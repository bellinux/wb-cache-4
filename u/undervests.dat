2500|$|In a séance on 6 January 1933 in Edinburgh, {{a little}} girl called Peggy emerged in the séance room. A sitter named Esson Maule grabbed her and the lights were turned on and the spirit was {{revealed}} to be made from a stockinette <b>undervest.</b> [...] The police were called and Duncan was prosecuted and fined £10. The <b>undervest</b> was used as evidence which led to Duncan's conviction of fraudulent mediumship at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court trial on 11 May 1933.|$|R
60|$|He rose--a tall, massively {{imposing}} {{figure in}} a low-girdled tunic of deep purple velvet, open at the breast, and gold-laced across a white silken <b>undervest.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{shout and}} expostulate with the conductor. Full of coarse life they are: but so coarse! The {{handsome}} fellow has his sleeved waistcoat open, and his shirt-breast has come unbuttoned. Not looking, {{it seems as}} if he wears a black <b>undervest.</b> Then suddenly, one sees it is his own hair. He is quite black inside his shirt, like a black goat.|$|R
60|$|The monarch {{slipped it}} {{into the pocket of}} his scarlet <b>undervest,</b> and was {{advancing}} once more when his eyes fell upon Madame de Montespan standing very stiff and erect in the middle of the passage. A dark flush of anger shot to his brow, and he walked swiftly past her without a word; but she turned and kept pace with him down the corridor.|$|R
60|$|Some of them, I believe, took {{it pretty}} much to heart. I know that Henry Mullins did. You could see it. The first day he {{came down to the}} lunch, all dressed up with the American Beauty and the white waistcoat. The second day he only wore a pink {{carnation}} and a grey waistcoat. The third day he had on a dead daffodil and a cardigan <b>undervest,</b> and on the last day, when the high school teachers should have been there, he only wore his office suit and he hadn't even shaved. He looked beaten.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there came}} {{rushing to the}} shock of war [...] Mr. McNicoll of the C. P. R. [...] He wore {{suspenders}} and about his throat [...] High rose the collar of a sealskin coat. [...] He had on gaiters and he wore a tie, [...] He had his trousers buttoned good and high; [...] About his waist a woollen <b>undervest</b> [...] Bought from a sad-eyed farmer of the West. [...] (And every time he clips a sheep he sees [...] Some bloated plutocrat who ought to freeze), [...] Thus in the Stock Exchange he burst to view, [...] Leaped to the post, and shouted, [...] "Ninety-two!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{clothing}} of {{the colossal}} statue {{consists of three}} pieces: an <b>undervest,</b> an upper garment and wide trousers. The upper garment of the sculpture fits tightly to the body {{and appears to be}} made of a sheer fabric. Through its skin-tight fit, the shoulders, the upper arms and the chest of the king have been emphasized. The sculpted ornaments on the upper garment are quite remarkable insofar as they resemble flames flickering downward. These are varyingly long, shaped in several different ways and irregularly arranged. At the waist, the upper garment is held together tightly by a belt while a second belt, which is hanging loosely around the hips, functions to fasten on the sword scabbard.|$|R
60|$|The {{business}} of unrobing had been simultaneous. Marmaduke {{appeared in a}} suit of plain, neat black; Monsieur Le Quoi in a coat of snuff- color, covering a vest of embroidery, with breeches, and silk stockings, and buckles—that were commonly thought to be of paste. Major Hartmann wore a coat of sky-blue, with large brass buttons, a club wig, and boots; and Mr. Richard Jones had set off his dapper little form in a frock of bottle-green, with bullet-buttons, by one of which the sides were united over his well-rounded waist, opening above, so as to show a jacket of red cloth, with an <b>undervest</b> of flannel, faced with green velvet, and below, so as to exhibit a pair of buckskin breeches, with long, soiled, white top-boots, and spurs; one of the latter a little bent, from its recent attacks on the stool.|$|R
60|$|So {{when the}} next morning had come, Sir Ewaine arose greatly refreshed, and by and by Elose came to him with food with which to break his fast. And after he had broken his fast she brought a bowl of ivory with tepid water, and she brought a razor with a heft of ivory studded with gold, and she hung a fine linen towel upon her {{shoulder}} and she shaved Sir Ewaine so that his face was both fresh and clean. After that she brought him fine raiment--an <b>undervest</b> of soft cambric linen and a surcoat and hose of azure silk embroidered with silver, and a cloak with a clasp of gold, and with pears of silver hanging from the corners thereof. And she brought a circlet of gold for his head, such as became {{the son of a}} king. Then she looked upon Sir Ewaine and he was very comely.|$|R
60|$|Corporal Mignan, {{wrinkling}} a thin, parchmenty face, full {{of suffering}} and kindly cynicism, used to call them 'mes deux phénomènes.' Riddled to the soul by gastritis, he must have found them trying roommates, with the tricks and manners of sick and naughty children towards a long-suffering nurse. To understand all is to forgive all, they say; but, though he had suffered enough to understand much, Mignan was tempted at times to deliver judgment--for example, when Roche, the Breton fisherman, rose from his bed more than ten times in the night, and wandered out into the little courtyard of the hospital, {{to look at the}} stars, because he could not keep still within four walls--so unreasonable of the 'type.' Or when Gray, the tall glass-blower--his grandfather had been English--refused with all the tenacity of a British workman to wear an <b>undervest,</b> with the thermometer below zero, Centigrade.|$|R
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and <b>undervest.</b> I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|R
5000|$|The man {{is shown}} in three-quarters view with his face {{dramatically}} lit by light falling from the left. This device provides both striking contrasts {{of light and shadow}} and draws the viewer's attention on to the man's face. He has brown eyes, and while his expression is impassive there are traces of melancholy, especially in the down-turn of his mouth. He is obviously a member of the nobility, being very well dressed in a fur lined brown jacket over a black <b>undervest.</b> His headdress, a chaperon, contains two wings which hang down over the man's shoulders and extend to his chest. The edges of the cloth are given a shredded look at the edges of their trains. The hood is brightly and dramatically coloured using pigment extracted from the expensive lapis lazuli gemstone to give it its bright, intense hue. The headdress is of a similar but less extravagant type to that seen in van Eyck's c. 1433 Portrait of a Man, and worn by a figure in the distance in his c. 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin. This type of headdress was to go out of fashion by the mid 1430s, conveniently and definitively dating the painting as having been completed before then.|$|R
6000|$|Hilary's tall thin figure {{appearing}} in the open doorway of the top-floor front, his kind and worried face, and the pale agate eyes of the little bulldog peeping through his legs, were witnessed by nothing but a baby, who {{was sitting in a}} wooden box in the centre of the room. This baby, who was very like a piece of putty to which Nature had by some accident fitted two movable black eyes, was clothed in a woman's knitted <b>undervest,</b> spreading beyond his feet and hands, so that nothing but his head was visible. This vest divided him from the wooden shavings on which he sat, and, since he had not yet attained the art of rising to his feet, the box divided him from contacts of all other kinds. As completely isolated from his kingdom as a Czar of all the Russias, he was doing nothing. In this realm there was a dingy bed, two chairs, and a washstand, with one lame leg, supported by an aged footstool. Clothes and garments were hanging on nails, pans lay about the hearth, a sewing-machine stood on a bare deal table. Over the bed was hung an oleograph, from a Christmas supplement, of the birth of Jesus, and above it a bayonet, under which was printed in an illiterate hand on a rough scroll of paper: [...] "Gave three of em what for at Elandslaagte. S. Hughs." [...] Some photographs adorned the walls, and two drooping ferns stood on the window-ledge. The room withal had a sort of desperate tidiness; in a large cupboard, slightly open, could be seen stowed all that must not see the light of day. The window of the baby's kingdom was tightly closed; the scent was the scent of walls and washing and red herrings, and--of other things.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the working {{conditions}} of coalminers exposed to high ambient temperature, the authors have studied the effects of wearing an under-vest and a cowl covering the head and shoulders made in sponge-cloth and soaked with cold water (cooling clothes). Eight coalminers volunteered for this study which included three sessions of prolonged intermittent exercise performed in a climatic room with the following ambient temperatures: [...] experiment A (comfortable environment) : td = 28 degrees C; twb = 20 degrees C; bare head and bare torso; [...] experiment B (hot environment) :td = 38 degrees C; twb = 30 degrees C; bare head and bare torso; [...] experiment C (hot environment and cooling clothes) : td = 38 degrees C; twb = 30 degrees C; wet <b>undervest</b> and cowl soaked with cold water (16 degrees C) every 15 minutes. Each experiment included 5 periods of exercise each lasting 15 minutes separated by periods of rest lasting 15 minutes; the exercises were performed on a bicycle ergometer or on a treadmill and their intensity corresponded to 50 % of the maximal oxygen intake. In the comfortable environment (experiment A), all subjects completed the experiment without undue fatigue; the final heart rate was 81 /min and the final rectal temperature was 37. 6 degrees C; the weight loss never exceeded 1 Kg. In the hot environment (experiment B), all subjects were exhausted {{at the end of}} the study which had to be shortened in 2 cases. The final heart rate was 125 /min and the final rectal temperature 38. 8 degrees C; the weight loss was above 2 Kg. The use of the "cooling clothes" in the hot environment (experiment C) resulted in significantly (p less than 0. 001) lower heart rate (104 /min), rectal temperature (38. 3 degrees C) and weight loss (1. 5 Kg); all subjects completed the experiment, none was exhausted and the "cooling clothes" were appreciated by all subjects. We conclude that the "cooling clothes" tested in the present study significantly reduce the physiological and subjective strain due to intermittent work in a hot environment; this cooling system is simple, of low cost and our results indicate that it is will be very useful in climatic conditions similar to those adopted in the present experimental protocol. Its usefulness in less severe climates has to be established but it might be limited by the subjective reactions of the subjects to the transient but sudden sensation of cold given by the "cooling clothes".
