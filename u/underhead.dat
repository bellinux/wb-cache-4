50|$|The {{standard}} Ford-issued {{block was}} machined differently to improve strength. In {{place of the}} single-cam arrangement, an endless duplex hydraulically tensioned timing chain was used to drive the overhead cams. The chain measured 2.2 m. The casting and bearings for the standard <b>underhead</b> cam were repurposed for a shaft which drove the oil pump. Ignition was controlled by a EDIS-6 system, which would become a standard feature.|$|E

The T series all used the same cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, valve trains and ignition system, combined into 2 (2T), 4 (4T), and 6 (6T) cylinder units of the same layout. The number of crankshaft bearings (3, 5 or 7) and throws (2, 4 or 6) naturally depended {{on the number of}} cylinders, as did the number of cams (4, 8 or 12) on the <b>underhead</b> camshaft. Each cylinder had a swept volume of 0.5 L, so the displacements were 1 L, 2 L and 3 L and the rated outputs , [...] and [...] respectively. The Train 6D was a variant of the 6T with increased bore of 85 mm.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} rail head wear (HW) and lateral forces on <b>underhead</b> radius stress conditions and resulting stress intensity factors (SIFs) of a long transverse crack. The occurrence of tension spikes at the <b>underhead</b> radius of the rail {{as a result of}} localised vertical and lateral bending of the head-on-web was significantly exacerbated with increasing rail HW. The extended finite element method (X-FEM) modelling, which had previously been validated by comparison with in-track measurements to verify the prediction of tension spikes, was used to model a single rail on discrete elastic foundations. SIFs along the crack front were parametrically evaluated in terms of changes in the contact patch offset (CPO), the (L/V) ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads, the rail HW, and crack size and shape. The X-FEM results revealed that for a long transverse crack, extending the crack length to the <b>underhead</b> radius position results in higher SIFs across the <b>underhead</b> radius as a result of tensile bending stresses. These higher SIFs can contribute to a massively higher crack growth rate at this location, as was evidenced by the crack growth morphology at the <b>underhead</b> radius...|$|E
40|$|The {{stress state}} at the rail <b>underhead</b> radius (UHR) has been parametrically {{analysed}} in this paper under high axle load conditions. A finite element method (FEM) was used to undertake the analyses with respect to head wear (HW) and the operational/track support conditions. The wheel load was simulated as a Hertizan contact pressure applied to an elliptical patch to the rail head, assuming fully slipping conditions. The results reveal that the longitudinal tensile stress at the rail <b>underhead</b> radius is highly dependent on the rail head wear (HW), the wheel contact load eccentricity, and the L/V ration of lateral (L) to verical (V) loads. The magnitude of tension spike increases, {{as a result of}} an increase in the contact patch offset, the L/V ratio, and HW. This stress is further enhanced by residual and thermally induced stresses. This may result in fatigue cracking and risk of material failure at the <b>underhead</b> radius (UHR) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of tensile stresses in the <b>underhead</b> {{region as a}} result of localised vertical and lateral head bending on the web is significant, and can potentially contribute to fatigue cracking. Field measurements under heavy haul conditions have shown that these stresses occur as a tension spike when the instrumented location is directly beneath the wheel. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the stress state of the rail <b>underhead</b> region with respect to changes of the rail profile due to wear. The study was undertaken using the finite element method (FEM) involving static stress analysis. The analysis revealed that the longitudinal stress at the rail gauge corner of the outer rail in curved track is highly dependent on several operational parameters including the offset of the contact patch location from the rail centreline, the ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads (L/V ratio), the direction of lateral traction, foundation stiffness and the head wear (HW). The magnitude of the tension spike at the surface of the rail in the <b>underhead</b> region is increased, but the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile is reduced when increasing the offset of contact patch location, the L/V ratio, the foundation stiffness and the HW. Both residual (RS) and thermally induced stresses increase the value of the stress in this region. The tensile stresses could potentially cause fatigue crack initiation at the rail <b>underhead</b> region and, in particular, could cause rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks on the gauge corner of the rail to turn downwards into transverse defects (TDs) ...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{head wear}} {{combined}} with a transverse defect is considered as an increased risk for rail safety and integrity, and reverse detail fracture (i. e. transverse defects which initiate at the lower corner of the gauge face of heavily worn rail) could be produced. This defect type as observed in poorly lubricated, heavily worn curved rails on stiff track subjected to high axle loads is shown in Fig 1 [1, 2]. Such failures which initiate at the <b>underhead</b> radius at aluminothermic welds are found in heavy axle load railway operation in Australia. Although, the weld normally has the lower material strength, the elevated residual stress levels and the complex geometry leading to stress concentration, the reverse detail fracture occasionally seen in aluminothermic welds but generally occur in the rail <b>underhead...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the potential risk of fatigue damage at the rail <b>underhead</b> radius (UHR) due to the occurrence of a short duration tensile stress peak, as a wheel passes over, has been examined. The tensile stress peak is mainly due to the localised bending of the rail head-on-web and its magnitude {{is associated with the}} contact position, lateral and vertical forces and rail head wear (HW). The stresses at the <b>underhead</b> radius have been explored using the finite element method (FEM). The Dang Van (DV) criterion, implemented as a customised computer programme, was used to identify the fatigue damage at the UHR. Fatigue behaviour under heavy haul conditions was compared for heat-treated low alloy, euctectoid and hypereutectoid rail grades in order to predict allowable rail head wear limits...|$|E
40|$|The {{exhaust valve}} in {{question}} had failed by fatigue. No metallurgical or mechanical abnormalities {{were responsible for}} the fatigue crack initiation. From the observations, it appears most probable that the misalignment of the valve had led to bending and generation of circumferential cracks at the <b>underhead</b> stem region. One of these cracks might have propagated by fatigue under the fluctuating load leading to failure of the valve...|$|E
40|$|Among {{different}} {{rail welding}} methods Aluminothermic welding (ATW) {{is the oldest}} and simplest procedure widely used for re-railing and replacement of defective rails. Since ATW is a cast welding process in which several aspects are operator-dependent it suffers from the variability of the produced weld quality, presence of casting defects and inconsistencies in the microstructure and mechanical properties. Previous observations have shown that field-welded ATWs have been major sources of fatigue and overload failures in Australian heavy haul railway systems. The most common failure modes are categorized into straight breaks (transverse fissure) and horizontal split webs (HSW). Straight breaks initiate from stress concentration sites {{at the edge of}} the weld collar, in the foot, lower web and <b>underhead</b> regions, and propagate in vertical direction under Mode I loading. HSW failures involve the development of a horizontal fatigue crack which initiates from a surface or near-surface gross defect in the weld collar, generally in the mid- or upper-web region. In this study analysis of fatigue crack initiation is performed {{at the edge of the}} weld collar of an aluminothermic weld, in order to examine the formation of straight break under high axle load conditions. The fatigue assessment is accomplished using a thermo-structural finite element simulation in ANSYS package followed by a shear based multi-axial fatigue critical plane criterion implemented in a MATLAB computer code. The influence of several parameters including wheel-rail contact patch eccentricity, contact tractions, residual stress distribution, seasonal temperature variation and track support condition is investigated. The analysis identifies the <b>underhead</b> region of a defect-free weld as the most critical location which is subject to severe fatigue damage under harsh curving and hunting behaviours...|$|E
40|$|A rail {{can fail}} by either wear (loss of profile) or by rolling contact fatigue (RCF) (surface cracks growing by fatigue which may cause a rail break) and {{requires}} replacing. The aim of my doctorate {{research has been}} to investigate the parameters that affect multi-axial fatigue and fracture behaviour of the rail <b>underhead</b> radius influenced by wear in heavy haul operation. The numerical analyses were performed using the newly developed “User supplied subroutines” (UVAR-M) programmed in FORTRAN-Code and also Extended finite element method (X-FEM) modelling in commercial code ABAQUS 6. 11 - 2. My research {{has been based on}} field measurements conducted for rails in heavy haul iron ore operations in Pilbara region of Western Australia. The results of this thesis can be used to examine the influence of wheel-rail interaction behaviour and rail wear on the possibility of a catastrophic rail failure developing from RCF damage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tests in which high strength fasteners, socket head set screws (SHCS), were tightened to yield as a means of generating maximum clamping force. The tightening tests were performed {{with the aid of a}} microprocessor controlled torque wrench and a torque-tension testing rig. Load cells fitted to the test rig provided an accurate measurement of the joint clamp load and the faster thread and <b>underhead</b> torque distribution under a range of lubrication conditions. Measurements were made during tightening to yield, under static load condition after yield tightening, and during loosening. The results obtained established that the lubrication conditions dramatically affect the magnitude of the maximum clamp load achieved on the joint and the torque distribution on the fastener. The results also enabled an estimate to be made of the coefficient of friction on the various mating surfaces during the tightening and loosening of the fastener. It was shown that the design of bolted joints must take account of the influence of friction if thejoints are to operate effectively in service. ...|$|E
40|$|Aluminothermic rail welds {{typically}} {{exhibit a}} variable and often inferior performance {{when compared with}} flash butt welds. Fatigue failure {{as a result of}} surface defects or harsh geometric features in the presence of high axle loads and tractive forces gives rise to the so-called straight break and horizontal split web fractures. In this study, the reduction of fatigue performance due to geometric irregularities is investigated using a multi-axial high cycle fatigue criterion based on the critical plane concept. A thermo-structural finite element model of a track containing an aluminothermic weld is linked with a developed computer code to perform fatigue crack initiation analysis. Two geometrically different aluminothermic welds, one of which is widely used in Australian heavy haul railways, are investigated in terms of fatigue probability, to facilitate a better insight into the effect of weld collar shape and geometry {{at the edge of the}} weld collar on fatigue behaviour. The results confirm that the amount of fatigue damage is critically dependent on the geometric features of the collar edge, especially at the <b>underhead</b> radius which undergoes severe fatigue loading under some operational conditions...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{localized}} stresses generated at {{the gauge}} {{corner of the}} outer rail cause fatigue cracking. The longitudinal bending stresses in the rail <b>underhead</b> radius position are of special interest, as tension spikes have been identified at this location during in-track measurements under high axle load conditions. The tension spike {{is a result of}} vertical and lateral head bending on the web. This effect is highly localized and is additional to the stresses generated due to vertical and lateral bending of the whole rail profile (the so-called global bending). This study examined contact and bending stresses by modelling the rail on a discrete foundation using finite elements and by considering the loading to be a fully slipping elliptical Hertzian contact patch. The analysis revealed that the tensile longitudinal stress was highly dependent on several service conditions: the contact patch offset from the rail centreline, the ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads, the direction of lateral traction, foundation stiffness and seasonal temperature variations. The tension spike increases, and the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile reduces, as the contact patch offset and/or the L/V ratio increases. Both these enhance the tendency for rolling contact fatigue cracks to turn downwards and become transverse defects. This is because an increase in tensile bending stresses together with both residual and thermally induced stresses can facilitate cracks to turn perpendicular to the tensile stresses once they reach a critical length. Shear traction towards the gauge corner was found to be the most damaging phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Thermite welding {{is widely}} used in heavy haul railway systems for {{in-track}} welding due to the low capital cost of equipment and the flexibility it provides. However thermite welds typically exhibit variable and often inferior performance compared to flashbutt welds. Fatigue failure {{as a result of}} surface defects or harsh geometrical features in the presence of high axle loads and tractive forces gives rise to the so-called straight break and horizontal split web fractures. In this study, the reduction of fatigue performance due to the geometrical inhomogeneity and the presence of defects is investigated using a multi-axial high cycle fatigue criterion based on the concept of critical plane. A thermo-structural finite element model of a track containing a thermite weld is linked with a customized computer code to perform fatigue crack initiation analysis; the effect of inclusions and defects is implicitly invoked through their effect on material fatigue parameters. Two geometrically different thermite welds which are widely used in Australian heavy haul railways are investigated in terms of fatigue probability, to facilitate a better insight into the effect of weld collar shape and toe geometrical parameters on fatigue behaviour. The effect of track support conditions on fatigue damage is also included in the analysis, which enables the effect of ballast deterioration, a common problem at the vicinity of thermite welds, to be quantified. The results show that the amount of fatigue damage critically depends on the geometrical features of the collar edge, especially at the <b>underhead</b> fillet which undergoes severe fatigue at some operational conditions. The condition of track support also shows to be highly influential in the probability of fatigue crack nucleation at regions of the weld foot...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} of catastrophic rail failure {{as a result}} of the propagation of surface-initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks to form transverse defects (TDs) is of ongoing concern to the rail industry, especially since the Hatfield incident in the UK in 2000. The heavy haul sector is not immune to such concerns, as the combination of improved rail steels and optimisation of the wheel-rail interface has reduced the extent to which rail wear influences rail life. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the growth behaviour of gauge corner cracking (GCC), and in particular, the tendency for rails to break with a rapid fracture, under the high axle load conditions typical of those that exist in Australian heavy haul operations. Previous work has shown that the occurrence of tension spikes {{as a result of}} localised vertical and lateral head bending on the web were significant in the understanding of this behaviour, which is exacerbated with increasing rail head wear (HW), such that the occurrence of the rapid fracture associated with this behaviour correlates with the extent of rail HW. This behaviour was examined using finite element (FE) modelling, which had previously been validated by comparison with in-track measurements to verify the prediction of the tension spikes. The FE model used a single rail on a discrete elastic foundation to parametrically study the growth behaviour of RCF damage subjected to changes in the rail HW; the contact patch offset (CPO) from the rail centreline, the (UV) ratio of lateral (L) to vertical (V) loads, foundation stiffness and the thermal stresses. The FE results reveal that existing GCC, when subjected to high tensile stresses at the <b>underhead</b> radius (UHR) and the gauge corner region, can contribute to the development of rapid (unstable) fracture. The results of this work can be used to examine the influence of wheel-rail interaction behaviour and rail HW on the {{probability of}} catastrophic rail failure from RCF damage...|$|E
