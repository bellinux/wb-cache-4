The present paper firstly reviews the relevant European Union (EU) regulatory framework: specific attention is paid to the concept <b>of</b> <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> power distribution sector in Europe. Afterwards, {{the focus is on the}} current state of penetration of DG technologies in the EU Member States and the corresponding interrelations with distribution features. A comparison between the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> the distribution and supply markets using econometric indicators such as the Herfindahl-Hirschmann (IHH) and the Shannon-Wiener (ISW) indices is then presented. Finally, a comparative analysis between these indices and the current level of penetration of distributed generation in most EU is shown; policy recommendations conclude the paper...|$|R

50|$|At the time, the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} {{was perhaps the}} most contentious point, involving antitrust issues that had recently been widely debated in the press and the courts. However, IBM's <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> software had long-term impact. After the unbundling, IBM software was divided into two main categories: System Control Programming (SCP), which remained free to customers, and Program Products (PP), which were charged for. This transformed the customer's value proposition for computer solutions, giving a significant monetary value to something that had hitherto essentially been free. This helped enable the creation of a software industry.|$|R

40|$|Does {{unbundling}} ensure efficient railway transportation? The {{separation of}} railway operators and infrastructure {{is supposed to}} ensure efficient railway transportation. However, the experience with the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> the railway operation in the Czech Republic suggests that unbundling does not work. In this paper, we investigate {{the hypothesis that the}} Czech railways represent an example of a network industry which is more efficient when it is concentrated. Therefore, the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> railways in the Czech Republic favors particular political interests instead of efficient operation. Our hypothesis is supported by the growth of per unit costs that indicates the inefficient operation <b>of</b> <b>unbundled</b> Czech railways. We also looked at the volume of subsidies and the productivity of labor which indicate the particular interests of politicians and the management of the Czech railways. KEY WORD...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which a firm conducts non-linear pricing though bundling. However some agents, ‘unbundlers’, find it profitable to unbundle output. Unbundlers have an increasing marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>unbundling,</b> which limits the extent <b>of</b> <b>unbundling.</b> Customers with identical demand can purchase either bundled or unbundled output. In equilibrium, some consumers purchase bundled output and others unbundled output. The analysis shows how the extent <b>of</b> <b>unbundling</b> and the optimal bundle size {{are related to the}} cost <b>of</b> <b>unbundling.</b> Failing to <b>account</b> for presence <b>of</b> <b>unbundling</b> could lead to a misinterpretation of market efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{has been}} {{promoting}} <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> the transmission grid from other {{stages of the}} electricity supply chain {{with the aim of}} fostering competition in the upstream stage of electricity generation. At presence, ownership unbundling is the predominant form <b>of</b> <b>unbundling</b> in Europe. However, the benefits of increased competition from ownership <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> the transmission grid may come at the cost of lost vertical synergies between the formerly integrated stages of electricity supply. The policy debate generally neglects such potential costs <b>of</b> <b>unbundling,</b> yet concentrates on its benefits. Therefore European cross-country evidence may shed some light on this issue. This study helps fill this void by empirically estimating the magnitude of economies of vertical integration (EVI) between electricity generation and transmission based on a quadratic cost function. For this purpose we employ novel firm-level panel data of major European electricity utilities. Our results confirm the presence of substantial EVI, which put the policy measure <b>of</b> transmission ownership <b>unbundling</b> into question.

40|$|Many {{colleges and}} {{universities}} are expanding their current online offerings and creating new programs to address growing enrollment. Institutions often utilize online education as a method to serve more students while lowering instructional costs. While online education may be more cost effective in some situations, college decision makers need to consider the full range of cost implications associated with these online offerings. The <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> faculty roles in online distance education programs is one cost consideration that is often overlooked. As the faculty role has become more distributed, so have the costs associated with providing instruction and instructional support. This paper reviews the hidden costs associated with the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> the faculty role and presents a framework for calculating the true costs <b>of</b> the <b>unbundled</b> faculty role...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) capabilities by incrementally sourcing and combining “best of breed ” services from different providers {{is a key}} lever for reducing implementation risks and costs linked to CRM projects. Central to a “best of breed ” and incremental CRM implementation strategy is the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> CRM functionality into a portfolio of services that can be sourced from application service providers and/or developed internally within the client organization. This paper addresses issues and methodological steps relating to unbundling CRM applications into self contained e-Services and developing the service blueprint to deliver the e-Service. In particular a study is conducted illustrating the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> customer segmentation functionality towards modeling, packaging and delivering the business process functionality as an on-demand e-Service. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{initial phase}} of {{reforms in the}} Indian power sector was {{primarily}} aimed at bringing regulatory reforms and <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> the vertically integrated State Electricity Boards (SEBs). Enactment of the Electricity Act 2003 led to deepening of the reform process by dismantling this monopoly in the power sector. Primary issues emerging on <b>account</b> <b>of</b> transition from a single-buyer model to a multi-buyer multi-seller model include, among others, policy and regulatory initiatives related to open access, power exchanges, and transmission allocation and its pricing. The paper {{provides an overview of}} the status of competition in various segments of the power sector. It also reviews the phased program for open access outlined by various State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, including their status and impact on competition. The paper highlights a number of residual issues for the wholesale and retail competition, and also discusses the approach to address the same. These include liberalization of fuel markets, market monitoring, <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> retail tariffs, universal service obligation, supplier of last resort and demand response.

40|$|We build {{a dynamic}} trade model {{to study how}} {{international}} <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> production {{and the emergence of}} global supply chains affect the world income distribution. We consider a world where countries only differ in their productivity. The level of productivity determines the number of varieties a country produces. To manufacture each variety a bundle of intermediates, which require capital and labor in different proportions, needs to be assembled. We characterize two trade regimes: (i) trade only in varieties and (ii) trade in both varieties and intermediates (unbundling). We show that <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> production generates income divergence among ex-ante identical countries (symmetry breaking). With heterogeneous countries, it increases top-bottom inequality and it has non-monotonic effects on the world income distribution (it reduces relatively more the income share of middle-productivity countries). We also show that when the South joins the global supply chain, the income share of all northern and the most productive southern countries increase, {{at the expense of the}} least productive countries. In addition, we find that the effect of a labor-saving technology, computerization, depends on the trade regime. Without unbundling, computerization has no effect on the world income distribution. With unbundling, computerization raises world inequality. Finally, we show that technology diffusion leads to income convergence under both trade regimes. However, with <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> production more low-productivity countries benefit from technological catch-up...|$|R

40|$|The <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> {{the faculty}} role occurs when {{e-learning}} course tasks normally {{performed by a}} single faculty member [...] such as course design, development, delivery, grading, interaction with students, course improvement, and advisement [...] are segmented or unbundled {{so that they can}} be performed by other personnel or with technologies. Using a qualitative methods approach, this study examines the <b>unbundling</b> and restructuring <b>of</b> the faculty professional role in large enrollment e-learning courses. This study was conducted at three community colleges in a large, urban community college district, and presents three models of e-learning course production that affect the <b>unbundling</b> <b>of</b> the faculty role: craft, collegial, and virtual assembly line. This research also examines how e-learning faculty members seek to rebundle tasks associated with their professional role and identity, and the tasks they perceive as meeting student needs and demand. This study contributes to professional and economic theories concerning faculty members in the e-learning context, and advances theories associated with academic labor, managed professionals, Academic Capitalism, and the globalization of the community college...|$|R
