5|$|Hot springs {{have been}} used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China's Lisan {{mountain}} built in the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used the hot springs there to feed public baths and <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating.</b> The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power. The world's oldest geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. <b>Underfloor</b> <b>heating</b> was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. <b>Underfloor</b> <b>heating</b> in the cages and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E
50|$|The {{rooms on}} display today are mostly {{located at the}} west end of the north wing, {{including}} a summer and winter (<b>underfloor</b> <b>heated)</b> dining room. The bathhouse is to the south-east. The rooms contain some of the best Roman mosaics to be found in Great Britain, both in terms of preservation, artistic merit and detailing. The Greek-key-patterned northern corridor extends for some 79 ft (24m) making it the longest in Britain.|$|R

25|$|During Roman {{occupation}} {{the countryside}} close to Verulamium was subdivided {{into a series}} of farming estates. The Berkhamsted area appears to have been divided into two or three farming estates, each including one or more masonry villa buildings, with tiled roofs and <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{variation}} is using tubes filled with circulating hot water as heat source for warming the floor. The heating principle remains the same. Both old style electric and warm water (hydronic) <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating</b> systems {{embedded in the}} floor construction are slow and cannot respond to external weather changes or internal demand/lifestyle requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was equipped with}} <b>underfloor</b> gas <b>heating,</b> a central boiler room set under the chancel, two heaters with hot air ducts, and approximately 200 gas lamps. Its organ was built by a well-known company of Wilhelm Sauer from Frankfurt (Oder). Lutheran rite liturgy was performed until 1945.|$|R
50|$|The Hyson Green Flats {{were built}} in 1965 and {{demolished}} in 1988. They were a well-known landmark in their day and many people really enjoyed living there- due to {{a great deal of}} community spirit. There were 593 individual flats and maisonettes. They had a kitchen, separate bathroom and toilet and communal <b>underfloor</b> central <b>heating.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} medieval Alpine upland, a simpler {{central heating system}} where <b>heat</b> {{travelled}} through <b>underfloor</b> channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman hypocaust at some places. In Reichenau Abbey a network of interconnected <b>underfloor</b> channels <b>heated</b> the 300 m2 large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.|$|R
25|$|When {{residents}} {{moved into}} their new homes, most were {{pleased with the}} improvement. However, the demolition of the slums and breaking up of entire communities had made people feel unsettled in their new homes. The modern features meant that residents had to adapt, for example, residents were now paying for <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating</b> when {{they were used to}} cheaper coal fires. Many residents resented being moved and were unhappy within their new homes.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Lindsey Archaeological Services were {{commissioned}} by Welby Parochial Church Council {{to provide a}} watching brief on an archaeological investigation before <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating</b> was installed. Pews and pew platforms were removed, and investigation trenches dug under flagstone floors in the north aisle, and {{the north and south}} sides of the nave. Finds included remains of a previous lime mortar floor, stained glass and window lead fragments, pottery of the 15th to 19th centuries, some graves, and shroud pins.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating</b> {{system has}} heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non absorbed heat to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, the Irish Government {{commissioned}} two {{postage stamps}} {{to commemorate the}} cathedral's 800 year anniversary. A picture {{of one of the}} stamps is displayed above. In 1991, there was a large £2.5 million restoration programme which was completed in 1996 with the excavation and re-laying of the floors as well as the installation of <b>underfloor</b> central <b>heating.</b> [...] Restoration continues today to a lesser degree.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} combisystems - the Type A - have no [...] "controlled storage device". Instead they pump warm (or cool) {{water from}} the solar collectors through <b>underfloor</b> central <b>heating</b> pipes embedded in the concrete floor slab. The floor slab is thickened to provide thermal mass and so that the heat and cool from the pipes (at {{the bottom of the}} slab) is released during the evening.|$|R
50|$|Radiant heating heats a {{building}} through radiant heat, rather than conventional {{methods such as}} radiators (mostly convection heating). The technology has existed since the Roman use of hypocaust <b>heating.</b> <b>Underfloor</b> radiant <b>heating</b> has long been widespread in China and Korea. Another example is the Austrian/German Kachelofen or masonry heater. The heat energy is emitted from a warm element, such as a floor, wall or overhead panel, and warms people and other objects in rooms rather than directly heating the air. The internal air temperature for radiant heated buildings may be lower than for a conventionally heated building {{to achieve the same}} level of body comfort, when adjusted so the perceived temperature is actually the same. One of the key advantages of radiant heating systems is a much decreased circulation of air inside the room and the corresponding spreading of airborne particles.|$|R
500|$|To {{the west}} of the mansio lay the public bath-house, {{separated}} from it by a cobbled road between [...] wide. From the street, a paved area led into a colonnade fronting the building on the east and continuing round the north side. Large doors in the centre of the eastern colonnade opened into a large, covered courtyard. This courtyard may have been a basilica; a settlement of this size would be expected to have one, and this is the only candidate on the site. At the far north end of the bath complex was the stoke-room or praefurnium, which contained the wood-fired furnaces of the hypocaust system. This <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating</b> system was present in the tepidarium, the caldarium and the laconicum where the floors were supported on pillars of tiles or pilae. The hot combustion gases from the stoke-room furnaces circulated under the floor between these pillars and were drawn up around the sides of the building through box tiles embedded in the walls, to escape finally through vents in the barrel-vaulted roof.|$|E

50|$|Around 150 {{the small}} house was {{demolished}} {{for a larger}} building. The new house was a larger row-house consisting of an important middle room with smaller rooms {{to the north and}} south of it. The house was aligned with the older work-hall, but kept apart from it. This {{was the beginning of the}} west wing. Later in the century a small bath suite was added to this west house. The most unusual feature of this west bath suite is that the pilae in the <b>underfloor</b> hypocaust <b>heating</b> system were built from curved roof tiles (imbrices) rather than from stacks of bricks.|$|R
50|$|Technically, {{the modern}} day ondol {{is based on}} the same concept as the <b>underfloor</b> radiant <b>heating</b> invented by the American {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright, who was interested in Japanese architecture. Wright came with the idea while visiting a Japanese nobleman's house, where he found a tea room that was {{different from the rest of}} the house, using a Korean ondol as a heating system. He then took the same idea to create a heating system that fits American houses. Wright invented modern radiant floor heating, using hot water running through pipes instead of hot air through flues.|$|R
2500|$|A hypocaust was {{an ancient}} Roman system of <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating,</b> used to heat houses with hot air.

40|$|Modern {{buildings}} {{have the capability}} to capture vast quantities of information about the building itself, its purpose, the people that use it and its wider environment. With the development of fields such as the Internet of Things and Big Data, the future of buildings will involve more data around all aspects of their operation and the people using them. Within the context of these changes, this research hypothesises that the availability of increasing information within buildings can enable new ways of operation to step change their performance. Initially the thesis combines an extensive literature review of modern building developments and the current landscape that buildings operate within to develop clarity around the term “Smart Building”. Two case studies are then presented to demonstrate the potential of Smart Building concepts: The first case study involves a pilot study within an existing university library building using occupancy, energy, occupant satisfaction and building functionality data to investigate the potential of the buildings ability to vary physical space with occupancy. The second study uses computational fluid dynamics to model the thermal comfort variations throughout a large <b>underfloor</b> <b>heated</b> naturally ventilated atrium. The results are then used to investigate potential energy savings and comfort improvements through correlating individual comfort preferences with environmental variations. The work forms a clear definition of a Smart Building to create a framework for researchers and designers to focus future Smart Building developments. The first case study then demonstrates that by varying physically occupied space with occupancy, energy consumption of the building can be reduced by approximately 33...|$|R

It has an apodyterium (changing room), a frigidarium (cold bath), two tepidaria (lukewarm baths', a caldarium (hot bath) and a sudatorium (sauna). The complex was heated from the praefurnia (firing places); and all rooms except the apodyterium and frigidarium were served by a hypocaust system (<b>underfloor</b> and wall <b>heating).</b>|$|R
2500|$|The COP {{increases}} {{as the temperature}} difference, or [...] "lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The COP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g. <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating),</b> and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g. the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures, reducing the COP that can be attained, and affecting the choice of heat pump technology.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, {{thermal energy}} is {{transferred}} to water, which is then used to heat the building via radiators or <b>underfloor</b> <b>heating.</b> The heated water may {{also be used for}} domestic hot water consumption. [...] The refrigerant is then allowed to expand, cool, and absorb heat from the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator, and the cycle repeats.

5000|$|Crofton Roman Villa in Orpington, in the London Borough of Bromley, is a Roman villa {{which was}} {{inhabited}} between approximately 140 and 400 AD. It was {{the centre of}} a farming estate of about 500 acre, with farm buildings nearby, surrounded by fields, meadows and woods. The house was altered several times during its 260 years of occupation, and at its largest it probably had at least 20 rooms. The remains of ten rooms can be seen today. Two rooms contain the remains of [...] "opus signinum" [...] floors, and three have evidence of tiled, or [...] "tessellated", floors. Details of an <b>underfloor</b> central <b>heating</b> hypocaust can also be seen, featuring both channelled and pillared systems, as can small finds from the site.|$|R
50|$|<b>Underfloor</b> {{and wall}} <b>heating</b> systems often are called {{low-temperature}} systems. Since their heating surface {{is much larger}} than other systems, a much lower temperature is required {{to achieve the same}} level of heat transfer. This provides an improved room climate with healthier humidity levels. The maximum temperature of the heating surface can vary from 29 - 35 C depending on the room type. Radiant overhead panels are mostly used in production and warehousing facilities or sports centers; they hang a few meters above the floor and their surface temperatures are much higher.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to compare solid wood flooring to engineered wood flooring due to {{the wide range of}} quality in both product categories, particularly engineered. Solid wood has some limitations. Recommended maximum widths and lengths are typically 5" [...] / 127mm wide and 7' / 2100mm long. Solid hardwood is also more prone to [...] "gapping" [...] (excessive space between planks), [...] "crowning" [...] (convex curving upwards when humidity increases) and [...] "cupping" [...] (a [...] or [...] "dished" [...] appearance of the plank, with the height of the plank along its longer edges being higher than the centre) with increased plank size. Solid wood CANNOT be used with <b>underfloor</b> radiant <b>heating.</b> However extra care is necessary with the planning and installation of the heating system and the wood flooring, such as limiting the temperature to 85 F, avoid sharp temperature fluctuations, utilizing an outdoor thermostat to anticipate heating demands, and monitoring the moisture content for the subfloor before installation.|$|R
