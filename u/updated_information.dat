5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 {{people living in the}} two Russian settlements. The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made it difficult for the Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were further complicated by erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with <b>updated</b> <b>information</b> in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} provides {{real time}} dynamic resource management to improve end-to-end QoS by mobile devices regularly updating a resource availability server (RAS) with resource <b>update</b> <b>information.</b> Examples of resource <b>update</b> <b>information</b> are device battery status, available memory, session bandwidth, delay, packet loss, and jitter, network element storage capacity, network element processing power. This information is made {{available by the}} RAS. In addition, the RAS generates and maintains predictive models and makes available predictive data from these models. Network elements and devices retrieve this information {{in the form of}} notifications from the RAS or by way of querying the RAS. The network elements and devices, based on these predictions, act to negotiate sessions to optimise QoS. In one embodiment the RAS is updated by only mobile devices subscribed to the operator which hosts the RAS. The <b>update</b> <b>information</b> is addressed to the RAS as a stand- alone entity. However, it is envisaged that the server may be hosted by multiple operators and may receive updates from devices subscribed to different operators. Also, it is envisaged that not only mobile devices but also network elements such as MMSCs may send <b>update</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

25|$|The On-line {{strategy}} makes {{adjustment to}} patient and beam position during the treatment process, based on continuously <b>updated</b> <b>information</b> throughout the procedure. The on-line approach requires a high-level of integration of both software and hardware. The {{advantage of this}} strategy is a reduction in both systematic and random errors. An example {{is the use of}} a marker-based program in the treatment of prostate cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Gold markers are implanted into the prostate to provide a surrogate position of the gland. Prior to each day's treatment, portal imaging system results are returned. If the center of the mass has moved greater than 3mm, then the couch is readjusted and a subsequent reference image is created. Other clinics correct for any positional errors, never allowing for >1mm error in any measured axes.|$|E
25|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 20 October 1917, 16 of the crew-members were taken to Laragne where they were interrogated by local gendarmes. Commander Waldemar Kölle was interrogated by the German department of the French intelligence service on 1 November 1917. The report of the commanders interrogation was later smuggled to Nordholz, where Peter Strasser received it on 25 April 1918. In the report {{it was revealed that}} the British Naval Intelligence Division had gotten hold of detailed and <b>updated</b> <b>information</b> on the German naval airships and all their commanders, including on Bockholt's top secret Africa mission. The discovery resulted in 3 people from Tønder and 2 from Nordholz coming under suspicion of spying and later being found guilty and executed by a firing squad. The circumstances are not clear as most archive material has been lost.|$|E
25|$|Windows 8, the {{successor}} to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including {{the introduction of a}} user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually <b>updated</b> <b>information,</b> and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture. An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 has been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the threat}} for flooding, local flood {{warnings}} were issued for much of Arizona. Starting at 0100UTC on September30 and lasting until 0600UTC on October6, the Tucson National Weather Service office issued 20warnings and statements including 13 radar-generated updates. In the same time period, the Phoenix National Weather Service office issued 28warnings, watches, and statements, nine of which were flood warnings generated by the Joint Federal-State Flood Warning Office. Although several flood warnings from the Phoenix National Weather Service Office were requested to be broadcast via the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS), which is a national program that provides public warning for such disasters, no warnings were implemented. The reason was that time there was no formal EBS program active in the Tucson area, {{and there was only}} one program request to fill this gap, but that request was denied. The Pima County Emergency Services Director stated that [...] "we just didn't see the need for activating the EBS system."
