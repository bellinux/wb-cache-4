50|$|Another {{feature of}} PFZ service is the {{generation}} of species-specific advisory to enable the fishermen folk {{to distinguish between the}} exploited and <b>under-exploited</b> <b>species</b> in the potential fishing zones. This enables them to have sustainable fishery management by targeting only the <b>under-exploited</b> <b>species</b> in the fishing zones. This approach enables them to avoid fishing the over-exploited species over and over again. One such species-specific advisory is Tuna Fisheries Forecasting System that enables the fishing community to adequately prepare for the Tuna catch. Being a highly migratory fish, it inhabits a wide range of ecosystems and wide area. Hence the fishing of tuna is a costly affair and it requires resource-specific orientation such as long lining by the fishing boats and trawlers. With the help of the parameters such as Oceanic Fronts, water clarity and sea surface temperature we can trace the distribution of tuna species.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Annona muricata L. is a {{fruit tree}} species of {{tropical}} origin whose fruit, the soursop, although having great potential, is not commercially exploited enough. So {{there is little}} information on this species and, in particular, on its germplasm characterization. Consequently, the purpose of our study was to estimate the genetic variability between nine soursop accessions using the RAPD marker technique. Materials and methods. By means of RAPD analysis, using the Jaccard's coefficient, a similarity matrix was generated between nine accessions, seven of them collected in Venezuela and two in Brazil. With these, a phenogram was obtained using UPGMA clustering analysis. The ordering of the accessions was also achieved {{by means of a}} principal component analysis. Results. Seventeen RAPD fragments were obtained, of which 14 were polymorphic. Average similarity was 0. 5333, and ranged from 0. 2627 to 1. 000. The phenogram identified two groups, equal to principal coordinates analysis. The Venezuelan accessions showed more variability when compared with the Brazilian ones (Jaccard's coefficient of 0. 5038 and 0. 5442, respectively). Discussion. Compared with other studies on various fruit trees, that carried out here on A. muricata underlined a great genetic variability. The situation is thus favorable to undertake in Venezuela a breeding program in this still <b>under-exploited</b> fruit <b>species...</b>|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} species are being transported beyond their natural range {{boundaries}} by humans. These non-native species can have severe negative impacts on native biodiversity. In order to guide management {{of these species}} {{it is important to}} be able predict where non-native species will spread to, and what impact they will have. This thesis aims to improve our understanding in both these areas, using the expansion of non-native birds in the Iberian Peninsula as a study system. The number of non-native passerines in the Iberian Peninsula has increased in the late 20 th century, with the common waxbill Estrilda astrild, yellow-crowned bishop Euplectes afer, red avadavat Amandava amandava and black-headed weaver Ploceus melanocephalus all established as breeding species since 1960. Methods to (1) account for dispersal limitation when modelling the distribution of spreading non-native species and (2) evaluate the likely transferability of native trained species distribution models were developed. The consistency of the species-environment relationship during expansion in the non-native range was also examined. The ability of vacant niches to facilitate the spread of non-native species was tested, and a framework for detecting the early impacts of non-native species was developed. Species distribution models of the potential distribution of non-native species are improved by incorporating dispersal. Dispersal is an important constraint on the distribution of non-native species, and interacts with environmental suitability to alter the species-environment relationship between the range-margin and the range core, and over time. Despite accounting for dispersal limitation in their evaluation, the performance of native-trained species distribution models was poor when most environmental conditions that were analogous to the species native range were within the species niche. Non-native birds in the Iberian Peninsula utilised similar resources to native seed-eating birds, but small differences in resource utilisation allowed them to exploit rice fields, where resources were <b>under-exploited</b> by native <b>species.</b> Non-native birds could also interact with native reedbed nesting passerines, and indeed aggression between black-headed weavers and native Acrocephalus warblers has been recorded. However, we did not find evidence for competition between these species at current population densities of black-headed weavers. Further work on non-native species needs to extend the hybrid dispersal-species distribution models developed here, and also to conduct more assessments of the impacts of non-native species in the early stages of their invasion...|$|R
40|$|Prices of cloves, cardamom, ginger, {{vanilla and}} black pepper have fallen by up to 75 % because of over-production. As a result, the current {{unfavourable}} prices for these well-known spices are a disappointment for all producers and a near disaster for some. Perhaps the time has now come to investigate the potential of many other species that are used as spices: to broaden the varietal base of spices in the market in order to stimulate changes in taste, flavour, aroma and, hopefully, demand. Some of these new introductions to the market can be used singly, whilst others {{may be used in}} combination with more familiar spices to bring about changes in tastes and demand. New spice resources In a recent survey carried out at the National Horticultural Institute, Ibadan, Nigeria it was found that out of 34 spices in the country 26 belong to commonly and locally produced types, while the handful of others are exotic imports. The locally-produced spices can be classified further into two broad groups based on their mode of production, namely (a) regularly cultivated species such as onions, garlic and peppers and (b) species grown in the wild such as African nutmeg (Monodora myristica) and Alligator pepper (Aframomum melegueta), a selection of which are listed (see table). The species grown in the wild include various plants which are potentially important and which may be capable of meeting a wide range of tastes and gaining acceptability on the world market. Locally, these spices vary considerably in their importance and popularity. Among the most important are African nutmeg or Ariwo, Eru (Xylopia aethiopicum) and Aidon (Tetrapleura tetraptera). These three species are noted for their versatility in the preparation of many local dishes and medicines. Spices from the rain forest The high rain forest region of tropical West Africa contains a wide diversity of spices which are locally important but are less well-known outside the region. Most are found growing in the wild in combination with other forest species including teak (Tectona spp) or baobab (Adansonia digitata). In fact most of the climbing types such as Piper spp. are found growing on such forest species as support. They are rarely cultivated but may exist as deliberately protected stands either on farmland or in the wild. Occasionally some species are introduced as intercrops with arable or cash crops like maize, cassava, cocoa, kolanut and rubber. In most backyard gardens where spices such as Occimum are grown they are interplanted with vegetables such as amaranth, okra and tomato. Many species occur at low population densities (Tetrapleura tetraptera is found at approximately 10 plants per 100 hectares of farmland) and, as a result, the quantity of production is low and prices at local markets can be high. The average market price {{of one of the most}} popular spices Monodora myristica is about US$ 1600 per ton, although there can be a price variation of about 25 - 50 % between peak production and scarcity. As these plant species are not generally cultivated, and are even less commonly studied, they are susceptible to genetic erosion through various human activities including bush burning, deforestation, development of commercial plantations and road construction. Strategy for the future These unfamiliar spice plants must be properly identified and information on their habitats, culture and uses must be disseminated. Deliberate attempts should be made to conserve existing plants and to undertake propagation in order to distribute plant material more widely. At present most spices are used in small quantities either singly or in combination, but more information is needed to determine how to process, preserve and store these materials. Most of the spices can be stored on shelves and keep well enough for 6 - 9 months under ambient conditions, but better processing and packaging would extend shelf-life, which is essential if these products are to be traded or even exported. It is apparent that many African countries have <b>under-exploited</b> plant <b>species</b> whose potential uses and value have yet to be fully realized. Action to protect, research and sustainably exploit these species must be undertaken quickly or it will be too late. An initiative on the conservation of African spices is being undertaken at the National Horticultural Research Institute, Ibadan, Nigeria but a coordinated regional effort would accelerate the rate of progress.
