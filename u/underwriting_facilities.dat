RSG's wholesale operation, RT Specialty, is the 3rd largest wholesale broker in the US. To date, there are 16 <b>underwriting</b> <b>facilities</b> within RSG Underwriting Managers (RSGUM).|$|E
40|$|The South African Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance {{have adopted}} {{inflation}} targeting and the gradual relaxation of exchange controls (along with control of public spending and financial liberalization) {{as the foundation}} of their economic policy in an attempt to win the confidence of foreign investors and to attract more foreign investment. However, this policy has not succeded in generating employment growth or investment. Instead, it has contributed to high real interest rates and relative stagnation. In order to improve central bank and capital management policies and have them contribute more to solving the fundamental problems of unemployment and poverty facing the South African economy, three reforms should be undertaken: 1) The Reserve Bank should scrap its inflation targeting approach and adopt a more even handed approach which would target employment growth subject to an inflation constraint. 2) Rather than loosening the exchange controls system, the Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance should enforcethe existing controls more strictly, and explore other ways, such as transaction taxes and speed-bumps, to further insulate South African macroeconomic policy from global pressures. 3) The South African government should implement other policies and institutions, such as special lending windows, <b>underwriting</b> <b>facilities,</b> asset based reserve requirements and subsidized credit, to further insulate the South African financial markets from the international capital markets and channel credit to employment generating and socially productive activities. This will correct a serious market failure in which international financial markets fail {{to take into account the}} social rates of return available on productive investments in South Africa. ...|$|E
5000|$|Insurers may be {{unwilling to}} insure drivers (especially at an {{affordable}} price) with particularly bad histories, which had led states to create [...] "residual market" [...] programs through which insurers {{are required to}} make insurance available. There are various ways that this is accomplished, with the most common being an assigned risk plan and other programs including joint <b>underwriting</b> associations, reinsurance <b>facilities,</b> {{and in the case}} of Maryland a state-owned fund subsidized by insurers.|$|R
50|$|Philanthropy was an {{important}} part of San Diego's expansion. For example, wealthy heiress Ellen Browning Scripps <b>underwrote</b> many public <b>facilities</b> in La Jolla, was a key supporter of the fledgling San Diego Zoo, and together with her brother E. W. Scripps established the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Another notable philanthropist of this era was George Marston, businessman and owner of Marston's Department Store. Wanting to see Balboa Park become a grand city park like those in other cities, he hired architect John Nolen on two occasions, 1908 and 1926, to develop a master plan for the park. In 1907 he bought Presidio Hill, site of the original Presidio of San Diego, which had fallen into ruins. Recognizing its importance as the site of the first European settlement in California, he developed it into a park (planned by Nolen) with his own funds, and built the Serra Museum (designed by architect William Templeton Johnson). In 1929 he donated the park to the city, which still owns and operates it; it is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
