5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E

Although computer programs are available for GSHP installers to calculate optimal lengths and configurations of ground-coupling geothermal systems, uncertainties exist for input parameters that must first be determined for these models. Input parameters include earth temperatures and {{thermal properties}} of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials.</b> Furthermore, thermal conductivity of sediments varies significantly depending on texture and moisture content, highlighting the need to characterize various <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials</b> under varying soil moisture regimes. Regolith texture data can be, and often are, collected for particular installations, and are then used to estimate thermal properties for system design.

40|$|Beef cattle feedlots contain <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials</b> (loose manure pack) that {{accumulate}} {{during a}} feeding cycle. The effects of varying amounts of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials</b> on runoff nutrient losses {{are not well}} understood. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) compare runoff nutrient losses from feedlot surfaces containing varying amounts of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials,</b> (2) determine if differences in runoff nutrient losses exist among rainfall simulation runs, (3) relate runoff nutrient losses to selected feedlot soil characteristics, and (4) identify the effects of varying runoff rate on nutrient loss rates from feedlot surfaces. This study was conducted on 0. 75 m wide by 2 m long (2. 47 ft wide by 6. 58 ft long) plots containing 0, 6. 7, 13. 5, or 26. 9 kg m− 2 (0, 1. 37, 2. 77, or 5. 51 lb ft− 2) of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials.</b> Simulated rainfall was applied during three 30 -minute events that were separated by 24 -hour intervals.

No significant differences in the measured water quality parameters were found among the surfaces containing varying amounts of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials.</b> Measurements of dissolved phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, total phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, chloride, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and erosion consistently decreased during the three rainfall simulation runs. Runoff losses of ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N), total nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were all correlated to easily obtained soil EC measurements. All measured water quality parameters were significantly influenced by runoff rate. Thus, runoff rate, and not the amount of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>materials</b> on the feedlot surface, significantly influenced nutrient losses in runoff...|$|R
40|$|Beef cattle feedlots contain <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> that accumulates within feedlot pens {{during a}} feeding cycle. Runoff from feedlot {{surfaces}} is diverted into settling basins. The storage {{capacity of the}} settling basins will be substantially reduced if large quantities of solid material are transported in runoff from the feedlot surfaces. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the hydraulic conditions that will not move <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> located within feedlots in order to minimize sediment transport. Selected sizes and a composite sample of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> were placed within 0. 75 m wide by 4. 0 m long metal frames. Flow was then introduced at the top of the frames in successive increments. The discharge rate and flow velocity necessary to cause movement of <b>unconsolidated</b> surface <b>material</b> was measured. Hydraulic measurements were used to determine the ratio of critical flow depth to particle diameter, critical flow rate, critical flow velocity, critical shear velocity, critical Reynolds number, critical shear stress, critical dimensionless shear stress, and critical boundary Reynolds number. Measurements of these parameters for the composite material were 0. 556, 0. 499 L s- 1, 0. 0787 m s- 1, 0. 0643 m s- 1, 695, 4. 12 Pa, 0. 0436, and 1040, respectively. Darcy-Weisbach roughness coefficients were calculated for each particle size class and the composite sample at varying flow rates.

30|$|The {{gradient}} on {{the horizontal}} tunnel of the kariz is 1 : 500 – 1 : 1500 (English 1968; Amin et al. 1983; Favre and Kamal 2004) and {{is less than}} the gradient of the land surface (Banks and Soldal 2002). Favre and Kamal (2004) have stated that 1 : 1000 is the maximum gradient: higher gradients result in erosion of the tunnel structure by water flowing in the kariz.

50|$|Aquifers are {{typically}} composed of semi-porous rock or <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material</b> whose pore space has {{been filled with}} water. In the relatively rare cases of confined aquifers, an impermeable geologic layer (i.e. clay or calcrete) encloses an aquifer, isolating the water within, sometimes for millennia. More commonly, fossil water is found in arid or semi-arid regions where the climate was significantly more humid in recent geologic history. In some semi-arid regions, the majority of precipitation evaporates before it can infiltrate and result in any significant aquifer recharge.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation plays a {{role with}} slope {{stability}} and creep. When a hillside contains many trees, ferns, and shrubs their roots create an interlocking network that can strengthen <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material.</b> They also aid in absorbing the excess water in the soil {{to help keep the}} slope stable.

50|$|Organic {{soils are}} {{subdivided}} into 4 great groups. Fibrisols, common in Canada, consist predominantly of relatively undecomposed organic material with clearly visible plant fragments; resistant fibres account for over 40% by volume. Most soils derived from Sphagnum mosses are Fibrisols. Mesisols are more highly decomposed and contain less fibrous material than Fibrisols (10-40% by volume). Humisols consist mainly of humified organic materials and may contain up to 10% fibre by volume. Folisols consist mainly of thick deposits of forest litter overlying bedrock, fractured bedrock or <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>material.</b> They occur commonly in wet mountainous areas of coastal British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials</b> (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.|$|R
40|$|Shallow seismic {{reflection}} surveys {{can assist}} in deter-mination of velocity and/or thickness variations in near-surface layers. Static corrections to seismic reflection data compensate for velocity and thickness variations within the "weathered zone. " An uncompensated weathered-layer thickness variation {{on the order of}} 1 m across the length of a geophone array can distort the spectrum of the signal and result in aberrations on final stacked data. P-wave velocities in areas where the weathered zone is composed of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials</b> can be substantially less than the velocity of sound in air. Weathered-layer thickness variation of 1 m in these low-velocity materials could result in a static anomaly in excess of 3 ms. Shallow-reflection data from the Texas panhandle illustrate a real geologic situation with sufficient variability in the near surface to significantly affect seismic signal reflected from depths commonly targeted by conventional reflection surveys. Synthetic data approximating a conventional reflection survey combined with a weathered-layer model generated from shallow-reflection data show the possible dramatic static effects of alluvium. Shallow high-resolution reflec-tion surveys can be used both to determine the severity of intra-array statics and to assist in the design of a filter to remove much of the distortion such statics cause on deeper reflection data. The static effects of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>materials</b> can be even more dramatic on S-wave reflection surveys than on comparable P-wave surveys...|$|R
