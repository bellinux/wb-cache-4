As with the Mercator projection, the region near the tangent (or secant) point on a Stereographic map remains very close to true scale for an angular distance of a few degrees. In the ellipsoidal model, a stereographic projection tangent to the pole has a scale factor of less than 1.003 at 84° latitude and 1.008 at 80° latitude. The adjustment of the scale factor in the <b>UPS</b> <b>projection</b> reduces the average scale distortion over the entire zone.|$|E

The dancers' use of imagery tended to be multi-modal, multi-dimensional, seeking to integrate mind, body, and spirit not only in their dance activities but also in their lifestyle. Many of these personalized images had common characteristics and similar effects, which made possible their organization into eight imagery categories: inspiration, atmospheric, specific movement, metaphysical, emptying out, filling <b>up,</b> <b>projection,</b> and imagery rehearsal.

40|$|Hierarchical {{processing}} of sensory information occurs at multiple levels between the peripheral and central pathway. Different extents of convergence and divergence in top down and bottom <b>up</b> <b>projections</b> {{makes it difficult}} to separate the various components activated by a sensory input. In particular, hierarchical processing at sub-cortical levels is little understood. Here we have developed a method to isolate extrinsic inputs to the inferior colliculus (IC), a nucleus in the midbrain region of the auditory system, with extensive ascending and descending convergence. By applying a high concentration of divalent cations (HiDi) locally within the IC, we isolate a HiDi-sensitive from a HiDi-insensitive component of responses evoked by afferent input in brain slices and in vivo during a sound stimulus. Our results suggest that the HiDi sensitive component is a monosynaptic input to the IC, while the HiDi-insensitive component is a local polysynaptic circuit. Monosynaptic inputs have short latencies, rapid rise times and underlie first spike latencies. Local inputs have variable delays and evoke long-lasting excitation. In vivo, local circuits have variable onset times and temporal profiles. Our results suggest that high concentrations of divalent cations should prove to be a widely useful method of isolating extrinsic monosynaptic inputs from local circuits in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Regression {{equations}} {{were developed}} from left ventricular casts of known volumes to calculate left ventricular volumes from biplane cineangiography obtained in non-standard views. Volumes were calculated by Simpson's rule from casts of postmortem specimens from patients with congenital heart disease. The casts {{were divided into}} two groups: those that came from patients with abnormal right ventricular haemodynamic function (group 1, n = 11) and those that came from patients in which it was normal (group 2, n = 9). Biplane cinegrams were taken in conventional (anteroposterior/lateral, right anterior oblique/left anterior oblique) and non-conventional (long axis oblique, hepatoclavicular, and sitting <b>up)</b> <b>projections.</b> The true volume of each cast was determined from its weight and specific gravity. Correlations between measured and true volumes (r = 0. 96 to 0. 99) were excellent in all projections, although each projection overestimated the true volumes (slope = 0. 72 to 0. 94). The regression equations obtained from conventional views were significantly different from those from the non-conventional views; however, the regression slopes in group 1 were not different from those in group 2 in any view. Regression equations obtained by Simpson's rule {{do not seem to be}} affected by the haemodynamic state of the right ventricle. Different regression equations are required to measure left ventricular volumes from non-conventional angiograms...|$|R
