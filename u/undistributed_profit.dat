40|$|Many {{provisions}} of the U. S. tax code affect corporate decisions to pay out or retain earnings. Most studies of these effects have {{examined the effects of}} dividend and capital gains taxes on payouts. Relatively few studies have considered the effects of corporate taxes on retentions. In the early 1900 s, the United States experimented with several corporate taxes on retentions. These taxes increased the price of corporate retentions, thereby encouraging corporate payouts. This paper studies the response of corporations to the most significant of these experiments the <b>Undistributed</b> <b>Profits</b> Tax of 1936 - 1938. While the U. S. no longer directly taxes corporate retentions, our study provides empirical results relevant to two recent policy debates. First, to the extent that corporate payouts did respond significantly to a change in the corporate price of retentions, we can learn more about the implicit prices corporations place on internal funds. These estimates enable us better understand the effects of government policies designed to encourage corporate reinvestment. Second, our study provides evidence relevant to several recent proposals designed to resolve managerial agency problems. These proposals require managers to payout their "free" cash flows as a way of committing not to waste financial capital. The <b>Undistributed</b> <b>Profits</b> Tax of 1936 - 1938 had a similar goal. Its maximum marginal tax rate of 27 percent on corporate retentions gave managers strong incentives to pay out retained earnings. We study the effects of the <b>Undistributed</b> <b>Profits</b> Tax on corporate payouts using a panel data set on 26 large petroleum companies. These data have a number of advantages, {{not the least of which}} is the relative homogeneity of petroleum firms' investment opportunities. We find that on average corporate payout policies did respond significantly to the surtax in 1936, the first year of the tax. There was much less of a response in 1937, and practically none in the last year, 1938. The smaller payouts in 1937 and 1938 suggest that managers were able to find margins other than dividends through which they could reduce their tax burden. These other margins included the short-term manipulation of expenses and delays in recognizing revenues. These responses suggest that managers place a relatively high valuation on internal versus external funds. They also suggest that proposals that would require managers to payout free cash flows must resolve an important incentive problem [...] how to get managers to reveal fully what cash flows are "free. " Finally, our results document the importance of recognizing behavioral responses to taxes. That is, firms may respond to changes in relative tax prices by finding other margins by which they can reduce their tax burdens. ...|$|R

Derick Heathcoat-Amory's Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential profits tax with a single profits tax measure, applicable to both retained and distributed profits. This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to retain profits for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce.|$|R

Sinn’s (1993) initial “underinvestment” problem due to taxes on repatriated dividends is argued to also concern all follow-up investments of the subsidiary financed from its marginal profits that represent the required return on the initial investment. The dividend tax capitalization hypothesis in the international context, or the Sinn-Hartman neutrality theorem, is valid only if the initial investment generates intra-marginal profits and concerns their reinvestment, the returns of which are repatriated dividends. The results reveal that the ownership structure of the parent and the consequent tax preference for dividends affect foreign source intra-marginal profits differently from domestic source ones. In particular, the cost of capital for foreign intra-marginal profits is inversely affected by the home-country dividend tax. We calibrate the cost of capital formulae to the parameter values of the Estonian and Finnish systems of taxing international investment income.

The results give support to the hypothesis that the share of external financing in total capital of Estonian companies is lower in the conditions of DPT in comparison to that under the traditional gross profit taxation system.

5000|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of <b>undistributed</b> <b>profits.</b> In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|R
