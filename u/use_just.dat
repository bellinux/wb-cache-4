25|$|The {{generation}} of a protein sequence {{is much easier}} than the determination of a protein structure. However, {{the structure of a}} protein gives much more insight in the function of the protein than its sequence. Therefore, a number of methods for the computational prediction of protein structure from its sequence have been developed. Ab initio prediction methods <b>use</b> <b>just</b> the sequence of the protein. Threading and homology modeling methods can build a 3-D model for a protein of unknown structure from experimental structures of evolutionarily-related proteins, called a protein family.|$|E

A study tested the {{hypothesis}} that cockroaches <b>use</b> <b>just</b> two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the Free University of Brussels and other European institutions created a set of tiny robots that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{great variety}} of such proofs of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, of which several will be given here. They vary in the amount of {{abstract}} algebraic notions required to understand the proof. The simplest proofs <b>use</b> <b>just</b> those notions needed to formulate the theorem (matrices, polynomials with numeric entries, determinants), but involve technical computations that render somewhat mysterious the fact that they lead precisely to the correct conclusion. It is possible to avoid such details, but at the price of involving more subtle algebraic notions: polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, or matrices with unusual kinds of entries.|$|E

To this end, the Air Ministry planned to <b>use</b> <b>just</b> about anything that could fly. On 17 May 1940, an Air Ministry meeting outlined a series of ambitious plans to make use of various aircraft in the event of an invasion.|$|E

25|$|Rains argued {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing that Mehserle lacked the malice necessary for a murder charge and {{that he intended to}} tase Grant. A BART officer testified, saying that Grant and his friends had yelled profanities and did not obey her orders to sit down moments before Mehserle fired at Grant. She said she was fearful when she heard taunts coming from Grant, his friends, and passengers on the train. After the seven days of testimony, Judge C. Don Clay concluded that Mehserle had not mistakenly used his service pistol instead of his stun gun. The judge based this on Mehserle's statements to other officers that he thought Grant had a gun. He also noted that Mehserle had held his weapon with both hands, but he was trained to <b>use</b> <b>just</b> his left if he was firing a Taser. Mehserle faced up to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the molluscs, whose shells often comprise both forms, most lineages <b>use</b> <b>just</b> one form of the mineral. The form used appears to reflect the seawater chemistry – thus which form was more easily precipitated – {{at the time that the}} lineage first evolved a calcified skeleton, and does not change thereafter. However, the relative abundance of calcite- and aragonite-using lineages does not reflect subsequent seawater chemistry – the magnesium/calcium ratio of the oceans appears to have a negligible impact on organisms' success, which is instead controlled mainly by how well they recover from mass extinctions. A recently discovered modern gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum that lives near deep-sea hydrothermal vents illustrates the influence of both ancient and modern local chemical environments: its shell is made of aragonite, which is found in some of the earliest fossil mollusks; but it also has armor plates on the sides of its foot, and these are mineralized with the iron sulfides pyrite and greigite, which had never previously been found in any metazoan but whose ingredients are emitted in large quantities by the vents.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 it was {{reported}} that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or {{are in a state of}} dereliction, with several squatter camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by vandalism, graffiti or strewn with rubbish. These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the Athens Olympics are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while other facilities are still in <b>use</b> <b>just</b> as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports. Concerts and theatrical shows, such as those by the troupe Cirque du Soleil, have recently been held in the complex.|$|E
