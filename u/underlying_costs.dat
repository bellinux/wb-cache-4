40|$|We {{document}} that observed international input-output linkages contribute substantially to synchronizing producer price inflation (PPI) across countries. Using a multi-country, industry-level dataset that combines information on PPI and exchange rates with {{international and domestic}} input-output linkages, we recover the <b>underlying</b> <b>cost</b> shocks that are propagated internationally via the global input-output network, thus generating the observed dynamics of PPI. We then compare {{the extent to which}} common global factors account for the variation in actual PPI and in the <b>underlying</b> <b>cost</b> shocks. Our main finding is that across a range of econometric tests, input-output linkages account for half of the global component of PPI inflation. We report three additional findings: (i) the results are similar when allowing for imperfect cost pass-through and demand complementarities; (ii) PPI synchronization across countries is driven primarily by common sectoral shocks and input-output linkages amplify co-movement primarily by propagating sectoral shocks; and (iii) the observed pattern of international input use preserves fat-tailed idiosyncratic shocks and thus leads to a fat-tailed distribution of inflation rates, i. e., periods of disination and high inflation...|$|R

The aim {{of this approach is}} to push learning from demonstration to more complex manipulation scenarios that include the interaction with objects and therefore the realization of contacts/constraints within the motion.

40|$|We {{examine the}} quality of social choice {{mechanisms}} using a utilitarian view, in which all of the agents have costs {{for each of the}} possible alternatives. While these <b>underlying</b> <b>costs</b> determine what the optimal alternative is, they may be unknown to the social choice mechanism; instead the mechanism must decide on a good alternative based only on the ordinal preferences of the agents which are induced by the <b>underlying</b> <b>costs.</b> Due to its limited information, such a social choice mechanism cannot simply select the alternative that minimizes the total social cost (or minimizes some other objective function). Thus, we seek to bound the distortion: the worst-case ratio between the social cost of the alternative selected and the optimal alternative. Distortion measures how good a mechanism is at approximating the alternative with minimum social cost, while using only ordinal preference information. The <b>underlying</b> <b>costs</b> can be arbitrary, implicit, and unknown; our only assumption is that the agent costs form a metric space, which is a natural assumption in many settings. We quantify the distortion of many well-known social choice mechanisms. We show that for both total social cost and median agent cost, many positional scoring rules have large distortion, while on the other hand Copeland and similar mechanisms perform optimally or near-optimally, always obtaining a distortion of at most 5. We also give lower bounds on the distortion that could be obtained by any deterministic social choice mechanism, and extend our results on median agent cost to more general objective functions. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{incumbent}} {{postal service}} provider faces two issues which make {{the design of}} e ¢ cient access pricing especially di ¢ cult: universal service obligations, which require retail prices to be out of line with <b>underlying</b> <b>costs,</b> and the possibility that competing rms will (selectively) bypass the incumbents delivery network.

40|$|This paper investigates {{heterogeneity}} in {{pollution abatement}} costs using a {{computable general equilibrium}} framework. Previous literature using aggregated data has found that "grandfathered" tradable permits are dominated by other instruments including emission taxes, performance standards, and technology mandates because of interactions with pre-existing taxes. However, when the <b>underlying</b> <b>costs</b> of abatement are heterogeneous, a disaggregate representation of costs yields qualitatively different findings. In a disaggregate model of NOX abatement in the United States, the relative performance of tradable permits improves significantly and out-performs command and control approaches {{over a wide range}} of emission reductions. ...|$|E

40|$|Producing a polymer {{copy of a}} polymer {{template}} {{is central}} to biology, and effective copies must persist after template separation. We show that this separation has three fundamental thermodynamic effects. First, polymer-template interactions do not contribute to overall reaction thermodynamics and hence cannot drive the process. Second, the equilibrium state of the copied polymer is template independent and so additional work is required to provide specificity. Finally, the mixing of copies from distinct templates makes correlations between template and copy sequences unexploitable, combining with copying inaccuracy to reduce the free energy stored in a polymer ensemble. These basic principles set limits on the <b>underlying</b> <b>costs</b> and resource requirements, and suggest design principles, for autonomous copying and replication in biological and synthetic systems...|$|E
