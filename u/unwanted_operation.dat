40|$|Power {{systems are}} in a phase of {{automation}} where intelligent components and sub-systems are employed to monitor, control and manage the grid. Quantifying the complex consequences on system reliability, from the integration of such automated and semi-automated equipment into the existing grid is important for maintenance optimisation and fault mitigation. This thesis identifies the  advanced approaches in power system reliability analysis {{with the potential to}} capture the complications and correlations in modern power grid after reviewing the traditional reliability evaluation methods. A method for modelling the different modes of failures, possible in a substation and feeder architecture along with the probable false tripping scenarios was developed. An improved Reliability Block Diagram based approach was designed to count in the traditionally unaccounted failure cases affecting both the primary grid and the protectionand control equipment. The effect and corresponding trend of additional feeder lines in a radial distribution system on the net interruption rate experienced at load ends of feeders are derived and modelled. Such real-world substation architectures are analysed and the aforementioned trends are compared with those from the practical grid. Thus, the analysis was able to identify and measure the complex hidden failure probabilities due to both <b>unwanted</b> <b>operation</b> of breakers and functional failure of protection systems. The measured probabilities were used to calculate the impact of protection and control equipment on system  reliability. The obtained results were verified by comparing it with the observations by energy researchers on ten years of protection system failure statistics. The application of the model and results, in optimal maintenance planning and power network optimisation are identified as the next step. QC 20151002 </p...|$|E

Some examples of these are long delays for heavy internal faults, <b>unwanted</b> <b>operations</b> for external faults, and insensitivity to low-level turn-to-turn faults, which can be left to develop into high-level faults – with more severe damage to the power transformer – before they can be detected...|$|R

40|$|Present {{distribution}} {{networks are}} changing into smarter, reliable and more flexible networks utilizing latest developments on power generation, storage and communication technologies. The {{changes have been}} brought about by integration of renewable energy resources, modern controllers, advanced communications and metering infrastructures. As a result, {{there are a number}} of dynamic devices operating in a closer proximity in small geographical areas of distribution networks. Moreover, there are increased chances of interactions among dynamic components within the distribution networks. Such interactions can lead to instabilities. Instability issues must be addressed to accommodate higher penetration of renewable energy resources and increasing network efficiency. This thesis attempts to address one of the major instability issues, i. e. small signal stability. Small signal stability can be a limiting condition for synchronized operation of generators and the power transfer capability of emerging distribution systems. Instability of this type results into system oscillations causing <b>unwanted</b> <b>operation</b> of protective devices leading to the system collapse. The objectives of this research are assessment and enhancement of small signal stability issues of emerging distribution networks with high penetration of distributed generators (DG units). This research basically covers issues on modelling, stability analysis and control system design. The studies are made on two test distribution networks, i. e. a 16 - bus radial network and a 43 -bus industrial mesh network. In order to achieve these objectives the following studies are accomplished in this research: - An investigation is made on small signal stability of a renewable energy based medium voltage electricity distribution system. The influence of different kinds of generators on small signal stability is discussed. Similarly, the influence of varying penetration of renewable energy on state participation and modal sensitivity is observed. Also, influence of shunt compensator placement on small signal stability is investigated. - Techniques for ranking of loads for assessing load impact on small signal stability have been discussed. Evaluation of dynamic loading margin as indicated by Hopf bifurcation is discussed. The influence of composite load modelling on modal damping and dynamic loading margin of the system has been investigated. - Control methodologies for enhanced small signal stability of distribution network are investigated. The opportunities for controlling network components such as a capacitor bank or a load have been explained. Similarly, discussions are made on installing a damping controller at a distributed generator such as photovoltaic or wind generator. Similarly, design of a coordinated controller tuned by multiple DG units is presented. The results show that emerging distribution can oscillate with unique frequency of oscillations. Oscillatory modes are sensitive to the variations of generator outputs. Damping ratios of the oscillations are affected by shunt compensators and load characteristics. Oscillatory modes with lower damping ratio can be critical to the system stability. Suitable control methodology must be applied to enhance damping ratio of critical modes. Damping ratio can be enhanced by an auxiliary controller installed at a selected capacitor bank or a selected load. Similarly, such a damping controller can be installed at a DG unit such as a photovoltaic or a variable speed wind generator. Moreover, multiple DG units can be controlled by a coordinated controller to enhance damping ratio of critical modes. Coordinated controller is tuned by multiple DG units so that it operates even if some of the DG units are out of operation. The contributions made by the thesis can be useful to network service providers as well as DG unit owners for better stability performance in emerging distribution networks...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{research}} carried {{out into the}} use of Artificial Intelligence techniques for Power System Analysis. A number of aspects of Power System analysis and its management are investigated {{and the application of}} Artificial Intelligence techniques is researched. The use of software tools for checking the application of power system protection systems particularly for complex circuit arrangements was investigated. It is shown that the software provides a more accurate and efficient way of carrying out these investigations. The National Grid Company's (plc, UK) use of software tools for checking the application of protection systems is described, particularly for complex circuit arrangements such as multi-terminal circuits and composite overhead line and cable circuits. Also described, is how investigations have been made into an actual system fault that resulted in a failure of protection to operate. Techniques using digital fault records to replay a fault into a static model of protection are used in the example. The need for dynamic modelling of protection is also discussed. Work done on automating the analysis of digital fault records using computational techniques is described. An explanation is given on how a rule-based system has been developed to classify fault types and analyse the response of protection during a power system fault or disturbance in order to determine correct or incorrect operation. The development of expert systems for on-line application in Energy Control Centres (ECC), is reported. The development of expert systems is a continuous process as new knowledge is gained in the field of artificial intelligence and new expert system development tools are built. Efforts are being made for on-line application of expert systems in ECC as preventive control under normal/alert conditions and as a corrective control during a disturbance. This will enable a more secure power system operation. Considerable scope exists in the development of expert systems and their application to power system operation and control. An overview of the many different types of Neural Network has been carried out explaining terminology and methodology along with a number of techniques used for their implementation. Although the mathematical concepts are not new, many of them were recorded more than fifty years ago, the introduction of fast computers has enabled many of these concepts to be used for today's complex problems. The use of Genetic Algorithm based Artificial Neural Networks is demonstrated for Electrical Load Forecasting and the use of Self Organising Maps is explored for classifying Power System digital fault records. The background of the optimisation process carried out in this thesis is given and an introduction to the method applied, in particular Evolutionary Programming and Genetic Algorithms. Possible solutions to optimisation problems were introduced to be either local or global minimum solutions with the latter being the desirable result. The evolutionary computation that has potential to produce a global solution to a problem due to the searching mechanisms that are inherent to the procedures is discussed. Various mechanisms may be introduced to the genetic algorithm routine which may eliminate the problems of premature convergence, thus enhancing the methods' chances of producing the best solution. The other, more traditional methods of optimisation described include Lagrange multipliers, Dynamic Programming, Local Search and Simulated annealing. Only the Dynamic Programming method guarantees a global optimum solution to an optimisation problem, however for complex problems, the method could take a vast amount of time to locate a solution due to the potential for combinatorial explosion since every possible solution is considered. The Lagrange multiplier method and the local search method are useful for quick location of a global minimum and are therefore useful when the topography of the optimisation problem is uni-modal. However in a complex multi-modal problem, a global solution is less likely. The simulated annealing method has been more popular for solving complex multi-modal problems since it includes techniques for the search to avoid being trapped in local minimum solutions. Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm have been used to design a neural network for short-term load forecasting. The forecasting model has been used to produce a forecast of the load in the 24 hours of the forecast day concerned, using data provided by an Italian power company. The results obtained are promising. In this particular case, the comparison between the results from the Genetic Algorithm - Artificial Neural Network and Back Propagation - Neural Network shows that the Genetic Algorithm - Artificial Neural Network does not provide a faster solution than the Back Propagation - Neural Network. The application of Evolutionary Programming to fault section estimation is investigated and a comparison made with a Genetic Algorithm approach. To enhance service reliability and to reduce power outage, rapid restoration of power system is required. As a first step of restoration, the fault section should be accurately estimated quickly. The Fault Section Estimation (FSE) identifies fault components in a power system by using information on the operation of protection relays and circuit breakers. However this task is difficult especially for cases where the relay or circuit breaker fails to operate and for multiple faults. An Evolutionary Programming (EP) approach has been developed for solving the FSE problem including malfunctions of protection relays and/or circuit breakers and multiple fault cases. A comparison is made with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach at the same time. Two different population sizes are tested for each case. In general, EP showed faster computational speed than GA with an average factor of 13 times more. The final results were almost the same. The convergence speed (the required number of generations to get an optimum result) is a very important factor in real time applications. Test results show that EP is better than GA. However, as both EP and GA are evolutionary algorithms, their efficiencies are largely dependent on the complexity of the problem that might differ from case to case. The use of Artificial Neural Networks to classify digital fault records is investigated showing theat Self Organising Maps could be useful for classifying records if integrated into other systems. Digital fault records are a very useful source of information to the protection engineer to assist with the investigation of a suspected <b>unwanted</b> <b>operation</b> or failure to operate of a protection scheme. After a widespread power system disturbance, due to a storm for example, a large number of fault records can be produced. A method of automatically classifying fault records would be very helpful in reducing {{the amount of time spent}} in manual analysis, thus assisting the engineer to focus on records that need in depth analysis. Fault classification using rule base methods have already been developed. The completed work is preliminary in nature and an overview of an extension to this work, involving the extraction of frequency components from the digital fault record data and using these as input to a SOM network, is described...|$|E

Security in Active XML is currently handled by matching {{the structure of the}} received data with an XML schema representing the allowed data (including service calls). This solution is not fully satisfactory in case of an open environment where the services do not often know or trust each other. Moreover, the strength of Active XML lies in its simple and dynamic structure, and the modified XML schemas used for security matching can quickly limit the allowed services, or give too much freedom to services that should not be trusted. Given that the result of an Active XML service call is some Active XML data (that may include more service calls), Active XML data is recursive, thus involving more security concerns. We propose a new framework based on the notion of Trust (Trusted Active XML) for handling security in Active XML.

40|$|Disturbances {{in power}} systems are common and they result in {{electromechanical}} oscillations called power swing. The power swings could be severe {{and it may}} lead to loss of synchronism among the interconnected generators. This {{is referred to as}} out-of-step condition. The voltage and current swings during an out-of-step condition damage power system equipments and also cause <b>unwanted</b> <b>operations</b> of various protective devices. The protection systems require an effective algorithm for fast and accurate detection of out-of-step condition. This research is focused on the development of a simple and effective out-of-step relay capable of detecting out-of-step condition in a complex power system. To achieve this, the research has gone through four distinct stages: development of an algorithm, simulation, hardware implementation and its testing. An out-of-step algorithm is proposed based on equal area criterion in time domain. The equal area criterion in time domain is obtained by modifying the traditional equal area criterion in power angle domain. A single machine infinite bus system, a two machine infinite bus system and a three machine infinite bus system and a 17 -bus multiple machines system are used as case studies and are modeled using simulation tool(PSCAD™). To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, various out-of-step conditions are simulated by applying disturbances at various locations in the above chosen power system configurations. For hardware implementation and testing of the algorithm, a digital signal processing board (ADSP-BF 533 from Analog Devices ™) is used. To test the performance of the developed digital relay in a closed loop, real time power system signals are necessary and therefore for this purpose, a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS™) available in the power research laboratory is used. The RTDS™ simulator mimics the actual power systems in real time. The signals required by the relays can be tapped from the RTDS™ and the signals coming from relay can be fed back into the RTDS™, which makes the closed loop testing of the digital relay possible. This research has yielded a simple out-of-step algorithm and unlike the other out-of-step detection techniques proposed in the literature does not need offline system studies to arrive at a solution. The developed digital out-of-step relay is capable of making decisions based only on the information available from its point of installation, thus it avoids the communication devices which is advantageous for the out-of-step protection of a complex power system. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can be applied to any power configurations and is faster compared to the conventional concentric rectangle schemes used in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Power swings {{are known}} to occur due to the {{presence}} of sudden disturbances in the power network. The oscillation of power results in impedance swaying and causes the impedance trajectory to swing back and forth within the distance relay operating characteristics which may lead to unintended relay operation. Ideally, the distance relays in transmission system should not trip unexpectedly during dynamic system conditions such as stable power swings. Commonly, the relay settings are customized to prevent the impedance swing in order to avoid nuisance tripping. However, as the electrical system evolves, its complexity increases in line with the increasing risk of swing severity which may trigger <b>unwanted</b> relay <b>operations.</b> In recent times, the integration of inverter driven generation has been increasing. The penetration of large scale renewable generation into transmission network and its impact to the power swing characteristics has yet to be established. Therefore, this research will investigate the severity of power swing, critical clearing time of synchronous generator and the risk of distance relay mal-operation in the presence of large solar PV generator in transmission system. It is demonstrated in this research that the severity of swing increases and the critical clearing time of the synchronous machine decreases in the presence of inverter driven generation (solar PV generator) when compared to an equivalent synchronous machine.

40|$|Today, most of {{the large}} and easily {{accessible}} oil and gas fields on the Norwegian continental shelf has been developed. Future production potential is found in development of fields at large depths and cost-efficient methods of improving the recovery of existing fields at the tail production stage. Development of wet gas compression technology for subsea boosting is one pathway to achieving this. Introducing multiphase flow into the already complex flow pattern inside compressors makes it challenging to develop accurate analytical models. Current research is therefore highly dependent on test data from real scale compressor rigs. One such compressor rig is built at the Department of Energy and Process Engineering. This thesis focus on transients aerodynamics phenomenons in centrifugal compressors. These primarily occur at low flow rate where the compressors performance is limited by stall and surge. Encountering stall or surge is highly <b>unwanted</b> during <b>operation</b> and it is therefore of interest to investigate how wet gas affect them. A compressor that is exposed directly to the wellstream also needs to handle inlet instabilities {{in the form of}} liquid content fluctuations, especially if the downstream pipelines are prone to slug formation. This is a unique challenge for wet gas compressors. A vibration approach is taken, and the author has focused on analysis of frequency spectra, primarily based on dynamic pressure readings in the diffuser. The results show a mild increase of noise during wet conditions due to the dispersed liquid droplets causing reflection of pressure waves. Left limit tests suggest that the compressor encounters impeller rotating stall that is severe enough to cause flow instabilities, but no signs of surge oscillations are seen. The same is observed for wet gas, but this occurs at a lower flow rate. Slug tests performed in the surge area gives no indication of instability, as the stall cells are immediately re-energized and no excitations are observed around the rotors natural frequency...|$|R

In this way, the search area for vehicle detection is limited to road boundaries while other moving objects such as vegetation or pedestrians are omitted. Road detection from aerial helicopter images is done by a line detection method based on edge detection and morphology <b>operations.</b> <b>Unwanted</b> lines and other errors introduced during the line detection are removed by a threshold method.

40|$|Optimal {{power flow}} (OPF) {{is the choice}} tool for {{determining}} the optimal operating status of the power system by managing controllable devices. The importance of the OPF approach has increased due to increasing energy prices and availability of more control devices. Existing OPF approaches exhibit shortcomings. Current OPF algorithms can be classified into (a) nonlinear programming, (b) intelligent search methods, and (c) sequential algorithms. Nonlinear programming algorithms focus on {{the solution of the}} Kuhn-Tucker conditions; they require a starting feasible solution and the model includes all constraints; these characteristics limit the robustness and efficiency of these methods. Intelligent search methods are first-order methods and are totally inefficient for large-scale systems. Traditional sequential algorithms require a starting feasible solution, a requirement that limits their robustness. Present implementations of sequential algorithms use traditional modeling that result in inefficient algorithms. The research described in this thesis has overcome the shortcomings by developing a robust and highly efficient algorithm. Robustness is defined as the ability to provide a solution for any system; the proposed approach achieves robustness by operating on suboptimal points and moving toward feasible, it stops at a suboptimal solution if an optimum does not exist. Efficiency is achieved by (a) converting the nonlinear OPF problem to a quadratic problem (b) and limiting the size of the model; the quadratic model enables fast convergence and the algorithm that identifies the active constraints, limits the size of the model by only including the active constraints. A concise description of the method is as follows: The proposed method starts from an arbitrary state which may be infeasible; model equations and system constraints are satisfied by introducing artificial mismatch variables at each bus. Mathematically this is an optimal but infeasible point. At each iteration, the artificial mismatches are reduced while the solution point maintains optimality. When mismatches reach zero, the solution becomes feasible and the optimum has been found; otherwise, the mismatch residuals are converted to load shedding and the algorithm provides a suboptimal but feasible solution. Therefore, the algorithm operates on infeasible but optimal points and moves towards feasibility. The proposed algorithm maximizes efficiency with two innovations: (a) quadratization that converts the nonlinear model to quadratic with excellent convergence properties and (b) minimization of model size by identifying active constraints, which are the only constraints included in the model. Finally sparsity technique is utilized that provide the best computational efficiency for large systems. This dissertation work demonstrates the proposed OPF algorithm using various systems up to three hundred buses and compares it with several well-known OPF software packages. The results show that the proposed algorithm converges fast and its runtime is competitive. Furthermore, the proposed method is extended to a three-phase OPF (TOPF) algorithm for unbalanced networks using the quadratized three-phase power system model. An example application of the TOPF is presented. Specifically, TOPF is utilized {{to address the problem of}} fault induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) phenomena, which lead to <b>unwanted</b> relay <b>operations,</b> stalling of motors and load disruptions. This thesis presents a methodology that will optimally enhance the distribution system to mitigate/eliminate the onset of FIDVR. The time domain simulation method has been integrated with a TOPF model and a dynamic programming optimization algorithm to provide the optimal reinforcing strategy for the circuits.

40|$|Combined sewer {{networks}} {{are designed to}} collect and transport the aqueous and solid wastes originating from domestic, industrial and catchment surfaces for treatment and disposal. One {{of the problems that}} arise is sedimentation of the particles within the collected water while flowing throughout such networks. In fact, many sewer pipes in combined sewer systems experience considerable fluctuations in flows, ranging from high flow during short-term storm events to longer periods of much lower dry weather flows. In low flow periods sewers experience a characteristic diurnal flow variation. In such periods when the pipe filling level is very low, minimum critical velocities might not be satisfied (Bertrand-Krajewski, 2002). Thus, deposition generally occurs during these periods and also during decelerating flows when storm runoff is receding. Although the flow of surface runoff into the sewer network generates considerable rates of shear stresses, this does not guarantee proper sediment transport in downstream sewer pipes due to lack of enough strength of the flow to constantly produce the required shear stresses. Hence deposition is likely to occur, which can generate problems such as hydraulic overloading due to a reduction in flow capacity and increase of the risk of surcharging during storm events. This could result in both surficial flooding and <b>unwanted</b> early <b>operation</b> of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Thus, the issue of designing sewer systems to be self-cleansing becomes important. This is however not always promising, particularly in flat regions, where the necessary slopes for sewer pipes to be self-cleansing are not available (especially in the most upstream parts of the network) due to the costs of required deep excavations and pumping systems. In this regard, the use of flushing devices that generate controlled flush waves into the downstream sewer system once the tank is completely filled with runoff water could be a proper solution. The effect of such devices as external sources to help remove the settled particles from sewer pipes has been investigated by many researchers (Bertrand-Krajewski et al, 2005; Bouteligier et al, 2006; Campisano et al, 2004; Dettmar et al, 2002). In the paper an evaluation of the proper implementation of flushing tanks for eroding sediments from a combined sewer network in the village Erpe-Mere in Flanders, Belgium, is presented based on experiments and numerical simulations carried out at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (K. U. Leuven). Implementation of these flushing tanks in different locations of a sewer network is studied with regard to subsequent modifications of hydrodynamic components of the flow throughout the network (shear stress, flow discharge, flow velocity). The research takes account of the hydraulic characteristics of the flushing tank (released flow rate as a function of time and the specific effects on in-sewer sediment transport). The methodology consists of utilizing version 7. 5 of InfoWorks CS (Wallingford Software, UK) in order to calculate the resulting spatially distributed shear stresses {{as a function of the}} pipe diameters and slopes to evaluate eroding capabilities of the generated flush waves in an existing combined sewer network. Emphasis is given on verifying whether the simulation-based shear stresses throughout the sewer network satisfy the required self-cleansing conditions reasonably, i. e. generated shear stresses remain high enough for a small time interval. Of particular concern is the proper location of multiple flushing devices all over the combined sewer network with respect to the potential degree of sediment removal and transport, and the possible drawbacks which could occur during such flushing events such as modification of the cross section of the flow and consequent effects on sewer surcharging or flooding. In fact, there are various influencing parameters engaged in the proper installation of these devices such as sewer network characteristics, contributing catchment characteristics, etc. The evaluation results indicate that attaining a minimum shear stress criterion (e. g. 3 N/m 2 for combined sewer networks based on the Flemish sewer design requirements) could not be satisfied in all parts of the considered sewer network and even some undesired effects emerged. Nevertheless, regarding the accomplished modelling analyses, the capability of such devices to produce effective forces for removal of the settled particles in combined sewer networks is well accounted for. status: publishe...|$|R
