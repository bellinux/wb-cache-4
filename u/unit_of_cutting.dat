40|$|Abstract. The use <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> fluids {{in turning}} can change {{thermomechanical}} loading <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> tools. Currently, manufacturers provide {{a wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> fluids, which have different combinations of lubricating and cooling properties. Depending on cutting conditions, this combination can reduce tool wear in different degrees, and, in some cases, to even increase it. Therefore, an effective choice <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> fluids requires {{a considerable amount of}} experiments, which requires cost and time. To solve this problem in the software SIMULIA/Abaqus Explicit 6. 10 was developed thermomechanical model of the turning process by cutting tools with PVD-coating, which allows simulating the effect of any combination of cooling and lubricating action. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation method was used in the modeling. Under the lubricating and cooling action is understood the final result <b>of</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> fluids with the <b>cutting</b> zone.
