25|$|When the Lincoln Cent was {{introduced}} in 1909, {{it was discovered that}} the coining dies and their curved fields were unable to be polished to proof coining condition by existing Mint equipment. To produce Proof coinage for collectors, the U.S. Mint adopted the French technique of the Matte Proof, which was thought to highlight the design, while leaving the details of the coin as the designer intended. This was done by a sandblasting of the dies prior to use. When struck by the high pressure hydraulic press of the Philadelphia Mint Medal Room, the result was a semi-rough surface, a gentle luster and strongly defined wide square rims. These coins were produced in very small numbers, and the dies quickly developed small marks, known as diagnostics. These marks are used today by Third Party Graders and Collectors to authenticate the coin. Sold for mere pennies over face during the years of production, they were not popular with collectors. When new, the coins were wrapped in a tarnish-proof tissue, which over time proved to be anything but. Since many of these coins sat for decades unsold, vivid colors and toning developed. It is not unusual to see vivid blues, greens, lavender, coppery orange, deep reds and purple hues on these coins. Eagerly collected by numismatists today, they are among the most valuable Lincoln cents. <b>Unencapsulated</b> coins are easily identified by wide, square outer rims, quite unlike the rounded edges of business strikes.|$|E
500|$|There is a {{pegylated}} (polyethylene glycol coated) liposome-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, sold as Doxil. It {{was developed}} to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer that causes lesions to grow under the skin, in {{the lining of the}} mouth, nose and throat, or in other organs. The polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome. [...] Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. [...] The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful. [...] In clinical testing at 50mg/m2 dosing every 4 weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than <b>unencapsulated</b> doxorubicin. [...] This form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.|$|E

50|$|In 1930, {{two major}} {{categories}} of H. influenzae were defined: the <b>unencapsulated</b> strains and the encapsulated strains. Encapsulated strains were classified {{on the basis}} of their distinct capsular antigens. There are six generally recognized types of encapsulated H. influenzae: a, b, c, d, e, and f.Genetic diversity among <b>unencapsulated</b> strains is greater than within the encapsulated group. <b>Unencapsulated</b> strains are termed nontypable (NTHi) because they lack capsular serotypes; however, they can be classified by multilocus sequence typing. The pathogenesis of H. influenzae infections is not completely understood, although the presence of the capsule in encapsulated type b (Hib), a serotype causing conditions such as epiglottitis, is known to be a major factor in virulence. Their capsule allows them to resist phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis in the nonimmune host. The <b>unencapsulated</b> strains are almost always less invasive; they can, however, produce an inflammatory response in humans, which can lead to many symptoms. Vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccine is effective in preventing Hib infection, but does not prevent infection with NTHi strains.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two forms}} of coal ash recycling- “encapsulated” and “unencapsulated." [...] When coal ash is bound to other {{materials}} it is encapsulated. For example, coal ash can be reused in making concrete, bricks and wallboards. On the other hand, <b>unencapsulated</b> use of coal ash is when the ash is not bound to other materials (loose particulate or sludge form). An example of <b>unencapsulated</b> coal ash is distributing the ash on icy roads in the winter.|$|E

50|$|Even though reusing coal ash {{minimizes}} {{health effects}} in humans, health problems can still occur when coal ash is recycled. Specifically, workers drilling or cutting encapsulated coal ash increase {{their risk of}} inhaling coal ash dust. In addition, when <b>unencapsulated</b> coal ash is scattered on snowy streets in the winter, the loose ash can {{come in contact with}} ditches {{on the side of the}} road. As a result, the toxins from coal ash can “leach” into the water streams polluting above-ground waterways and eventually contaminating underground water supplies (drinking water).

50|$|The {{microscopic}} appearance {{shows an}} <b>unencapsulated,</b> destructive growth, remodeling and invading bone. The tumor is arranged as simple, broad, non-complex papillary projections without large cystic spaces. The spaces are often fluid filled, have extravasated erythrocytes and/or inspissated material. The cells are cuboidal, usually single layered along the papillary structures, showing indistinct cell borders. The nuclei are round and hyperchromatic.|$|E
50|$|The {{tumors are}} <b>unencapsulated</b> and poorly circumscribed, showing a firm, white cut surface. Most tumors are about 3.5 cm, {{but can be}} up to 8 cm.By {{microscopic}} examination, there are haphazardly arranged thick collagen fibers, with a low cellularity and no pleomorphism. There are usually entrapped fat cells, skeletalmuscle, and peripheral nerves. The may be perineural fibrosis. Interestingly, the elastic fibers may be altered, which is why an elastofibroma is considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Due to routine {{use of the}} Hib {{conjugate}} vaccine in the U.S. since 1990, {{the incidence}} of invasive Hib disease has decreased to 1.3/100,000 in children. However, Hib remains {{a major cause of}} lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children in developing countries where the vaccine is not widely used. <b>Unencapsulated</b> H. influenzae strains are unaffected by the Hib vaccine and cause ear infections (otitis media), eye infections (conjunctivitis), and sinusitis in children, and are associated with pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|Although {{papillary}} carcinoma has {{a propensity}} to invade lymphatics, {{it is less}} likely to invade blood vessels. These kinds of tumors are most commonly <b>unencapsulated,</b> and they have a high tendency to metastasize locally to lymph nodes, which may produce cystic structures near the thyroid that are difficult to diagnose because of the paucity of malignant tissue. Furthermore, papillary tumors may metastasize to the lungs and produce a few nodules or the lung fields may exhibit a snowflake appearance throughout.|$|E
50|$|<b>Unencapsulated</b> H. influenzae {{is often}} {{observed}} in the airways of patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Neutrophils are also observed in large numbers in sputum from patients with COPD. The neutrophils phagocytize H. influenzae, thereby activating an oxidative respiratory burst. However instead of killing the bacteria the neutrophils are themselves killed (though such an oxidative burst likely causes DNA damage in the H. influenzae cells). The lack of killing of the H. influenzae appears to explain the persistence of infection in COPD.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{tumors are}} <b>unencapsulated,</b> but are usually well defined or circumscribed. The {{overlying}} surface epithelium is not involved. The tumor shows a dual or biphasic appearance, with glandular or cystic spaces showing inner luminal secretory cells with abundant granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm subtended by basal, myoepithelial cells at the periphery, {{adjacent to the}} basement membrane. The luminal cells will often have decapitation (apocrine) secretions and will also have yellow-brown, ceroid, lipofuscin-like (cerumen) pigment granules. There is no pleomorphic, limited mitoses, and no necrosis.|$|E
5000|$|Members of {{the genus}} Macrococcus are Gram-positive, nonmotile, nonspore-forming cocci that are coagulase {{negative}} and catalase positive. They can be distinguished phenotypically from most staphylococci {{on the basis of}} their cellular morphology (they are 2.5 - 4.0 times larger in diameter compared to Staphylococcus aureus) and their positive cytochrome c oxidase reaction. Species in this genus are resistant to bacitracin and lysozyme and sensitive to furazolidone. The DNA base content is 38-45 mol% G+C. The cell walls lack teichoic acid. They are usually <b>unencapsulated.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Infiltrative, highly {{cellular}} spindled cell neoplasm that {{is poorly}} circumscribed and <b>unencapsulated.</b> Bone destruction or invasion is common. The cells show medium to long fascicles, with a herringbone pattern. The cells are remarkably uniform with elongated nuclei. There are delicate strands of intercellular collagen without ropy or dense deposition. There {{is a very}} characteristic concurrent surface-type respiratory epithelial proliferation invaginated from the surface or in small cystic spaces within proliferation, often forming glands. The background may have a rich vascularity and usually has {{a small number of}} scattered lymphocytes. Mitoses are rare, while necrosis, ulceration and hemorrhage are usually absent.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of surgery, the tumor tends to peel away from the {{adjacent}} bones, although not the ossicles. It is usually fragmented, soft, rubbery and white to gray-tan. Due to the anatomic confines of the region, tumors are usually <1 cm.The tumors arise below the surface, are <b>unencapsulated,</b> and have an infiltrative pattern of growth, composed of many different patterns (glandular, trabecular, cords, festoons, single cells). The tumor shows duct-like structures with inner luminal, flattend cells and outer, basal, cuboidal cells. The cells may have an eccentrically placed nucleus. The nuclear chromatin distribution is [...] "salt-and-pepper", giving a delicate, fine appearance. Nucleoli are small with inconspicuous mitoses. There may be secretions in the gland tumor. It is possible to see a concurrent cholesteatoma.|$|E
50|$|Nanoscale metal {{catalysts}} {{are important}} ingredients for fixed- and fluidized-bed CVD synthesis of CNTs. They allow increasing the growth efficiency of CNTs and may give {{control over their}} structure and chirality. During synthesis, catalysts can convert carbon precursors into tubular carbon structures but can also form encapsulating carbon overcoats. Together with metal oxide supports they may therefore attach to or become incorporated into the CNT product. The presence of metal impurities can be problematic for many applications. Especially catalyst metals like nickel, cobalt or yttrium may be of toxicological concern. While <b>unencapsulated</b> catalyst metals may be readily removable by acid washing, encapsulated ones require oxidative treatment for opening their carbon shell. The effective removal of catalysts, especially of encapsulated ones, while preserving the CNT structure is a challenge and has been addressed in many studies. A new approach to break carbonaceaous catalyst encapsulations is based on rapid thermal annealing.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{diagnosis}} is not clear based on physical exam and growth history (most often in deep hemangiomas with little cutaneous involvement), then either imaging or histopathology can help confirm {{the diagnosis}}. [...] On Doppler ultrasound an IH in the proliferative phase appears as a high flow soft-tissue mass usually without direct arteriovenous shunting. On MRI, IH show a well-circumscribed lesion with intermediate and increased signal intensity on T1 and T2-weighted sequences, respectively, and strong enhancement after gadolinium injections. There are fast flow vessels. [...] Tissue for diagnosis can be obtained via fine needle aspiration, skin biopsy, or excisional biopsy. [...] Under the microscope, hemangiomas are <b>unencapsulated</b> aggregates of closely packed, thin-walled capillaries, usually with endothelial lining. Blood-filled vessels are separated by scant connective tissue. Their lumens may be thrombosed and organized. Hemosiderin pigment deposition due to vessel rupture may be observed.

50|$|Anthrax {{vaccines}} {{were developed}} in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and available for use in humans by 1940. A live attenuated, <b>unencapsulated</b> spore vaccine became widely used for humans. It was given either by scarification or subcutaneously and its developers claimed that it was reasonably well tolerated and showed some degree of protective efficacy against cutaneous anthrax in clinical field trials. The efficacy of the live Russian vaccine {{was reported to have}} been greater than that of either of the killed British or US anthrax vaccines (AVP and AVA, respectively) during the 1970s and '80s. Today both Russia and China use live attenuated strains for their human vaccines. These vaccines may be given by aerosol, scarification, or subcutaneous injection. A Georgian/Russian live anthrax spore vaccine (called STI) was based on spores from the Sterne strain of B. anthracis. It was given in a two-dose schedule, but serious side-effects restricted its use to healthy adults. It was reportedly manufactured at the George Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology in Tbilisi, Georgia, until 1991.|$|E
50|$|Thaumatin {{production}} is induced in katemfe {{in response to}} an attack upon the plant by viroid pathogens. Several members of the thaumatin protein family display significant in vitro inhibition of hyphal growth and sporulation by various fungi. The thaumatin protein is considered a prototype for a pathogen-response protein domain. This thaumatin domain has been found in species as diverse as rice and Caenorhabditis elegans.Thaumatins are pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are induced by various agents ranging from ethylene to pathogens, and are structurally diverse and ubiquitous in plants: They include thaumatin, osmotin, tobacco major and minor PR proteins, alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor, and P21 and PWIR2 soybean and wheat leaf proteins. The proteins are involved in systematicallyacquired resistance and stress response in plants, although their precise role is unknown. Thaumatin is an intensely sweet-tasting protein (on a molar basis about 100,000 times as sweet as sucrose) found in the West African shrub Thaumatococcus daniellii: it is induced by attack by viroids, which are single-stranded <b>unencapsulated</b> RNA molecules that do not code for protein.

40|$|Many {{bacterial}} species coexist in {{the same}} niche as heterogeneous clones with different phenotypes; however, understanding of infectious diseases by polyphenotypic bacteria is still limited. In the present study, encapsulation in isolates of the porcine pathogen Streptococcus suis from persistent endocarditis lesions was examined. Coexistence of both encapsulated and <b>unencapsulated</b> S. suis isolates was found in 26 out of 59 endocarditis samples. The isolates were serotype 2, and belonged to two different sequence types (STs), ST 1 and ST 28. The genomes {{of each of the}} 26 pairs of encapsulated and <b>unencapsulated</b> isolates from the 26 samples were sequenced. The data showed that each pair of isolates had one or more unique nonsynonymous mutations in the cps gene, and the encapsulated and <b>unencapsulated</b> isolates from the same samples were closest to each other. Pairwise comparisons of the sequences of cps genes in 7 pairs of encapsulated and <b>unencapsulated</b> isolates identified insertion/deletions (indels) ranging from one to 10 [4] bp in different cps genes of <b>unencapsulated</b> isolates. Capsule expression was restored in a subset of <b>unencapsulated</b> isolates by complementation in trans with cps expression vectors. Examination of gene content common to isolates indicated that mutation frequency was higher in ST 28 pairs than in ST 1 pairs. Genes within mobile genetic elements were mutation hot spots among ST 28 isolates. Taken all together, our results demonstrate the coexistence of dual phenotype (encapsulated and <b>unencapsulated)</b> bacterial clones and suggest that the dual phenotypes arose independently in each farm by means of spontaneous mutations in cps genes...|$|E
