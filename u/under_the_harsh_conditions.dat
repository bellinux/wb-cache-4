50|$|Practical {{underwater}} adhesion is {{an engineering}} challenge since current technology {{is unable to}} stick surface strongly underwater because of barriers such as hydration layers and contaminants on surfaces. However, marine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>harsh</b> <b>conditions</b> of the ocean. They use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes, and one-component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols.|$|E
50|$|Although Germany used forced labourers in most {{occupied}} countries, Poles {{and other}} Slavs {{were viewed as}} inferior by Nazi propaganda, thus, better suited for such duties. Between 1 and 2.5 million Polish citizens were transported to the Reich for forced labour, against their will. All Polish males were required to perform forced labour. While ethnic Poles were subject to selective persecution, all ethnic Jews were targeted by the Reich. In the winter of 1939-40, about 100,000 Jews were thus deported to Poland. They were initially gathered into massive urban ghettos, such as 380,000 held in the Warsaw Ghetto, where large numbers died of starvation and diseases <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>harsh</b> <b>conditions</b> therein, including 43,000 in the Warsaw Ghetto alone.

40|$|A great {{challenge}} in wastewater bioremediation is the sustained activity of viable microorganisms, which {{can contribute to}} the breakdown of waste contaminants, especially in alkaline pH conditions. Identification of extremophiles with bioremediation capability can improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment. Here, we report the discovery of an electrochemically active alkaliphilic halotolerant bacterium, Anditalea andensis ANESC-ST (=CICC 10485 T=NCCB 100412 T), which is capable of generating bioelectricity in alkaline-saline conditions. A. andensis ANESC-ST was shown to grow in alkaline conditions between pH 7. 0 - 11. 0 and also under high salt condition (up to 4 wt% NaCl). Electrical output was further demonstrated in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with an average current density of ~ 0. 5 µA/cm 2, even <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>harsh</b> <b>condition</b> of 4 wt% NaCl and pH 9. 0. Subsequent introduction of secreted extracellular metabolites into MFCs inoculated with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded enhanced electrical output.

40|$|Analyses of {{a series}} of allelic chlorina mutants of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which have partial blocks in {{chlorophyll}} (Chl) synthesis and, therefore, a limited Chl supply, reinforce the principle that Chl is required for the stable accumulation of Chl-binding proteins and that only reaction centers accumulate when the supply of Chl is severely limited. Depending on the rate of Chl accumulation (determined by the severity of the mutation) and on the rate of turnover of Chl and its precursors (determined by the environment in which the plant is grown), the mutants each reach an equilibrium of Chl synthesis and degradation. Together these mutants generate a spectrum of phenotypes. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>harshest</b> <b>conditions</b> (high illumination), plants with moderate blocks in Chl synthesis have membranes with very little Chl and Chl-proteins and membrane stacks resembling the thylakoids of the lethal xantha mutants of barely grown at low to medium light intensities (which have more severe blocks). In contrast, when grown <b>under</b> low-light conditions <b>the</b> same plants with moderate blocks have thylakoids resembling those of the wild type.

40|$|A simple {{selective}} {{supercritical fluid}} extraction (SFE) method {{was developed for}} the determination of desorption behaviour of PCBs in sediments. This method was applied to determine the distribution of individual PCB congeners among sites of differing bonding strengths in two Swedish sediments (Lake Järnsjön and Baltic bay Orserumsviken). Four different PCB fractions were distinguished in each sediment by applying consecutively harsher supercritical fluid extraction conditions on the same sample. Even though the two sediments had completely different textures, they showed very similar extraction behaviour. It was shown that, in both sediments, {{a major part of}} the PCBs (58 % and 65 %, respectively) were located at "fast sites", from which they were extractable already with the mildest extraction conditions (60 min, 40 degrees C and 120 bar). Only a small fraction of the PCBs were so tightly bound to the sediments (located at "slow sites"), that they could be extracted only <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>harshest</b> <b>conditions</b> (60 min, 150 degrees C and 400 bar).
