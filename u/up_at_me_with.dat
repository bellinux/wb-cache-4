60|$|JAYSON--[Lamely.] I started to. He simply flared <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> insane rage.|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} a very {{diminutive}} palm and looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a beaming smile.|$|E
60|$|I set {{more food}} before the famished child and kissed her. She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{wondering}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|He turned with an oath, and {{followed}} his brother into the wood. Naomi's bright eyes looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> flashing <b>with</b> indignation.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{could ask}} him what he meant, he looked <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> deep sadness on his usually nonchalant face.|$|R
60|$|But the fan dropped: {{her arms}} lay limp in her lap; {{and she was}} staring <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> piteously, <b>with</b> a world of self-reproach in her {{beautiful}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Bes {{squatted down}} upon the floor and looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a strange smile on his ugly face.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{a little}} smile. I think {{she must have}} {{forgotten}} {{the pain in her}} foot.|$|E
60|$|I came {{slowly back}} to the table, and stood facing her across it. She looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> very piteous eyes.|$|E
6000|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> eagerly <b>with</b> {{a sudden}} look of hushed inquiry. [...] "You mean it?" [...] she asked, {{trembling}} visibly. [...] "You mean it, Mr. Tristram? You {{know what you}} are saying?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>with</b> {{her eyes}} she said, [...] "How could I help knowing?" [...] She might have {{intended}} {{to say something}} with her lips, but I took my answer from her eyes, and with the quick impulse of a lover I stopped her speech.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Have {{you nothing}} better than that to sell?' I says, not quite sure that she wasn't all a humbug, {{like so many of}} 'em. She seemed to see that, and looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again <b>with</b> such {{innocent}} eyes, I couldn't doubt her when she said, shivering with something beside the cold,-- ...|$|R
60|$|A faint blush {{came over}} her cheeks, {{and a smile}} broke out on her lips; she looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a pretty reproachful air.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes--And {{what does}} she say--Eliza? We know her name's Eliza, that's another thing.' She grimaced a little, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a mocking laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, not farewell," [...] {{she whispered}} back, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> {{eyes that were}} full of tears, though what she meant I did not know.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the woman}} came forward again, her head rather ducked. But she looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and smiled, <b>with</b> that odd, {{immediate}} intimacy, something witch-like and impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it relates}} to Miss Minna, or to her mother," [...] I suggested. Fritz {{turned back to the}} first page and looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> red <b>with</b> anger. [...] "More abominable slanders! More lies about Minna's mother!" [...] he burst out. [...] "Come here, David. Look <b>at</b> it <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> What do you say? Is it the writing of a woman or a man?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{suggested}} some places; {{indeed he}} seemed to have come provided with a list of them, and I sat silent making no comment. At length he finished and squatted there before me, chewing a bit of tobacco I had given him, and looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> interrogatively <b>with</b> his head on one side, {{for all the world like}} a dilapidated and inquisitive bird.|$|R
60|$|She had {{finished}} buttoning her gloves, and looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a queer little {{smile at the}} corner of her lips and her hands behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes.--And {{what does}} she say--Eliza? We know her name's Eliza, that's another thing." [...] She grimaced a little, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a mocking laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, Philip Morton," [...] she said, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a grave smile. [...] "I am {{very glad}} that you came in here to talk to me. I was so dull." ...|$|E
60|$|I drove slowly home, {{and little}} Pat lay very quiet, looking <b>up</b> {{steadily}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> his twinkling blue eyes. For a time, everything went very well, but happening to look up, I {{saw in the}} distance a carriage approaching. It was an open barouche, and I knew it belonged to a family of our acquaintance, in the village, and that it usually contained ladies.|$|R
60|$|As I re-entered {{the cave}} with my burden Nuflo sat <b>up</b> and stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a frightened {{look in his}} eyes. Throwing my cloak down, I placed the girl on it and briefly related what had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what do yu want? Proper little gem, ain't yu!" [...] And {{suddenly}} looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{he added}} <b>with</b> {{a sort of}} bashful glee: [...] "My old people'll go fair mad when they see me--go fair mad they will." [...] He seemed {{to dwell on the}} thought, and I saw the wife give him a long soft smiling look. He added suddenly: ...|$|R
6000|$|The clerk looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> an {{expression}} of disgust. [...] "I bought it for a book of travel," [...] said he, [...] "but {{it is only a}} novel. Want it? I'll sell it cheap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{shall we}} start?" [...] I ask presently, as we return, rather like bashful yokels, to the library, {{and the old}} gentleman reading the Arabian Nights in the {{armchair}} in the corner glances <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a sudden curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|Hilda Wade looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a {{sympathetic}} glance. [...] "We will pull her through yet," [...] she murmured, in her soft voice, [...] "if care and skill can do it,--MY care and YOUR skill. This is now OUR patient, Dr. Cumberledge." ...|$|E
60|$|The shawl she {{had been}} wearing was thrown across her shoulders, and her head was bare, and her black hair, soft and short and ecstatic, tumbled wildly into loose light curls. She thrust the stalks of the berries under her combs. Her hair was not heavy or {{long enough to have}} held them. Then, with the ruby bunches glowing through the black mist of curls, she looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> brightly, <b>with</b> wide eyes. I looked at her, and felt the smile winning into her eyes. Then I turned and dragged a trail of golden-leaved {{convolvulus}} from the hedge, and I twisted it into a coronet for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Begone you cursed beast!" [...] and I {{jumped to}} save myself; {{but he was}} furiously quick, and chased <b>me</b> <b>up,</b> {{striking}} furiously <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> his cane, I dodging this way and that, in terror, and at last a strong blow fell upon my left foreleg, which made me shriek and fall, for the moment, helpless; the cane went up for another blow, but never descended, for the nurse's voice rang wildly out, [...] "The nursery's on fire!" [...] and the master rushed away in that direction, and my other bones were saved.|$|R
60|$|Robert has let his {{moustache}} {{and beard}} grow together, and looks very picturesque. I thought I should {{not like the}} moustache, but I do. He is in very good looks altogether, though, in spite of remonstrances, he has given up walking before breakfast, and doesn't walk at any time half enough. I was in fault chiefly, because he both sate <b>up</b> <b>at</b> night <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and kept by me when I was generally ill in the mornings. So I oughtn't to grumble--but I do.... Love to dear M. Milsand. We are in increasing spirits on Italian affairs.|$|R
60|$|We {{had walked}} on, {{for nearly a}} mile I should say before Rachel roused herself. She {{suddenly}} looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a faint reflection of her smile of happier times--the most irresistible smile I have ever seen on a woman's face.|$|E
60|$|Matthew was {{regarding}} her indulgently, sympathetically, Moreton rather scornfully. The myth {{had been}} exploded for both, but Matthew still hugged it. That {{was the difference}} between them. Maude, seated on the floor, perceived me first, and glanced <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a smile.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> eyes {{clear and}} transcendent as the heavens. But she was {{slightly}} roused. There was the slight {{motion of the}} eagle in her turning to look at me, a faint gleam of rapt light in her eyes. It was my unaccustomed Italian.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure we ARE two of {{the happiest}} people,' {{returned}} Traddles. 'I admit that, at all events. Bless my soul, when I see her getting up by candle-light on these dark mornings, busying herself in the day's arrangements, going out to market before the clerks come into the Inn, caring for no weather, devising the most capital little dinners out of the plainest materials, making puddings and pies, keeping everything in its right place, always so neat and ornamental herself, sitting <b>up</b> <b>at</b> night <b>with</b> <b>me</b> if it's ever so late, sweet-tempered and encouraging always, and all for me, I positively sometimes can't believe it, Copperfield!' ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{was lying}} in a heap upon his rough bed as I entered, but, {{uncoiling}} his long limbs, he started <b>up</b> and stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> an insolent look of defiance on his face which augured badly for our interview. He had a pale, set face, with sandy hair and a steely-blue eye, with something feline in its expression. His frame was tall and muscular, {{though there was a}} curious bend in his shoulders, which almost amounted to a deformity. An ordinary observer meeting him in the street might have put him down as a well-developed man, fairly handsome, and of studious habits--even in the hideous uniform of the rottenest convict establishment he imparted a certain refinement to his carriage which marked him out among the inferior ruffians around him.|$|R
6000|$|... 8th.--Yesterday I felt blue--blue and bored; {{and when}} I got {{up this morning}} I had half a mind to leave Florence. But I {{went out into the}} street, beside the Arno, and looked <b>up</b> and down--looked <b>at</b> the yellow river and the violet hills, and then decided to remain--or rather, I decided nothing. I simply stood gazing at the beauty of Florence, and before I had gazed my fill I was in good-humour again, and {{it was too late to}} start for Rome. I strolled along the quay, where {{something}} presently happened that rewarded me for staying. I stopped in front of a little jeweller's shop, where a great many objects in mosaic were exposed in the window; I stood there for some minutes--I don't know why, for I have no taste for mosaic. In a moment a little girl came and stood beside me--a little girl with a frowsy Italian head, carrying a basket. I turned away, but, as I turned, my eyes happened to fall on her basket. It was covered with a napkin, and on the napkin was pinned a piece of paper, inscribed with an address. This address caught my glance--there was a name on it I knew. It was very legibly written--evidently by a scribe who had made up in zeal what was lacking in skill. Contessa Salvi-Scarabelli, Via Ghibellina--so ran the superscription; I looked at it for some moments; it caused me a sudden emotion. Presently the little girl, becoming aware of my attention, glanced <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> wondering, <b>with</b> a pair of timid brown eyes.|$|R
