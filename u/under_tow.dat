40|$|The ground ropes {{function}} {{is to keep the}} net in contact with the sea bottom, and herd fishes to the entrance of the bag net. In the case of thinking about selective fishing with a drag net, it is necessary to clarify the shape and herding function of the ground rope. But there are very few reports about it. In this paper, the author considered forces acting on the ground rope <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> conditions, and decided the shape of it analytically. The author designed a fish herding model the ground rope based on the theoretical probability of fiches entering the funnel of a net. Based on these results, the author investigated the shape and gear efficiency of the ground rope. Finally the author intended to obtain rational instructions for designing of ground rope. (1) The construction and weight distribution of three types of ground rope: Danish Seine, Bull Trawl and Trawl, (typical drag nets operated in Japan), were compared. Weight distribution of both Danich Seine and Trawl are uniform. But the mean weight of the later is much heavier than that of the former. It the case of comparison of Trawl and Bull Trawl, the former is long and increases its weight towards the middle. The latter is short and very heavy and shows little difference in its weight distribution. The difference in fishing methods are clearly influenced {{in the construction of the}} two types ground rope. (2) Three forces: hydraulic resistance of netting concentrated at the lacign line, hydraulic resistance of ground rope, and sliding frictional force between sea bottom are acting on the ground rope <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> conditions. At equilibrium those forces made a fixed ground rope shape. The author assumed the ground rope as a connection of segments, and considered an equlibrium among three components acting on them: horizontal, vertical and tangential components. In general it is impossible to express the vertical and horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope as a simple function. Assuming that the horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope is constant at any part, the length and end distances are known ahead of time, the shape of the ground rope was expressed graphically based on the distribution of vertical components of it which were obtained experimentaly. (3) The vertical component acting on each segment of the ground rope <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> conditions was expressed as the sum of hydraulic resistance, sliding frictional force and sand drag. Drag of clyinder type of bobbins at different lengths and that of sphere type of bobbins in various directions were measured both on wet concrete and in a sand tank with water. The drag of two types bobbin on a rocky bottom (F_D) had no directional qualities, and may be expressed as the product of weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μ_ 90); F_D=μ_ 90 W_B. The drag coefficient of cylinder type of bobbins and sphere type of bobbins were 0. 75 and 0. 68 respectively. The drag of cylinder type of bobbins in towed on a sandy bottom is dependent upon the on attack angle (90 °-θ), and may be expressed the product of the weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μθ) as follows; F_D=μθW_B. The drag coefficient is a function of θ　and is expressed as follows; μθ= 0. 68 (0. 72 sin^[1. 5]θ+cos^[1. 5]θ). In the case of a sphere, the drag coefficient was denoted a constant value of 0. 68. Hydraulic resistance of model ground rope composed of clyinder type of bobbins was measured in a circulating tank. Hydraulic drag coefficient (C_D) showed a constant value of about 0. 45. (4) Three types of model ground rope differing in weight distribution were made. These were examined both on wet concrete and sandy sea bottom under various conditions for the purpose of measuring shape and resistance. Close agreement was shown between experimental values of the shape and resistance of them, and those of calculated values obtained by analytically using the drag coeffieients mentioned above. When the distribution of forces acting on ground rope uder towing condition are known, the shape of it can be decided using the method proposed in this study. On the other hand the weight distribution of ground rope for making a certain ground rope shape can be decided using the method proposed in this study. (5) The author paid attention to fish reaction to the ground rope and considered a fish herding model for the ground rope. Theoretical probability of fishes entering the funnel of the bag net was calculated, and six theoretical types of ground rope: triangle, trapezoid, half ellipse, arc, parabola and catenary were compared. The fishing efficiency of trapezoid, parabola, half ellipse and catenary showed almost same values <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> condition based on the fish herding model for flat fish. The wing tips distance at maximum fishing efficiency was wider than usual towing conditions. Higher fishing efficiency would be expected <b>under</b> that <b>towing</b> condition. Fishing efficiency of two types of ground rope, middle-weighted Bull Trawl type and heavy-weighted Trawl type, were compared by towing on a sandy sea bottom using the fish herding model proposed in this study. Fishing efficiency of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. This corelates well with the results of field experiments. (6) The ratio of resistance of ground rope to the total resistance of drag net was about 30 - 35 % <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> condition. It is imposible to change a ground rope shape <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> condition by means of variation on the weight distribution of the ground rope. In the case of thinking on the ground rope shape, it is necessary to consider the hydraulic resistance of netting which were concentrated to the lacing lines and acting on the ground rope. The trapezoid shape glound rope was showed the fishing efficiency using the fish herding model proposed in this study. About 30 - 35 % of resistance of drag net should act on the points both edge of bosom of ground rope to make a trapezoid-shape ground rope. It is one method to concentrate whole drag acting on ground rope and hydraullic resistance of netting there as a results of many considerations on weight distribution of ground rope and the design of lacing lines...|$|R

Despite {{attempts}} to get Montanan <b>under</b> <b>tow,</b> she foundered later in the morning. Meanwhile, Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation. After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded, Hawkins advised Burrows captain that the situation was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship, crew, and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside. Consequently, Burrows departed for Brest, France, leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the towing speed observable when the shouldering-points of the <b>towing</b> rope was <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> was made {{by means of the}} radar, set on board the factory ship of the Fish meal fleet operated on the Bering Sea in 1965; the following results obtained : 1) The speed of the shouldering-rope-towing in the earlier stage (V) varies from 1. 8 knot to 3. 4 knot, the average being 2. 4 knot, while the one in the later stage (V’) varies from 1. 1 to 1. 8 knot, the average being 1. 3 knot. Hence, it may be that as the towing time elapses the speed decreases gradually. 2) The speed ratio (V’/V) becomes less as the catch increases, and when the catch gets above 5 tons, the ratio observed varies from 0. 3 to 0. 5. 3) The stronger becomes the Horse Power of the main engine of the trawler, the higher are (V) and(V’/V) therefore it may be concluded that there is some relationship between the speed of the shouldering-rope-towing and the catch. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Towing {{dynamics}} is {{investigated by}} means of a simplified mathematical model that approximates the tug as a point particle with prescribed motion, while the tow is modelled as a 4 -DOF (surge/sway/yaw/roll) nonlinear dynamical system. Manoeuvring forces and moments are calculated via a model capable of dealing with high drift angles; aerodynamic effects are also taken into account and the connection between the tug and the tow is simulated {{by means of}} a single elastic towline. A numerical bifurcation analysis is carried out to determine the equilibria of the system when a relevant parameter (such as wind direction/speed) is modified. Time-domain simulations are performed wherever necessary. An example application is proposed, in which the behaviour of two vessels <b>under</b> <b>towing</b> is examined. It is shown that multiple stable/unstable towing equilibria may exist and that the response of the system is deeply affected by the wind direction and speed; in the absence of stable equilibrium solutions, a potentially dangerous fishtailing phenomenon takes place, sometimes leading to evident roll oscillations and large snap-loads in the towing line. Two different towing speeds are examined, in order to analyse how such an important operational parameter can affect the equilibria of the system and their stability...|$|R
