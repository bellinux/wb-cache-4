This includes the common Shiba Inu coloring pattern known as Urajiro. The Japanese Akitas, as per the breed standards, are restricted to red, fawn, sesame, brindle, pure white, all with [...] "Urajiro" [...] markings i.e., whitish coat {{on the sides of}} the muzzle, on the cheeks, on the underside of jaw, neck, chest, body and tail and on the inside of the legs.|$|E
2500|$|The AKC breed {{standard}} {{states that the}} correct coat color is either a black saddle, with a tan head, ears and legs; or a dark grizzle saddle (black mixed with gray and white).

[...] There are, however, examples of non-standard black-coated and [...] "red" [...] (tan) coated Airedales, (the solid colored Airedales are NOT able to be AKC registered, since they are deviations from {{breed standard}} and have yet to be proven 'purebred' Airedale Terriers.) There are also the short coated [...] "Redline" [...] type Airedales, they appear to be genetic throwbacks in looks to the Airedale's early days when the breed's coats were much shorter than today's Airedale. Even with their shorter coat they still have the same hard wiry outer coat with a soft <b>under</b> <b>coat</b> and fall well within the criteria of the breed standard and therefore can be AKC registered and most are registered.|$|E

Currently the assessment of localised corrosion <b>under</b> <b>coating</b> defects is a major technical challenge. The application of corrosion probes to monitor corrosion <b>under</b> disbonded <b>coating</b> also remains a difficulty. This paper presents a new corrosion sensor concept capable of electrochemically measuring corrosion rates under disbonded coatings on cathodically protected structures such as energy pipelines. Examples of its capabilities are illustrated with experimental data obtained in low conductivity aqueous solutions...|$|R

You have all seen his house in the Smiling Pool. He builds it {{in much the same way}} that Paddy builds his, but instead of sticks he cuts and uses rushes. Of course it is not nearly as large as Paddy's house, because Jerry is himself so much smaller. It is arranged much the same, with a comfortable bedroom and one or more passages down to deep water. In winter Jerry spends much of his time in this house, going out only for food. Then he lives chiefly on lily roots and roots of other water plants, digging them up and taking them back to his house to eat. When the ice is clear you can sometimes see him swimming below." ...|$|E
60|$|Dragging my bags I hurried {{toward the}} fire. Nielsen was {{building}} a barricade of rocks to block the flying sparks. Suddenly I espied Romer. He sat on a log close to the blaze. His position struck me as singular, so I dropped my burdens and went to him. He had on a heavy coat over sweater and <b>under</b> <b>coat,</b> which made him resemble a little old man. His sombrero was slouched down sidewise, his gloved hands were folded across his knees, his body sagged a little to one side, his head drooped. He was asleep. I got around so I could see {{his face in the}} firelight. Pale, weary, a little sad, very youthful and yet determined! A bloody bruise showed over his temple. He had said he would ride all the way to Mormon Lake and he had done it. Never, never will that picture fade from my memory! Dear, brave, wild, little lad! He had made for me a magnificent success of this fruitless hunting trip. I hoped and prayed then that when he grew to man's estate, and faced the long rides down the hard roads of life, he would meet them and achieve them as he had the weary thirty-five Arizona miles from Long Valley to Mormon Lake.|$|E

Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, [...] "inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body." [...] The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement.

A new technology of surface coating process {{was introduced to}} increase the hardness of the edge of coating blade and thus to prolong its service life. Surface coating preparing process on blade was studied and metal-ceramic compound coating prepared successfully {{on the edge of}} coating blade with AT 13 (Al 2 O 3 + 13 %TiO 2) wear resistant material by plasma spraying process. NiCrAl alloy powder was used as <b>under</b> <b>coat</b> material. Microstructure of the coating is dense. The coating bonds well with the matrix and have high hardness. Results of grain-abrasion testing show that wear-resisting property of the metal/ceramic compound coating is about 7 - 8 times as that of steel blade...|$|E
