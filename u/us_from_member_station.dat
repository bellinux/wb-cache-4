As globally connected as the Internet is the technology necessary for participation is inherently local, primarily available at work, school and increasing from home.

50|$|Day to Day (D2D) was {{a one-hour}} weekday American radio newsmagazine {{distributed}} by National Public Radio (NPR), and produced by NPR {{in collaboration with}} Slate.

D2D premiered on Monday, July 28, 2003, and fed to stations from noon ET with updates through 4:00 p.m. ET. It was the fastest growing program in NPR's history.|$|R
50|$|The channel {{originally}} {{aired on}} Channel 12 of Charter Communications Madison cable system (where it was commonly known by City Channel 12 or CitiCable 12). On September 30, 2008, the channel moved to Channel 98 on Charter's basic analog tier and Channel 994 on the digital tier. An aborted relocation plan in August 2008 {{would have seen}} the channel move to the digital-only tier, a move allowed by a provision in the Video Competition Act that was passed by Wisconsin's legislature in 2007; the move faced objections <b>from</b> the <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> of the Wisconsin Association of Public, educational, and government access (PEG) channels.|$|R
5000|$|Some or all {{of these}} {{services}} are available on the digital cable tiers of many cable providers, on free-to-air (FTA) television via C-band satellite, as well as via direct broadcast satellite. With the exception of Sprout, some of these services, including those <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> and networks, have not made contracts with Internet-distributed over-the-top MVPD services such as PlayStation Vue and Sling TV. With the transition to over-the-air digital television broadcasts, many of the services are also often now available as standard-definition multicast channels on the digital signals of some <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> while PBS-DT2 serves as a secondary HD feed. With the absence of advertising, network identification on these PBS networks was limited to utilization {{at the end of the}} program, which includes the standard series of bumpers from the [...] "Be More" [...] campaign.|$|R

From the 1980s onward, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe, especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential; in addition, starting with the respective launches of the MountainWest Sports Network (now defunct) and Big Ten Network in 2006 and 2007 and the later launches of the Pac-12 Network and ESPN's SEC Network, athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member university's sports programs for their cable channels, restricting their use <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations,</b> even those associated with their own universities.|$|R

50|$|Speedvision's initial lineup {{featured}} various automotive programs, including various documentary-style series {{focusing on}} prolific vehicles, manufacturers, and racing teams (such as Victory by Design and Legends of Motorsport), series focusing on classic automobiles (such as Dream Car Garage, coverage of Barrett-Jackson's auctions, and My Classic Car, which {{moved to the}} network from TNN), an AutoWeek-branded television series, along with MotorWeek and Autoline Detroit - two programs respectively syndicated <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>stations</b> in Maryland and Detroit. Speedvision also carried coverage of various minor and professional auto racing series, including the Sports Car Club of America's World Challenge series (of which it also acquired title sponsorship of in 1999, becoming the Speedvision World Challenge).|$|R

5000|$|Wisconsin was a {{relative}} latecomer to educational television, despite its earlier {{leading role in}} educational radio. Channel 21's radio sister, WHA-AM, {{is one of the}} oldest educational radio stations in the world. By the time channel 21 signed on, UW had already launched a radio network that evolved into today's Wisconsin Public Radio. However, until the late 1960s, the only other areas of the state outside of Milwaukee and Madison that had a clear signal <b>from</b> an NET/PBS <b>member</b> <b>station</b> were the northwest (from Duluth, Minnesota's WDSE-TV) and the southwest (from the Twin Cities's KTCA-TV).|$|R
500|$|The phrase {{became a}} common witticism used among Soviet citizens; a parable {{involved}} a call-in program on Radio Moscow where {{any question about}} their living conditions was met with the answer: [...] "In America, they lynch Negroes." [...] A U.S. citizen living in the Soviet Union in 1949 was arrested after complaining the government barred him from work; a local paper made fun of his expectation of fair treatment, writing of the U.S. as [...] "the country where they lynch Negroes." [...] In 1949 Soviet author and war poet Konstantin Simonov gave a speech at a Soviet jubilee event honoring poet Alexander Pushkin, where he delineated between the Soviet Union and the Western world by simply using the phrase to refer to English-speakers: [...] "There {{is no need for}} those who hang Negroes to commemorate Pushkin!" [...] Historian Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov wrote in his 1953 book The Reign of Stalin that Soviet media put forth the notion that U.S. citizens [...] "are unanimous in pursuing an anti-colour policy, and that the average American spends his time lynching negroes." [...] Perpetuation of the phrase during the Soviet period engendered negative feelings towards the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>members</b> of the working class.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} SAFER Act, WCWF {{kept its}} analog signal on the air until March 4 to inform viewers of the digital {{television}} transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters. On May 6, 2009, due to the station's {{close proximity to the}} Canada-U.S. border, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) issued a conditional approval of WIWB's construction permit to expand its coverage area by increasing power. The approval was needed in order to work with interference problems resulting <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>station</b> WCMW across Lake Michigan in Manistee, Michigan sharing channel 21 and to address the concerns of interference in local health care facilities' radiological equipment. The increase in power was applied on September 8, 2009 and station officials asked viewers to rescan for the signal.|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of the Franciscan Third Order Secular upon the society of medieval Europe was significant. The prohibition against carrying arms a dealt {{a blow to the}} feudal system and to the ever-fighting factions of Italian municipalities. The admission to the Order of <b>members</b> <b>from</b> all <b>stations</b> in life on an equal basis helped to promote social change and equality of opportunity in a period of rigid social stratification.|$|R
50|$|Despite Allbritton's {{best efforts}} to improve the station, WJXX failed to gain {{significant}} ratings traction in the market; in addition to lingering confusion from the early announcement that WBSG would be the ABC affiliate for Jacksonville and the subsequent early launch of channel 25, the combined signal of WJXX and WBSG was somewhat inferior to that of their two VHF competitors, CBS affiliate WJXT (channel 4, now an independent station) and NBC affiliate WTLV (channel 12). Not helping matters was the fact that WJXX was initially placed on channel 7 by local cable provider MediaOne (which later sold its Jacksonville system franchise to Comcast), which suffered from co-channel interference <b>from</b> PBS <b>member</b> <b>station</b> WJCT, which transmitted its broadcast signal on VHF channel 7. Additionally, until the station's studios opened in December, WJXX relayed its signal to MediaOne directly from its transmitter, resulting in a lower-quality signal as it did not yet have a fiber optic relay to transmit the station feed to the provider.|$|R
