25|$|On May Day, 2007, {{immigrant}} {{rights groups}} held rallies in MacArthur Park {{in support of}} undocumented immigrants. The rallies were permitted and initially the protesters followed {{the terms of the}} permits but some of the protesters began blocking the street and after warnings by the LAPD the protesters in the street didn't disperse and the rally was declared an <b>unlawful</b> <b>assembly.</b> The LAPD only announced the declaration of the <b>unlawful</b> <b>assembly</b> in English leading to confusion by some in the crowd who only spoke Spanish. Police officers held a line to prevent protesters from entering the street and held the line and did not disperse the crowd until rocks, bottles, and other objects began to be thrown at the police. The officers began slowly advancing and fired rubber bullets and used batons to disperse crowd members who refused to comply with police orders to leave the area. Police were heavily criticized for firing rubber bullets at some journalists and hitting some with batons who did not disperse along with the crowds. Seventeen officers and two sergeants of the metropolitan division were recommended for punishment by a department internal review for their actions in the incident.|$|E

Chief Minister Zeliang said that there had been administrative lapses and that relaxing the Section 177 of the CrPC, which prohibits <b>unlawful</b> <b>assembly,</b> in Nagaland was a mistake. He also said that the social media was responsible for inciting the incident. Later, Nagaland government restricted telecom services in the region.

He handled a number of prominent criminal matters, including the Pulau Senang and Sunny Ang murder trials; and the Gold Bars case, in which a Hong Kong seaman was found to have tried to unlawfully import 165 gold bars and 134 gold coins worth S$86,076.70 without a permit. In September 1967 he led the prosecution of 262 members of the Barisan Sosialis political party (dissolved in 1988) for <b>unlawful</b> <b>assembly</b> and disturbing the peace, Singapore's largest criminal trial. He eventually led the Chambers' civil and criminal sections until 2 August 1972, when he was appointed to head the Official Assignee and Public Trustee's Office.

500|$|In 2006, the United States Department of State {{noted that}} {{although}} the ISA had not been used against the Singapore Government's political opponents for some years, [...] "political opposition and criticism remained restricted by the government's authority to define these powers broadly. In the past, occasional government references to speech that it considered 'out-of-bounds' were understood to be implicit threats to invoke the ISA." [...] The Singapore Government itself has regularly raised the need to prevent national security threats from materializing as a justification for preventive detention. However, there have been suggestions that the criminal law is apt for dealing with this matter as well. Crimes of accessory liability such as , conspiracy and <b>unlawful</b> <b>assembly</b> in the Penal Code may apply even if harm has not actualized. Furthermore, restrictions imposed by the Societies Act, {{as well as the}} offences in the Sedition Act, may be viable alternatives to preventive detention.|$|E
500|$|In {{the joint}} {{autobiography}} written with Jack, The Braddocks (1963), Bessie cites the formative experience of police violence on [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] in 1911 as a motivating factor for her CPGB activities. On 12September 1921, again at St George's Plateau, she attended a rally for the city's jobless, organised by the Liverpool Unemployed Workers' Committee. Again there was police intervention; Jack and Mary Bamber {{were charged with}} <b>unlawful</b> <b>assembly</b> and received a token one day's imprisonment. In 1922 Bessie and other party members provided comfort and shelter to Hannington's hunger marchers, as the columns of unemployed passed through Lancashire {{on their way to}} London. Bessie combined her party roles—she was treasurer of the Liverpool branch—with her full-time union post; Jack, meanwhile, was only intermittently in work, as his incendiary reputation meant that employers were reluctant to give him a job. He had been living for some time at the Bambers' home when, in February 1922, the couple were married at Brougham Terrace registry office, {{during the course of a}} working day. After a brief reception they returned to their respective duties—Bessie to her union job and Jack to his volunteer work for the CPGB.|$|E

500|$|Many funeral processions {{were held}} in Ireland and even in a few British cities during the weeks {{following}} the executions, sometimes attracting crowds of thousands. These demonstrations {{of support for the}} three Fenians further outraged British public opinion, and [...] "reinforced the prevailing sentiment that the Irish moral compass was somehow off-center". The executions gave rise to an enormous groundswell of feeling among Irish communities the world over. In New Zealand, for instance, seven men were convicted of <b>unlawful</b> <b>assembly</b> in a high-profile trial following a mock funeral to Hokitika cemetery; two of the seven, a newspaper editor and a priest, pleaded guilty to seditious libel, having published [...] "a succession of very rabid articles about the Queen's Government." [...] The viceregal government declared the holding of a Manchester Martyr funeral procession illegal. Throughout Ireland Masses, even public ones, were said for the three, although Bishop David Moriarty of Kerry prohibited celebration of Mass for them in his diocese. Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam, on the other hand, personally assisted at a High Mass for them, and Cardinal Archbishop Paul Cullen of Dublin, while opposing public celebrations, instructed his priests to pray for the dead Fenians, and to say Mass privately for them.|$|E
