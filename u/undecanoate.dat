25|$|Oral {{testosterone}} {{is provided}} exclusively as testosterone <b>undecanoate.</b> It {{is available in}} Europe and Canada, {{but not in the}} United States. Once absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, testosterone is shunted (at very high blood levels) to the liver where it can cause liver damage (albeit very rarely) and worsens some of the adverse effects of testosterone, like lower HDL (good) cholesterol. In addition, the first pass metabolism of the liver also may result in testosterone levels too low to provide satisfactory masculinization and suppress menses. Because of the short terminal half-life of testosterone, oral testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> must be administered two to four times per day, preferably with food (which improves its absorption).|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the FDA {{approved}} a buccal form of testosterone (Striant). Sublingual testosterone {{can also be}} made by some compounding pharmacies. Cost for Striant is greater than other formulations ($180–210/month). Testosterone is absorbed through the oral mucosa and avoids the 'first pass metabolism' in the liver which is cause {{of many of the}} adverse effect with oral testosterone <b>undecanoate.</b> The lozenges can cause gum irritation, taste changes, and headache but most side effects diminish after two weeks. The lozenge is 'mucoadhesive' and must be applied twice daily.|$|E
25|$|MHC may {{be related}} to mate choice in some human populations, a theory that found support by studies by Ober and colleagues in 1997, as well as by Chaix and colleagues in 2008. However, the latter {{findings}} have been controversial. If it exists, the phenomenon might be mediated by olfaction, as MHC phenotype appears strongly involved in the strength and pleasantness of perceived odour of compounds from sweat. Fatty acid esters—such as methyl <b>undecanoate,</b> methyl decanoate, methyl nonanoate, methyl octanoate, and methyl hexanoate—show strong connection to MHC.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone <b>undecanoate,</b> testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} <b>undecanoate,</b> {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be {{administered}} parenterally, {{but it has}} more irregular prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in enanthate, <b>undecanoate,</b> or cypionate ester form. These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone {{at the site of}} injection; absorption rate (and thus injection schedule) varies among different esters, but medical injections are normally done anywhere between semi-weekly to once every 12 weeks. A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain a more constant level of hormone in the system. Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle, not into the vein, to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream. In addition, because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil, intravenous injection has the potential to cause a dangerous embolism (clot) in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone <b>undecanoate,</b> which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Depot' drug {{formulations}} {{are created}} by mixing a substance with the drug that slows its release and prolongs {{the action of the}} drug. The two primarily used forms in the United States are the testosterone esters testosterone cypionate (Depo-Testosterone) and testosterone enanthate (Delatestryl) which are almost interchangeable. Testosterone enanthate is purported to be slightly better with respect to even testosterone release, but this is probably more of a concern for bodybuilders who use the drugs at higher doses (250–1000mg/week) than the replacement doses used by transgender men (50–100mg/week). These testosterone esters are mixed with different oils, so some individuals may tolerate one better than the other. Testosterone enanthate costs more than testosterone cypionate and is more typically the one prescribed for hypogonadal males in the United States. Testosterone cypionate is more popular in the United States than elsewhere (especially amongst bodybuilders). Other formulations exist but are more difficult to come by in the United States. A formulation of injected testosterone available in Europe and the United States, testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> (Nebido, Aveed) [...] provides significantly improved testosterone delivery with far less variation outside the eugonadal range than other formulations with injections required only four times yearly. However, each quarterly dose requires injection of 4mL of oil which may require multiple simultaneous injections. Testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is also much more expensive as it is still under patent protection. Testosterone propionate is another testosterone ester that is widely available, including in the United States, Canada, and Europe, but it is very short-acting compared to the other testosterone esters and must be administered once every 2 or 3 days, and for this reason, is rarely used.|$|E
2500|$|Testosterone {{has been}} used to {{successfully}} treat undervirilization in some [...] but not all [...] men with PAIS, despite having supraphysiological levels of testosterone to start with. [...] Treatment options include transdermal gels or patches, oral or injectable testosterone <b>undecanoate,</b> other injectable testosterone esters, testosterone pellets, or buccal testosterone systems. [...] Supraphysiological doses may be required to achieve the desired physiological effect, which may be difficult to achieve using non-injectable testosterone preparations. [...] Exogenous testosterone supplementation in unaffected men can produce various unwanted side effects, including prostatic hypertrophy, polycythemia, gynecomastia, hair loss, acne, and the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in the reduction of gonadotropins (i.e., luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) and spermatogenic defect. [...] These effects may not manifest at all in men with AIS, or might only manifest at a much higher concentration of testosterone, depending on the degree of androgen insensitivity. [...] Those undergoing high dose androgen therapy should be monitored for safety and efficacy of treatment, possibly including regular breast [...] and prostate [...] examinations. [...] Some individuals with PAIS have a sufficiently high sperm count to father children; at least one case report has been published that describes fertile men who fit the criteria for grade 2 PAIS (micropenis, penile hypospadias, and gynecomastia). [...] Several publications have indicated that testosterone treatment can correct low sperm counts in men with MAIS. [...] At least one case report has been published that documents the efficacy of treating a low sperm-count with tamoxifen in an individual with PAIS.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} C17β <b>undecanoate</b> ester of dimethandrolone, dimethandrolone <b>undecanoate</b> (DMAU) (CDB-4521), {{a few other}} esters, such as dimethandrolone {{buciclate}} (CDB-4386A) and dimethandrolone dodecylcarbonate (CDB-4730), have also been developed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{testosterone}} {{itself is}} not used orally, testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is approved and used orally. Due to the unique chemical properties afforded by its very long ester chain, testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> partially bypasses first-pass liver metabolism via absorption from the gastrointestinal tract directly into the lymphatic system and then into circulation. Of oral testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> that reaches circulation, 90 to 100% is transported lymphatically. This ester is not hepatotoxic at the dosages used. However, oral testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> has variable pharmacokinetics and must be taken two to {{four times a day}} with food. In addition to testosterone <b>undecanoate,</b> the combination of testosterone with a 5α-reductase inhibitor like dutasteride can render testosterone orally active when it is given in the form of oil-filled capsules. This is via reduction of the first-pass hepatic metabolism of testosterone.|$|E
50|$|The C17β <b>undecanoate</b> ester of dimethandrolone, dimethandrolone <b>undecanoate</b> (DMAU) (CDB-4521), is a prodrug of dimethandrolone that is cleaved by esterases and {{is under}} {{investigation}} {{as a method of}} androgen replacement therapy and as a potential male contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is {{available}} in Europe and Aveed brand testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> was approved {{for use in the}} United States by the FDA in 2014, after three previous rejections due to safety concerns. It is administered at a dosage of 1,000 mg every 12 weeks via intramuscular injection. In addition to parenteral, an oral formulation of testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> (brand name Andriol) is also available in Europe, but must be taken {{two or three times a}} day in combination with food.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> has a {{very long}} {{elimination}} half-life and mean residence time when given as a depot intramuscular injection. The elimination half-life and mean residence time of testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> are 2.5-fold and 4-fold longer than those of testosterone enanthate (the values for testosterone enanthate being 4.5 days and 8.5 days, respectively).|$|E

50|$|Testosterone palmitate is a longer-chain ester of {{testosterone}} compared to testosterone <b>undecanoate.</b> Relative to testosterone <b>undecanoate,</b> testosterone palmitate shows higher oral bioavailability. However, no free testosterone was observed after administration {{of testosterone}} palmitate, {{suggesting that it}} is not hydrolyzed as well. On the other hand, another study found that testosterone palmitate was hydrolyzed in humans.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in Europe, Canada, {{and much}} of the rest of the world, oral {{testosterone}} <b>undecanoate</b> is not available in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> (USAN, BAN) (brand names Aveed, Andriol, Androxon, Cernos Depot, Nebido, Panteston, Restandol, Nebido-R, Reandron 1000, Undestor), or {{testosterone}} undecylate, is an androgen and {{anabolic steroid}} and a testosterone ester. It {{is used in}} androgen replacement therapy primarily {{for the treatment of}} male hypogonadism, and has also been investigated for use as a male contraceptive or as hormone replacement therapy in transgender men. Unlike other testosterone esters, testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is available in both oral and intramuscular formulations.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas the {{terminal}} half-life of unesterified testosterone administered via intramuscular injection is very short at only around 10 minutes, {{the terminal}} half-lives of intramuscular testosterone esters are far longer. Administered {{in the form}} of oil solutions, the terminal half-lives are 0.8 days for testosterone propionate, 4.5 days for testosterone enanthate, 20.9 days (in tea seed oil) and 33.9 days (in caster oil) for testosterone <b>undecanoate,</b> and 29.5 days for testosterone buciclate. Although exact values are not available for intramuscular testosterone cypionate, its pharmacokinetics are said to be the same as those of testosterone enanthate, with [...] "extremely comparable" [...] patterns of testosterone release. Due to their varying and different terminal half-lives, the different intramuscular testosterone esters are administered with differing frequencies. Testosterone propionate is injected two to three times per week, testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate are injected once every two to four weeks, and testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> and testosterone buciclate are injected once every 10 to 14 weeks. Due to its relatively short duration, testosterone propionate is now relatively little used and testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is the preferred testosterone ester for intramuscular use. Testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> and testosterone buciclate can be injected intramuscularly as little as four times per year.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{was first}} {{isolated}} and synthesized in 1935. Shortly thereafter, in 1937, testosterone first became commercially {{available as a}} pharmaceutical drug {{in the form of}} pellets and then in ester form for intramuscular injection as the relatively short-acting testosterone propionate. Methyltestosterone, one of the first synthetic AAS and orally active androgens, was introduced in 1935, but was associated with hepatotoxicity and eventually became largely medically obsolete. In the mid-1950s, the longer-acting testosterone esters testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate were introduced. They largely superseded testosterone propionate and became the major testosterone esters used medically for over half a century. In the 1970s, testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> was introduced for oral use in Europe, although intramuscular testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> had already been in use in China for several years. Intramuscular testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> was not introduced in Europe and the United States until much later (in the early to mid 2000s and 2014, respectively).|$|E
50|$|Dimethandrolone <b>undecanoate</b> (DMAU) (developmental {{code name}} CDB-4521), or dimethandrolone undecylate, {{also known as}} 7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-undecanoate, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a {{derivative}} of 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) that {{was developed by the}} Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and has not been marketed at this time. It is an androgen ester - specifically, the C17β <b>undecanoate</b> ester of dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) - and acts as a prodrug of dimethandrolone in the body. DMAU is or was under development as a potential male contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} half-life of testosterone {{varies depending on}} the route of administration and formulation and {{on whether or not}} it is esterified. Oral testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> (in oil capsules) has a {{terminal half-life}} of 1.6 hours. Because of its very short terminal half-life, oral testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is taken two to four times per day. In contrast to oral testosterone, other forms of testosterone including topical gels and solutions, transdermal patches, and buccal tablets have an extended-release effect and can be administered less frequently, at intervals, depending on the route/formulation, of once a day, twice a day, or once every other day.|$|E
50|$|Estradiol undecylate is an estrane (C18) steroid and the C17β undecylate (or <b>undecanoate)</b> {{fatty acid}} ester of {{estradiol}}. It {{is also known}} as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-undecanoate. A few related estradiol esters include estradiol decanoate, estradiol diundecylate, and estradiol diundecylenate.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} esters of {{nandrolone}} have been marketed and used medically. The {{most commonly used}} esters are nandrolone decanoate {{and to a lesser}} extent nandrolone phenylpropionate. Examples of other nandrolone esters include nandrolone cyclohexylpropionate, nandrolone cypionate, nandrolone hexyloxyphenylpropionate, nandrolone laurate, nandrolone sulfate, and nandrolone <b>undecanoate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The C17β dodecylcarbonate ester of 11β-MNT, 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-dodecylcarbonate (11β-MNTDC) (CDB-4754), is a prodrug of 11β-MNT. Along {{with the}} closely related AAS dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone; CDB-1321) and its ester prodrug dimethandrolone <b>undecanoate</b> (CDB-4521), 11β-MNT and 11β-MNTDC are under {{investigation}} as potential male contraceptives and to treat male hypogonadism.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone cypionate (brand names Depo-Testosterone, many others), or {{testosterone}} cipionate, {{also known}} as testosterone cyclopentylpropionate or testosterone cyclopentanepropionate, is an androgen and anabolic steroid and a testosterone ester.

50|$|Nandrolone <b>undecanoate</b> (brand names Dynabolon, Dynabolin, Psychobolan), or {{nandrolone}} undecylate, {{also known}} as 19-nortestosterone 17β-undecanoate, is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and nandrolone ester that {{was developed in the}} 1960s and was previously marketed in France, Germany, Italy, and Monaco but has since been discontinued and is now no longer known to be available.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone, as esters such as {{testosterone}} <b>undecanoate</b> or testosterone buciclate, {{has been}} studied and promoted as a male contraceptive analogous to estrogen-based contraceptives in women. Otherwise considered an adverse effect of testosterone, reduced spermatogenesis can be further suppressed {{with the addition of}} a progestin such as norethisterone enanthate or levonorgestrel butanoate, improving the contraceptive effect.|$|E
50|$|A single {{intramuscular}} injection of testosterone buciclate {{in an aqueous}} suspension {{has been found to}} produce physiological levels of testosterone within the normal range in hypogonadal men for 3 to 4 months. The elimination half-life and mean residence time (average amount of time a single molecule of drug stays in the body) of testosterone buciclate were found to be 29.5 days and 60.0 days, respectively, whereas those of testosterone enanthate in castor oil were only 4.5 days and 8.5 days. Testosterone buciclate also lasts longer than testosterone <b>undecanoate,</b> which has elimination half-lives and mean residence times of 20.9 days and 34.9 days in tea seed oil and 33.9 days and 36.0 days in castor oil, respectively. In addition, there is a spike in testosterone levels with testosterone enanthate and testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> that is not seen with testosterone buciclate, with which levels stay highly uniform and decrease very gradually and progressively.|$|E
50|$|A {{pharmacokinetic}} study of DMAU in men {{found that only}} 2 to 3% of the drug was hydrolyzed into dimethandrolone when it was administered orally {{in the form of}} powder in capsules. In contrast, hydrolysis of testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> into testosterone is rapid and appears to be complete. The difference in conversion efficiency with DMAU relative to testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is attributed to steric hindrance in DMAU caused by its additional C7α and C11β methyl groups. Although the hydrolysis of DMAU into dimethandrolone was very limited, it was still sufficient to produce dose-dependent biological effects at the dosages assessed, including reversible suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels. A subsequent {{pharmacokinetic study}} found that the conversion of DMAU into dimethandrolone was improved when the drug was delivered orally in castor oil/benzyl benzoate or a self-emulsifying drug delivery system contained in capsules as opposed to powder in capsules.|$|E
50|$|Estradiol undecylate (INN, USAN) (brand name Progynon Depot 100, others), or {{estradiol}} <b>undecanoate,</b> is a synthetic, steroidal {{estrogen and}} an estrogen ester - specifically, the 17β-undecanoate ester of estradiol - which is or has been marketed in Europe, including in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Monaco. It {{acts as a}} prodrug of estradiol, and hence, {{is considered to be}} a natural, bioidentical form of estrogen.|$|E
50|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} {{of testosterone}} {{is very low}} and virtually negligible. The bioavailability of oral testosterone <b>undecanoate</b> is 3 to 7%.
