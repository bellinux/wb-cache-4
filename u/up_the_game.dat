5|$|Defender is an arcade {{video game}} {{developed}} and released by Williams Electronics in February 1981. A horizontally scrolling shoot 'em <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{is set on}} an unnamed planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis' first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Reform was {{demanded by}} such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who decried the {{brutality}} and foul {{play of the}} game, and called a meeting of school presidents to discuss the issue. As a result, before the next season began, new rules {{were put in place}} to discourage such play. The forward pass was also introduced to open <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations. Despite the planned changes, a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year, including Columbia, NYU, and Northwestern.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{was born}} on April 19, 1980 in Recife, Brazil, the second son of Canadian Mennonite missionaries Ron and Edith Regehr. Regehr only lived in Brazil {{for the first nine}} months of his life. From three to seven years old he lived in Indonesia, where his younger brother, Richie was born. He also has an older brother and a sister. The family finally settled back in Canada, at Rosthern, Saskatchewan around the time he turned seven. Regehr quickly picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> of hockey, but was held back in his first year of minor hockey as he was {{starting}} the game three years behind other kids his age. He helped his father operate the natural surface ice rink in Rosthern, often spending hours manually preparing the ice.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> once again.|$|E
5|$|The Longhorns {{scored a}} field goal on their firstpossession and Texas Tech {{answered}} with a touchdown pass by Cody Hodges. Texas regained the lead when Henry Melton rushed for a touchdown. In the secondquarter, the Red Raiders tied <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with {{a field goal}} before Texas regained the lead with twotouchdown runs by Selvin Young and a touchdown pass to Billy Pittman. In the thirdquarter, the Longhorns extended their lead with twotouchdowns to one by Texas Tech. Texas' seventhtouchdown came with 6:30 {{left in the game}} and it was the last points scored in the game.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on {{professional}} wrestling games, but more closely resembles a beat-'em <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>game</b> can be played in two modes: a tournament style single-player game or a grudge match where two players can interact. The matches take place in ten different detailed 3D locations from Springfield, such as the Simpsons' house, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, the Kwik-E-Mart, and Moe's Tavern. Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects enough of them, they can taunt and temporarily become invincible. A round ends when one wrestler pins their opponent for a three count. Two rounds are needed to win a match.|$|E

5|$|Against the Panthers, the Bears' defense forced three {{turnovers}} in {{the first}} half, which included a 51-yard interception return for touchdown by Jon Bostic, followed by Zack Bowman intercepting Derek Anderson and Sherrick McManis forcing Kenjon Barner to fumble; the Bears recorded {{a total of four}} takeaways in the game. However, the offense allowed seven sacks and had three turnovers, one of which was a fumble by Armando Allen. Panthers cornerback Josh Norman had two interceptions, one of which set up the first score of the game via Cam Newton's three-yard touchdown pass to Brandon LaFell early in the game. Bostic's pick-six tied <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> followed by Robbie Gould's 35-yard field goal in the second quarter. With 18 seconds left {{in the first}} half, Carolina scored again on Kenjon Barner's 5-yard touchdown run; the Panthers scored the lone points of the third quarter after Norman intercepted Matt Blanchard, scoring on the 60-yard return. Though the Bears retaliated after Blanchard threw a 58-yard pass to Marquess Wilson to Carolina's 4-yard line, followed by Michael Ford's touchdown run, Graham Gano's 50-yard field goal was the final score of the game, as the Panthers triumphed 24–17.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E

5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>game</b> features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians opened <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home {{run of the}} season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then {{stepped up to the plate}} and hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6–1.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ranged {{weapons are}} based on real {{firearms}} {{with the exception of}} a Yithian directed-energy weapon introduced at the end of the game. The player character can also perform a melee attack with a crowbar or with a gun if all ammunition for it has been used <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>game</b> features a realistic combat system: due to lack of HUD, the player has to count shots manually to know when the gun goes empty. There is also no artificial on-screen targeting reticle; instead, the player must aim through the iron sights on the weapons themselves, but sustained aiming tires the character and drops accuracy. The shooting system is unique in that fired rounds go exactly where the gun's barrel is pointing. For example, if the player character readies a reloaded weapon and the player pulls the trigger before the character animation has finished, the round will be discharged in the direction the gun was pointing when the shot was fired.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{tensions}} {{within the}} team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful {{of some of the}} more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce his vision of BioShock. 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role player game hybrid they set out for. Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team. Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that {{he was in charge of}} at that time. Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.|$|E
5|$|Spencer {{ended the}} inning by {{throwing}} Snider out {{at home to}} keep the score 2–0. Eddie Stanky reached base after a Dodgers error, marking the second error for both teams; after another hit, the inning ended with a strikeout by Thomson. In the fourth inning, three players hit singles but did not score. Snider doubled in the fifth inning with one out, and a Jackie Robinson single made the score 3–0 for the Dodgers. The inning ended for the Dodgers on a double play, and Don Mueller hit a single {{in the bottom of}} the fifth before the Giants recorded three straight outs. The Dodgers opened <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in the sixth inning, as Hodges led off with a home run. Billy Cox then reached base on an error and scored on a second error to make the game 5–0. After Labine walked to get on base, there was a rain delay, and play did not resume until that night.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} {{to take the lead}} in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.|$|E

5|$|Zoldak {{was born}} on December 8, 1918 in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised by his mother, and worked at her {{confectionery}} shop, both while {{he was growing up}} and during the baseball offseason. He attended Eastern District High School, and took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> of baseball at McCarren Park, as his high school did not have a baseball team. He began his professional career with the Palatka Azaleas in 1938, and threw 13 innings in two games. He was released afterwards, and played college baseball for the Fordham Rams baseball team while also playing some semi-professional baseball for a team in Cedarhurst, New York. Zoldak was signed by Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack before the 1941 season, ending his college baseball career and restarting his professional one.|$|E
5|$|A new Zelda {{title was}} first hinted at in April 2008, when Miyamoto {{stated that the}} Zelda {{development}} team were reforming to create new games. Miyamoto later confirmed at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that a new Zelda was in development for the Wii. The game was officially unveiled at E3 2009, although its official title remained unknown. Due to its in-development state, Miyamoto could not show off gameplay as he had wished. Instead, he showed promotional art featuring Link and Fi. He also announced the game's use of Wii MotionPlus, along with its planned 2010 release window. In a later interview, Aonuma's comments on the game's playability brought this release window into doubt. He also noted that his wish {{to focus on the}} new game meant that the release date of Spirit Tracks was shifted to the end of 2009 rather than its initial projected release in early 2010. The game's official title was announced at the event, along with its revised release period in 2011 and a playable demonstration. According to Miyamoto, the game was delayed from its planned 2010 release window as the staff felt that they would be releasing an unfinished product if they put the convenience of the company ahead of creating a quality experience. They used the extra year to both finish the core elements and polish <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> as a whole.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-day}} rest, the Lady Vols resumed their season with {{three games in}} five days, {{starting}} with their final non-conference opponent, Memphis, on the road. UT started strong, taking a 16–6 lead to open <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> only {{to give it back}} up. Memphis delighted its home crowd by taking a 38–31 lead with two minutes to go in the half, but Tennessee rallied and took a two-point lead to the locker room. Once again, Tennessee pulled away in the second half, 91–65, behind three players who scored over twenty: Holdsclaw (31), Randall (21), and Catchings (20). The next game was against Auburn, a program that is traditionally competitive within the conference. Once again, Summitt's team started the game strong, leading 32–16 before Auburn woke up, cutting the lead to five by the half. However, the Tigers would not get any closer than this, as Holdsclaw's 39 points helped Tennessee to yet another win, 79–63. The final game of this stretch was the rematch with Vanderbilt, played on President's Day in front of a sellout crowd at the Commodores' quirky Memorial Gymnasium and a national television audience on ESPN. The Commodores started off strong, taking a 16–7 lead in front of their home crowd. However Tennessee responded with seventeen straight points to take the lead, and led by nine at the halftime. As in previous games, the Lady Vols made a big run to open up the second half to put the game out of reach. UT won 91–60, with UT shooting over fifty percent yet again. The final game of the regular season came against LSU, a respectable SEC team which beat the Lady Vols the previous season in Baton Rouge, but still a few seasons away from becoming a national power. Tennessee played well on Senior Night, starting with a 32–8 lead that would never be given up. Tennessee completed the season with a 90–58 win, giving them a perfect 30–0 regular season.|$|E
