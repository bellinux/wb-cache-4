In 1926 she {{supported}} the TUC's decision {{to hold a}} General Strike, and also the decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefit.</b> Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour Party or the TUC.

In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members.

The model shows that the effects of minimum wages differ from those of <b>unemployment</b> <b>benefits.</b> Moreover, we show that the labour market outcome depends on the underlying game-theoretic bargaining solution.

[...] "Ironically and tragically," [...] Vernon says, [...] "it was not peaceful crusading, but the impetus of rearmament which brought industrial activity back to Jarrow".
