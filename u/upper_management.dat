25|$|David Hoffman, {{a nuclear}} {{supervisor}} at Turkey Point, resigned over the incident and was subsequently sued by Florida Power and Light for {{return of a}} bonus. Hoffman countersued, claiming he was pressured to restart the reactors {{while they were in}} a condition which in his judgment made it unsafe to do so. <b>Upper</b> <b>management</b> wanted the reactors restarted during xenon dead time, which would have led to the operators at the controls having to continuously step control rods to safely manage reactor output.|$|E

25|$|Though Stamkos {{was heavily}} criticized for {{his lack of}} {{production}} {{during the first half}} of the season, in which he was limited to less than 10 minutes of ice time some games (largely due to a dispute amongst then-Head Coach Barry Melrose and <b>upper</b> <b>management,</b> mainly Co-Owner Len Barrie on how to approach the development of Stamkos in the NHL), he finished the season with 19 points in his final 20 games.

After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off and Jackson was given the sign to swing away. Jackson bunted again, and then on the third pitch he bunted again and popped out. A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but after conversing with <b>upper</b> <b>management</b> Martin agreed on a five-game suspension. Then, when Jackson returned, he told reporters that he did not know why Martin had suspended him.|$|E

25|$|Several {{phishing}} {{attacks have}} been directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets within businesses, and the term whaling has been coined for {{these kinds of}} attacks. In the case of whaling, the masquerading web page/email will take a more serious executive-level form. The content will be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack email is often written as a legal subpoena, customer complaint, or executive issue. Whaling scam emails are designed to masquerade as a critical business email, sent from a legitimate business authority. The content is meant to be tailored for <b>upper</b> <b>management,</b> and usually involves some kind of falsified company-wide concern. Whaling phishers have also forged official-looking FBI subpoena emails, and claimed that the manager needs to click a link and install special software to view the subpoena.|$|E

500|$|After Apple co-founder Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985, product {{development}} was handed to Jean-Louis Gassée, formerly {{the manager of}} Apple France.

Gassée long argued that Apple should not market their computers towards {{the low end of}} the market, where profits were thin, but instead concentrate on the high end and higher profit margins. He illustrated the concept using a graph showing the price/performance ratio of computers with low-power, low-cost machines in the lower left and high-power high-cost machines in the upper right.

This is a qualitative study in which individual and focus-group interviews were conducted in a Swedish context with occupational health care specialists, managers, and HR experts. The results suggest that organizational solutions have failed and continue to fail at controlling workers’ health problems, although the main difficulty is not in identifying the ‘right’ individually oriented weak signals.
