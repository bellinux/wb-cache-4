30|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>items</b> or inputs {{are defined}} as goods that last more than 1  year and {{typically}} have a unit cost greater than US$ 100 (Creese and Parker 1994). However, capital costs or assets are usually invested at a bulk amount and used over time (Drummond et al. 2005). Capital inputs in the project included non-recurrent basic training and workshop with target groups, behavior change communication (BCC) activities (e.g., drama, video show, cultural events, and observance of world population day/national days), BCC material development and printing (e.g., flip chart, brochure, signboard, board making, booklet, guidelines) and physical improvement of selected facilities (e.g., power line set-up, furniture and curtain supply, building repair and painting). For calculating annualized values of <b>capital</b> <b>items,</b> useful life time of inputs and 5  % discounting rate was considered (Drummond et al. 2005).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between place and components of social capital among adolescents living in three impoverished communities outside of Beirut, {{the capital city of}} Lebanon. We utilized a unique data set that includes a wide range of social <b>capital</b> <b>items</b> to assess the association between place, social capital and self rated health. The analyses were based on data collected by trained interviewers during the Spring of 2003 from a stratified random sample of 1294 adolescents aged 13 - 19 years, drawn from a sampling frame constructed from area maps and detailed household listing of the target population. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios from logistic regression models were used to assess the strength of associations between (1) the social <b>capital</b> <b>items</b> and community of residence and (2) social capital, community and self-rated health controlling for age, sex and income. Findings show that distrust and social fragmentation were generally prevalent among adolescents living in impoverished suburban communities. Even though social networks, especially the presence of family and relatives, were strong, instrumental social exchange was relatively scarce. Social <b>capital</b> <b>items</b> varied significantly by community, and the stock of social capital in one of the three communities surveyed [...] the Palestinian refugee camp [...] was quite distinctive. Findings from logistic regression models showed that social capital as measured by a simple index is strongly associated with self-rated health status, controlling for community, age, sex and income.

This paper investigates whether similar manipulation exists in companies listed as TSEC and TOC listed as well. Furthermore, we extend Carslaw's (1988) and Thomas's (1989) research by examining whether managers manipulate discretionary accruals (DAs) and working <b>capital</b> <b>items,</b> representing relatively low earnings management costs to make earnings exceed such a cognitive reference point. The result shows that the listed companies of Taiwan manipulate earnings to surpass this cognitive reference point. However, this phenomenon is less significant for negative earnings {{than it is for}} positive earnings. This phenomenon is even more significant for listed companies than for emerging companies. Finally, the higher the levels of DA and working capital are, the more significant such phenomena are; this implies that DA and working <b>capital</b> <b>items</b> are used to round up earnings, and managers report earnings numbers that exceed the cognitive reference point. earnings management, number cognitive, discretionary accruals, rounding earnings numbers...|$|R

However, few studies thus {{far have been}} conducted in northeastern Asian countries, particularly Japan. Therefore, whether social capital is a determinant of health in Japanese society remains unclear. This study attempted to provide new evidence {{for the impact of}} social capital on health in Japan by analyzing original survey data with two different statistical models. In total, 1910 subjects were randomly selected from 210 enumeration districts (EDs) considered in the 2000 population census. In the present study, after excluding missing data on the outcome and predictor variables, we conducted an analysis of 1157 individuals nested within 206 EDs. Ecological and multilevel regression analyses were performed to examine the association between social capital and health, measured by the General Health (GH) perception item (a subcategory of Short Form 36 (SF- 36)), and to estimate the impact of aggregated indicators of social capital on health. We developed an original Japanese version of three social <b>capital</b> <b>items</b> (perceived helpfulness, kindness, and greeting) based on previous studies and expert opinions and prepared a social cohesion index that integrated these three social <b>capital</b> <b>items.</b> The ecological model, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, revealed that perceived helpfulness and greeting, along with the social cohesion index, were observed to have statistically significant associations with GH. The multilevel model, after adjusting for individual social capital perceptions, indicated that the two aggregated indicators of community social capital (kindness and greeting), along with the social cohesion index, showed a statistically significant association with GH. These results showed the existence of a contextual effect of social capital on health outcomes, although individual differences in social capital perceptions in Japan were considered.

40|$|For {{some time}} economists have {{acknowledged}} that reported budgetary {{data do not}} necessarily reflect actual economic activity. Agreement has not been reached, however, on how budget figures should be adjusted to reflect such activity accurately. In this working paper, Resident Scholar Neil H. Buchanan examines 13 alternative measures of the budget deficit in order to determine which, if any, are theoretically or statistically sounder than existing measures. He evaluates them in terms of their theoretical value, that is, their ability to capture benefits (such as higher levels of employment (subject to NAIRU constraints), higher rates of growth, and higher levels of private investment), and costs (higher rates of inflation and lower levels of private investment, consumption, and net exports) to the economy. He also tests whether the new definitions provide empirically more robust estimates than existing measures. Different measures can provide somewhat different gauges of the total macroeconomic effects of deficit spending. For example, since spending by any level of government has macroeconomic effects, {{it can be argued that}} all spending, not only that of the federal government, should be included in the derivation of the "government deficit. " Some assert that the so-called inflation tax (the effects of inflation on changes in interest rate payments) should be subtracted from the deficit since inflation results in a decrease in the real amount of debt outstanding. An argument also can be made that changes in spending and revenues resulting from a change in the business cycle should be smoothed over the course of the business cycle. Another adjustment would separate government expenditures for <b>capital</b> <b>items</b> from expenditures for consumption <b>items</b> because <b>capital</b> <b>items</b> yield long-term returns. In addition, however, government's long-term liabilities in the form of, for example, unfunded loan and pension guarantees, should be accounted for in the definition of a capital budget. ...|$|R
