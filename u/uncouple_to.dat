40|$|OBJECTIVES: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{suppresses}} HIV viraemia, {{thereby reducing}} the antigenic drive for T cells to proliferate. Accordingly, selected HIV-specific T-cell responses have been described to contract within weeks of ART initiation. Here, we sought to investigate whether these findings apply to the entire repertoire of HIV-specific T cells. METHODS: Using interferon (IFN) -gamma enzyme linked immuno spot (ELISpot), we performed retrospective 2 -year proteome-wide monitoring of HIV-specific T cells in 17 individuals with undetectable viral loads during ART. The sample pool for each study subject consisted of one pre-ART time-point {{and at least two}} time-points after initiation of therapy. RESULTS: Peripheral pools of HIV-specific T cells decreased nonsignificantly within the first 2 years under ART in our cohort of patients, in terms of both breadth and magnitude. However, in most cases, the seeming decrease masked ongoing expansion of individual HIV-specific T-cell responses. We detected synchronous contraction and expansion of T-cell responses - with different peptide specificities - in 12 out of 17 study participants during follow-up. Importantly, the observed expansions and contractions of individual HIV-specific T-cell responses reached similar ranges, supporting the biological relevance of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that successful ART enables both contraction and expansion of HIV-specific T-cell responses. Our results should prompt a renewed interest in HIV-specific T-cell dynamics under ART, in particular to elucidate the mechanisms that <b>uncouple,</b> <b>to</b> some extent, particular HIV-specific T-cell responses from variations in circulating antigen load and functionally characterize expanding/contracting T-cell populations beyond IFN-gamma secretion. Assuming that expanding HIV-specific T-cell responses under ART are protective and functional, harnessing those mechanisms may provide novel opportunities for assisting viral control in chronically infected individuals...|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{and cellular}} mechanisms underlying sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and strength, {{are not fully}} understood. It has been proposed that a reduced level of calcium ion-supply to contractile muscle proteins via excitation-contraction <b>uncoupling</b> leads <b>to</b> the muscle weakness associated with aging. The basic process of excitation-contraction uncoupling {{is a result of}} a larger number of ryanodine receptors being <b>uncoupled</b> <b>to</b> the voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptor units. Other mechanisms of sarcopenia include reduced protein synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inadequate nutrition, reduction in hormone levels and neuromuscular changes. In animal models of sarcopenia, a drastic decline in the α 1 S-subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor was observed. However, immunoblot analysis of vastus lateralis specimens from male humans aged 18 to 82 years of age showed no major changes in the relative abundance of this transverse-tubular receptor. In addition, the oligomeric status of the α 1 S-dihydropyridine receptor was unaltered in aged human fibres. It would appear therefore that dihydropyridine receptor expression is preserved during the aging process of human skeletal muscle fibres. Thus, the assumption that abnormal triadic signal transduction is responsible for sarcopenia can not be transferred from animal models to senescent human muscle without modifications...|$|R
