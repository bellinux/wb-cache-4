50|$|The 1960s {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of an <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> of race and race mixture. Swedish historian Magnus Mörner’s 1967 Race Mixture in the History of Latin America, published by a trade press and suitable for college courses, remained important for defining the issues surrounding race. The historiography on Africans and slavery in Latin America was examined in Frederick Bowser’s 1972 article in Latin American Research Review, summarizing research to date and prospects for further investigation. His major monograph, The African Slave in Colonial Peru, African Slave in Colonial Peru, 1524-1650, marked a significant advance in the field, utilizing rich archival sources and broadening the research area to Peru.The debates about race, class, and “caste” took off in the 1970s with works by a number of scholars. Scholars have been also interested in how racial hierarchy has been depicted visually in the eighteenth-century flowering of the secular genre of casta painting. These paintings from the elite viewpoint show racial stereotypes with father of one race, mother of another, and their offspring labeled in yet another category.|$|E

Although Africans earn more than both Caribbean immigrants and native-bom blacks, controllingfor relevant earnings-related endowments erases the African advantage, and elevates Caribbean earnings above those of the other two groups. The findings also trace a substantial African (but not Caribbean) disadvantage wherein university degree holders, particularly those with degrees earned abroad receive little if any, reward for their degrees.

40|$|Complex hypernetworks are {{ubiquitous}} in real-life systems. While a substantial body of {{previous research has}} only focused on the applications of hypernetworks, relatively little work has investigated the evolving models of hypernetworks. Considering the formations of many real world networks, we propose two evolving mechanisms of the hyperedge growth and the hyperedge preferential attachment, then construct an evolving hypernetwork model. We introduce some basic topological quantities, such as a variety of degree distributions, clustering coefficients as well as average path length. We numerically investigate these quantities {{in the limit of}} large hypernetwork size and find that our hypernetwork model shares similar qualitative features with the majority of complex networks that have been previously studied, such as the scale-free property of the degree distribution and a high degree of clustering, as well as the small-world property. It is expected that our attempt in the hypernetwork model can bring the <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> the <b>study</b> of the hypernetwork model in further.

Drawing on an inductive comparative case study of eight social integration enterprises in France, I explore the extent to which intraorganizational dynamics influence organizational responses to conflicting institutional demands. In line with the hypotheses developed by Pache and Santos (2010 b), I confirm the relationship between the degree of internal representation by organizational leaders of the conflicting institutional demands and the corresponding strategic responses mobilized. I then extend the model by highlighting the positive consequences (in terms of resource mobilization), as well as the negative consequences (in terms of internal conflict) of the responses mobilized by organizations. In particular, I highlight the value and limitations of co-optation as a response strategy for dealing with competing institutional demands. - 2 -In the last decade, the field of institutional theory, which has traditionally focused on the constraining influence of homogeneous institutional environments on organizations, has witnessed an <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> exploring the phenomenon of conflicting institutional demands...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} an <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> on the {{evaluation}} of universities using different indicator systems, which has resulted in a multiplicity of indicators. This paper tries to identify which are the most important indicators for the evaluation of higher education institutions, since currently there is no consensus on this. We use the Delphi technique to try to achieve some sort of consensus among a group of experts occupying senior academic and management positions in the Spanish higher education (HE) system, with in-depth knowledge of HE institutions evaluation. The paper contributes directly to both theory and practice by providing a list of prioritized critical indicators for the evaluation of HE institutions. Although the analysis focuses on experts from Spanish HE institutions evaluation, our findings can be generalized to other European HE institutions. © Beech Tree Publishing 2011.

40|$|This is an {{introductory}} paper {{to a special}} issue on climate governance entrepreneurship, where entrepreneurship is understood as acts performed by actors seeking to ‘punch above their weight’. By contrast, actors who are merely doing their job are not ‘entrepreneurs’. In order to understand climate policy and governance, {{we need to learn}} more about the factors that condition variance in entrepreneurial activity, strategies and success. In this introduction, we present a comprehensive review of the literature on entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship in policy in governance, with special attention to the recent <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> of climate governance entrepreneurship. We distinguish two types of entrepreneurship: (1) acts aimed at enhancing governance influence by altering the distribution of authority and information; and (2) acts aimed at altering or diffusing norms and cognitive frameworks, worldviews or institutional logics. The contributions in this special issue offer valuable insights into how personal motivations, policy windows, international trends, cultural-institutional traditions and the distribution of structural power influence entrepreneurship. However, more work is needed – not least as regards whether actors that seek change are more active and/or more successful as entrepreneurs compared to those that defend the status quo, and whether there is more successful entrepreneurship in public or in private arenas of governance...|$|E

40|$|The fingerings used by {{keyboard}} {{players are}} determined by a range of ergonomic (anatomic/motor), cognitive, and music-interpretive constraints. We have attempted to encapsulate the most important ergonomic constraints in a model. The model, which is presently limited to isolated melodic fragments, begins by generating all possible fingerings, limited only by maximum practical spans between finger pairs. Many of the fingerings generated in this way seldom occur in piano performance. In {{the next stage of}} the model, the difficulty of each fingering is estimated according to a system of rules. Each rule represents a specific ergonomic source of difficulty. The model was subjected to a preliminary test by comparing its output with fingerings written by pianists on the scores of a selection of short Czerny studies. Most fingerings recommended by pianists were among those fingerings predicted by the model to be least difficult; but the model also predicted numerous fingerings that were not recommended by pianists. A variety of suggestions for improving the predictive power of the model are explored. A significant <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> psychological <b>studies</b> of performance <b>in</b> th...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{review the}} {{available}} {{literature on the}} interface between borderline personality disorder and affective disorder. Three competing hypotheses have been offered to explain the substantial overlap between these diagnostic categories; they postulate that borderline disorder arises from affective disorder, that affective disorder arises from borderline disorder, or that the two are independent and overlap coincidentally. None of these hypotheses satisfactorily explains the existing data. The authors propose a fourth hypothesis focusing on the multiple etiologies of the signs and symptoms used to diagnose both affective and borderline disorders and suggesting that some patients in the resulting heterogeneous population have symptom clusters that fit both syndromes. (Am J Psychiatry 142 : 277 - 288, 1985) T he <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> of borderline personality disorder and primary affective disorder has led to competing hypotheses about possible interrelation-ships between these diagnostic groups.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how {{a heightened sense}} of power affects customers’ behavioural response following a service failure. Power {{in the context of this}} investigation is defined as the subjective ‘sense of power’, which focuses more on how powerful individuals perceive themselves to be as opposed to an objective appraisal based on tangible possessions such as wealth or hierarchical status. A thorough reading of contemporary literature regarding power and its effect was synthesised into two main issues. First, current findings have not been able to definitively conclude how power impacts on behaviour in a service failure setting. Thus, a thorough investigation into this matter is required. Furthermore, contradictory evidence exists regarding whether power would bring about conciliatory tendencies such as forgiveness or encourage hostile tendencies such as revenge. As such, further investigation is needed to establish the conditions in which power would lead to these different behaviours. Secondly, the researches regarding power, its triggers, and its effect on behaviour have been largely conducted in the social psychology literature. Although the concept of power is highly relevant to marketing, its usability is still currently limited and needs further investigation. To address these issues, five experimental studies were conducted, which are described in six chapters of this thesis. The first chapter establishes the background, objectives and aims of this thesis in detail. The second chapter presents the current literature pertaining to power. Chapters Three to Five report the results of the experimental studies that have been conducted. Chapter Three is dedicated to investigating the role of power in a service failure setting. A more focused literature review is given, and two studies were conducted which found evidence that heightened power leads to lower perception of service failure severity, and higher likelihood of conciliatory behaviour such as decreased likelihood of complaining and reduced demand for compensation. Chapter Four attempts to establish a connection between the recent <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> <b>studies</b> about power in the social psychology field and the concept of consumer empowerment which exists in the marketing literature. Two studies were conducted which found that when consumers’ sense of power was managed using ways derived from the paradigm of consumer empowerment, they produced results consistent with those presented in Chapter Three, when power was activated using methods rooted in the social psychology field. Chapter Five focuses on establishing the boundary conditions determining where power would produce positive or negative effects. One study found that ego-depletion interacted with power. Powerful individuals who were not ego-depleted exhibited lower perceptions of service failure severity, consistent with the findings of studies in previous chapters. However, those who were experiencing a state of ego-depletion showed increased perceptions of severity, implying a more hostile reaction to the failure. This is aligned with conventional wisdom which often illustrates that the powerful are more hostile when dealing with conflict. The final chapter, Chapter Six, presents a summary and discussion of the findings. It will discuss the notion that, contrary to conventional perception, power does not always have a negative connotation. Second, by extending power’s usability more widely in the marketing discipline, the findings and methods developed in this thesis enable service marketers to utilize customer power advantageously when managing negative service encounters...|$|E
40|$|Revised {{version of}} SASNES paper, Moving on from an XML schema to an {{ontology}} of syntactic functions for Biblical HebrewInformation Systems {{is regarded as}} an interdisciplinary science. Therefore, insights from the humanities are important for this discipline, although {{this is not always}} recognised or valued. One outstanding example is the current <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> the <b>study</b> and use of 'ontologies' in information systems, bridging the disciplines of philosophy and computing. The article begins with an overview of an XML Schema that was used as a thesaurus to ensure consistency in the syntactic tagging of the Hebrew text in Genesis 1. The broader syntactic taxonomy, on which the XML Schema is based, and which may be used to analyse the syntax of Biblical Hebrew texts, is discussed in detail. The research also investigates how the concept of 'ontologies' is used in computational linguistic projects. These concepts form the building blocks for suggesting an ontology of syntactic functions for Biblical Hebrew, which may be implemented and used by linguistic information systems to ensure its quality and reliability (i. e. an ontology for information systems). Some possibilities are also proposed of how such an ontology may be put to use...|$|R

The results also demonstrated that dietary SFP and SCP liposomes prolonged the life span and ameliorated oxidative stress status of S 180 ascitic tumour-bearing mice. Results also showed that dietary SFP and SCP liposomes up-regulated the expression of Bax and down-regulated Bcl- 2 level in tumour cells, then induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, thus the activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} SFP and SCP liposomes exert antitumour effects mainly via activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in tumour-bearing mice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|There {{has been}} an <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> {{academic}} <b>studies</b> relating to the underclass as a marginalized group. Notwithstanding this, the literature seldom represents the underclass as an economically active grouping. This study counters this stance by considering street prostitutes and pimps as economically active members of an entrepreneurial underclass. Although previous studies have wrapped the prostitute (and particularly the Madame) in the mantle of entrepreneurship none have sought {{to do so in}} relation to the pimp who traditionally has been portrayed as a swaggering, flamboyant, violent, ruthless, calculating individual existing at the margins of society. In reality they remain an elusive and difficult to research genre. Few ever publicly accept the persona. Indeed, pimping runs contrary to accepted masculine doxa {{of what it means to}} be a man, making it deeply shameful to live off the immoral earnings of women. This paper, based upon the observations of the authors, adopts a semiotic perspective to re-focus these elusive characters in the entrepreneurial and criminological gaze. By concentrating upon prostitution and pimping as an entrepreneurial behaviour, and not on the prostitutes and pimps as entrepreneurial types, the paper contributes to extant knowledge by developing an appreciation of entrepreneurial strategies employed by them to create and extract value from their environment. The methodology circumvented the issues of access allowing a wider sociological discussion to develop, as well as highlighting other ethical issues of researching street level entrepreneurship...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} relationship between the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the internationalization agenda of U. S. colleges and universities. The construct, post- 9 / 11 syndrome, is used metaphorically to delineate the apparent state of panic and disequilibrium that followed the incident. Three research questions were investigated, with two universities in the Miami-area of South Florida, one private and the other public, as qualitative case studies. The questions are: (a) How are international student advisors and administrators across two types of institutions dealing with the post- 9 / 11 syndrome? (b) What, if any, are the differences in international education after 9 / 11 ? (c) What have been the institutional priorities in relation to international education before and after 9 / 11 ?^ Data-gathering methods included interviews with international student/study abroad advisors and administrators with at least 8 years of experience in the function(s) at their institutions, document and institutional data analysis. The interviews were based on the three-part scheme developed by Schuman (1982) : context of experience, details of experience and reflection on the meaning of experiences. Taped interviews, researcher insights, and member checks of transcripts constituted an audit trail for this study. ^ Key findings included a progressive decline in Fall to Fall enrollment of international students at UM by 13. 05 % in the 5 years after 9 / 11, and by 6. 15 % at FIU in the seven post- 9 / 11 years. In both institutions, there was an <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> interest <b>in</b> <b>study</b> abroad during the same period but less than 5 % of enrolled students ventured abroad annually.

40|$|Background: Controlling global {{epidemics}} in {{the real}} world and accelerating information propagation in the artificial world are of great significance, which have activated an <b>upsurge</b> <b>in</b> the <b>studies</b> on networked spreading dynamics. Lots of efforts have been made to understand the impacts of macroscopic statistics (e. g., degree distribution and average distance) and mesoscopic structures (e. g., communities and rich clubs) on spreading processes while the microscopic elements are less concerned. In particular, roles of ties are not yet clear to the academic community. Methodology/Principle Findings: Every edges is stamped by its strength that is defined solely based on the local topology. According to a weighted susceptible-infected-susceptible model, the steady-state infected density and spreading speed are respectively optimized by adjusting the relationship between edge's strength and spreading ability. Experiments on six real networks show that the infected density is increased when strong ties are favored in the spreading, while the speed is enhanced when weak ties are favored. Significance of these findings is further demonstrated by comparing with a null model. Conclusions/Significance: Experimental results indicate that strong and weak ties play distinguishable roles in spreading dynamics: the former enlarge the infected density while the latter fasten the process. The proposed method provides a quantitative way to reveal the qualitatively different roles of ties, which could find applications in analyzing many networked dynamical processes with multiple performance indices, such as synchronizability and converging time in synchronization and throughput and delivering time in transportation.
