40|$|The {{most common}} {{solution}} for modern adjustable speed drives (ASD) {{is the use}} of induction motors (IM) fed by voltage-source inverters (VSI). The inverter generates a pulsewidth modulated (PWM) voltage, with dv/dt values of about 6 kV/us or even more. In three-leg inverters for three-phase applications the occurrence of common-mode voltage is inherent due to asymmetrical output pulses. As a result, for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) reasons, in most applications shielded cables are used between the inverter and the motor, implying high installation costs. The present paper discusses the use of cheaper, <b>unshielded</b> <b>cables</b> from an EMC point-of-view. A new method for measuring electromagnetic interference (EMI) from <b>unshielded</b> <b>cables</b> is proposed and measurement results are presented. The level of EMI is evaluated in different situations: without an output filter, with a classical LC output filter and with an advanced output filter with dc link feedback. It is concluded that, from an EMC point of view, <b>unshielded</b> <b>cables</b> can give very good performance provided that a common-mode (CM) output filter is used...|$|R
50|$|Network {{connections}} {{made with}} <b>unshielded</b> <b>cables</b> are occasionally {{used as a}} form of isolation, in that no shield connection exists between the device and the network. However, this fails to provide sufficient protection in the scope of IEC 60601-1, as the data lines themselves are not isolated, and may be floating at dangerous voltage potentials.|$|R

50|$|Econet is a five-wire bus network. One pair {{of wires}} {{is used for}} the clock, one pair for data, and one wire as a common ground. Signalling used the RS-422 5-volt {{differential}} standard, with one bit transferred per clock cycle. <b>Unshielded</b> <b>cable</b> was used for short lengths, and shielded cable for longer networks. The cable was terminated at each end to prevent reflections and to guarantee high logic levels when the bus was undriven.|$|E
50|$|As {{a signal}} travels from its source to its destination, it can {{encounter}} {{various forms of}} interference and sources of error, so whenever a signal passes through a connecting cable or switch point, it may be degraded. For example, in low current and high resistance applications, unshielded cabling can introduce leakage currents that will degrade measurement accuracy. <b>Unshielded</b> <b>cable</b> can result in noisy readings for low current and high resistance applications, especially if the cabling runs adjacent to equipment generating electromagnetic interference.|$|E
5000|$|In the ST-506 interface, {{the drive}} connects to a {{controller}} card with two data cables, while a third provides power.

Four of the pins, [...] "HD SLCT 0" [...] through [...] "HD SLCT 3", allow the selection among up to 16 heads, although only four {{are available on the}} two-platter ST-506. Once the heads are properly positioned, data is read or written serially through a set of pins in the 20-pin data cable. The limited bandwidth of the data cable was not an issue at the time and is not the factor that limited the performance of the system. However, the <b>unshielded</b> <b>cable</b> can sometimes be susceptible to high levels of noise.|$|E
50|$|Class F {{channel and}} Category 7 cable are {{backward}} compatible with Class D/Category 5e and Class E/Category 6.

This involves a tight twist and carefully controlled design. Cables with individual shielding per pair such as category 7 rely mostly on the shield and therefore have pairs with longer twists.|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) compliance is crucial during {{the design process}} of a digital circuit board (PCB).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} correct for the effect of solar radiation in atmospheric distributed temperature sensing (DTS) applications. By using two cables with different diameters, one can determine what temperature a zero diameter cable would have. Such a virtual cable would not be affected by solar heating and would take on {{the temperature of the}} surrounding air. With two <b>unshielded</b> <b>cable</b> pairs, one black pair and one white pair, good results were obtained given the general consensus that shielding is needed to avoid radiation errors (WMO, 2010). The correlations between standard air temperature measurements and air temperatures derived from both cables of colors had a high correlation coefficient (r 2 = 0. 99) and a RMSE of 0. 38 °C, compared to a RMSE of 2. 40 °C for a 3. 0 mm uncorrected black cable. A thin white cable measured temperatures that were close to air temperature measured with a nearby shielded thermometer (RMSE of 0. 61 °C). The temperatures were measured along horizontal cables with an eye to temperature measurements in urban areas, but the same method can be applied to any atmospheric DTS measurements, and for profile measurements along towers or with balloons and quadcopters.

40|$|Introduction. Development of cables for {{structured}} cabling systems based on twisted pairs for shipbuilding {{is carried out}} in two main directions: increasing the fire safety of cables and increasing the long-term permissible operating temperature by using new, more heat-resistant, electrical insulating materials. Purpose. Substantiation {{of the possibility of}} unshielded cables on the basis of unshielded twisted pairs with thermoplastic polyethylene insulation in PVC protective jacket in conditions of high humidity and high operating temperatures {{on the basis of the}} results of accelerated aging. Methodology. The cycle of aging under conditions of increased humidity is performed for 336 hours. Then the sample was under natural drying conditions for 1440 hours. Thermal aging in a thermostat at 90 °C was carried out in two stages: first – for 206 hours, the second – for 260 hours. In the initial state and after accelerated aging, measurements of the capacitance and tangent of the dielectric loss angle of all the insulating gaps at frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 and 10 kHz were performed. Results. According to the results of accelerated aging under conditions of high humidity and temperature, it is established that the design of an <b>unshielded</b> <b>cable</b> based on unshielded twisted pairs with thermoplastic polyethylene insulation in a protective coating based on PVC-plastic is resistant to external influencing factors. Practical value. The prolonged holding at temperature of 90 °C is equivalent to operation at temperature of 40 °C for 6. 8 years.
