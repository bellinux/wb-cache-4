25|$|No {{matter how}} we view it, {{it remains a}} fact that we charged a non-English-speaking alien with {{criminal}} tax evasion on the first tax returns he filed in this country. It appears that we didn't give him a fair chance to <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> laws. We didn't seek a civil penalty as an initial means of redress. We didn't give {{him the benefit of}} any doubt. Rather, we took a novel theory of tax liability of less than $10,000 {{and turned it into a}} guilty verdict and eighteen months in a federal prison.|$|E

500|$|Motivated {{by her own}} {{battle to}} gain {{credibility}} as {{a woman in a}} field dominated by male astronomers, [...] Rubin encouraged girls interested in investigating the universe to pursue their dreams. She faced discouraging comments on her choice of study throughout her life, but persevered, supported by family and colleagues. In addition to astronomy, Rubin was a force for greater recognition of women in the sciences and for scientific literacy. She and Burbidge advocated together for more women in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on review panels, and in academic searches. She said that despite her struggles with the NAS, she continued to be dissatisfied with the number of women who are elected each year, and called it [...] "the saddest part of [...] life". Rubin was Jewish, and saw no conflict between science and religion. In an interview, she stated: [...] "In my own life, my science and my religion are separate. I'm Jewish, and so religion to me is a kind of moral code and a kind of history. I try to do my science in a moral way, and, I believe that, ideally, science should be looked upon as something that helps us <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> role in the universe." ...|$|E

500|$|Tesla {{had been}} working at the Machine Works {{for a total of}} six months when he quit. What event precipitated him leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for {{redesigning}} generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design [...] "twenty-four different types of standard machines" [...] "but {{it turned out to be}} a practical joke". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal quipping [...] "Tesla, you don't <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> American humor." [...] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that sort of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering December 7, 1884 to January 4, 1885 saying [...] "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".|$|E
500|$|Facundo {{begins with}} a {{geographical}} description of Argentina, from the Andes {{in the west to}} the eastern Atlantic coast, where two main river systems converge at the boundary between Argentina and Uruguay. [...] This river estuary, called the Rio de Plata, is the location of Buenos Aires, the capital. [...] Through his discussion of Argentina's geography, Sarmiento demonstrates Buenos Aires' advantages; the river systems were communications arteries which, by enabling trade, helped the city to achieve civilization. Buenos Aires failed to spread civilization to the rural areas and as a result, {{much of the rest of}} Argentina was doomed to barbarism. [...] Sarmiento also argues that the pampas, Argentina’s wide and empty plains, provided [...] "no place for people to escape and hide for defense and this prohibits civilization in most parts of Argentina". Despite the barriers to civilization caused by Argentina’s geography, Sarmiento argues that many of the country's problems were caused by gauchos like Juan Manuel de Rosas, who were barbaric, uneducated, ignorant, and arrogant; their character prevented Argentine society's progress toward civilization. Sarmiento then describes the four main types of gaucho and these characterizations aid in understanding Argentine leaders, such as Juan Manuel de Rosas. Sarmiento argues that without an understanding of these Argentine character types, [...] "it is impossible to <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> political personages, or the primordial, American character of the bloody struggle that tears apart the Argentine Republic".|$|E

In a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Evtushenkov called for an import ban on all the GPS-capable devices unless these devices support Glonass as well. Evtushenkov claimed that Russian authorities had already started negotiations with major vendors like Nokia, Siemens and Motorola. [...] Vladimir Putin agreed that [...] "It is good that our partners <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> need to protect our national interests and promote our product". According to Russian experts, {{it was possible that}} mobile devices like smartphones would be effectively banned as well.

2500|$|With an {{emphasis}} of discoveries {{in the fields}} of astronomy, physics, chemistry, medicine, biology, geology, paleontology, and archaeology, United States citizens acclaimed in their professions have contributed much. [...] For example, the [...] "Bone Wars," [...] beginning in 1877 and ending in 1892, was an intense period of rivalry between two American paleontologists, Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, who initiated several expeditions throughout North America in the pursuit of discovering, identifying, and finding new species of dinosaur fossils. In total, their large efforts resulted in when 142 species of dinosaurs being discovered. [...] With the founding of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958, a vision and continued commitment by the United States of finding extraterrestrial and astronomical discoveries has helped the world to better <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> solar system and universe. As one example, in 2008, the Phoenix lander discovered the presence of frozen water on the planet Mars of which scientists such as Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) had suspected before the mission confirmed its existence.|$|E
2500|$|Death is that {{possibility}} {{which is the}} absolute impossibility of Dasein. As such, it cannot be compared to {{any other kind of}} ending or [...] "running out" [...] of something. For example, one's death is not an empirical event. For Heidegger, death is Daseins ownmost (it is what makes Dasein individual), it is non-relational (nobody can take one's death away from one, or die in one's place, and we can not <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> own death through the death of other Dasein), and it is not to be outstripped. The [...] "not-yet" [...] of life is always already a part of Dasein: [...] "as soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die." [...] The threefold condition of death is thus simultaneously one's [...] "ownmost potentiality-for-being, non-relational, and not to be out-stripped". Death is determinate in its inevitability, but an authentic Being-toward-death understands the indeterminate nature of one's own inevitable death — one never knows when or how it is going to come. However, this indeterminacy does not put death in some distant, futural [...] "not-yet"; authentic Being-toward-death understands one's individual death as always already a part of one.|$|E
2500|$|His Theology in the Flesh: How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God is {{the first}} book to apply the field of {{cognitive}} linguistics to theology. According to cognitive linguistics, the specific types of bodies humans have shape how we interact with and <b>understand</b> <b>our</b> world. We have concepts such as up/down and in/out because we have bodies that can experience these sorts of things. Embodied experience also gives rise much of our metaphorical thinking. For instance, {{we know what it}} is like to go on a journey in which we experience getting to a destination together and perhaps overcoming obstacles on the way. Many, but not all, languages use the experience physical journeys as the framework in which to understand the experience of love. We say, [...] "Our relationship has come a long way together" [...] and [...] "We have overcome many bumps in the road." [...] We reason about our love relationship in terms of a journey. Yet, in English, we also conceive of love in terms of strong physical forces ("He's blown away by love"), magnetism ("She is attracted to him"), and even insanity ("He is crazy about her"). That means that metaphors can be cognitive and not merely rhetorical. We actually think with metaphors.|$|E
