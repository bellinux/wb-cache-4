40|$|Leukemia-specific {{chromosome}} translocations {{involving the}} nucleoporin CAN/NUP 214 lead to expression of different fusion genes including DEK-CAN, CAN-ABL, and SET-CAN. DEK-CAN and CAN-ABL 1 {{are associated with}} acute myeloid leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively, whereas SET-CAN was identified in a patient with acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia.</b> In addition, SET is overexpressed in solid tumors of the breast, uterus, stomach, and rectum. Ectopic expression of SET-CAN inhibits vitamin-D 3 -induced differentiation of the human promonocytic U 937 cells, whereas ectopic SET expression induces differentiation. Here, we assessed the leukemogenic potential of SET-CAN in the hematopoietic system of transgenic mice. Although SET-CAN mice showed expansion of an early progenitor cell pool and partial depletion of lymphocytes, the animals were not leukemia-prone and did not show shortening of disease latency after retroviral tagging. This suggests that SET-CAN expression in acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> might determine the primitive phenotype of the disease, whereas secondary genetic lesions are necessary for disease development. Surprisingly, SET-CAN mice developed spontaneous hyperplasia of the stomach mucosa, which coincided with overexpression of β-catenin and vastly increased numbers of proliferating gastric mucosa cells, suggesting a role of SET-CAN in proliferation of certain epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{translocation}} (6; 9) (p 23;q 34) {{in acute}} nonlymphocytic leukemia {{results in the}} formation of a highly consistent dek-can fusion gene. Translocation breakpoints invariably occur in single introns of dek and can, which were named icb- 6 and icb- 9, respectively. In a case of acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia,</b> a breakpoint was detected in icb- 9 of can, whereas no breakpoint could be detected in dek. Genomic and cDNA cloning showed that instead of dek, a different gene was fused to can, which was named set. set encodes transcripts of 2. 0 and 2. 7 kb that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Both transcripts contain the open reading frame for a putative SET protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa. The set-can fusion gene is transcribed into a 5 -kb transcript that contains a single open reading frame predicting a 155 -kDa chimeric SET-CAN protein. The SET sequence shows homology with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I. The only common sequence motif of SET and DEK proteins is an acidic region. SET has a long acidic tail, of which a large part is present in the predicted SET-CAN fusion protein. The set gene is located on chromosome 9 q 34, centromeric of c-abl. Since a dek-can fusion gene is present in t(6; 9) acute myeloid leukemia and a set-can fusion gene was found in a case of acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia,</b> we assume that can may function as an oncogene activated by fusion of its 3 ' part to dek, set, or perhaps other gene...|$|E

40|$|FLT 3 is a {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} that is expressed in CD 34 + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and is important for both normal myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. FLT 3 expression in Pax 5 negative lymphoid precursors coincides with a window of multilineage differentiation potential in mice and humans. Recent work has shown that FLT 3 activating mutations can collaborate with a Nup 98 -HoxD 13 mutation to induce an aggressive acute leukemia. The leukemic initiating population in this model displayed properties of both lymphoid and myeloid precursors, making it a useful tool to study the role of FLT 3 in lineage plasticity. Through a variety of assays, the leukemic initiating population was shown to be restricted to myeloid differentiation, suggesting that the B-lineage properties in these cells are due to the priming of lymphoid transcription programs in multipotent progenitors rather than a true capacity for B-cell maturation.

Myelogenous and undifferentiated categories varied less with age, predominated among males, and had a survival paHern midway between trends for the lymphocytic and mono-cytic types. The differences between lymphocytic and <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> are surprising, since these cell types share cytochemical charac-teristics and are usually considered as one entity.

Raptor deficiency impaired granulocyte and B cell development but did not alter survival or proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Transplantation of Raptor-deficient undifferentiated AML cells in a limiting dilution revealed that mTORC 1 is essential for leukemia initiation. Strikingly, a subset of AML cells with undifferentiated phenotypes survived long-term in the absence of mTORC 1 activity. We further demonstrated that the reactivation of mTORC 1 in those cells restored their leukemia-initiating capacity. Thus, AML cells lacking mTORC 1 activity can self-renew as AML stem cells.

40|$|Fusion genes {{encoding}} the 3 ' {{part of the}} can gene are {{implicated in}} two types of leukemia.

40|$|Summary The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} influence and prognostic relevance of CD 25 expression in a retrospective data collection of patients with AML who were treated in the HELIOS Klinikum Berlin-Buch. After a flow cytometrically analyzed expression of the CD 25 antigen, the patients were divided into a CD 25 -positive and a CD 25 -negative group. In the process the correlation and the differences between both groups with regard to age, sex, AML classification, ELN risk group, induction therapy, induction results, cytogenetic and molecular genetics were analyzed. It could be shown that there exists a correlation between CD 25 expression and the differentiation of AML. In this regard, the CD 25 expression increased in patients with <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemias,</b> which was demonstrated by the detection of an increased antigen expression of progenitor markers in CD 25 -positive patients such as CD 34 (p= 0. 032) and CD 117 (p= 0. 001). Moreover, it could be revealed via the flow cytometric examination of the mature granulocytic markers, like for example CD 16 (p= 0. 049) and lactoferrin (p= 0. 042), that CD 25 is expressed to a much lesser extent in patients with granulocytic differentiated leukemias. Furthermore, CD 4 and MPO 7 were to a significant extent more frequently expressed in patients with CD 25 -negative AML than in patients with CD 25 -positive AML (CD 4 p= 0. 048 and MPO 7 p= 0. 014). In addition, the investigations revealed that the proportion of blasts in the CD 45 vs. SSC gate (blast gate) is significantly higher in CD 25 -positive patients than in CD 25 -negative patients (p= 0. 001). With regard to the ELN risk classification, it was shown that the patients with CD 25 -positive AML were completely assigned to the prognostically unfavorable or to the intermediate ELN risk group. No patients with CD 25 -positive AML showed a favorable ELN prognosis, whereas 18 % of the favorable ELN risk class were associated with CD 25 -negative patients (p= 0. 047). The ELN risk assessment was confirmed insofar that the patients with a favorable ELN risk class had a higher survival probability than the patients with an intermediate prognosis, and the survival probability of the latter was again higher than for patients with an unfavorable ELN risk class (p= 0. 005). However, it could not be proven that CD 25 -negative patients had a higher survival probability than CD 25 -positive patients (p= 0. 140). The parameters age, sex, molecular genetics, cytological risk group according to MRC criteria and induction therapy did not show any significant differences in regard to the CD 25 expression...|$|R
40|$|Stem {{cells are}} defined by their ability to make more stem cells, a {{property}} known as self-renewal {{and their ability to}} generate cells that enter differentiation. One mechanism by which fate decisions can be effectively controlled in stem cells is through asymmetric division and the correct partitioning and inheritance of cell fate determinants. While hematopoietic stem cells have the capacity to divide through asymmetric division, the molecular machinery that regulates this process is unknown and whether its activity is required in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that Lis 1, a dynein-binding protein and regulator of asymmetric division, is critically required for blood development and for hematopoietic stem cell renewal in fetal and adult life. In particular, conditional deletion of Lis 1 led to a severe bloodless phenotype and embryonic lethality in vivo. In both fetal and adult mice, loss of Lis 1 led to a failure of normal self-renewal, which included impaired colony-forming ability in vitro and defects in long-term reconstitution ability following transplantation. As a possible mechanism, we find that the absence of Lis 1 in hematopoietic cells, in part, accelerates differentiation linked to the incorrect inheritance of cell fate determinants. Furthermore, using a live cell imaging strategy, we find that the incorrect inheritance of cell fate determinants observed following the loss of Lis 1 is due defects in spindle positioning and orientation. Finally, using two animal models of <b>undifferentiated</b> myeloid <b>leukemia,</b> we show that Lis 1 is critical for the aberrant cell growth that occurs in cancer. Deletion of Lis 1 both at the early and late stages of myeloid leukemia blocked its propagation in vivo and led to a marked improvement in survival. Together, these data identify Lis 1 and the directed control of asymmetric division as key regulators of normal and malignant hematopoietic development. Dissertatio...|$|R

Mutations involving codons 12 or 13 of the NRAS gene were detected in 6 of 33 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6 / 33, 18 %), whereas no mutations were found in non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

On the other hand, a complete search for B cell-related markers (BA- 1 and B 1 monoclonal antibodies, as well as cytoplasmic immunoglobulins [CyIg]) in the cALL cases showed that at least one B cell marker could be detected either on primary or on TPA-induced cells in all cases in which a gene rearrangement had occurred. Incubation with TPA allowed the detection of one B cell marker in a case in which the primary cells were negative, and increased the expression of B cell markers in {{all but one of the}} cALLs tested. The only cALL case that was not rearranged expressed no B cell markers either on primary or on TPA-induced cells. The non-T, non-B, non-common ("null") case that was rearranged also showed no phenotypic evidence of B cell markers on primary and induced cells. These findings indicate that: (a) practically all cases of cALL appear to be of B cell origin as shown by gene rearrangement analysis; (b) DNA studies are relevant for a more precise characterization of individual cases of undifferentiated acute leukemia; (c) a complete survey for B cell markers may establish the B cell origin of the cALL blasts, as long as the analysis on primary cells is complemented by differentiation induction assessment; and (d) most cases of non-T ALL appear to be characterized by the expansion of neoplastic cells "frozen" at different levels along the B cell differentiation pathway, the first detectable marker being heavy chain gene rearrangement, followed by BA- 1, B 1, and CyIg expression...|$|R
40|$|SET/I 2 PP 2 A is {{a nuclear}} protein that was {{initially}} {{identified as an}} oncogene in human <b>undifferentiated</b> acute myeloid <b>leukemia,</b> fused to the nuclear porin Nup- 214. In addition, SET is a potent inhibitior of the phosphatase PP 2 A. Previously, we proposed a model in which the small GTPase Rac 1 recruits SET from the nucleus to the plasma membrane to promote cell migration. This event represents an entirely novel concept {{in the field of}} cell migration. Now, fluorescent versions of the SET protein are generated to analyze its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in live cells. Our studies showed that under steady-state conditions a fraction of the SET protein, which is primarily localized in the nucleus, translocates to the cytosol in an apparently random fashion. SET exiting the nucleus was also seen in spreading as well as dividing cells. We designed an image analysis method to quantify the frequency of nuclear exit of the SET proteins, based on 4 D confocal imaging. This straightforward method was validated by analysis of SET wild-type and mutant proteins. This showed that the frequency of nuclear exit of a Ser- 9 phosphomimetic mutant (S 9 E) is enhanced compared to wild-type SET or a S 9 A mutant. Thus, we have developed a novel method to analyze the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the proto-oncogene SET dynamics in live cells. This method will also be applicable to monitor dynamic localization of other nuclear and/or cytoplasmic signaling proteins. (C) 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometr...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the pattern of gene expression induced by activin A in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs). Mouse ES cells cultured in <b>undifferentiated</b> state by <b>leukemia</b> inhibitory factor and feeder layer cells. Following removing these two anti differentiation factors for 5 days and forming Embryoid Bodies (EBs), the cells divided to 8 equal cells per groups. Differentiation procedure was performed in a two staged protocol; Formed EBs for 4 days (Stage one); expanded differentiated ESCs on gelatin coated dishes for one week (stage two). In the stage one, the media of groups 2 - 7 contained 10, 30 and 100 ng mL - 1 Activin A. The media in stage two was {{the same for all}} groups and contained only Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). The expression of undifferentiated, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm markers were compared with relative RT-PCR method and statistically analyzed. The expression of an undifferentiating marker; Nanog was increased in the Activin A treated groups of stage one. The expression of OCT 4 reduced in Activin A treated groups in stage two. In the stage one, the expression of Nodal increased by Activin A. expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) was suppressed in Activin A treated groups of both stages. In stage two, there were significant decrease for the expression of mesoderm (Brachyury) and Nodal and visceral endoderm (GATA 4) markers (p< 0. 01). The expression of definitive endoderm markers (PDX 1, TAT) showed significantly increased in Activin A treated groups (p< 0. 01). Activin A induced differentiation in high concentration by imbalance in undifferentiating markers. Nodal has a dual role, undifferentiating effect and regulation of visceral endoderm towards definitive endoderm. Overexpression of Nanog, alteration in the expression of Nodal and Shh inhibition are three mechanisms for explanation of differentiation induced by activin A in ES cells. These mechanisms induces cascade of gene expression that commits ESCs towards definitive endodermal cells...|$|R
40|$|The tyrosine-kinase {{receptor}} c-KIT (c-KIT) {{plays an}} important role in proliferation, survival and 26 differentiation of progenitor cells in normal hematopoietic cells. In human hematological 27 malignancies, c-KIT is mostly expressed by progenitor cell neoplasia and seldom by those 28 involving mature cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are actually licensed for the first- and 29 second-line treatment of human haematologic disorders. Aim of the present study was to evaluate c- 30 KIT mRNA and protein expression and complementary DNA mutations in canine leukemia. Eleven 31 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AUL) and 12 chronic 32 lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were enrolled in this study. The amounts of c-KIT mRNA and protein 33 were determined, in peripheral blood samples, by using quantitative Real Time RT-PCR, flow 34 cytometry and immunocytochemistry, respectively. The presence of mutations on c-KIT exons 8, 9, 35 10, 11 and 17 were investigated by cDNA sequencing. Higher amounts of c-KIT mRNA were found 36 in ALL/AUL compared to CLL, and this latter showed a lower pattern of gene expression. 37 Transcriptional data were confirmed at the protein level. No significant gain-of-function mutations 38 were ever observed in both ALL/AUL and CLL. Among canine hematological malignancies, 39 ALL/AUL typically show a very aggressive biological behavior, partly being attributable to the lack 40 of efficacious therapeutic options. The high level of c-KIT expression found in canine ALL/AUL 41 might represent the rationale for using TKIs in future clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) {{has been}} {{detected}} in biological fluids using a radioimmunoassay {{based on the}} inhibition of binding of 125 I-labeled monoclonal anti-CALLA antibody to glutaraldehyde-fixed NALM- 1 cells. With this assay, we showed first that CALLA was released in culture fluids from NALM- 1 and Daudi cell lines but was absent from culture fluids from CALLA negative cell lines. Then, {{we found that the}} sera of 34 out of 42 patients (81 %) with untreated common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (c-ALL) contained higher CALLA levels than any of the 42 serum samples from healthy controls. The specificity of these results was further demonstrated by testing in parallel the sera from 48 patients with CALLA negative leukemias, including 26 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 12 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and 10 acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AUL). All of these sera gave negative results, except for one patient with AUL, who had a significantly elevated circulating CALLA level, and one patient with AML, who had a borderline CALLA level, 3 SD over the mean of the normal sera. Preliminary results suggest that circulating CALLA is associated with membrane fragments or vesicles, since the total CALLA antigenic activity was recovered in the pellet of the serum samples centrifuged at 100, 000 g. In addition, the CALLA-positive pellets contained an enzyme considered as a membrane marker, 5 '-nucleotidase. Evaluation of the clinical importance of repeated serum CALLA determinations for the monitoring of c-ALL patients deserves further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{translocation}} (6; 9) (p 23;q 34) {{is mainly}} found in specific subtypes of {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The diagnosis of this translocation is not easy since the cytogenetic change is quite subtle. The two genes involved in this translocation were recently isolated and diagnosis at the DNA-level became an additional option. Both the dek gene on chromosome 6 and the can gene on chromosome 9 contain one specific intron where breakpoints of t(6; 9) patients were found to cluster. The translocation results in a consistent chimeric dek-can mRNA which is generated from the 6 p- derivative. Five centers participated in a study to estimate the incidence of t(6; 9) in leukemic patients using conventional Southern blot analysis. Patients (n = 320) with either acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AUL), AML, MDS or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were screened for rearrangement of the genes involved in this translocation. Four of these 320 patients showed rearrangement of the can gene on chromosome 9, of which one also had a rearranged dek gene on chromosome 6. A further 20 patients were studied with karyotypic aberrations in which either the short arm of chromosome 6 or the long arm of chromosome 9 were specifically involved. Both conventional Southern blot analysis and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) analysis failed to show dek-can rearrangement {{in any of these}} patients. The results of our study indicate that the incidence of the t(6; 9) is a low as reported based on cytogenetic data and that rearrangement of the dek and can genes is mainly restricted to this specific translocatio...|$|E
40|$|Morphologic, immunologic, cytogenetic, and {{clinical}} features were studied in 9 cases of acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AUL). These patients were unclassifiable by FAB criteria, they were CD 34 + {{and did not}} express myeloid- or lymphoid-associated antigens (CD 13, CD 33, CD 14, CD 15, CD 61, CD 19, CD 10, CD 22, CD 7, CD 2, CD 5, CD 3). Clonal abnormalities were seen in 8 of 9 cases. Del(5 q) as the sole anomaly was observed in 3 cases; + 13 was the primary change in 3 cases, and isolated trisomy 12 was found in 1 patient. A complex karyotype with trisomy 12 q, in association with del 17 p and trisomy 21 q was detected in 1 case. One patient with 5 q- relapsed with refractory anemia with excess of blasts; the presence of dysgranulopoiesis and a few blasts with possible monocytoid morphology in the remaining 2 patients point to a "myeloid nature" of these leukemias. Analysis of cytologic features in our 3 patients with + 13, in combination with previously reported cases, suggests the occurrence of immature stem cell involvement with limited differentiation potential, possibly more along the myeloid than the lymphoid lineage. The significance of trisomy 12 q in this subset of leukemia remains elusive; some clues of minimal differentiation towards the myeloid lineage in our cases are provided by positivity for the CD 117 (c-kit) antigen and by relapse with acute myeloid leukemia without maturation (M 1) in one patient. We conclude that, with presently available diagnostic techniques, AUL is a rare subset of leukemia, in which cytogenetic changes are confined to a few chromosomes, with prevalent involvement of 5 q and of chromosomes 13 and 12. Chromosome findings may be of value in clinical practice, especially in those cases with "myeloid-oriented" karyotype. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to ascertain the frequency of cytogenetic polyclonality in various hematologic malignancies and to investigate whether morphologic subgroup, age, gender, or previous genotoxic exposure influences the incidence. Among 2, 243 cytogenetically investigated hematologic malignancies, 10 acute myeloid leukemias (AML), 5 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), 1 acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AUL), 1 atypical Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 1 chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMD), and 1 chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (CLD) with karyotypically unrelated clones were identified, constituting 2. 6 % of AML, 1. 6 % of MDS, 0. 8 % of ALL, 13 % of AUL, 9. 1 % of Ph- CML, 1. 5 % of CMD, and 2. 8 % of CLD with chromosomal abnormalities. In contrast to the cytogenetic features, the X-inactivation pattern was monoclonal in the two informative female patients that could be investigated. Among 17, 733 karyotypically aberrant published cases surveyed, significant frequency differences (P < 0. 001) were discerned: 1. 7 % of 6, 526 AML, 3. 4 % of 2, 391 MDS, 0. 4 % of 1, 920 Ph+ CML, 2. 9 % of 856 CMD, 0. 9 % of 4, 226 ALL, and 5. 8 % of 1, 814 CLD displayed unrelated clones. The incidence of cytogenetic polyclonality {{did not differ significantly}} among the MDS, CMD, or ALL subgroups, between males and females, between children (< 16 years) and adults, or between B- and T-cell ALL, whereas the frequencies varied among the AML FAB types (P < 0. 05), among the different CLD entities (P < 0. 001), and between B- and T-cell CLD (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, the incidence was higher in therapy-related AML and MDS than in de novo AML and MDS (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 01, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{cytosine}} arabinoside (araC) can induce a remission in {{a majority of}} patients presenting with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), a minority fail to respond and moreover the drug has less effect in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The carrier-mediated influx of araC into purified blasts from patients with AML, ALL, and acute <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AUL) {{has been compared to}} that of normal lymphocytes and polymorphs. Blasts showed a larger mediated influx of araC than mature cells, since mean influxes for myeloblasts and lymphoblasts were 6 - and 2. 3 -fold greater than polymorphs and lymphocytes, respectively. Also, the mean influx for myeloblasts was fourfold greater than the mean for lymphoblasts. The number of nucleoside transport sites was estimated for each cell type by measuring the equilibrium binding of [3 H]nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), which inhibits nucleoside fluxes by binding with high affinity to specific sites on the transport mechanism. The mean binding site numbers for myeloblasts and lymphoblasts were 5 - and 2. 8 -fold greater, respectively, than for the mature cells of the same maturation series. The mean number of NBMPR binding sites for myeloblasts was fourfold greater than for lymphoblasts. Patients with AUL were heterogeneous since blasts from some gave values within the myeloblastic range and others within the lymphoblastic range. The araC influx correlated closely with the number of NBMPR binding sites measured in the same cells on the same day. Transport parameters were measured on blasts from 15 patients with AML or AUL who were then treated with standard induction therapy containing araC. Eight patients entered complete remission, while seven failed therapy, among whom were the three patients with the lowest araC influx (10 -fold between leukemic blasts and normal leukocytes, but transport capacity related directly to the number of nucleoside transport sites on the cell. Finally, low araC transport rates or few NBMPR binding sites on blasts were observed in a subset of patients with acute leukemia who failed to achieve remission with drug combinations containing araC...|$|E
