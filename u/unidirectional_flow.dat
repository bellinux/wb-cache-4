5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flow</b> and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flow</b> from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

40|$|Research in {{bidirectional}} data flow analysis {{seems to have}} come to a halt due to an impression that the case for {{bidirectional data}} flow analysis has been considerably weakened by a plethora of investigations based on decomposability of known bidirectional placement algorithms into a sequence of purely unidirectional components. This paper shows that the approach of decomposability is not general enough in that it derives its power from the simplifying graph transformation of edge-splitting and the favourable nature of flows in partial redundancy elimination (PRE). This follows from {{the fact that in the}} absence of edge-splitting, PRE cannot be performed using a sequence of cascaded <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows.</b> Further, edge-splitting inherently converts data flows involved in PRE into <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows.</b> In our opinion, this obviates the need of an alternative formulation. We also show that edge-splitting cannot convert data flows involved in "truly" bidirectional data <b>flow</b> problems into <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows.</b> Thus not every bidirectional data flow problem can be converted into <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows.</b> Besides, we argue that the premise that bidirectional analysis is more complex than unidirectional analysis, is invalid.

40|$|Abstract—Physical-layer network coding (PNC) is a {{promising}} technique {{for improving the}} throughput of wireless networks. To implement PNC in practice, a suitable medium access control (MAC) protocol is needed. Existing works mainly focus on bidirectional PNC, where two nodes exchange their packets with each other. Considering the case where <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows</b> exist, in this paper, we propose a distributed MAC protocol to support PNC with overhearing. The proposed protocol is compatible with conventional relaying methods, including con-ventional network coding and plain routing. It {{is based on the}} Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism and can be regarded as an extension to the IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can increase the throughput of networks with <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows,</b> especially when the traffic load is heavy.

The motivation for <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows</b> is justified, since {{it may not}} always be possible to collect bidirectional flows due to routing asymmetries [138, 347]. Therefore, the authors analyze the effectiveness of flows in one direction. To this end, they divide their dataset into three sets, consisting of server-to-client flows, client-to-server flows, and random flows that have a combination of both. The beginning and ending of the TCP flows are identified using SYN/SYNACK packets and FIN/RST packets, respectively. Whereas, a cluster is labeled to the traffic class with the majority of flows. As the number of clusters increase, it is possible to identify applications with a finer granularity.|$|R

40|$|One {{aspect of}} ocean flow over mid-ocean ridges that has escaped much {{attention}} is {{the capacity of}} a ridge to convert oscillatory <b>flows</b> into <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows.</b> Those <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows</b> {{take the form of}} relatively narrow jets hugging the ridge's flanks. In the Northern Hemisphere, the jets move heat and dissolved and particulate matter poleward on the west and equatorward on the east of north-south trending ridges. Recent measurements and a model of flow at the East Pacific Rise at 9 – 10 °N show that these ridge-parallel flows can extend 10 – 15 km horizontally away from the ridge axis, reach from the seafloor to several hundreds of meters above ridge crest depth, and have maximum speeds in their cores up to 10 cm s– 1. Because of their along-ridge orientation and speed, the jets can significantly affect the transport of hydrothermal vent-associated larvae between vent oases along the ridge crest and, possibly, contribute to the mesoscale stirring of the abyssal ocean. Because jet-formation mechanisms involve oscillatory currents, ocean stratification, and topography, the jets are examples of "stratified topographic flow rectification.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} data flow analysis, {{which has its}} roots in <b>unidirectional</b> <b>flows,</b> is inadequate to characterize bidirectional data flow problems. We present a generalized theory of bit vector data flow analysis which explains the known results in unidirectional and bidirectional data flows and provides a deeper insight into the process of data flow analysis. Based on the theory, we develop a worklist-based generic algorithm which is uniformly applicable to unidirectional and bidirectional data flow problems. It is simple, versatile, and easy to adapt for a specific problem. We show that the theory and the algorithm are applicable to all bounded monotone data flow problems which possess the property of the separability of solution. The theory yields valuable information about the complexity of data flow analysis. We show that the complexity of worklist-based iterative analysis is the same for unidirectional and bidirectional problems. We also define a measure of the complexity of round-robin iterative analysis. This measure, called width, is uniformly applicable to unidirectional and bidirectional problems and provides a tighter bound for unidirectional problems than the traditional measure of depth. Other applications include explanation of isolated results in efficient solution techniques and motivation of new techniques for bidirectional flows.
