40|$|There {{has never}} been common {{understanding}} {{of the concept of}} community participation. Along with the positive effects, various authors have also pointed out many negative outcomes. Nevertheless, community participation is still being practiced in various ways. Initiated by the researcher's own interest, this study is carried out for assessing community participation in a public <b>urban</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>project</b> of Nepal. The major objective is to understand the relationship of 'community participation on the ground' to 'project's success'. Therefore the main research question posed {{for the purpose of this}} study is – 'How did the community participation within the UEIP Banepa impact the project's success?' Among the numerous subprojects carried out within UEIP, three subprojects are selected as study units. They are - i) Road Upgrading Subproject, ii) Urban Community Facilities and Urban Area Improvement subproject and iii) Sanitation and Waste Water Management Subproject. The main theoretical bases for carrying out this study are' (i) the interrelationship of the objective, intensity and instruments of community participation' and (ii) OECD success criteria for projects. The 'four questions of participation'- contribute to identifying these three dimensions of community participation in project. Various existing ladder of participation are also referred as useful base for evaluation. 'Case study' was adopted as research method and qualitative data were analyzed for the research. The sub projects are analyzed on the process of community participation, the factors that affected the process and their outcome in resulting project's success. It was found from the analysis that a common approach of community participation that was carried out in the subprojects was not always contributing towards the long term project success. There were various factors on the ground that affected the process. They were mainly -the limitations of projects approach, nature of job of the subprojects, community availability for participation and formal/informal energy flow in participation. Depending upon these factors on the ground, the community participation reached to a moderate intensity in the case of road upgrading subproject and urban area upgrading subproject. However in the case of sanitation and wastewater treatment system, community participation was not visible during implementation phase. Where community was available for participation, the short term success conditions of efficiency were achieved through conflict resolution and inputs to effective implementation. However, impacts of community participation contributing to long term success were seen only in the road upgrading subproject, where this process could build some kind of shared ownership to the sub-project. This thesis then proposes a model mainly for formative evaluation on the availability of community to participate in a project. And finally the research is concluded by providing some practical implications to follow a consistent approach to align with objective of community participation in the project. In doing so, a need to pre-assessment of motivation and availability of the community participation, potential positive strength of informality, and a joint approach of expert-local synergy is proposed...|$|E

War damage {{and the need}} to rehouse {{soldiers}} and civilians returning from overseas resulted in a shortage of 4.2million units of housing which, combined with food shortages, led to many civilians being forced to live in harsh conditions. In September 1945 the Japanese government offered to provide material for 300,000 small temporary houses to evacuees, but the emphasis of its policies in this year and 1946 was to stop people returning to the damaged cities. The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946, and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government. The Allied occupation authorities were not involved in the urban rebuilding effort, but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan's status as a defeated country. Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction, however. In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the urban layout, though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations. Overall, most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality, and it was not until well after the war that major <b>urban</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> were undertaken.|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} two decades of the Meiji period (1868 - 1912) the country 2 ̆ 7 s leaders engaged in intense discussions {{about the future of}} the capital of Tokyo. Some leaders {{believed}} in the importance of urban beautification, while others regarded changes in urban infrastructure and services as essential to maintenance and growth of the city. Many of the proposed changes were cloaked in the language of progress. This work examines the course taken by urban leaders of the first decades of the Meiji period in establishing planning policy. This investigation depends heavily on planning documents, transcripts of planning committees, and on architectural and urban design data from completed <b>urban</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> in Meiji Tokyo. My research focuses on two issues, (1) the extent to which the efforts of Japanese leaders focused the country on the goal of modernization, and (2) the extent to which efforts to achieve bunmei kaika, or cultural enlightenment, were superficial. My aim in this study is to demonstrate how the concepts of modernity and the struggle to develop a modern urban structure altered previous notions of cities and city planning practices. In summarizing my results, I review the debates among historians in reconstructing the developments in Tokyo 2 ̆ 7 s planning history, and conclude that poor articulation of planning policy in the first decades of the Meiji period reflects a lack of consensus among Meiji leaders about the definition and course of modernization. Rather than reject traditional approaches to planning, urban leaders eventually incorporated these approaches into their new planning methodologies. Modernity in the Japanese context, consequently, did not require dismantling preexisting urban structures. Instead, it represented a marriage of the political motivations of the country 2 ̆ 7 s leaders with the modern urban needs for improved transportation networks and zoning mechanisms. Exposure of the political system to popular opinion entailed the shifting of planning discourse from the theoretical to the practical realm, as well as from the private to the public realm. ...|$|R

This paper presents a LCCA analysis process which integrates the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) program, RealCost (a road user cost calculation program), the FHWA-endorsed Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation Strategies (CA 4 PRS) and Caltrans specific design tools (CalFP and CalAC), into the existing Caltrans LCCA process (a {{modified version of the}} FHWA LCCA process).

In {{the last two}} centuries, their growth in America in the forms of live performance and cinemas speak to their popularity. Within the city of Wilmington, Delaware, theaters {{can be used to}} represent the cultural, social, economic and historic changes. Three theaters remain from the historic era studied (1870 - 1930). The first is the Grand Opera House, the first permanent theater in the city of Wilmington built in 1871. The second theater studied is the DuPont Theater, which was constructed as part of the large <b>urban</b> building and <b>improvement</b> <b>projects</b> by the DuPont Company and the du Pont family, constructed in 1913. The third theater is the Queen Theater, a movie palace opened in 1916 and the last such historic structure within the city of Wilmington. Each of these three theaters offers a glimpse into a historic era {{of the city and the}} construction of the theater corresponds to particular trends both locally and nationally. These three theaters were once part of nearly thirty five more theaters within the area of Wilmington. The loss of so many structures can be attributed to numerous factors, but the overall goal is modern times is to conserve these buildings. Whether this is done by reopening the structure as a theater or merely maintaining the building, preservation of theaters is imperative to a city’s identity and in certain cases, renewal. With Wilmington being actively revived, the operation of old theaters alongside new structures shows how these buildings are markers to a city’s identity and history.
