5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV) in this breed, which occurs when twisting of the stomach (volvulus or torsion) causes or is caused by excess gas. Symptoms include restlessness, inability to get comfortable, pacing, or retching without being able to bring <b>up</b> <b>anything.</b> The dog's abdomen may be visibly swollen, but bloat or torsion can occur without visible swelling. A dog with GDV requires immediate veterinary care. The dog's survival usually depends on whether the owner can get to a veterinarian in time.|$|E

500|$|On August 18, it was {{reported}} that Tyler officially signed on with the show. When asked about this in October, Perry declared he understood Tyler's reasons and wished him luck, but stated that he would seek different projects – [...] "I'm tired of waiting around, so I'm not passing <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> right now".|$|E
500|$|Since 2010, Seidell and Blumenfeld have hosted Pranked, an MTV series {{featuring}} pranks {{recorded on}} video and posted online. The show has generally received poor reviews, with critics {{looking down on}} its clip show format and use of content from YouTube, and calling it inferior to the [...] "prank war" [...] that inspired it. The Michigan Daily Eric Chiu said [...] "Hosts Blumenfeld and Seidell {{do what they can}} with their material, but their banter and commentary is mostly forgettable", and [...] "the Prank War series on CollegeHumor.com {{is a perfect example of}} discomforting gags done right...It's a shame that Pranked can't muster <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> near the same level of ingenuity." ...|$|E
500|$|The 3D {{cameras were}} unable to pick <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> shiny, such as {{stainless}} steel, due to a flare. Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are [...] "slow to pick up information". Loucks said, [...] "It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, and we thought that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light. [...] So we had to add more and more black. [...] The reason I say it's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before." ...|$|E

500|$|Carnarvon {{had been}} succeeded as Colonial Secretary by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who {{received}} the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: [...] "Have {{you ever heard of}} an instance where the British Lion has ever given <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> on which he had set his paw?" [...] Kruger retorted: [...] "Yes. The Orange Free State." [...] The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the Eastern Question dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: [...] "Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end." [...] Kruger was touched and wore {{it for the rest of}} his life.|$|E

2500|$|During Tongyang Group's late 2013 crisis, {{the group}} had {{initially}} planned to sell only a minority stake in Tongyang Power, {{with the aim of}} raising funds so they could carry through with the construction of the Samcheok plant. However, by late September 2013, group officials expressed their willingness to sell the entire company; one stated, [...] "Survival of the group comes first over everything else. We will give <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> to save the group." ...|$|E

2500|$|The restyled GTO {{had a new}} {{simulated}} hood scoop. A seldom seen dealer-installed option {{consisted of}} a metal underhood pan and gaskets to open the scoop, making it a cold air intake. The scoop was low enough that its effectiveness was questionable (it was unlikely to pick <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> but boundary layer air), but it allowed more of the engine's roar to escape. Another cosmetic change was the black [...] "egg-crate" [...] grille.|$|E
2500|$|... … {{the cast}} was only of {{moderate}} ability, {{and we had}} access to far too few performances to make <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> really worth while. It was still {{felt that this was}} the only economic way to record Wagner, for the expense involved in taking his major works to the studio {{did not seem to be}} justified by the sales potential. But after the Lohengrin experience I found myself fervently hoping that I would never return to Bayreuth, at least in a recording capacity.|$|E
2500|$|Police did not {{say whether}} the search of the {{basement}} had turned <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> significant. But almost a year later, in May 2014, Bronx County prosecutors presented the evidence against Bonie [...] to a grand jury, which indicted him on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter. An [...] arrest warrant was issued for Bonie. The New York Post reported that an acquaintance had told police that Bonie had admitted {{to him that he}} {{had something to do with}} Moore's disappearance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story behind}} Palance's face was {{repeated}} numerous times (including in respected film reference works), but upon his death, several obituaries of Palance quoted him {{as saying that}} the entire story had been contrived: [...] "Studio press agents make <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> they want to, and reporters go along with it. One flack created the legend that I had been blown up in an air crash during the war, and my face had to be put back together by way of plastic surgery.

2500|$|One of Abu Zubaydah's FBI interrogators, Ali Soufan, wrote a {{book about}} his experiences. He later testified to Congress that Zubaydah was {{producing}} useful information in response to conventional interrogation methods, including the names of Sheikh Mohammed and Jose Padilla. He stopped providing accurate information in response to harsh techniques. Soufan, one of the FBI's most successful interrogators, explained, [...] "When they are in pain, people will say anything to get the pain to stop. Most of the time, they will lie, make <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> to make you stop hurting them. That means the information you're getting is useless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hall of Famer Mickey Cochrane {{returned}} as the team's manager and catcher. [...] Known as [...] "Black Mike", Cochrane {{is considered one}} of the greatest catchers of all time. [...] In 1935, he hit [...]319 (9th in the AL) with a [...]452 on-base percentage (3rd in the AL), 96 walks (4th in the AL), 93 runs scored, and 33 doubles. [...] Aside from his contributions as a player, Cochrane was invaluable as a manager and leader. [...] Charlie Gehringer later said: [...] "When Mickey was managing the Tigers from behind the plate I can't remember him ever fouling <b>up</b> <b>anything.</b> [...] Seemed like he made snap judgments that always worked out well, especially in '34 and '35." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Rift {{plot device}} has {{attracted}} some critical commentary. In Under Torch Wood, a one-off Torchwood parody for The Register (a dialogue {{in the style}} of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' radio play Under Milk Wood), columnist Verity Stob derides the device as lazy writing on the part of Davies and his writing team, and comments on its large indebtedness to the Hellmouth from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Gwen asks [...] "What is the Rift?"; the narrative voice describes it as [...] "a kind of hellmouth that is sucking on a transcendental, transdimensional gobstopper. It is a double-egg MacGuffin served with large fries. It is [...] [...] [...]" [...] an easy way for lazy writers to generate indulgence-straining plots, without ever troubling to think <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> new, or plausible, or to know or look up any science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Conquest {{stressed}} that Stalin's purges were not {{contrary to the}} principles of Leninism, but rather a natural consequence of the system established by Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the killing of local groups of class enemy hostages. Alexander Yakovlev, architect of perestroika and glasnost and later head of the Presidential Commission for the Victims of Political Repression, elaborates on this point, stating that [...] "The truth is that in punitive operations Stalin did not think <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> that was not there under Lenin: executions, hostage taking, concentration camps, and all the rest." [...] Historian Robert Gellately concurs, saying: [...] "To put it another way, Stalin initiated very little that Lenin had not already introduced or previewed." [...] Said Lenin to his colleagues in the Bolshevik government: [...] "If we are not ready to shoot a saboteur and White Guardist, what sort of revolution is that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's key {{campaign}} man was Jim Karygiannis {{who became}} a living legend within the Liberal Party due to his ruthlessness. Chrétien told Lavelle that what he wanted was [...] "A tough guy. A guy who could go on a search-and-destroy mission, who could do a kamikaze raid for our side", and decided that Karygiannis was that man. At a meeting to select Liberal delegates for the Kitchener-Waterloo riding, Martin's supporters attempted to call on the pay phones as many potential Martin supporters as possible {{to come to the}} meeting, which led Karygiannis to put chewed gum into all of the pay phone coin slots, and thereby won Kitchener-Waterloo for Chrétien. At another delegate selection meeting, Karygiannis verbally attacked a pro-Martin Liberal official with such rage that the man was hospitalized for angina. Karygiannis specialised in signing up immigrants to serve as delegates for Chrétien, and personally signed 9,500 immigrants as Chrétien delegates between January and June 1990, leading one pro-Martin official to lament that [...] "We were getting Greeked. And if we weren't getting Greeked, we were getting Sikhed". Karygiannis later boasted in an interview that [...] "I signed <b>up</b> <b>anything</b> that moved". Chrétien is said to have praised Karygiannis with the remark [...] "Whatever it takes to win, Jimmy, whatever it takes to win". In large part because of Karygiannis and his team, by late April 1990 Chrétien had signed up 1,500 delegates to Martin's 500 delegates, making him the clear front-runner.|$|E
