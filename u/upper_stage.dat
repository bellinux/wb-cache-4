5|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigated}} sending a Gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, {{the second stage of}} a Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would have been used to launch the <b>upper</b> <b>stage,</b> whilst the Gemini would launch on the Titan II, as it had in the Gemini program.|$|E
5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's <b>upper</b> <b>stage,</b> the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|The nozzle of the Merlin Vacuum {{series of}} engines {{developed}} by SpaceX for the <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> of its Falcon 9 rocket {{is made from}} a niobium alloy.|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} for enabling the Scout <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> {{to endure the}} expected temperature, mechanical shock, acoustical and mechanical vibration environments during a specified shuttle mission were determined. The study consisted of: determining a shuttle mission trajectory for a 545 kilogram (1200 pound) Scout payload; compilation of shuttle environmental conditions; determining of Scout <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> environments in shuttle missions; compilation of Scout <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> environmental qualification criteria and comparison to shuttle mission expected environments; and recommendations for enabling Scout <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> to endure the exptected shuttle mission environments...|$|R
50|$|The US-K satellites, were {{launched}} by Molniya-M carrier rockets with Blok 2BL <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> from Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The US-KS and US-KMO operate in geosynchronous orbits and {{were launched}} by Proton rockets with DM-2 <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> from Baikonur.|$|R
50|$|Many early <b>upper</b> <b>stages,</b> in {{both the}} Soviet and U.S. space programs, were not {{passivated}} after mission completion. During the initial attempts to characterize the space debris problem, it became evident that a good proportion of all debris {{was due to the}} breaking up of rocket <b>upper</b> <b>stages,</b> particularly unpassivated upper-stage propulsion units.|$|R
5|$|CryoSat-2 was {{launched}} at 13:57:04 UTC on 8 April 2010. Following a successful launch, CryoSat-2 {{separated from the}} <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> of the Dnepr into a low Earth orbit. The first signals from the satellite were detected by a ground station at the Broglio Space Centre in Malindi, Kenya, seventeen minutes after launch.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 2005, MRO was {{launched}} aboard an Atlas V-401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Centaur <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> of the rocket completed its burns over a fifty-six-minute period and placed MRO into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission payload was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to a failure of the onboard reaction control system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket <b>upper</b> <b>stage,</b> after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its <b>upper</b> <b>stage,</b> massed a total of , with the cradle massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E

50|$|The H-I or H-1 was a Japanese liquid-fuelled carrier rocket, {{consisting}} of a licence-produced American first stage and set of booster rockets, and all-Japanese <b>upper</b> <b>stages.</b> It was launched nine times between 1986 and 1992. It replaced the N-II, and was subsequently replaced by the H-2, which used the same <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> with a Japanese first stage.|$|R
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> would be used.|$|E
5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|Testing {{then moved}} to Kwajalein. The first test on 21 March 1963 failed when the MTR failed to lock onto the missile. A second on 19 April also failed when the missile's {{tracking}} beacon failed 30 seconds before intercept. The third test, this time using an actual target consisting of an Agena-D <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> equipped with a Zeus miss-distance transmitter, was carried out on 24 May 1963, and was a complete success. From that point until 1964, one DM-15S was kept {{in a state of}} instant readiness and teams continually trained on the missile.|$|E

50|$|The main {{differences}} between the Juno II and Jupiter were stretched propellant tanks for increased burn time (the first stage burn time was approximately 20 seconds longer than on the Jupiter), a reinforced structure to support the added weight of <b>upper</b> <b>stages,</b> and the inertial guidance system replaced with a radio ground guidance package, which {{was moved to the}} <b>upper</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{performances}} of Ariane 5 ME and Ariane 6 (for two different configurations: PPH and PH) with common <b>upper</b> <b>stages.</b> In that perspective, the investigated <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> are ESC-B (Perigee Decrease and Direct Deorbiting Versions) and newly defined H 31 and H 34. Ariane 6 is modeled based {{on one or two}} P 135 stages (serial) and similarly, two P 135 boosters...|$|R
5|$|The {{designation}} WS-199B {{was assigned}} to the project that, under a contract awarded in 1958 to Martin Aircraft, would become the Bold Orion missile. The design of Bold Orion was simple, using parts developed for other missile systems to reduce the cost and development time of the project. The initial Bold Orion configuration was a single-stage vehicle, using a Thiokol TX-20 Sergeant solid-fuel rocket. Following initial testing, the Bold Orion configuration was altered to become a two-stage vehicle, an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> being added to the missile.|$|E
5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. It {{was expected to}} be a three-day mission with four crew members, and would launch INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following problems with the Inertial <b>Upper</b> <b>Stage</b> (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS {{was not going to be}} flown. It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{beyond the}} manned lunar landings, NASA {{investigated}} several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using {{the space in}} the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop {{to be built in}} orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn <b>upper</b> <b>stage,</b> and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack. The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission.|$|E
50|$|There are two variant <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> in use, the Block I and Improved Block-I (used in Soyuz-2-1b).|$|R
50|$|The Jupiter MRBM {{was also}} {{modified}} by adding <b>upper</b> <b>stages,</b> {{in the form}} of clustered Sergeant-derived rockets, to create a space launch vehicle called Juno II, {{not to be confused with}} the Juno I which was a Redstone-Jupiter-C missile development. There is also some confusion with another U.S. Army rocket called the Jupiter-C, which were Redstone missiles modified by lengthening the fuel tanks and adding small solid-fueled <b>upper</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{lower part}} of the tower was built around 1300 with the <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> being added in the 15th century.|$|R
25|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> {{is powered}} by a single Merlin 1D engine {{modified}} for vacuum operation.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2007 NASA {{awarded the}} Ares I <b>Upper</b> <b>Stage</b> {{manufacturing}} contract to Boeing. Boeing built the S-IC {{stage of the}} Saturn V rocket at Michoud Assembly Facility in the 1960s. The <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> of Ares I {{was to have been}} built at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility, the construction site used for the Space Shuttle's External Tank and the Saturn V's S-IC first stage.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{designation}} XMQR-13A in 1967, the BMTS could be launched in four different configurations. Configuration 1 used the booster from a Nike Ajax surface-to-air missile, with either an Apache (Version 1), Cajun (version 2), or inert Cajun (version 3) <b>upper</b> <b>stage.</b> Configuration 2 omitted the <b>upper</b> <b>stage.</b> All four variations fitted a radar enhancer {{in the nose}} cone to assist in target acquisition by the targeting missile.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 2012, a Delta IV M+ (4,2) {{experienced}} an anomaly in the <b>upper</b> <b>stage's</b> RL10-B-2 engine {{which resulted in}} lower than expected thrust. While the vehicle had sufficient fuel margins to successfully place the payload, a GPS Block IIF satellite, into its targeted orbit, investigation into the glitch delayed subsequent Delta IV launches and the next Atlas V launch (AV-034) due to commonality between the engines used on both vehicles' <b>upper</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
5|$|This {{architecture}} {{would have}} used a Titan II to launch the Gemini spacecraft, with a Saturn IB launching the <b>upper</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 {{were both}} sent {{out of the}} solar system by Star 37E <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> from Atlas-Centaur rockets.|$|R
25|$|Again on 27 August 2015, GSLV-D6 {{launched}} GSAT-6 {{into the}} transfer orbit. ISRO used the indigenously developed Cryogenic <b>Upper</b> <b>Stage</b> (CUS) third time on board in this GSLV flight.|$|E
25|$|The rocket {{has three}} solid {{propulsion}} stages and a liquid propulsion <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> (the AVUM) for accurate orbital insertion {{and the ability}} to place multiple payloads into different orbits.|$|E
25|$|United Launch Alliance (ULA) {{contracts}} the An-124 {{to transport}} the Atlas V launch vehicle from its facilities in Decatur, Alabama to Cape Canaveral. ULA also uses the An-124 {{to transport the}} Atlas V launch vehicle and Centaur <b>upper</b> <b>stage</b> from their manufacturing facility in Denver, Colorado to Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base. Two flights are required to transfer each launch vehicle (one for the Atlas V main booster stage and another for the Centaur <b>upper</b> <b>stage).</b> It is also contracted by Space Systems Loral to transport satellites from Palo Alto, CA to the Arianespace spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.|$|E
50|$|The {{bell tower}} is {{substantially}} Norman but the <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> were remodelled in the 14th century. The tower has a saddleback roof.|$|R
5000|$|Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 {{were both}} sent {{out of the}} solar system by Star 37E <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> from Titan IIIE rockets.|$|R
25|$|To {{reduce the}} cost per launch the Epsilon uses the {{existing}} SRB-A3, a solid rocket booster on the H-IIA rocket, as its first <b>stage.</b> Existing M-V <b>upper</b> <b>stages</b> {{will be used for}} the second and third stages, with an optional fourth stage available for launches to higher orbits. The J-1 rocket, which was developed during the 1990s, but abandoned after just one launch, used a similar design concept, with an H-II booster and Mu-3S-II <b>upper</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R
