25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and a strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E
2500|$|The 370Z uses a front double {{wishbone}} suspension, with forged aluminum control arms and steering knuckle, the rear multi-link suspension uses a forged aluminum <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> lower arm and radius rod, the toe control rod is steel and wheel carrier assembly is aluminum.

5000|$|The 320 {{was built}} on a {{shortened}} BMW 326 frame and used a 326 engine with a single carburettor and an output of [...] The suspension, which was carried over from the 329, consisted of an independent front suspension with a high-mounted transverse leaf spring acting as <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and a conventional live axle on semi-elliptic springs at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The Discovery Sport {{includes}} further {{changes to}} the platform {{in comparison with the}} Evoque, with a new compact multi-link suspension design to permit the folding rear seats and spare wheel well in the boot space, without requiring an unduly high and impractical load floor. The front suspension is a MacPherson strut design carried over from the Range Rover Evoque largely unchanged, and features steel lower and aluminium <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Front-wheel {{alignment}} {{was made}} easier with and with greater accuracy {{by moving the}} camber adjustment from the upper to the lower control arm on the double wishbone suspension, and the caster angle adjustments also moved from the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> to the drag strut. At midyear, AMC's new top engine, the AMX 390 CID L [...] V8 became an option in the Ambassador line, bringing the total engine options up to four.|$|E

50|$|The {{successful}} mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 {{no longer}} had the high bodywork behind the driver's seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a wishbone rear suspension with wide-based tube lower wishbones carrying coilover shocks. The upper wishbones though were, once again {{in the style of the}} Chapman strut, using the driveshafts themselves and a front radius rod. This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the driveshafts as an <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 321 was {{introduced}} {{at the start}} of 1939 as a successor to the BMW 320. It sat on a shortened version of the BMW 326 chassis. The 321 differed from the 320 in its front suspension, its larger tyres, and its styling. While the 320 used front suspension derived from the BMW 303, with a high mounted transverse leaf spring and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> the 321 used the front suspension from the 326, with <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and a low mounted transverse leaf spring.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} other D3 sedans, the Ford Taurus is {{configured}} with four-wheel independent suspension, featuring MacPherson struts and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a stabilizer bar {{in the front and}} a multilink coilover shock setup with stamped steel lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and cast <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> in the rear. As with the previous-generation Taurus (Five Hundred) and the Ford Crown Victoria, the sixth-generation Taurus features four-wheel antilock disc brakes. On all models, AdvanceTrac combines traction control and stability control. Torque Vectoring Control and Curve Control is an option for all-wheel drive models.|$|R
2500|$|The 1970 Javelins {{featured}} a new front-end design {{with a wide}} [...] "twin-venturi" [...] front grille incorporating the headlamps and a longer hood. It also had a new rear end with full-width taillamps and a single center-mounted backup light. This was a one-year-only design. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. The exterior rear view mirror {{featured a}} new [...] "aero" [...] design {{and in some cases}} matched the car's body color. The three [...] "Big Bad" [...] exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 Javelins, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers. Underneath the restyle was a new front suspension featuring ball joints, <b>upper</b> and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs, and shock absorbers above the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> as well as trailing struts on the lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and a strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E
50|$|With a MacPherson strut {{suspension}} system where {{the spring and}} shock absorber are combined in the one suspension unit which also replaces the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> the entire vertical suspension load is transmitted {{to the top of}} the vehicle's strut tower, unlike a double wishbone suspension where the spring and shock absorber may share the load separately. In general terms, a strut tower in a monocoque chassis is a reinforced portion of the inner wheel well and is not necessarily directly connected to the main chassis rails. For this reason there is inherent flex within the strut towers relative to the chassis rails.|$|E
5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} {{upper and lower}} control arms with coilover shocks. A common misconception with this platform is that the front end has struts; however, since there is an <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> they are actually coilover shocks. Brakes were a vented rotor / single-piston caliper with Sport model Thunderbirds receiving a larger diameter rotor. The rear suspension consisted of upper and lower control arms with coil spring and shock. Varying sway bar diameters were used among the different models of Cougar and Thunderbird. All MN12 cars shipped from the factory with a 5 x 4.25" [...] (5x108mm) lugnut bolt pattern.|$|E

50|$|On May 3, 2016, GM {{placed a}} recall on both 2016 model Suburbans and Yukon XLs over {{inadequate}} welds on its <b>upper</b> front <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> which {{could result in}} an accident or injury.|$|R
25|$|The XM, {{released}} in 1964, {{was the first}} Falcon with an Australian-designed body; the rear taillights were raised for Australian conditions and the front end received a full-wrap chrome grill and surrounds. The steering linkage was upgraded with 9/16-inch tie rods instead of the 1/2-inch tie rods found in the US models. The suspension was also improved with the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> lowered to reduce the notorious bump steer found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on {{the sixth}} lap. The second caution flew on lap 10 for a three-car wreck in Turn 2 involving Jeffrey Earnhardt, Gray Gaulding and Reed Sorenson. Austin Dillon, who took his car to the garage prior to the initial start for a broken track bar and <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> returned to the race 12 laps down. He said after the race that when he [...] "made a pace lap before the race I could feel something was broken. We {{had to go into}} the garage and make repairs before we could even start the race." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{cars with}} double {{wishbone}} suspensions, camber angle may be fixed or adjustable, but in MacPherson strut suspensions, it is normally fixed. The elimination of an available camber adjustment may reduce maintenance requirements, {{but if the}} car is lowered by use of shortened springs, the camber angle will change. Excessive camber angle can lead to increased tire wear and impaired handling. Significant suspension modifications may correspondingly require that the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> or strut mounting points be altered to allow for some inward or outward movement, relative to longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, for camber adjustment. Aftermarket plates with slots for strut mounts instead of just holes are available {{for most of the}} commonly modified models of cars.|$|E
5000|$|A raft {{of changes}} {{included}} a launch control system, stiffer engine and transmission mounts and retuned suspension. The suspension gained stiffer <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> bushes, stiffer upper strut mounts and retuned dampers at the front, with the rear gaining higher spring rates, retuned dampers, a larger anti-roll bar and reinforced lower control arms. The rear also gained a 9-inch wider wheel package shod with 275/35 R19 tyres and revised toe-link settings. This [...] "R-Spec" [...] also {{ended up being}} a louder car than the regular GT and GT-P despite no particular changes to that effect. The R-Spec split public and owners on not only looks but the package as well. For {{the first and only}} time Ford/FPV produced a car with major changes in drive and handling. Many existing FPV owners were quick to down play what was actually quiet a good package which significantly improved drive and performance.|$|E

The suspension was also improved with the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> lowered to reduce the notorious bump steer found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based.A coupé, in a two-door hardtop body style, was offered {{for the first time}} in both Falcon Deluxe and Falcon Futura trim levels.|$|R
2500|$|Also new, the {{double-wishbone}} front suspension had ball joints, <b>upper</b> {{and lower}} <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs and shock absorbers above the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> arms; {{as well as}} trailing struts on the lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The [...] "Magnum 500" [...] road wheels were now standard, but the new [...] "Machine" [...] 15x7inch slot-styled wheels were optional.|$|R
50|$|Solid axle suspension: For a {{solid axle}} the lower <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> forward and {{backward}} motion, the <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> {{forward and backward}} rotation. This rotation is present under acceleration and braking.|$|R
50|$|To {{be really}} successful, the MacPherson strut {{required}} {{the introduction of}} unitary construction, because it needs a substantial vertical space and a strong top mount, which unibodies can provide, while benefiting them by distributing stresses. The strut will usually carry both the coil spring on which the body is suspended and the shock absorber, which is usually {{in the form of}} a cartridge mounted within the strut (see coilover). The strut can also have the steering arm built into the lower outer portion. The whole assembly is very simple and can be preassembled into a unit; also by eliminating the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> it allows for more width in the engine compartment, which is useful for smaller cars, particularly with transverse-mounted engines such as most front wheel drive vehicles have. It can be further simplified, if needed, by substituting an anti-roll bar (torsion bar) for the radius arm. For those reasons, it has become almost ubiquitous with low cost manufacturers. Furthermore, it offers an easy method to set suspension geometry.|$|E
5000|$|The GTA had {{aluminium}} {{outer body}} panels instead of steel, (the inner steel panels were also of thinner gauge, {{the inner and}} outer panels were bonded and pop-riveted together), magnesium alloy wheels, clear plastic side windows, an aluminium rear <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> different door handles and quarter window mechanisms, and lightweight interior trim. The engine had a new double ignition cylinder head (called twin plug, later in the eighties the system was called twin spark) cylinder head with a Marelli distributor from a Ferrari Dino, 45 mm carburetors instead of 40 mm and magnesium camshaft cover, sump, timing cover and bell housing. The transmission gear ratios were closer than standard and the gears were machined for lightness and quicker shifting. Dry weight of the 1600 was approximately 1640 lb. In stradale form this car boasted approximately [...] (up from [...] ). In full race form this engine could produce up to [...] The 1600 GTA did not have a brake booster and had a thicker radiator than the standard vehicle. For homologation 500 cars were made for racing and road use.|$|E
5000|$|The Magna Sports was {{available}} in only four colours: Paris White, Calypso Red, Nautilus Blue (deep blue), and Frontier Green (deep green), the latter two colours being new to the TF series. This new model carried all the standard features of the Executive model on which it was based, plus a deck lid spoiler, red side strip, 16-inch alloy wheels (same as the Verada Ei, but polished), and unique interior trims such as a metal-style instrument cluster fascia. Its V6 was standard as on all Magnas, however, only the Sports could be optioned with a manumatic Sports Mode four-speed automatic transmission featuring {{for the first time}} on an Australian-built car, a manual shifting function (via a second transmission gate plane to the right of standard gear positions, with [...] "push-forward" [...] upshifts and [...] "push-back" [...] downshifts). The Sports had improved handling characteristics thanks to the addition of an 18 mm rear swaybar (a rear bar swaybar was not fitted to the standard Magna), 11 percent firmer rear springs, firmer <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and trailing arm bushes, and suspension height lowered by 10 mm. Options included dual airbags and ABS. This specific model represented MMAL's foray into the Australian sporty family passenger car sector, as well as an initial and long overdue departure from the more conservative Japanese product planning. The Sports' production ceased after September 1998.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{generation}} Quattroporte used an all-steel unibody structure.The chassis {{was related to}} that of the Maserati Kyalami, in turn derived from the De Tomaso Longchamp and therefore ultimately related to the De Tomaso Deauville luxury saloon.Front suspension was of the double wishbone type, with single coaxial dampers and coil springs and an anti-roll bar.The rear axle used a peculiar layout very similar to Jaguar independent rear suspension. Each cast aluminium hub carrier was linked to the chassis only by a single lower wishbone, the half shafts doubling as <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> and was sprung by twin coaxial dampers and coil springs units. Rear brakes were mounted inboard, the callipers bolted directly to the housing of the differential. The entire assembly was supported by a bushing-insulated crossbeam. Initially a Salisbury-type limited slip differential was used; in 1984 it was replaced by a more advanced Gleason-licensed Torsen—or [...] "Sensitork" [...] in Maserati parlance.|$|R
50|$|In an automobile, {{the spindle}} {{is a part}} of the {{suspension}} system that carries the hub for the wheel and attaches to the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The spindle is referred to as an upright in UK-built vehicles and in areas dominated by cars designed for the UK, like Australia, New Zealand etc.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2011 the GMC and Chevrolet heavy Duty's have being {{upgraded}} {{with a new}} fully boxed {{high strength}} steel frame from front to rear improving stiffness by 92% with bigger rear springs, larger engine and transmission mounts and new hydraulic body mounts to improve the ride.The front suspension incorporates new <b>upper</b> and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and new torsion bars tailored to one of five different gross axle weight ratings. <b>Upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms, while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity. Using a unique torsion bar for each gross weight rating allows for better control over vehicle height, resulting in improved handling and better alignment for reduced tire wear. These improvements allow {{for up to a}} 6,000 pound front axle weight rating, allowing all 4wd trucks to accommodate a snow plow.Additional front suspension enhancements come from new urethane bump stops, two per side. The upper shock mount has been changed from a single stem mount to a two-bolt design to eliminate the possibility of squeaks and thumps. The rear suspension design uses asymmetrical leaf springs that are wider and capable of greater load handling. The design features 3-inch wide leaves, with front and rear spring sections of different lengths to reduce the twisting that can result in axle hop and loss of traction. The 2500HD use a two-stage design with a rating of 6,200 lbs, and 3500HD models have a three-stage design with 7,050 lb and 9,375 lb ratings on single and dual-wheel models respectively ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Suspension {{system is}} major {{part in a}} vehicle, the {{wishbone}} <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> {{is a type of}} a independent suspension used in passenger car. In this work it is mainly concentrated on stiffness, slippage and damage of <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> The <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is subjected to different type of loads such as static loads and cyclic loads. Stiffness is improved by changing shape and size of <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> this is achieved by static analysis. This analysis is carried out to find displacement, stress and stiffness. Due to some loading conditions, slippage occurs in between arm and bush. In this work slippage analysis carried out to check whether slippage occurs in the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> Fatigue analysis carried out to determine the damage and life of <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design and {{manufacture}} an improved <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> for a 1988 - 1998 Chevrolet K 2500 truck. This component controls the suspension of a vehicle and will be redesigned to improve the many shortcomings of the current design. The objectives of this project were met by redesigning the stock <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> designing and manufacturing a weld fixture, manufacturing a prototype component, and performing a cost analysis. This component was designed to improve performance, reliability, serviceability and strength while maximizing manufacturability.

40|$|AbstractSimulation-based {{surrogate}} {{models have}} been used for a variety of applications in automotive industry. In this paper, based on the FEM analysis, both of the response surface model (RSM) and Kriging model are used to optimize an ADI <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> where the weight of the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is considered as the design objective, and the maximum allowable von Mises stress the constraint objective. The initial FEM analysis shows the stress distribution and maximum stress on the <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> under a very severe loading condition. And, by virtue of the result of FEM analyses, fifty simulations with six design variables are performed for RSM and Kriging model to construct the approximation of the weight and maximum stress to obtain the optimum result. The optimized results obtained by using RSM and KRG are confirmed by a verified FEM analysis. In addition, a fatigue analysis is carried out to verify the durability the final design...|$|E
50|$|The 1978 Fleetwood Brougham {{was built}} as body on frame construction. It used a ladder type frame with welded cross members. The front {{suspension}} used the traditional <b>upper</b> and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> integral steering knuckle, arm and caliper support, integral hubs and rotors on spindles, {{tapered roller bearings}} with spherical joint, independent coil springs, link-type stabilizer bar, and hydraulic Direct Action shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|A simple kingpin {{suspension}} {{requires that}} the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> (wishbones) have pivot axes that are parallel, and in strict geometric relationship to the kingpin, or {{the top and bottom}} trunnions, which connect the kingpin to the <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> would be severely stressed and the bearings would suffer severe wear. In practice, many vehicles had elastomeric bearings in the horizontal pivots of the trunnions, which allowed some small amount of flexibility, however this was insufficient to allow much adjustment of caster to be made, and also introduced compliance where the suspension designer may not have desired it in his quest for optimum handling. camber angle could generally be adjusted by moving both inner pivots of either the <b>upper</b> or lower <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> inwards or outwards by an exactly equal amount. But compliance of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> inner pivots, typically due to the use of elastomeric bearings, would again cause the trunnions to be stressed. The suspension designer's freedom was severely limited, it was necessary to have some compliance where it might not be wanted, and very little where more would have been useful in absorbing the fore and aft impact loading from bumps.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the GTO's late {{introduction}} (some {{three-fourths of}} the way through the model year) and the ambiguous nature - technically a violation of GM policy limiting intermediates to 330 CID, although the 1963 Pontiac Tempest/LeMans had already done this in 1963, and even though badged as a 326 the 63 Tempest V-8 was already at 336 CID, 1964 it became a true 326. - the Olds offering was a conservative package. Technically the [...] "B09 Police Apprehender Pursuit" [...] option, it used the four-barrel carbureted 330 CID (5.4 L) V8 with heavy-duty valve gear, and a hotter camshaft, raising rated (SAE gross) output to 310 hp (231.3 kW) at 5200 rpm. Torque remained 355 lbft Nm, although the torque peak rose from 2800 rpm to 3600 rpm. Also included was a stiffened frame, adjustable pinion angle by way of added holes in the frame mounts for the rear <b>upper</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> Muncie four-speed manual transmission, a heavy duty drive shaft connected to a 3.36:1 rear end, oversized brakes(155.6 vs 118sq.in lining area) and the heavy-duty police-package suspension, with heavy duty wheels, higher-rate coil springs front and rear, heavy-duty shock absorbers, a larger front anti-roll bar, an additional rear anti-roll bar bolted to a fully boxed lower <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> and dual snorkel air cleaner. Two-speed windshield wipers, A/C ($430), an AM/FM radio, an electronic trunk opener, and a tilt steering wheel ($43) were optional. [...] Unlike the 1965 4-4-2 model built in Lansing, the 1964 4-4-2 does not have an option code on the data plate. There is documentation available showing that the 1964 4-4-2 was built in both Lansing and Fremont.|$|R
