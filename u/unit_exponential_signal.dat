40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} least squares estimation of the parameters of two–dimensional (2 -D) <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> observed {{in the presence of}} an additive noise field, when the assumed number of exponentials is incorrect. We consider both the case where the number of <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> is underestimated, and the case where the number of <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> is overestimated. In the case where the number of <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> is underestimated, we prove the almost sure convergence of the least squares estimates (LSE) to the parameters of the dominant exponentials. In the case where the number of <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> is overestimated, the estimated parameter vector obtained by the least squares estimator contains a subvector that converges almost surely to the correct parameters of the exponentials.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{analysis}} of parameter variance statistics for the SVD-Prony method applied to damped <b>exponential</b> <b>signals.</b> We derive the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters for this method. The parameters include the magnitudes and angles of the poles, and the magnitudes and angles of the amplitude coefficients. We verify the theoretical results using Monte-Carlo simulations studies. We also compare the variance results to the corresponding Cram'er-Rao bounds for several cases. 1 Introduction The problem of estimating model parameters of noisy <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> is an active area of research. These models have a single set of complex poles and one or more set of amplitude coefficients (snapshots). The performance of these parameter estimation methods is often measured by {{the accuracy of the}} estimated poles, since these pole locations contain such information as formant frequencies or directions of arrival of signal components.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of frequency estimation of undamped superimposed <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> model. We propose two iterative techniques of frequency estimation using genetic algorithms. The proposed methods use an elitism based generational genetic algorithm for obtaining the least squares and the approximate least squares estimates. In the simulation studies, {{it is observed that}} the proposed methods give nearly efficient estimates, having mean square error almost attaining the corresponding Cramér-Rao lower bound. The proposed methods significantly do not depend on the initial guess values otherwise required for other iterative methods of frequency estimation. It is also observed that the proposed methods have fairly high breakdown point with respect to different types of outliers present in the data. Outlier robustness and accuracy of the proposed methods are compared with the classical approaches for this problem.

40|$|The general {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} asymptotic extraction of the signal series from the perturbed signal {{with the help of}} Singular Spectrum Analysis (briefly, SSA) was already outlined in Nekrutkin 2010, SII, v. 3, 297 [...] 319. In this paper we consider the example of such an analysis applied to the increasing <b>exponential</b> <b>signal</b> and the sinusoidal noise. It is proved that if the signal rapidly tends to infinity, then the so-called reconstruction errors of SSA do not uniformly tend to zero as the series length tends to infinity. More precisely, in this case any finite number of last terms of the error series do not tend to any finite or infinite values. On the contrary, for the "discretization" scheme with the bounded from above <b>exponential</b> <b>signal,</b> all elements of the error series tend to zero. This effect shows that the discretization model can be an effective tool in the theoretical SSA considerations with increasing signals. Comment: 19 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Signals are {{generally}} modeled as a superposition of exponential functions in spectroscopy of chemistry, biology and medical imaging. For fast data acquisition or other inevitable reasons, however, {{only a small}} amount of samples may be acquired and thus how to recover the full signal becomes an active research topic. But existing approaches can not efficiently recover N-dimensional <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> with N≥ 3. In this paper, we study the problem of recovering N-dimensional (particularly N≥ 3) <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> from partial observations, and formulate this problem as a low-rank tensor completion problem with exponential factor vectors. The full signal is reconstructed by simultaneously exploiting the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC structure and the exponential structure of the associated factor vectors. The latter is promoted by minimizing an objective function involving the nuclear norm of Hankel matrices. Experimental results on simulated and real magnetic resonance spectroscopy data show that the proposed approach can successfully recover full signals from very limited samples and is robust to the estimated tensor rank.

40|$|Abstract—Doppler Diversity is a {{technique}} in which complex <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> are used to shift the signals transmitted from the different transmit antennas. This results in making the effective channel seen by the data symbols to fade {{at a faster rate}} [1]. Discontinuous Doppler Diversity is {{a technique}} for OFDM systems in which the complex <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> are constant during the duration of an OFDM symbol. In this paper, we develop analytical expressions for Average Level Crossing Rate (LCR) and Average Fade Duration (AFD) of a subcarrier in an OFDM system under Discontinuous Doppler Diversity (DDoD). Owing to the discontinuous nature of the subcarrier channel in time domain [2], the traditional defintion for LCR of a random process[3] cannot be used. Instead a definition similar to the one used for defining LCR of an OFDM channel in frequency domain in [4] has to be used. Simulation results show that average LCR obtained using simulation and average LCR obtained using the analytical expression are in good agreement. We also derive analytical expressions for average LCR and AFD of the modified channel under Doppler Diversity. All the results are obtained for Rayleigh fading conditions. I...|$|R

30|$|A {{transient}} signal is traditionally {{represented by the}} parametric model consisting of a sum of complex exponentials, and the model parameters are estimated by Prony’s method (Henderson 1981; Kumaresan and Tufts 1982). Parameter estimation of the sum of complex <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> {{is closely related to}} the problem of system identification, because the impulse response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with distinct poles has the similar parametric form. Moreover, the sum of complex <b>exponential</b> <b>signals</b> provides a more general model than the sum of complex sinusoidal signals. In this way, the parametric representation can be extended from a stationary signal to a non-stationary signal, as explained in the sequel. When the signal derived from a multicomponent complex exponential random process is corrupted with white noise, an extension of Prony’s method to the second-order statistics domain can provide better accuracy of estimation of model parameters (Cadzow and Wu 1987; Sircar and Mukhopadhyay 1995). It should be mentioned, however, that special care is to be taken in the extension of the estimation technique to the higher order statistics domain because the signal being modeled is non-stationary in nature (Sircar and Mukhopadhyay 1995), and the cumulants of a non-stationary process are, in general, time-dependent.|$|R
