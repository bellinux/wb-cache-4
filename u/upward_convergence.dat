They will accommodate to them in a phenomenon known as <b>upward</b> <b>convergence.</b> The opposite, downward convergence, where a higher-status person accommodates to a lower status person, is much rarer. This accommodation is thought to happen mainly among adults in Western societies, not children or adolescents, because in those societies children and adolescents have much more self-centred, narrower peer groups. In societies where standardisation is generally something that adults do, children and adolescents perform other kinds of levelling.|$|E
40|$|People {{are social}} being {{who need to}} {{interact}} with other people. Thus, they have developed patterned {{ways of doing things}} and talking about them (Lado, 1984 : 24). As a result, language is needed {{in order to be able}} to make an interaction with other people. Concerning the importance of language in life it might be a reason why people begin to learn other people's languages in order to be able to communicate with one and another (Renkema, 1993 : 7). Learning other languages can be promoted also in the classroom in a foreign language setting. The problem of learning a foreign language in a non English country is in providing the natural condition for the pupils. Therefore, the teacher should use the appropriate way to maintain the interaction in the classroom. Based on the writer's experience, there are still a lot of difficulties found by the English teachers to accommodate their speeches in order to maintain an interaction in teaching, especially in teaching English as a foreign or second language. One of the common problems encountered by an English teacher as a strong motivator is to provide and increase the effectiveness of their speeches to improve pupils' abilities in acquiring the target language. The teacher can adopt a way taken from the field of sociolinguistics called "speech accommodation". Inspired by this theory and her experience, the writer was encouraged to conduct the study under discussion. In this thesis, the writer observed the utterances of two English teachers of the third grade at Intan Permata Hati Surabaya. She investigated kinds of speech accommodation which were particularly delivered by those teachers and the social functions of speech accommodation that they used. In analyzing the data, the writer recorded the classroom discourses of those teachers. Then, she transcribed them and categorized them by using the parameter which has been set up. The finding revealed that those teachers had the same styles in delivering their speeches. They both frequently delivered their speeches in the form of speech <b>upward</b> <b>convergence</b> accommodation. In addition, the use of speech <b>upward</b> <b>convergence</b> used by those teachers functioned as a way to develop of a topic discussion in order to maintain an interaction with the pupils. Through the analysis, it can be concluded that the desires of those teachers by adjusting their speeches in <b>upward</b> <b>convergence</b> is to get along well with their pupils in order to maintain the interaction with their pupils in the classroom. Finally, the writer can provide some suggestions for the English teachers who are willing to be creative in promoting pupils' acquiring the target language by developing the way of speech adjustment in order to maintain the interaction...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to contribute, in the {{theoretical}} and empirical sense, to better understanding the challenges of the EU welfare regimes and how particular regimes react on them. Despite significant differences among the EU welfare regimes, it is real to expect that they will converge because of the common challenges confronting them. In this paper, using the model of sigma and beta convergence, we are trying to predict the possible direction of convergence in the sense that Europe will go toward to more or less generosity or in other words it will converge downward or upward. The downward convergence means the strengthen competition among existing welfare regimes, in order to maintain and/or attract capital, that could reduce the social spending generosity. On the other hand, the <b>upward</b> <b>convergence</b> above involves the strengthening of coordination among existing welfare regimes according to the values of solidarity and social justice, which characterise not only the most developed EU countries but also the supranational European social model. ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Intracranial germinomas {{are usually}} {{situated}} in the pineal, but sometimes they arise in the infundibular region of the third ventricle (ectopic pinealoma) and may rarely extend down into the pituitary fossa. Two cases of germinoma arising within the pituitary gland and presenting with hypopituitarism, are described; no report of any similar cases could be found. Intracranial germinomas usually arise in the pineal gland, when they may present with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure from obstructive hydro-cephalus, impaired <b>upward</b> gaze, <b>convergence,</b> ptosis and pupillary disturbance (Parinaud syn-drome), and even precocious puberty. Less fre-quently, they commence in the infundibular region of the third ventricle when diabetes insipidus may be the presenting symptom. From this situation, the tumour may rarely extend downwards into the pituitary fossa, although only four examples {{have been found in}} the literature. '- 3 We present two intrasellar germinomas which arose within the pituitary gland. The first extended through the suprasellar cisterns to elevate and splay apart the anterior recesses of the third ventricle; the second was confined entirely within the sella.

40|$|For {{the last}} twenty years, European {{integration}} has been characterised by an imbalance between economic and social policies.

40|$|This PhD thesis studies {{three aspects}} of {{competition}} in pharmaceutical markets {{using data from the}} EU, and recommends appropriate policies to address inefficiencies. The first study examines the effect of patent expiry on originator drug prices in the presence of price regulation. Using econometric panel data methods, I find that neither generic entry nor generic market penetration affect the prices of originator drugs downwards. Instead, prices of originator drugs often appear to increase post-generic entry. Findings suggest that no savings to health services should be expected post-patent expiry if the originator product is dispensed, and any savings occur solely from generic uptake. The second study examines whether generic entry leads to a switch in total consumption (both originator and generic) from an off-patent branded molecule to a different in-patent molecule of the same therapeutic class. Using panel data analysis, I find that a switch in consumption post-patent expiry took place for the first ACE inhibitor which went off-patent, and in some cases for the second and third product. Such a switch leads to increased costs because it removes any substitution power from health authorities. The third study examines the effects of parallel trade on price competition. The topic is first approached from a game-theoretic point of view, predicting that parallel trade does not trigger price competition. Descriptive statistics demonstrate differences, if any, between prices of locally sourced and parallel traded products in the presence of different regulatory policies. Finally, the econometric analysis shows that there is <b>upward</b> price <b>convergence</b> in the presence of parallel trade. However, some regulatory interventions may lead to a spread between prices of locally sourced products and parallel traded products. Findings suggest that parallel trade should not always be considered a cost-containment mechanism and other ways to address rising pharmaceutical expenditures should be considered...|$|R

The model system COSMO-ART (Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling-Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases) in which the emission and transport of mineral dust {{as well as the}} radiation feedback are taken into account, was used. The emission of mineral dust between 9 and 14 September 2006 occurred in association with the relatively strong monsoon flow and northeasterly trade winds, with gust fronts of convective systems over land, and with the Atlantic inflow. Additionally, increased surface wind speed was linked to orographical effects at the Algerian Mountains, Atlas Mountains, and the Hoggar. The dust, as part of the Saharan air layer, is transported at low levels by the monsoon flow, the Harmattan, the northeasterly trade winds, and the monsoon trough, and is transported <b>upward</b> in the <b>convergence</b> zone between Harmattan and monsoon flow, in the baroclinic zone along the West African coastline, and by convection. At around 700  hPa the dust is transported by the African easterly jet. Dry and dust-free air is found to the north-northwest of the developing tropical depression due to descent in an anticyclone.

While the methodology used to determine convergence differs from the common cross-sectional approach, it corroborates Baumol's finding of a convergence club among the world's wealthiest countries.

The group of wealthy countries is characterized by what may be referred to as <b>upward</b> <b>convergence,</b> where the poorer group members catch up with the richer countries. The group of extremely poor countries exhibits downward convergence, or a reduction in income disparity brought about by nearly zero, or even negative, growth by the group's `wealthier' members.

Also, rural ageing is not observed at aggregate levels in rural regions of the developing world. Perhaps the main adverse demographic trend of rural populations is the high dependency ratios brought about by higher fertility rates.

40|$|This {{commentary}} {{looks at}} the (macro-economic) stabilisation properties of a potential European unemployment benefits scheme (EUBS). Any such scheme would of course involve many other aspects, both political and economic; for instance, {{it could be argued}} that an EUBS, especially one that pays benefits directly to individuals, would constitute a powerful illustration of the benefits of ‘Europe’. It might also be argued that the creation of an EUBS could foster the <b>upward</b> <b>convergence</b> of unemployment systems. But these issues are not considered here. Our concentration on the stabilisation aspect points to one direct implication: emphasis should be placed on the short-term unemployed. But the short-term unemployed make up ‘only’ about one-half of total unemployment at present. It is thus clear that the stabilisation aspect can cover only a part of the overall unemployment problem. Moreover, the share of the short-term unemployed varies greatly over time and across countries. This paper does not advocate the creation of an EUBS; it merely investigates the stabilisation properties of such a system, and as such constitutes a companion to “A European Unemployment Benefits Scheme: The rationale and the challenges ahead”, 1 which makes ample reference to the vast academic literature on this issue...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of tropical cyclones (TCs) {{to changes in}} parameterized convection is investigated to improve the simulation of TCs in the North Atlantic. Specifically, the impact of reducing {{the influence of the}} Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert (RAS) scheme-based parameterized convection is explored using the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS 5) model at 0. 25 ° horizontal grid spacing. The years 2005 and 2006 characterized by very active and inactive hurricane seasons, respectively, are selected for simulation. A reduction in parameterized deep convection results in an increase in TC activity (e. g., TC number and longer life cycle) to more realistic levels compared to the baseline control configuration. The vertical and horizontal structure of the strongest simulated hurricane shows the maximum wind speed greater than 60 ms- 1 and the minimum sea level pressure reaching ~ 940 mb, which are never achieved by the control configuration. The radius of the maximum wind of ~ 50 km, the location of the warm core exceeding 10 °C, and the horizontal compactness of the hurricane center are all quite realistic without any negatively affecting the atmospheric mean state. This study reveals that an increase in the threshold of minimum entrainment suppresses parameterized deep convection by entraining more dry air into the typical plume. This leads to cooling and drying at the mid- to upper-troposphere, along with the positive latent heat flux and moistening in the lower-troposphere. The resulting increase in conditional instability provides an environment that is more conducive to TC vortex development and <b>upward</b> moisture flux <b>convergence</b> by dynamically resolved moist convection, thereby increasing TC activity. ope...|$|R

40|$|Each {{country has}} its own history of welfare state but {{generally}} within a common system of values and finality: a peaceful society and a ‘good society ’ based on universal values. After the Second World War, during the golden age, {{the differences between the}} levels of social welfare were often conceived as a lag effect, more or less in a similar way to the notion of takeoff in economic development.

Convergence in the social welfare systems of the most developed countries has been very often analysed in a large number of papers and books.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify and discuss the reasons for this finding and to present new evidence confirming convergence in health outcomes, as represented by life expectancy and infant mortality rates. The statistical methods used, s and b-convergence analysis, are well established in macro-economic growth analyses and based on the neo-classical growth model which predicts convergence in income for homogenous countries such as those forming the EU. The analyses reveal a common trend in that Southern Mediterranean countries have generally exhibited <b>upward</b> <b>convergence</b> towards the mean in health expenditure, and convergence towards the EU mean in improving directions for health outcomes. In contrast, EU countries of the North, particularly those of Scandinavia, exhibit downward convergence towards the EU mean or below it in health expenditure, whilst their health outcome measures have generally been displaying a decreasing advantage over the EU mean over the periods of analysis. The results are briefly considered in relation to the factors that help to explain the results, including the question of whether a causal relationship between health expenditure and health outcomes exists, the nature and impact of health care reforms throughout the 1970 s, 80 s and 90 s in countries contributing most to the observed convergence, and the predictions of the neoclassical growth model which underpin the results. convergence, divergence, health expenditure, health outcomes, causal relationship...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study aims to {{investigate}} the role of spatial and temporal physical, biological and biogeochemical gradients on sediment biogeochemistry along a macrotidal and Si-rich estuary. Scanning and biogeochemical analyses were performed in the inner, mid and outer Aulne Estuary (France) at four seasons. The inner estuary shows high diagenetic activity linked to fluid mud dynamics and river loads. The highest authigenic phosphorus (Aut-P) concentrations ever {{found in the literature}} are observed in the inner estuary (18 µmol g- 1 PS sediment). This is explained by a combination of favorable factors, i. e. the high organic matter and nutrient loads, the reductive conditions, the freshwater properties (low pH, OH-, sulfate and Mg 2 + concentrations), the increase of particle residence time by the <b>upward</b> <b>convergence</b> of particles due to residual currents, and allochthonous riverine Aut-P. We suggest that the high Si(OH) 4 concentrations (> 400 µM) may even increase Aut-P precipitation through the increase of Fe-P formation in these low salinity conditions. In the mid estuary, erosion-deposition dynamics dominate in point bars and lead to the succession of poor and rich organic and authigenic phosphorus layers, recording thus the seasonality of matter loads and its seasonal translocation from the inner estuary. In the outer estuary, deposition rates are high and constant and biogeochemical properties are characteristic of marine environments. The precipitation of Aut-P from free phosphate (PO 43 -) is lower than in the inner estuary and might be limited by higher Mg 2 + concentrations in saline waters. This study highlights that small macrotidal estuaries, and especially their freshwater sediments, may constitute an important phosphorus sink through the precipitation of Aut-P. This precipitation could even be enhanced in fresh or brackish environments, thus increasing long term phosphorus storage and altering benthic fluxes of PO 43 - to the pelagic ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{systematic}} {{experimental study of}} the flow behaviour resulting from liquid-liquid impacts has been conducted. Numerous new flow behaviours have been identified including microbubble formation from floating drops, pre-entrapment jetting, multiple primary bubble entrapment, downward jets penetrating the entrapped bubble, the break-up of the downward jets to leave drops entrapped inside the entrapped bubble and small vortex ring formation {{in the early stages}} of the post-entrapment jetting regime. These new flow phenomena have been combined with existing flow behaviour to produce the most comprehensive maps (both quantitative and qualitative) describing the splashing morphology of liquid-liquid impacts to date. It was found that six different flow regimes were required to adequately categorise all the flow behaviour. The physics of the cavity formation and collapse were investigated with high speed video and high framing rate particle image velocimetry. The formation and collapse of the cavity can be described as a six stage process. Initially, the cavity expands due to the inertia of the impact and the majority of the displaced fluid is driven into the wave swell. After the energy of the impact has been dissipated, the side walls of the cavity stagnate and the growth of the wave swell also stagnates. This causes the fluid contained in the wall swell to begin flowing downward under the influence of gravity. As the fluid flows down, the base of the cavity stops growing and begins to retract. These actions give rise to a vortex mid way down the cavity and acts to collapse the cavity. The fluid driven by the vortex then converges at the base of the cavity along the axis of symmetry. The formation of the vortex was shown to be centred around a stationary line that forms on the cavities interface. Several interesting properties of this stationary line were discovered. The depth at which the stationary line forms is almost constant for the same drop size and is independent of impact velocity. The dimensionless width of the cavity, Dw ' was shown to scale to Fr 1 3. The formation of the stationary line was also shown to influence how the flow converges at the base. The wider the cavity grows, the greater the rotation the fluid undergoes before converging along the axis of symmetry. Thus, for small width cavities the flow tends to converge while the fluid is being directed downward. While for larger width cavities, the flow tends to converge with a strong upward component. This has lead to the formulation of three different flow convergence criteria: downward convergence, parallel convergence and <b>upward</b> <b>convergence.</b> All jetting modes or lack of jetting can be described using one of the three convergence criteria. For cavities that are small and thus have a downward flow convergence condition, no jetting occurs. This type of flow convergence occurs in the primary vortex ring regime and may assist in the development of strong coherent vortex rings. A parallel flow convergence condition is responsible for forming high-speed jets in both the preentrapment jetting and primary bubble entrapment regimes. Here, the flow is similar to two parallel jets impinging on each other. This action forms a stagnation point and a significant rise in the local pressure around this zone follows. This leads to a strong inertial force that drives a small jet of fluid back up into the cavity. Cavity retraction acceleration was measured as high as 90 000 g during this time. The maximum exit velocity of the secondary drops formed from the break up of the thin high-speed jets was measured to be in excess of 30 m/s. In the primary bubble entrapment regime it was postulated that multiple stagnation points would form and interact with each other to produce variable jet velocities across the regime. The retraction velocity of the cavity was also shown to have a direct correlation with the exit velocity of the first drop. An upward flow convergence condition was found to be responsible for the thick slow moving jets observed in the post-entrapment jetting regime. All modes of bubble entrapment were investigated and the quantity of air each mode can entrap has been estimated. It was found that the most efficient method to produce microbubbles was by forming jets in the post-entrapment jetting regime that pinch off secondary drops with Weber numbers ranging from 6 to 20. This produces drops that fall into the primary microbubble entrapment regime to produce thin films that rupture into thousands of microbubbles. Methods for determining the volume of entrapped air from the break up based on the rupture velocity of the film are presented. The entrapped air in the bulk fluid is equivalent on average to 0. 3...|$|E
