Golden medal for bravery was awarded to only seven persons and five of them was awarded posthumous. Also, two Golden medals for bravery were awarded to flags of two Croatian units.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} style of lapel, the notched lapel, [...] {{originated}} in older types of jacket or coat that buttoned to the neck, by unbuttoning and turning back {{the upper part}} of the closure at an angle indoors or in hot weather, and then removing the <b>upper</b> <b>buttons.</b> The <b>upper</b> points are derived from the end corners of the collar. This can be duplicated by similarly turning back the closure in a modern button-to-the-neck garment such as an outdoor coat or a boilersuit. Sometimes when caught outside in bad weather in a lapelled jacket and nothing over it, its wearer may unfold the lapels and hold them that way to temporarily reproduce the ancestral to-the-neck closure.|$|R

5000|$|The {{lower strap}} button is usually {{located at the}} bottom (bridge end) of the body. The <b>upper</b> strap <b>button</b> is usually located near or at the top (neck end) of the body: on the upper body curve, {{at the tip of}} the upper [...] "horn" [...] (on a double cutaway), or at the neck joint (heel). Some electrics, {{especially}} those with odd-shaped bodies, have one or both strap buttons on the back of the body. Some Steinberger electric guitars, owing to their minimalist and lightweight design, have both strap buttons at the bottom of the body. Rarely, on some acoustics, the <b>upper</b> strap <b>button</b> is located on the headstock. Some acoustic and classical guitars only have a single strap button at the bottom of the body—the other end must be tied onto the headstock, above the nut and below the machine heads.|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel rose to {{his feet}} and applied himself {{apparently}} to the single and silent inflation of his chest, for the space of a minute. When the <b>upper</b> <b>buttons</b> of his coat seemed to be on the point of flying off with a report, he suddenly extended his hand and grasped Dumphy's with fervour. [...] "Permit me," [...] he said, in a voice husky with emotion, [...] "to congratulate myself on dealing with a gentleman and a man of honour. Your sentiments, sir, I don't care if I do say it, do you credit! I am proud, sir," [...] continued the Colonel, warmly, [...] "to have made your acquaintance! But I regret to say, sir, that I cannot give you the information you require. I do not myself know the name or address of my client." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, shoes with high <b>uppers,</b> <b>buttoned</b> or laced and {{reaching}} {{to the lower}} calves, were common footwear for women. Rising hemlines made longer styles of boots popular, particularly when the alternative was exposure of the leg, which was still considered shocking. In 1913, Denise Poiret, wife of celebrated French couturier Paul Poiret, caused a sensation in Paris and New York by wearing knee-length boots in wrinkled Morocco leather. Designed by her husband and made by the bottier Favereau, these boots were styled with a low heel and a square toe; she had versions in red, white, green, and yellow In 1915 the New York Times reported that, partly inspired by Mme. Poiret, these so-called [...] "Russian boots" [...] were becoming an outré statement by some cutting-edge fashionable women. However, no boots of any kind caught on with the general public in these years, women being accustomed to traditional high-top shoes, either laced or buttoned. [...] Russian boots remained a forward fashion statement, however, adopted by stage and film stars, including Mary Pickford, Irene Castle, Cécile Sorel and Gloria Swanson, and endorsed by such leading designers as the London-based Lucile (Lady Duff Gordon), who also famously wore them herself.|$|R
5000|$|The {{watch is}} {{controlled}} by three side-mounted pushbuttons. The <b>upper</b> left <b>button</b> turns on the backlight, cancels the alarm, resets the stopwatch or marks the split (lap) time, and is used for selecting settings. The lower left button cycles the modes of the watch: time display, alarm, stopwatch, and time/date adjustment. The button {{on the right is}} the function button: when used it starts and stops the stopwatch, changes the settings currently being adjusted, or switches between the 12- and 24-hour modes, depending on what mode the watch is currently in. In time mode, pressing this button for three seconds will make the display read [...] "CASIo" [...] if the watch has genuine parts or ones produced under legitimate license. Pressing all three buttons at the same time will fill all the cells on the LCD until any button is pressed again.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Through stimulus–response {{compatibility}} {{we tested}} whether sound frequency (pitch height) elicits a mental spatial representation. Musical-ly untrained and, mostly, trained participants were shown a stimulus–response compatibility effect (Spatial–Musical Association of Response Codes or SMARC effect). When response alternatives were either vertically or horizon-tally aligned, performance was better when the lower (or leftward) button {{had to be}} pressed {{in response to a}} low sound and the <b>upper</b> (or rightward) <b>button</b> had to be pressed in response to a high sound, even when pitch height was irrelevant to the task...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{a bright}} Sunday afternoon; the scene is a secluded little seat half-way {{down the front of}} the Leas, and Kipps is four years older than when he parted from Ann. There is a quite {{perceptible}} down upon his upper lip, and his costume is just as tremendous a [...] "mash" [...] as lies within his means. His collar is so high that it scars his inaggressive jawbone, and his hat has a curly brim, his tie shows taste, his trousers are modestly brilliant, and his boots have light cloth <b>uppers</b> and <b>button</b> at the side. He jabs at the gravel before him with a cheap cane, and glances sideways at Flo Bates, the young lady from the cash desk. She is wearing a brilliant blouse and a gaily trimmed hat. There is an air of fashion about her that might disappear under the analysis of a woman of the world, but which is quite sufficient to make Kipps very proud to be distinguished as her particular [...] "feller," [...] and to be allowed at temperate intervals to use her Christian name.|$|R
5000|$|Chromatic harmonicas {{are often}} {{described}} as either [...] "straight tuned" [...] or [...] "cross tuned". This refers {{to the way the}} slider is shaped to isolate the reed set being played at a given position (button [...] "in" [...] or button [...] "out"). Traditionally the chromatic was [...] "straight tuned" [...] and the slider selected either the <b>upper</b> reed-plate (<b>button</b> out) or the lower reed-plate (button in). In the later half of the 20th century a new system came into use in which the slider played the upper and lower reed-plates at the same time, staggered by which hole (thus with the button out the player might play the upper reed-plate in hole 1, the lower reed-plate in hole 2, and then the upper again in hole 3 and so forth; pressing the button reversed this). This allows for a larger hole in the slider, and thus presumably more air gets through, allowing a louder volume. The two methods co-exist with some companies and players preferring one style and others another.|$|R
5000|$|The GP32 (Game Park 32-bit), {{their first}} system, was then being designed. Several {{iterations}} {{of it were}} developed, including a metallic look, and a style issued from the original Game Boy design, and a flat panel with a screen on the <b>upper</b> part and <b>buttons</b> on the lower part. Those systems were shown at the 2000 Tokyo Game Show but failed to catch attention with their inferior hardware and games. After five years of development, Game Park opted for a more plastic look, {{a lot like the}} Game Boy Advance. Game Park's new handheld also had a major internal hardware upgrade making it more powerful than the GBA.The age limit of the game is 10 and over ...|$|R
5000|$|Common to all Spirit {{models is}} the flat top and back. One control cavity is routed {{into the rear}} of the guitar. All spirits have a double-cutaway design, with the upper horn {{slightly}} longer than the lower. The neck is set (glued) into the body and has 22 frets with pearl dot inlays. Some models have flamed/tiger maple tops and transparent/sunburst finishes. Truss rod covers on Spirit models vary, with most simply saying [...] "Spirit" [...] or [...] "Spirit Made By Gibson" [...] (on Epiphone models). Humbuckers are Gibson 1959 Les Paul Reissue models (sometimes called [...] "Tim Shaw" [...] pickups after the Gibson engineer who led the design team). Some of these pickups have white coils and get mistaken for Dirty Fingers, but they are medium-output alnico pickups, whereas Dirty Fingers are high-output ceramic pickups. Early models have the <b>upper</b> strap <b>button</b> located {{on the back of the}} guitar at the neck joint, while later models have a strap button at the tip of the upper horn. Tuners are typically the Kluson-type [...] "tulip" [...] knob tuners, though some Spirits (particularly XPL models) have enclosed tuners.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Indigenous {{societies}} {{around the}} world are stepping forward to assert their place as an equal partner in their nation’s future. In many cases, these efforts have been undertaken in response to the development and the 2007 publication of the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as endorsed by the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations. Governments also have begun to reconsider their stance on the associated issues. The digital texts of 189 international constitutions – as offered by the Constitute Web site – were examined for occurrences of the four tokens indigenous, aboriginal, and Indian or Indians to yield country indices. Documents from forty countries were found to contain the term indigenous and seven possessed aboriginal (N uses = 320 and 19, respectively). The more familiar token Indian, or its plural, occurred 88 times in ten of these political affirmations.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of these activities. Two short {{comments}} must be made to make our research standpoint clearer. First, our purpose is to generate referring actions that model human referring actions in mundane situations. Theoretically speaking, as Appelt pointed out, it is enough for referring to provide sufficient description to distinguish one object from other candidates [Appelt 85]. For example, a pointing action to the object must be enough, or description of the object's position, such as "the <b>upper</b> left <b>button</b> of the dial buttons" also must be considered sufficient. However, we often observe referring actions that consist of a linguistic expression, "a small button with the mark of a handset above and {{to the left of the}} dial buttons", accompanied with a pointing gesture. Such a referring action is familiar to us even though it is redundant from a theoretical viewpoint. Our objective is to generate such familiar referring actions, and is rather different from those of [Appelt 85] and [Dale 91]. Second, in our research, a referring action is considered as the entire sequence of actions needed for allowing the addressee to identify the intended object and incorporating its achievement into part of the participants' shared knowledge. In order to refer to an object in a box, an imperative sentence such as "Open the box, and look inside" may be used. Such a request shifts the addressee's attention, and to see it as a part of the referring action may be problematic. It is, however, reasonable to think that both the request for looking into the box and the assertion of the fact that an object is in the box come from different plans for achieving the same goal, identifying the object. As Cohen claimed that it is useful to understand referring expressions from t [...] ...|$|R
