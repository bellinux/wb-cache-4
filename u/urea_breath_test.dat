5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The current, {{arbitrarily}} defined {{gold standard}} for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection requires histologic examination of two specially stained antral biopsy specimens. However, routine histology is potentially limited in general clinical practice by both sampling and observer error. The current {{study was designed to}} examine the diagnostic performance of invasive and non-invasive H. pylori detection methods that would likely be available in general clinical practice. METHODS: The diagnostic performance of rotating clinical pathology faculty using thiazine staining was compared with that of an expert gastrointestinal pathologist in 38 patients. In situ hybridization stains of adjacent biopsy cuts were also examined by the expert pathologist for further comparison. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate whether the diagnostic performance of the expert pathologist differed depending upon the histologic method employed. A similar analysis was made to evaluate the diagnostic performance of pathology trainees relative to the expert. In the absence of an established invasive gold standard, non-invasive testing methods (rapid serum antibodies, formal Elisa antibodies and carbon- 14 <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>testing)</b> were evaluated in 74 patients by comparison with a gold standard defined using a combination of diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Using either rapid urease testing of biopsy specimens or <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> as the {{gold standard for}} comparison, the diagnostic performance of the rotating clinical pathology faculty was inferior to that of the expert gastrointestinal pathologist especially with regard to specificity (e. g., 69 percent for the former versus 88 percent, with the latter relative to rapid urease testing). Although interpretation of in situ hybridization staining by the expert appeared to have an even higher specificity, ROC analysis failed to show a difference. The mean ROC areas for thiazine and in situ hybridization staining for trainee pathologists relative to the expert were 0. 88 and 0. 94, respectively. In untreated patients, <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent as compared with thiazine staining with a sensitivity of 83 percent and a specificity of 97 percent. Post-therapy, <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> had a sensitivity of 100 percent but a specificity of only 86 percent as compared with invasive testing with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent. Rapid serum antibody testing and formal Elisa antibody testing agreed in 93 percent of cases (Kappa 0. 78) with the rapid test being correct in three of the four disagreements. CONCLUSIONS: The current study illustrates a number of realities regarding H. pylori diagnosis. There is no diagnostic gold standard in general clinical practice. Accurate interpretation of specially stained slides is a learned activity with a tendency towards overdiagnosis early on. <b>Urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> {{is likely to be the}} diagnostic method of choice for untreated patients in general clinical practice although antibody testing is almost as accurate.

Our {{aim was to}} evaluate the duration of time needed for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori by the BreathID ® System. Methods This is a retrospective multicenter chart review study. Test location, date, delta over baseline, and duration of the entire test were recorded. Consecutively 13 C <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> results were extracted from the files over a nine year period. Results Of the 12, 791 tests results, 35. 1 % were positively diagnosed and only 0. 1 % were inconclusive. A statistically significant difference in prevalence among the countries was found: Germany showing the lowest, 13. 3 %, and Israel the highest, 44. 1 %. Significant {{differences were found in}} time to diagnosis: a positive diagnosis had the shortest and an inconclusive result had the longest. Overall test duration averaged 15. 1 minutes in Germany versus approximately 13 minutes in other countries. Diagnosis was achieved after approximately 9 minutes in Israel, Italy and Switzerland, but after 10 on average in the others. The mean delta over baseline value for a negative diagnosis was 1. 03 ± 0. 86, (range, 0. 9 - 5), versus 20. 2 ± 18. 9, (range, 5. 1 - 159. 4) for a positive one.

50|$|Common causes {{include the}} {{bacteria}} Helicobacter pylori and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Other less common causes include tobacco smoking, stress due to serious illness, Behcet disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, Crohn disease and liver cirrhosis, among others. Older {{people are more}} sensitive to the ulcer-causing effects of NSAIDs. The diagnosis is typically suspected due to the presenting symptoms with confirmation by either endoscopy or barium swallow. H. pylori can be diagnosed by testing the blood for antibodies, a <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> testing the stool for signs of the bacteria, or a biopsy of the stomach. Other conditions that produce similar symptoms include stomach cancer, coronary heart disease, and inflammation of the stomach lining or gallbladder inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Ulcers of the {{duodenum}} commonly {{occur because}} of infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. These bacteria, {{through a number}} of mechanisms, erode the protective mucosa of the duodenum, predisposing it to damage from gastric acids. The first part of the duodenum is the most common location of ulcers as it is where the acidic chyme meets the duodenal mucosa before mixing with the alkaline secretions of the duodenum. Duodenal ulcers may cause recurrent abdominal pain and dyspepsia, and are often investigated using a <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> to test for the bacteria, and endoscopy to confirm ulceration and take a biopsy. If managed, these are often managed through antibiotics that aim to eradicate the bacteria, and PPIs and antacids to reduce the gastric acidity.|$|E

30|$|Helicobacter pylori is the causative {{agent of}} gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), MALT {{lymphoma}} and {{a risk factor}} {{in the development of}} gastric cancer (Blaser and Berg 2001). It has also been classified as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monogr Eval Carcinog Risks Hum 1994 (an arm of WHO) in 1994. The mode of transmission still unknown, although epidemiologic studies suggest close person to person contact, intrafamilial spread. There is still uncertainty whether transmission occurs primarily through faecal-oral or gastric-oral route (Covacci et al., 1999). There are various tests for H. pylori diagnoses broadly categorized into two: invasive and non-invasive (Mégraud and Lehours 2007). Invasive methods require endoscopy while the non-invasive methods do not. The invasive methods include culture (which is the gold standard), Rapid urease tests (RUT), histology, direct gram stain, PCR based methods and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The non-invasive methods include serology (which does not measure active infection), <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> (UBT) (both 13 C and 14 C, gold standard, which is an expensive test and cannot be available in routine clinical laboratories), Helicobacter pylori stool antigen tests (HpSA) (Mégraud and Lehours 2007).|$|R

(2) Reduce ulcer recurrence and prevent the overuse of chronic anti-secretory medications in PUD patients. Key points ■ Clinical approach. Ulcers are caused by an infection of a bacterium known as Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori. Eradication of HP infection alters {{the natural history of}} peptic ulcer disease. Successful eradication reduces PUD recurrence rate from 90 % to < 5 % per year [A*]. PUD generally does not recur in the successfully treated patient unless nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is present. ■ Diagnosis.

[evidence: C*] Testing for active HP infection (stool antigen or <b>urea</b> <b>breath</b> <b>testing)</b> is more appropriate than serology testing in areas with low prevalence of active HP infection to reduce unnecessary treatment of individuals without active HP infection. ■ Treatment.

Sensitized New-Zealand White Rabbits underwent bronchoscopic infection with either Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rabbits were treated with 25 mg/kg of isoniazid (INH) approximately 2 months after infection when significant cavitary lung pathology was present. [(13) C] urea was instilled directly into the lungs of intubated rabbits at selected time points, exhaled air samples analyzed, and the kinetics of delta(13) CO(2) formation were determined. Samples obtained prior to inoculation served as control samples for background (13) CO(2) conversion in the rabbit model. (13) CO(2), from metabolic conversion of [(13) C]-urea by mycobacterial urease activity, was readily detectable in the exhaled breath of infected rabbits within 15 minutes of administration. Analyses showed a rapid increase in the rate of (13) CO(2) formation both early in disease and prior to treatment with INH.

40|$|Dyspepsia {{is defined}} as {{symptoms}} related to the upper gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 25 % of western populations complain of dyspeptic symptoms each year. 70 % {{of them do not}} have an organic cause and symptoms are related to the so-called functional dyspepsia, characterized by epigastric pain, early satiety, and/or fullness during or after a meal occurring at least weekly and for at least 6 months according to ROME III criteria.
