The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an <b>unequal</b> <b>tension</b> between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to justify and {{validate}} osteopathic motion-testing diagnosis of simulated vertebral segments. Background. Previous studies have tested intra and inter-observer reliability for spinal evaluation using anteriorposterior translational springing. Inter-observer reliability in these studies has been poor compared with intra-observer reliability when testing on human subjects. Simulated models equipped with calibrated springs have been proven to be a reliable onedimensional stiffness stimulus for the evaluation of stiffness at a specific vertebral segment. Methods. Approximately 80 second year osteopathic medical students at Nova Southeastern University, College of Osteopathic medicine participated in the study. They performed testing on a wooden spring model, and the osteopathic medical students’ skill at performing diagnosis was assessed. Three wooden models with a spring mechanism simulating a vertebral segment were constructed. The spring mechanism provided rebound on either side when pressure was applied, mimicking the palpatory task of motion testing via palpation of the transverse processes of the thoracic spine. Model A was constructed with equal tension and coils on both sides. Models B and C were constructed with <b>unequal</b> <b>tension,</b> with one side having more spring than the other side. The students were instructed to press, using their thumbs, on the marked spot of the wooden model as if they were attempting to diagnose a somatic dysfunction of the thoracic spine. Once they have determined what side has increased tension, if any, they were be asked to do the same on the other two models and were asked to determine the side of increased tension, if any. Results. The results of the student’s correct diagnosis were analyzed, and it was found that 92 % of all student participants were able to correctly diagnose at least two of the dysfunctional models, with 56 % of the students overall diagnosing all three dysfunctional models correctly. Conclusion. It was found that second year medical students were able to correctly assess dysfunction using the spring model of palpation with a 92 % accuracy in at least two of three simulated models. Further studies are needed with a larger population number to assess for accuracy based on handedness, and gender. Grants. None...|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} {{transmission}} line structures due to severe High Intensity Wind (HIW) events {{is one of}} the major problems facing the electrical utility companies in various places around the globe including Canada. An extensive research program focusing on this problem started about fifteen years ago at The University of Western Ontario (UWO). In this Thesis, two major milestones are achieved leading to the advancement of the knowledge in this field. The first milestone is conducting, for the first time, a test on an aero-elastic model of a multi-span transmission system under reduced–scale simulated downbursts. The first objective of the experimental program is to assess the dynamic response of the conductors and the towers resulting from the transient nature of both the mean and the fluctuating components of downbursts. The second objective is to use the experimental results to validate a numerical model previously developed in-house at UWO for the analysis of transmission line structures under downbursts. The second milestone achieved in this Thesis is the development, for the first time, of a set of load cases that simulates the critical effects of downbursts on transmission line structures taking into account the variation in the location and size of the wind events. A load case that is particular for downbursts results in a velocity profile on the line that is non uniform and unequal along the conductor spans adjacent to the opposite sides of a tower. This leads to <b>unequal</b> <b>tensions</b> in the two spans adjacent to the tower and the difference in tensions leads to a force transmitted to the tower along the longitudinal direction of the line. This force is believed to be the cause of the failure of many towers. A procedure that is simple enough for application and for estimation such a force is developed in this study. Finally, through conducting an extensive parametric study for a number of transmission line systems, a comprehensive and simple procedure for estimating critical downburst loads on both the tower and the conductors is developed and presented in a simplified manner for possible implementation in the codes of practice...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{axisymmetric}} gravity-driven {{dynamics of}} a bubble rising toward a free surface isaddressed for gas-liquid interfaces having <b>unequal</b> surface <b>tensions.</b> The liquid flowis {{governed by the}} Stokes equations which are here solved using a boundary elementmethod in axisymmetric configuration. Within this framework, two dimensionlessnumbers arise: the Bond number Bo 1 based on the surface tension of the bubbleinterface and the surface tension ratio ˆ γ comparing the free surface and bubble surfacetensions. Under a careful and discussed selection of the code key settings (numberof boundary elements, initial bubble location, and distance beyond which the freesurface is truncated), it has been possible to numerically and accurately track in timethe bubble and free surface shapes for several values of (Bo 1, ˆ γ). The long-time shapesare found to deeply depend upon both Bo 1 and ˆ γ and also to compare well withthe shapes predicted in Princen and Mason [“Shape of a fluid drop at a fluid-liquidinterface. II. Theory for three-phase systems,” J. Colloid. Sci. 20, 246 – 266 (1965) ]using a hydrostatic model in which both surfaces are touching. Similarly, the drainagedynamics of the liquid film thickness between the bubble and the free surface dependson (Bo 1, ˆ γ). The long-time film thickness exponentially decays in time and a so-calledthinning rate α for which the numerical behaviors and a simple model reveal twobasic behaviors: (i) at small Bond number, α behaves as 1 /Bo 1 and (ii) at largeBond number, α is nearly constant. In addition, {{it is found that}} in the entire rangeof the quantity χ = (1 + ˆ γ) Bo 1 /(2 ˆ γ), the thinning rate α is well approximated by thefunction 1 /(18 χ) + α∞ with α∞ ≈ 0. 158.

40|$|New {{field work}} {{conducted}} by Kristof Titeca for the CSRC {{in the border}} areas of North-Western Uganda, North-Eastern Congo and Southern Sudan yields important lessons {{about the development of}} cross-border trading patterns in this region. Informal trade between these countries pre-dates the colonial period, though major political and economic changes have occurred since the 1980 's. Drawing from interviews with active traders and government officials, the author argues that internal and external political security and conflict, poor infrastructure and changing state policies are the foremost factors which have influenced the shifting and fragmenting cross- border trade relations between these countries. For many participants, informal cross-border trade (which largely operates outside the legal framework of the state), is seen as an indigenous form of development, providing a 'coping' economy for marginalised populations who are isolated or excluded from activities at the centre of the state. It has the potential to provide new opportunities and access to markets, but it is often accompanied by the development of elite business owners, gate keepers and imbalanced power relationships. The tensions that this can create can be seen in attitudes towards Ugandan traders, who currently reap the highest rewards from cross-border trade due to the relative stability and security of their country. This paper recommends that policymakers not only consider the influence of external events on regional cross-border trade, but also address the relations of power and profit which may produce <b>unequal</b> relationships and <b>tensions...</b>|$|R
40|$|At the {{symbolic}} centre of every Dickens novel is the roaring fire {{of a domestic}} hearth. Readers of Dickens frequently related clustering in familial groups around a fireplace, sharing in the fire’s uncertain pools of light and warmth while they read the text aloud. And within the texts themselves, the Dickens fireside {{has been seen as}} an idyllic space of conflict resolution: as Alexander Welsh has put it, “if the problem that besets” Dickens “can be called the city, his answer can be named the hearth. ” This essay seeks to remember the materiality of the fireside alongside its more symbolic evocations. Comparing Dickens’s representation of the coal fuelling the fires of A Christmas Carol (1843) and Our Mutual Friend (1865), written over twenty years later, and taking in several short fictions published in Household Words in the intervening decade, it shows that Dickens often based plots of fictional transformation on the fantastic metamorphoses embodied in the lump of coal itself. While there was something exuberant about this change in the 1840 s and 1850 s, when Britain’s plentiful coal supplies were frequently imagined as tokens of a divine plan favourable to British industrial and imperial expansion, the darkening mood of Dickens’s late fiction chimed with contemporary fears about the waste and depletion of resources and the increasing competitiveness of the global markets. Most importantly, however, throughout his career the material dimension of coal offered Dickens both narrative possibility, and representational trouble. So important was it to his social vision that he often overlooked the cost of coal in his desire to keep his poorest characters warm, and in the 1860 s he repeatedly ridiculed the national panic that Britain’s coal reserves might run out. Thinking about Dickens’s firesides as both symbolic and material spaces, fuelled by the coal whose history was of such fascination to the readers of Household Words, we see that the hearth was not only Dickens’s all-solving “answer” to the problems of the “city. ” It was a space in which many of his most central concerns would sit in <b>unequal,</b> and unresolved, <b>tension...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe gravity-driven {{migration}} of bubbles toward a free surface {{in a high}} viscous liquid occurs particularly in the glass industry. Indeed in a such process, raw materials are heated in order to react and create a molten glass. The chemical processes lead to a release of large amount of bubbles which further have to be removed to obtain a final product without defects. Since the bubble removal is mainly achieved by the buoyancy effect, {{the understanding of the}} bubble interaction with a free surface is an important issue to determine the onset of foaming. In this presentation, we summarize experimental results achieved in molten glasses at high temperature and in oils at room temperature. Experiments have been mainly focused in a thinning rate of liquid film using an interferometry method to determine the dynamics of the liquid film thickness. As a bubble approach a free surface, the interface deformations are driven by a balance between buoyancy and capillary forces meaning that the relevant dimensionless number is the Bond number. The experimental results show that the thickness of the liquid film {{at the top of the}} bubble decreases exponentially with time. This important result is the consequence of the mobility of fluid interface. Indeed for shear-free interface, the velocity in the thin liquid film is in first approximation uniform over the film thickness meaning that the flow is purely extensional. Whatever the fluid employed in the experiments, we establish a strong influence of the interface deformation measured by the Bond number. The smaller the Bond number is, the larger the thinning rate is. In other words, the film rupture occurs earlier when the Bond number is small (small bubble compared to the capillary length). We develop also a numerical method to simulate this problem established in the framework of Stokes flow since the typical Reynolds number in this particular problem is obviously much lesser than one. The problem has been solved using a boundary-integral formulation in two dimensions axisymmetric configuration. When the bubble is stuck close to the free surface, its shape is compared to the static form established previously by Princen. The exponential decrease is also found numerically and the thinning rate obeys the same behavior observed experimentally. In this presentation, we also present the recent results obtained with the boundary element method for a bubble and a free surface having uniform but <b>unequal</b> surface <b>tensions.</b> This situation is motivated by the fact that in application the surface tension can vary as a function of the gas nature. Here, the problem is driven by two parameters: the Bond number based on the surface tension of the bubble interface and the ratio of the two surface tensions. The numerical results show that the deformation of interfaces is more important when the Bond number is large and when the surface tension ratio is smaller than one. The bubble shape obtained at long times is compared to the static form established by Princen and Mason. The deformation of interfaces are strongly correlated to the thinning rate which is more and more important when the surface tension ratio is larger than one. Assuming a pure extensional flow in the liquid film when the bubble is stuck at the free surface, we point out that the thinning rate is inversely proportional to the area of the spherical cap created at the top of bubble. Using an asymptotic result provided by Princen and Mason, we find that the thinning rate is controlled by a unique parameter given corresponding to the harmonic average of the two Bond numbers based on the two surface tensions of interfaces...|$|R
40|$|To {{account for}} the {{behavior}} of a solid particle in the interface between two fluids it is necessary to consider, as indicated by Clark Maxwell, three surface tensions: Tso, the tension in the interface between the solid particle and the organic phase; Tsw, the tension in the interface between solid particle and aqueous phase; and Tow, the organic phase-water interfacial tension. If Tso > Tsw + Tow, (2), the stronger solid-organic phase tension should pull the line of intersection of the three phases around the periphery of the solid particle until the particle is completely enveloped in the water phase. If Tsw > Tow + Tow (3), the solid-water tension should pull the line of meeting of the phases about the particle until it is enveloped in the organic phase. If See PDF for Equation the particle should be stable in the interface, only leaving it when mechanical work overcomes the equilibrium due to the balance of interfacial tensions. The ordinary bacteria used have been stable in the interfaces between water or aqueous solutions and all organic liquids tested; i. e., condition (4) obtains. In preparations in which Tow is large, stability has been found by experiment to be greater than when Tow is small, as follows from condition (4). The force, dependent upon condition (4), which holds bacteria in the liquid-liquid interface, and the force, dependent upon <b>unequal</b> distribution of <b>tension</b> in the liquid-liquid interface, which causes bacteria to glide along the interface, prove to be of the same order of magnitude as the force due to bacterial flagella. Interfacial tensions or its own motility may dominate the movement of the bacterium, according to circumstances. When bacteria thresh {{their way out of the}} interface, escape is into the aqueous phase. Acid-fast bacteria possess very low or, in some cases, no stability in the interface, passing easily or even spontaneously into the organic phase. Good evidence has been advanced by other workers to indicate that the surfaces of ordinary bacteria contain many polar radicals; on the other hand, the acid-fast microorganisms are coated with predominantly non-polar substances. It follows from known principles, therefore, that Tsw should be greater than Tsw with ordinary bacteria, and Tsw should be greater than Tso with acid-fast bacteria. Consideration of relations (2) and (3) above will show that these conditions should result in the differences in behavior of acid-fast and ordinary bacteria actually found by experiment. The theoretical and experimental data here developed contradict the theoretical formulations of the surface tension factor in phagocytosis advanced by Rhumbler and by Tait and substantiate those of Fenn...|$|R
