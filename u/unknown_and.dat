40|$|Abstract: There are {{different}} {{structure of the}} network and the variables, {{and the process of}} learning Bayesian networks has a lot of different forms. The structure of the network can be <b>unknown</b> or known, <b>and</b> the variables can be observable or hidden in {{some or all of the}} data points. Consequently, there are four cases of learning Bayesian networks from data: known structure <b>and</b> observable variables, <b>unknown</b> structure <b>and</b> observable variables, known structure and unobservable variables <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> structure <b>and</b> unobservable variables. In this paper, we focus on known structure <b>and</b> observable variables, <b>unknown</b> structure <b>and</b> observable variables...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively <b>unknown</b> <b>and</b> little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} to estimation of <b>unknown</b> inputs <b>and</b> faults in a class of nonlinear systems is presented. The approach is based on the design of a cascade connection of two sliding mode observers. The first is used for estimation of state <b>and</b> <b>unknown</b> inputs <b>and</b> the second is used for fault detection. An important feature of the proposed approach is that the state trajectories do not leave the sliding manifold even in presence of <b>unknown</b> disturbances <b>and</b> faults. This allows for faults and disturbances to be reconstructed based on information retrieved from the equivalent output injection signal. The proposed approach is tested on a nonlinear model of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) system to reconstruct <b>unknown</b> disturbances <b>and</b> faults...|$|R

While in school, he developed an interest in theater and made his public acting debut at a school concert. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to a black cabinet maker and eventually worked as a turner.

5|$|Before 2010, the {{computing}} {{reliability of}} GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely <b>unknown,</b> <b>and</b> circumstantial evidence {{related to the}} lack of built-in error detection and correction in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected soft errors in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.|$|E
