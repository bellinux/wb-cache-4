In this paper there are study the possibilities of harmonics filtering and compensate the reactive power. The study was made using the results of some measurements made on an EAF and using an electric arc model for simulation. The simulations are performed in PSCAD EMTDC simulation program, a program dedicated to the power system.

50|$|After {{acquisition}} by Usinor in 1979 {{the works}} in Neuves-Maisons underwent restructuring - a transition to electrically produced steel, and a concentration towards long products {{took place in the}} 1980s: the Siemens-Martin plant and coke ovens were closed, and a new continuous casting plant built, in 1985 all the liquid phase operations ended and a <b>UHP</b> electric arc <b>furnace</b> installed. In 1993 the plant along with works in Montereau becomes part of the société des aciers d’armature du béton (SAM), and three cold drawing lines were installed. In 1995 the company is acquired by the British firm Allied Steel and Wire, then in 2000 is acquired by the Riva Group. In 2004 steel production was ~840,000t pa, and employed 441 people. In 2006 production was from scrap metal by electrical plant producing continuous cast billets, with processing to wire rod and rebar.|$|R

The {{effect of}} the {{refining}} slag composition on the total oxygen content and inclusions in steel was investigated in 100 t <b>UHP</b> Electric <b>Furnace</b> – LF – Billet CC process. The test steel was 77 B hard wire steel and Si-Mn alloy {{was used as the}} deoxidizer. Three types slag were used in the industrial tests, which including CaO-CaF 2, CaO-CaF 2 adding CaC and CaO-Al 2 O 3 refining slag. The results shown that the lowest total oxygen contents of rolled bar can be gained using the CaO-CaF 2 refining slag adding CaC, which is 0. 0036 %, while the total oxygen contents of rolled bar using CaO-Al 2 O 3 refining slag is higher a little than the heats using CaO-CaF 2 refining slag. The CaO-SiO 2 and CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 compound inclusions with the size of about 5 µm are the main inclusions in the heats refining by the CaO-CaF 2 refining slag in the rolled bar, but the pure, indeformable Al 2 O 3 inclusion can also be found with the size of about 10 µm. The CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MnO compound inclusions are the main inclusions in the heats refining by the CaO-CaF 2 -CaC refining slag, but most of the inclusion shape is irregular with bigger size of about 10 µm. Similar with the heat using CaO-CaF 2 refining slag, the pure Al 2 O 3 inclusion with edge angle {{can be found in the}} rolled bar. The inclusions in the rolled bar treated by CaO-Al 2 O 3 refining slag are CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 compound inclusions, most of which are nearly globular shape with th...|$|R
