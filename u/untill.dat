25|$|The {{affiliation}} of many Congressmen in {{the earliest}} years is an assignment by later historians; these were slowly coalescing groups with initially considerable independent thinking and voting. Cunningham noted that only {{about a quarter of}} the House of Representatives up <b>untill</b> 1794 voted with Madison as much as two-thirds of the time and another quarter against him two-thirds of the time, leaving almost half as fairly independent. Albert Gallatin recalled only two caucuses on legislative policy between 1795 and 1801, one over appropriations for Jay's Treaty and the other over the Quasi-War, but in neither case did the party decide to vote unanimously.|$|E

60|$|Atten. This Woman died well: And now we {{are talking}} of the dying of Christians, I will {{tell you a story}} of one that died some time since in our Town. The man was a godly old Puritan, for so the godly were called in time past. This man after a long, and godly life, fell sick, of the sickness, whereof he died. And as he lay drawing on, the woman that looked to him thought she heard Musick, and that the sweetest that ever she heard in her life, which also {{continued}} <b>untill</b> he gave up the Ghost: {153a} now when his soul departed from him, the Musick seemed to withdraw and to go further and further off from the house, and so it went <b>untill</b> the sound was quite gone out of hearing.|$|E
60|$|Her {{relation}} was short. He {{had gone}} in the carriage to the nearest town where he took a post chaise and horses with orders for the London road. He dismissed his servants there, only telling them {{that he had a}} sudden call of business and that they were to obey me as their mistress <b>untill</b> his return.|$|E
60|$|First, He {{became a}} Frequenter of {48d} Taverns and Tippling-houses, and would stay there <b>untill</b> {{he was even}} as drunk as a Beast. And if it was so, {{that he could not}} get out by day, he would, be sure, get out by night. Yea, he became so common a Drunkard, at last, that he was taken notice of to be a Drunkard even by all.|$|E
60|$|The next King was Artaxerxes Mnemon, {{the son of}} Darius: he Reigned forty six years, {{and died}} Anno Nabonass. 390. Then Reigned Artaxerxes Ochus twenty one years; Arses, or Arogus, two years, and Darius Codomannus four years, unto the battel of Arbela, whereby the Persian Monarchy was {{translated}} to the Greeks, Octob. 2. An. Nabonass. 417; but Darius was not slain <b>untill</b> a year and some months after.|$|E

6000|$|How {{often have}} I wept over that letter which <b>untill</b> I was sixteen {{was the only}} relick I had {{to remind me of}} my parents. [...] "Pardon me," [...] it said, [...] "for the uneasiness I have unavoidably given you: but while in that unhappy island, where every thing {{breathes}} her spirit whom I have lost for ever, a spell held me. It is broken: I have quitted England for many years, perhaps for ever. But to convince you that selfish feeling does not entirely engross me I shall remain in this town <b>untill</b> you have made by letter every arrangement that you judge necessary. When I leave this place do not expect to hear from me: I must break all ties that at present exist. I shall become a wanderer, a miserable outcast--alone! alone!"--In another part of the letter he mentioned me--"As for that unhappy little being whom I could not see, and hardly dare mention, I leave her under your protection. Take care of her and cherish her: one day I may claim her at your hands; but futurity is dark, make the present happy to her." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{spent two}} months {{together}} in this house. My father spent {{the greater part of}} his time with me; he accompanied me in my walks, listened to my music, and leant over me as I read or painted. When he conversed with me his manner was cold and constrained; his eyes only seemed to speak, and as he turned their black, full lustre towards me they expressed a living sadness. There was somthing in those dark deep orbs so liquid, and intense that even in happiness I could never meet their full gaze that mine did not overflow. Yet it was with sweet tears; now there was a depth of affliction in their gentle appeal that rent my heart with sympathy; they seemed to desire peace for me; for himself a heart patient to suffer; a craving for sympathy, yet a perpetual self denial. It was only when he was absent from me that his passion subdued him,--that he clinched his hands--knit his brows--and with haggard looks called for death to his despair, raving wildly, <b>untill</b> exhausted he sank down nor was revived <b>untill</b> I joined him.|$|E
6000|$|... with downcast eyes, and sympathizing smiles or whimpers; and I {{listened with}} quiet countenance while every nerve trembled; I that dared not utter aye or no {{to all this}} blasphemy. Oh, this was a delicious life quite void of guile! I with my dove's look and fox's heart: for indeed I felt only the {{degradation}} of falsehood, and not any sacred sentiment of conscious innocence that might redeem it. I who had before clothed myself in the bright garb of sincerity must now borrow one of divers colours: it might sit awkwardly at first, but use would enable me to place it in elegant folds, to lie with grace. Aye, I might die my soul with falsehood <b>untill</b> I had quite hid its native colour. Oh, beloved father! Accept the pure heart of your unhappy daughter; permit me to join you unspotted as I was or you will not recognize my altered semblance. As grief might change Constance[47] so would deceit change me <b>untill</b> in heaven you would say, [...] "This is not my child"--My father, to be happy both now and when again we meet I must fly from all this life which is mockery to one like me. In solitude only shall I be myself; in solitude I shall be thine.|$|E
60|$|No time {{or space}} can tear from my soul that {{which makes a}} part of it. Since my arrival here I have not for a moment ceased to feel the hell of passion which has been {{implanted}} in me to burn <b>untill</b> all be cold, and stiff, and dead. Yet I will not die; alas! how dare I go where I may meet Diana, when I have disobeyed her last request; her last words said in a faint voice when all feeling but love, which survives all things else was already dead, she then bade me make her child happy: that thought alone gives a double sting to death. I will wander away from you, away from all life--in the solitude I shall seek I alone shall breathe of human kind. I must endure life; and as it is my duty so I shall <b>untill</b> the grave dreaded yet desired, receive me free from pain: for while I feel it will be pain that must make up the whole sum of my sensations. Is not this a fearful curse that I labour under? Do I not {{look forward to a}} miserable future? My child, if after this life I am permitted to see you again, if pain can purify the heart, mine will be pure: if remorse may expiate guilt, I shall be guiltless.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{this could}} not last. One idea rushed on my mind; never, never may I speak to him again. As this terrible {{conviction}} came upon him [me?] it melted my soul to tenderness and love--I gazed on him as to take my last farewell--he lay insensible--his eyes closed as [and?] his cheeks deathly pale. Above, {{the leaves of the}} beech wood cast a flickering shadow on his face, and waved in mournful melody over him--I saw all these things and said, [...] "Aye, this is his grave!" [...] And then I wept aloud, and raised my eyes to heaven to entreat for a respite to my despair and an alleviation for his unnatural suffering--the tears that gushed in a warm & healing stream from my eyes relieved the burthen that oppressed my heart almost to madness. I wept for a long time <b>untill</b> I saw him about to revive, when horror and misery again recurred, and the tide of my sensations rolled back to their former channel: with a terror I could not restrain--I sprung up and fled, with winged speed, along the paths of the wood and across the fields <b>untill</b> nearly dead I reached our house and just ordering the servants to seek my father at the spot I indicated, I shut myself up in my own room[.][33] ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{lay upon}} the grass {{surrounded}} by a darkness which not the slightest beam of light penetrated--There was no sound for the deep night had laid to sleep the insects, the only creatures that lived on the lone spot where no tree or shrub could afford shelter to aught else--There was a wondrous silence {{in the air that}} calmed my senses yet which enlivened my soul, my mind hurried from image to image and seemed to grasp an eternity. All in my heart was shadowy yet calm, <b>untill</b> my ideas became confused and at length died away in sleep.[78] ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have known}} many, that, {{when they have}} been sick, have had large {{measures}} {{of this kind of}} Repentance, and while it has lasted, the noyse and sound thereof, has made the Town to ring again: but alas! how long has it lasted? oft-times scarce so long as <b>untill</b> the party now sick has been well. It has passed away like a mist or a vapour, it has been a thing of no continuance. But this kind of Repentance is by God compared to the howling of a dog. And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their bed. {148a} ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{raised his}} eyes from the ground, but still turning them away from me, said: [...] "Besought by that plea I will answer your rash question. Yes, you are the sole, the agonizing cause of all I suffer, of all I must suffer <b>untill</b> I die. Now, beware! Be silent! Do not urge me to your destruction. I am struck by the storm, rooted up, laid waste: but you can stand against it; you are young and your passions are at peace. One word I might speak and then you would be implicated in my destruction; yet that word is {{hovering}} on my lips. Oh! There is a fearful chasm; but I adjure you to beware!" ...|$|E
60|$|The Canaanites {{who fled}} from Joshua, retired {{in great numbers}} into Egypt, and there conquered Timaus, Thamus, or Thammuz King of the lower Egypt, and reigned there under their Kings Salatis, Bœon, Apachnas, Apophis, Janias, Assis, &c. <b>untill</b> the days of Eli and Samuel. They fed on flesh, and sacrificed men after {{the manner of the}} Phœnicians, and were called Shepherds by the Egyptians, who lived only on the fruits of the earth, and abominated flesh-eaters. The upper parts of Egypt were in those days under many Kings, Reigning at Coptos, Thebes, This, Elephantis, and other Places, which by conquering one another grew by degrees into one Kingdom, over which Misphragmuthosis Reigned in the days of Eli.|$|E
60|$|As I was perpetually {{haunted by}} these ideas, you may {{imagine that the}} {{influence}} of Woodville's words was very temporary; and that although I did not again accuse him of unkindness, yet I soon became as unhappy as before. Soon after this incident we parted. He heard {{that his mother was}} ill, and he hastened to her. He came to take leave of me, and we walked together on the heath for the last time. He promised that he would come and see me again; and bade me take cheer, and to encourage what happy thoughts I could, <b>untill</b> time and fortitude should overcome my misery, and I could again mingle in society.|$|E
60|$|Atten. Murder doth often follow indeed, as {{that which}} is the fruit of this sin: but {{sometimes}} God brings even these Adulterers, and Adulteresses to shameful ends. I heard {57a} of one, (I think, a Doctor of Physick) and his Whore, who had had three or four Bastards betwixt them, and had murdered them all, but at last themselves were hanged for it, in or near to Colchester. It came out after this manner: The Whore was so afflicted in her conscience abort it, {{that she could not}} be quiet <b>untill</b> she had made it known: Thus God many times makes the actors of wickedness their own accusers, and brings them by their own tongues to condigne punishment for their own sins.|$|E
60|$|But days of {{peaceful}} melancholy were of rare occurence[:] {{they were often}} broken in upon by gusts of passion that drove me as a weak boat on a stormy sea to seek a cove for shelter; but the winds blew from my native harbour and I was cast far, far out <b>untill</b> shattered I perished when the tempest had passed and the sea was apparently calm. I {{do not know that}} I can describe his emotions: sometimes he only betrayed them by a word or gesture, and then retired to his chamber and I crept as near it as I dared and listened with fear to every sound, yet still more dreading a sudden silence--dreading I knew not what, but ever full of fear.|$|E

She never caressed me, and seemed all the time I staid in the room to fear that I should annoy her by some childish freak. My good nurse always schooled me with the greatest care before she ventured into the parlour--and the awe my aunt's cold looks and few constrained words inspired was so great that I seldom disgraced her lessons or was betrayed from the exemplary stillness which I was taught to observe during these short visits.[11] ...|$|E
