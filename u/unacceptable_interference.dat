The main limitations of the super-regenerative receiver include the difficulty in choosing a good quench waveform to optimize its sensitivity and selectivity, and its significantly degraded performance in the presence of interference. To address the above problems, we first propose a novel quench waveform search algorithm providing good sensitivity and selectivity results. The algorithm avoids the undesirable manual calibration and hence suitable for autonomous operation. In addition, we consider the spectrum sensing algorithm to autonomously avoid data transmission in the presence of <b>unacceptable</b> <b>interferences.</b> The above algorithms enabling autonomous operation of the super regenerative receiver are implemented in hardware. Our measurement results show that by using the quench waveform calibrated super-regenerative receiver, the system can provide stable probability or mis-detection and probability of false alarm results in different carrier frequencies. This is very desirable for the determination of a good threshold in spectrum sensing. Together with our previously reported chip designed for the super regenerative receiver, we have developed an autonomously operating super-regenerative receiver based wireless system, which is ideal for many BAN applications...|$|R

One of these issues is the shape of the NC-OFDM spectrum outside of the intended transmission bandwidth, which is known to be relatively high when left untreated due to the Sinc pulse shapes of the individual data-bearing subcarriers. Consequently, if PU transmissions are located next to a collection of data-bearing subcarriers belonging to an NC-OFDM signal, this may result in the former experiencing an <b>unacceptable</b> level of <b>interference</b> from the latter. Therefore, it is essential that the spectral shape of the NC-OFDM waveform is treated such that the out-of-band (OOB) radiation is minimized.|$|R

40|$|In two-tier {{networks}} [...] comprising {{a conventional}} cellular network overlaid with shorter range hotspots (e. g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or wired relays) [...] with universal frequency reuse, the near-far effect from cross-tier interference creates dead spots where reliable coverage cannot be guaranteed to users in either tier. Equipping the macrocell and femtocells with multiple antennas enhances robustness against the near-far problem. This work derives {{the maximum number}} of simultaneously transmitting multiple antenna femtocells meeting a per-tier outage probability constraint. Coverage dead zones are presented wherein cross-tier interference bottlenecks cellular and hotspot coverage. Two operating regimes are shown namely 1) a cellular-limited regime in which femtocell users experience <b>unacceptable</b> cross-tier <b>interference</b> and 2) a hotspot-limited regime wherein both femtocell users and cellular users are limited by hotspot interference. Our analysis accounts for the per-tier transmit powers, the number of transmit antennas (single antenna transmission being a special case) and terrestrial propagation such as the Rayleigh fading and the path loss exponents. Single-user (SU) multiple antenna transmission at each tier is shown to provide significantly superior coverage and spatial reuse relative to multiuser (MU) transmission. We propose a decentralized carrier-sensing approach to regulate femtocell transmission powers based on their location. Considering a worst-case cell-edge location, simulations using typical path loss scenarios show that our interference management strategy provides reliable cellular coverage with about 60 femtocells per cellsite.

30|$|The {{cornerstone}} of the IEEE 802.22, the first standard for cognitive radio networks, requires the SUs to yield to the PUs immediately after detecting the primary signal within a designated region [9]. The 802.22 WRAN standard is aimed at using DSA technology to allow sharing of geographically unused spectrum allocated for television broadcast services. So in the 802.22 WRAN implementation, the primary network would consist of a TV broadcasting station (primary transmitter) and the corresponding subscribed viewers (primary receivers) [5, 9]. Ideally, SUs would occupy unused TV spectrum in geographical locations where the primary network is absent, but may coexist {{as long as the}} SUs do not interfere with the subscribed viewers’ reception of the primary signal. However, guaranteeing a minimal level of interference to the primary network is perhaps the biggest obstacle to the commercialization of DSA technology and a very difficult problem to solve [5]. In order to have minimal interference, cognitive radios must be able to reliably detect, in real time, {{the presence or absence of}} a primary signal from a given spectrum band. Otherwise, these cognitive radios can unknowingly transmit signals simultaneously with the primary transmitter, causing <b>unacceptable</b> levels of <b>interference</b> to nearby PUs.|$|R

Romania’s absorption into the Soviet camp led to deterioration in the bilateralrelationship, as successive Romanian communist leaders imposed a totalitarian system and strictlimits on contacts with Americans and other Westerners. However, bilateral relations with Romaniabegan to improve in the early 1960s under Gheorghiu-Dej with the signing of an agreement providingfor partial settlement of Americanproperty claims. Cultural, scientific, andeducational exchanges were initiated, andin 1964 the legations of both nations werepromoted to full embassies. Ceausescu’scalculated distancing of Romania fromthe Soviet foreign policy line, includingBucharest’s diplomatic recognition ofIsrael and denunciation of the 1968Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia pavedthe way for President Nixon’s officialvisit to Romania in August 1969.

40|$|To {{solve the}} {{spectrum}} scarcity problem {{caused by the}} high number of wireless applications and users, the concept of cognitive radio (CR) was proposed in the past few years. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) provide dynamic spectrum access (DSA), where the unlicensed users can access the spectrum without causing <b>unacceptable</b> level of <b>interference</b> to the primary user (PU). DSA was based on conventional spectrum sensing information or geolocation databases. Later, radio environment map (REM) as an improved geolocation database was introduced to enhance the DSA process. It is a comprehensive map consists of different integrated databases, and the interference field information is one of its databases. In this thesis, a description of the REM concept and its construction methods will be presented. The focus will be for the indirect methods for constructing interference map, which represents a layer of the REM. Indirect method refers to the methods that utilize known model information, to first estimate the primary transmitter parameters and then generate REM. Two indirect methods under lognormal shadowing were presented and compared. The better of these two methods is further investigated in different scenarios. These scenarios include different number of sensors, varied size of measurements, several shadowing spread values, different percentages of error in path-loss exponent, and the effect of the number of moving sensors and their speeds to the REM quality. The performance is evaluated using these metrics: “localization error, signal power error and correct detection zone ratio (CDZR). The results show that performance is enhanced as the number of sensors and the size of measurements increase, whereas clear degradation in REM quality is shown when shadowing spread increases or the model parameters are not well calibrated.
