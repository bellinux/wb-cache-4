40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} and {{interprets the}} changes {{that took place in}} Russia's exchange rate system during 1992. The multiple exchange rate regime that existed in Russia prior to July 3, 1992, created strong incentives for exporters to refrain from repatriating foreign exchange earnings, induced both importers and exporters to participate in <b>unofficial</b> <b>markets</b> for foreign exchange, and encouraged international barter transactions. Efforts to manage the exchange rate through heavy foreign exchange intervention were unsuccessful.

40|$|AbstractGoogle Play is the {{official}} market of Android apps. The app publishers make money by selling apps, through in-app billing, and through advertisements. The apps, especially the popular ones, are disassembled by adversaries, who then add/replace ads in the apps, and/or add some malicious code to the apps, and then release it to app markets. This is called app repackaging. Any revenue these repacked-apps make on these ads go to the adversaries. Also, if the repackaged apps have malwares then the malwares now spread more swiftly because of {{the popularity of the}} apps. In this paper, we present our study on some Android apps released to <b>unofficial</b> <b>markets</b> which were originally released to Google Play to find how prevalent the repackaging of Android apps is. Moreover, we proposed a mechanism for the detection of repackaging based on the permissions of the apps. To evaluate the performance of proposed approach, we downloaded 50 apps, each with well over a hundred million downloads from {{the official}} Android market, and tried to find their repackaged versions on <b>unofficial</b> <b>markets</b> based on extra permissions. We found repackaged versions of 6 out of these 50 apps without such a naive approach. This just goes to demonstrate how widely available the repackaged versions {{of some of the most}} popular Android apps are. It also proves that, in many cases, it is possible to detect repackaging only by comparing the permissions of an app with its original version. To a wide extent, there is no need of complex code analysis, or adding some authentication entity such as a watermark to the app for deterring repackaging...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} whether the money supply can serve as a nominal anchor for the domestic price level under real exchange rate targeting. When capital controls are perfect so that there is complete separation between official and <b>unofficial</b> <b>markets</b> for foreign exchange, the domestic inflation rate can be stabilized, but only at the expense of a widening gap between official and parallel market exchange rates. When cross - transactions between the two markets are permitted, the steady state of the model is identical to that of a model without capital controls and, hence, the money supply cannot serve as a nominal anchor for the price level in the long run. If capital controls are nevertheless maintained temporarily, and are known to be temporary, targeting the money supply fails to stabilize the rate of inflation even in the short run. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{irrigation}} {{services are}} often state-subsidized in agrarian economies for {{the enhancement of}} agricultural productivity while they also target poverty alleviation. The agriculture-dependent states of India offer representative examples of undervalued irrigation services mainly sourced by canal networks. However, canal irrigation is nowadays lagging behind private groundwater initiatives but with significant costs which question the concept of low water pricing in agriculture. This paper assesses irrigation water costs in representative backward clusters of Bihar state in eastern India while the effects on different landholding groups are analysed. The results indicate that marginal landholders heavily rely on purchased water from <b>unofficial</b> <b>markets</b> while they pay the highest amount for irrigation. This is due to limited access in the canal network, possession of inefficient pumping systems and cultivation of crops with a high demand for water. However, acute policy reforms could drastically decrease water costs and improve agricultural productivity...|$|R

50|$|Owing to its {{geographical}} remoteness, {{local authorities}} {{in what is}} today Argentina developed an early sense of autonomy. Based largely on economic needs, during colonial times their pragmatism led to a flourishing <b>unofficial</b> <b>market</b> in smuggled goods, out of the then-small port of Buenos Aires, in blatant contravention of the Spanish mercantilist laws. With the Enlightened despotism of the late-eighteenth-century Bourbon kings {{and the creation of}} the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776, trade increased as the political importance of the port-city of Buenos Aires soared. The urgency for a complete liberalization of commerce remained a powerful political cause for Criollos and Mestizos, further stimulated by the politically egalitarian and revolutionary ideals spread by the French and Anglo-American revolutions. Ultimately, the actual experience of successfully defending without Spanish aid the viceroyalty from a foreign invader during the 1806-1807 British invasions of the Río de la Plata, triggered a decisive quest for even greater autonomy from the colonial metropolis.|$|E

50|$|Transgender and {{sex worker}} populations have {{difficulty}} accessing {{health care services}} due to social stigma. This difficulty is further compounded {{at the intersection of}} these two populations. A survey of sex workers, which included transgender responses, in four African countries, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Uganda, and South Africa, reported that denial of treatment for injuries associated with physical or sexual assault as well as general public services was common. Recent legal moves within the United States have been made to legalize this kind of discrimination within the health care sector with the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA). In the United States, transgender people do not always have job protections as anti-discrimination bills vary between states, which means that transgender people can lose their job {{on the basis of their}} gender identity. Due to these lack of protections, transgender people are at a higher risk of experiencing unemployment and finding employment in <b>unofficial</b> <b>markets</b> like the sex work industry.|$|R

50|$|Post-Independence, {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} drain was accentuated in 1962 during the border dispute with China. Morarji Desai, then finance minister, {{came out with}} Gold Control Act, 1962, which recalled all gold loans given by banks and banned forward trading in gold. In 1963, the production of gold jewellery above 14 carat fineness was banned. In 1965, a gold bond scheme was launched with tax immunity for unaccounted wealth. All these steps failed to yield the desired result. Desai finally introduced the Gold Control Act, on 24 August 1968, which prohibited citizens from owning gold {{in the form of}} bars and coins. All existing holding of gold coins and bars had to be converted to jewellery and declared to the authorities. Goldsmiths were not allowed to own more than 100 gms of gold. Licensed dealers were not supposed to own more than 2 kg of gold, depending upon the number of artisans employed by them. They were banned from trading with each other. Desai believed that Indians would respond positively to these steps and stop consuming gold and help conserve precious foreign exchange. New gold jewellery purchases were either recycled or smuggled gold. This legislation killed the official gold market and a large <b>unofficial</b> <b>market</b> sprung up dealing in cash only. The gold was smuggled in and sold through the unofficial channel wherein, many jewellers and bullion traders traded in smuggled gold. A huge black market developed for gold. Gold Smith were unorganised labour force and could not cope with the new developed situation. Only a few could get the licence to hold the gold, that also in very small quantity, with the result that the members of the Sunar caste, who were depending only on their traditional occupation of making gold ornaments, lost their business and their financial condition deteriorated and families shattered.|$|E

Rice exports also declined, from 1,840,000 tons in 1961-62 to 350,000 tons in 1967-68, the result of both socialist policies and the inability of rice production to meet the population growth rates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{tests the}} contractionary {{devaluation}} hypothesis {{in the context}} of select African countries. The output effect of devaluation is examined within an empirical model that controls, among others, for the parallel currency premium, the rate of net capital inflow, the degree of capacity utilization and political instability. The model is estimated on pooled data drawn from 20 African countries, employing alternative indicators of devaluation and pooling procedures. The results indicate that the contemporaneous output effect of nominal devaluation is negative, providing statistical support for the hypothesis that devaluation is contractionary in the short run. On the other hand, the coefficient of the lagged rate of devaluation is found to be positive, implying that the contractionary problem is temporary. The magnitude of the observed contractionary effect appears to depend on the rate of net capital inflow and the degree of capacity utilization. Devaluations accompanied by augmented net capital inflow and implemented in the presence of excess capacity are found to be less contractionary than otherwise equivalent exchange‐rate changes.

40|$|There is some {{evidence}} in established market economies that health economics is having {{a positive impact on}} policy. Although many of the underlying assumptions can be questioned, the predictions made are broadly applicable to a range of relatively wealthy industrialised economies. In low and middle income countries these assumptions are often less applicable. In particular, assumptions about the regulation and functioning of public and private sector activities often fail to account for the operation of the unofficial health care sector. This paper illustrates how unofficial markets might operate {{in the context of the}} health care sector in a developing economy. In particular it examines how the motives of practitioners may be influenced by a lack of regulation and under-funding which in turn contribute to the presence of unofficial activities. <b>Unofficial</b> <b>market</b> activities could influence and distort the impact of policies commonly being pursued in many countries.

These systems of cultural capital not only allow fans to experience the sacred but also facilitate their sense of relationship with like-minded others in self-selecting communities of shared taste...|$|R
