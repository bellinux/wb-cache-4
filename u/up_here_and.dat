25|$|As Niebuhr remarked, {{once again}} the total yields the sacred number of thirty, but the sum {{is made up of}} {{different}} components. It is a mix of some {{of the members of the}} populi Albenses and some of the clara oppida. In fact, many of the oppida had been destroyed or resettled by the Romans during the regal period, namely Caenina, Politorium, Ficana, Cameria, Medullium, Corniculum, Collatia. Among the clara oppida of Pliny's list, Satricum, Norba, Sulmo, Scaptia, Tellenae show <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> among the populi albenses Bubentum, Corioli, Pedum, Querquetula, Tolerium, and possibly Nomentum.|$|E

I've always liked the lead character in Alasdair Gray's [...] growing the hard scales to defend the soft inner-self from the world. Socially awkward asthmatic with a self-consuming imagination.

500|$|The serious losses {{sustained}} in maintaining a static defence during June led to fractures in the German high command. On 1 July, Panzer Group West commander Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg {{had been replaced}} by Heinrich Eberbach, following disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted. Gerd von Rundstedt, soon followed, that evening, in a telephone conversation with Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, head of OKW, von Rundstedt said [...] "Make peace, you fools." [...] Taken to task over his endorsement of von Schweppenburg's recommendation for a withdrawal, he replied [...] "If you doubt what we're doing, get <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> take over this shambles yourself". The following morning, informed that perhaps his health was [...] "no longer up to the task", von Rundstedt resigned and was succeeded as OB West by Günther von Kluge. The costly battles in and around Caen and Saint-Lô convinced both Eberbach and von Kluge that their predecessors had been correct. The Germans had suffered heavily, leading Hitler to order Army Group B to temporarily abandon big counter-attacks and go over to the defensive until more reinforcements could arrive to bolster the front.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour. Before she performed [...] "Skin", Rihanna appeared on stage with a set similar to that of her performance of [...] "S" [...] remix with Britney Spears at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, wearing a black tuxedo and pink tie to perform a cover of Princes [...] "Darling Nikki", before transitioning into [...] "S". As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a little fun [...] who wants to come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and the lights go out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E

500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching a lot of black smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the strike}} on the Pentagon by American Airlines Flight 77, Rumsfeld {{went out to}} the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts. He later {{recalled}} that [...] "I wanted to see what had happened. I wanted to see if people needed help. I went downstairs and helped for a bit with some people on stretchers. Then I came back <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> started – I realized I had to get back <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{trees have}} now {{grown up on}} the once bare hillside. The windows {{at the front of}} the house look over a garden where King’s sculptures sit among the eucalypts and shrubs. Inside, the house is full of books and art works: small sculptures, paintings, prints, postcards, ceramics, {{aboriginal}} artefacts and bark paintings, cover every available surface. King said: “Robin Boyd used to come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> say ‘This house should look awful, but it doesn't.’” ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2011, Murphy {{discussed}} a possible fourth film, stating, [...] "They're not doing it. What I'm {{trying to do}} now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lowe {{was widely}} admired by his peers for excelling {{in every aspect}} of mountaineering, from rock- and ice-climbing to ski descents.

2500|$|When {{questioned}} at a {{press conference}} about Sheridan's goal, Meath manager Eamon O'Brien said: [...] "I can't say and I'm not commenting. I can comment, as I said to RTÉ, that loads of decisions were made during the game that didn't go our way. I can recall three or four balls that were blown for picking off the ground that I didn’t think were off the ground. Nigel Crawford was booked <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> Louth got a point off it. The game goes for 70 minutes, decisions are made and you live with it. That’s it, that’s the way I see it".|$|E

2500|$|Much of the show's humor {{relied on}} {{recurring}} gags, unseen regulars and punch lines that sometimes popped <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there for years.

[...] In the episode of December 19, 1944, [...] "Fibber Snoops For Presents In Closet" [...] (at 3:59 {{is a perfect example}} of the [...] "Hall Closet", a running gag described in detail later in this entry), Jim Jordan can be caught at the end of his audience warm-up evoking the opening laughter by quipping, [...] "10 seconds?

2500|$|The {{most notorious}} matchups {{of the era}} took place in 1993, 1995, and 1996, in which Ohio State entered the game each year undefeated. The Buckeyes had a 9–0–1 record heading into the 1993 game and were looking to claim an {{outright}} Big Ten title against a Michigan team that had already lost four times. Michigan receiver Mercury Hayes and running backs Jon Ritchie, Che Foster, and Ed Davis each scored a touchdown as the Wolverines shocked the Buckeyes, 28–0. After the game, Cooper said: [...] "This {{is one of the}} most embarrassing games I've ever been involved with." [...] "They outplayed us on offense, on defense, and in the kicking game. If you'd told me we would come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> get beat 28–0, I'd have probably stayed home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career. [...] "I was thinking it wouldn't be bad to come back <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> kind of follow the same steps as Pinner – play here a couple years and maybe {{get a chance to}} coach up here", Williams said. [...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
