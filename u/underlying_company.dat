It is used to cover various sized company boxes, ranging in size from shoebox, through pizza box, knockdown furniture box, up to double-doored refrigerator box. No matter the size box the <b>underlying</b> <b>company</b> is, the 4'x8' sheet of pegboard remains the same. It then becomes the reseller's job to link up whichever pegholes are needed to the specific company under the interface. They may not need all of the holes; some company boxes may need less than 1,000 links, but all of the holes remain visible to the end-user after the installation is complete. The Pascal-like development language is easily accessible to appropriate developers and is designed for rapidly customizing the software.|$|E

40|$|Few {{issues are}} more {{important}} for finance practice than the computation of market betas. Existing approaches compute market betas using historical data. While these approaches differ in terms of statistical sophistication and the modeling of the time-variation in the betas, they are all backward-looking. This paper introduces a radically different approach to estimating market betas. Using the tools in Bakshi and Madan (2000) and Bakshi, Kapadia and Madan (2003) we employ the information embedded in the prices of individual stock options and index options to compute our forward-looking market beta at the daily frequency. This beta can be computed using option data for a single day, {{and is able to}} reflect sudden changes {{in the structure of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>company.</b> Based on an empirical investigation of daily cross-sections of option contracts on thirty underlying companies, we conclude that these forward-looking betas contain information relevant for forecasting future betas that is not contained in historical betas. market beta, CAPM, historical, forward-looking, option-implied, capital budgeting, event studies, model-free moments...|$|E
40|$|The {{termination}} of a representative financial firm due to excess leverage {{may lead to}} substantial bankruptcy costs. A benevolent government {{in the tradition of}} Ramsey (1927) may be inclined to provide transfers to the firm so as to prevent its liquidation and the associated deadweight costs. The paper studies the optimal way to finance such a “bailout ” with distortionary taxes and obtains two results. First, some degree of “fiscal stimulus ” through procyclical taxation (low taxes in bad times, high taxes in good times) is always optimal. This is true even when markets are complete and government expenditure is set to zero. Second, taxes exhibit history dependence, even in a complete market. These results are in contrast with pre-existing results in the literature on optimal fiscal policy, and are driven by the endogeneity of the transfer payments that are required to salvage the financial firm.

40|$|Abstract. Joint default {{modeling}} {{for a set}} {{of firms}} is crucial in the context of pricing credit derivatives. We consider here a model for defaults among multiple firms based on the Vasicek or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for the hazard rates of the <b>underlying</b> <b>companies</b> or “names”. We analyze the impact of volatility time scales on the default distribution for the set of firms. We also consider the associated impact on a particular credit derivative contract, the so-called CDO. We demonstrate how correlated fluctuations in the parameters of the firm hazard rates affect the loss distribution and prices associated with the CDOs. The effect of stochastic parameter fluctuations is to change the shape of the loss distribution and cannot be captured by using averaged parameters in the original model. Our analysis assumes a separation of time scales and leads to a singular-regular perturbation problem [9, 10]. This framework allows us to compute perturbation approximations {{that can be used for}} effective pricing of CDOs. 1. Introduction. Credi...|$|R
