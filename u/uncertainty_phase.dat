This monotonous function, called the phase variable, is often affected by intermittent perturbations due to noisy sensors. We will mainly focus on continuous periodic orbits obtained via parameterized trajectories, and then analyze their stability properties under a noisy phase estimation. In other words, {{our focus is}} on examples where phase variables are difficult to compute, and therefore are imperfect.

40|$|In {{this review}} {{we focus on}} the {{determination}} of phase diagrams by computer simulation with particular attention to the fluid-solid and solid-solid equilibria. The calculation of the free energy of solid phases using the Einstein crystal and Einstein molecule methods are described in detail. It is shown that for the hard spheres solid both methods yield the same results and that free energies of solid phases present noticeable finite size effects. Finite size corrections can be introduced, although in an approximate way, to correct for the dependence of the free energy {{on the size of the}} system. The computation of free energies of solid phases can be extended to molecular fluids. The procedure to compute free energies of solid phases of water (ices Ih, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI and XII) using the SPC/E and TIP 4 P models will be described. Other methods to estimate the melting point of a solid, as the direct fluid-solid coexistence or simulations of the free surface of the solid will be discussed. It will be shown that the melting points of ice Ih for several water models, obtained from these two methods and from free energy calculations agree within statistical <b>uncertainty.</b> <b>Phase</b> diagram calculations can help to improve potential models of molecular fluids; for water, the TIP 4 P/ 2005 model can be regarded as an improved version of TIP 4 P. We will also review some recent work on the phase diagram of the simplest ionic model, the restricted primitive model. Although originally devised to describe ionic liquids, the model is becoming quite popular to describe charged colloids. Besides the possibility of obtaining fluid-solid equilibria for simple protein models will be discussed. In these primitive models, the protein is described by a spherical potential with certain anisotropic bonding sites. Comment: 72 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effects of <b>uncertainty</b> in the <b>phase</b> of speech signals on the word {{recognition}} error rate of human listeners. The motivating {{goal is to get}} a quantitative measure on the importance of phase in automatic speech recognition by studying {{the effects of}} <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> on human perception. Listening tests were conducted for 18 listeners under different <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. These results indicate that a small amount of <b>phase</b> error or <b>uncertainty</b> does not affect the recognition rate, but a large amount of <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> significantly affects the recognition rate. The degree of the importance of phase also seems to be an SNR-dependent one, such that at lower SNRs the effects of <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are more pronounced than at higher SNRs. For example, at an SNR of IH dB, having random phases at all frequencies results in a word error rate (WER) of 63 % compared to 24 % if the phase was unaltered. In comparison, at 0 dB, random phase results in a 25 % WER as compared to 11 % for the unaltered phase case. Listening tests were also conducted for the case of reconstructed phase based on the least square error estimation approach [11]. The results indicate that the recognition rate for the reconstructed phase case is very close to that of the perfect phase case (a WER difference of 4 % on average).
