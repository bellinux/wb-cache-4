When they go wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those requisites which are necessary will be carried along.

40|$|This film {{is made up}} of five panoramas, four {{wide and}} one close-up, of the ruins of {{downtown}} San Francisco shortly after the 1906 disaster, plus a panorama and scene in a nearby refugee camp. Original intertitles precede each change of scene, but the locations provided are incorrect for three of the five views. The state of the ruins and camp suggest a date in late April, 1906. The absence of streetcar tracks in the "Grand Avenue" panorama dates that segment to before May 1, 1906. The following is a scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0103 (part 1) ] Intertitle: "Panorama of City Hall from Top of U. S. Mint. " In fact, this right-to-left (north-to-northwest) panorama of the ruined City Hall was filmed from the east side of 8 th Street at Market Street. For another description of essentially the same view (in reverse pan) see Scenes in San Francisco, No. 2. The principal features seen here are [0219 (part 1) ] the Hall of Records, [0655 (part 1) ] the east wing, [1020 (part 1) ] Marshall Square with the Pioneer Monument in front of the ruined City Hall cupola, [1327 (part 1) ] the ruined southwest wing, and [1602 (part 1) ] Market Street (note the elaborate street lamp). Because City Hall stood back from Market Street on a parallel street, ruins can be seen in front of parts of City Hall. In July 1993, in a spectacular engineering feat, the 1000 -ton Pioneer Monument was moved in one piece {{to the site of the}} City Hall cupola on the (future) Fulton Street mall. The move makes room for a corner of San Francisco's new Main Library. [1724 (part 1) ] Intertitle: "Panorama of Mission Street. " This jerky segment is a right-to-left (northeast-to-west) panorama filmed from the north side of Mission Street between 6 th and 7 th streets, a block south of Market Street. [1821 (part 1) ] The camera looks northeast down Mission Street. The twin chimneys of the U. S. Mint (one smoking) at 5 th Street are at center right. Beyond them and in the center of the picture is the Call Building tower on Market Street. [1926 (part 1) ] The Flood Building at Market and Powell streets is seen in the background. The ruins of the Hale Brothers Department Store rise in the background at Market and 6 th streets. In the far distance at left is the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill. Note the steps in the foreground leading nowhere; a common sight in the ruined city. [2205 (part 1) ] A small break in the continuity occurs here. [2424 (part 1) ] The arch-windowed ruin on Jessie Street between Mission and Market streets is the Swedish Evangelical Mission Church, founded in 1877 and built on this site circa 1900. The heart of the city's Scandinavian neighborhood lay several blocks further west. [2695 (part 1) ] The distant ruined tower of St. Boniface Church (1902) rises beyond the classic facade of the ruined Hibernia Bank (1892) at McAllister and Jones streets, at Market Street. [3057 (part 1) ] We see the north (Stevenson Street) wing of the U. S. Post Office (1905) at 7 th and Mission streets, and a lower central part of the building behind a boundary wall. Built on a buried marsh, the building was damaged in the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes. It was recently restored to serve as a court building for the U. S. Court of Appeals. [3192 (part 1) ] Intertitle: "Panorama [of] Market Street, San Francisco, from Top of U. S. Mint. " This segment was actually filmed from the first floor of the ruined California Casket Company Building located near the Mint on the south side of Mission Street between 5 th and 6 th Streets. The segment is a right-to-left (north-northwest-to-west) pan. [3290 (part 1) ] At far right is the Flood Building, with the northwest corner of the Mint in the foreground. At distant center is the Saint Francis Hotel on Powell street and the Alexander Hotel behind it (left). The narrow tower at left is the Press Club Building on Ellis Street. Far beyond it on Nob Hill are the Flood mansion (left) and the Fairmont Hotel (right). [3606 (part 1) ] Popular Zinkand's Cafe had occupied the ground floor of the building reduced to the dramatic brick spires seen here behind a foreground ruin. [3941 (part 1) ] The towers of ruined apartment buildings and hotels are seen along Turk Street across Market Street. Note the man searching through rubble in the foreground. [4327 (part 1) ] The ruins of Hale Brothers Department Store at Market and 6 th Streets fill the screen. Stevenson Street is in the foreground. [4880 (part 1) ] The ruins of St. Boniface Church are in the background. [5384 (part 1) ] At right center are an east-wing tower of City Hall and the adjacent dome of the Hall of Records. The Grant Building at 7 th and Market streets hides the City Hall cupola. At left is the U. S. Post Office at 7 th Street. Close to the camera and at left is the cornice of the California Casket Company Building. [Frame: 0102 (part 2) ] Intertitle: "Panorama from Grand Ave. " The correct name is Grant Avenue and the panorama was actually filmed almost a block southwest of Grant on Market Street near the Stockton and Ellis streets intersection. The first part of the segment is a right-to-left (northeast-to-west) pan. The second part is a slow, closeup pan moving left-to-right, of a ruined lot on the west side of Stockton Street north of Ellis Street. This site is also seen in the background near the end of the first pan in the segment. [0263 (part 2) ] Bicycle and pedestrian traffic on Market Street reflects the lack of public transportation before the beginning of streetcar service on May 1, 1906. [0396 (part 2) ] The Call Building tower at 3 rd and Market streets rises behind the Sorensen Jewelers Building. Beyond the Call Building are the Monadnock Building and the Palace Hotel. [0461 (part 2) ] A film assistant directs pedestrians out of the camera view. [0565 (part 2) ] The Mutual Savings Bank at Market and Kearny Streets is seen. [0850 (part 2) ] The view is of the rear wall of the elegant City of Paris Department Store, rebuilt on the site and now the location of Neiman-Marcus. [1946 (part 2) ] The unfinished frame of the Butler Building, now I. Magnin department store, is seen along Stockton Street at Geary Street, across from the City of Paris building. [2542 (part 2) ] The St. Francis Hotel and adjacent Alexander Hotel (left) rise in the background. Pedestrians are seen on Stockton Street and a work crew is busy in a lot across the street (see below). [3757 (part 2) ] The camera points up Ellis Street. The Flood Building stands on the left at Powell Street. The pan then drifts back up to Stockton Street. [Frame: 0100 (part 3) ] Intertitle: "Refugees in Jefferson Square. " This segment gives an excellent view of the informal, egalitarian atmosphere of a typical San Francisco earthquake refugee camp in the weeks following the earthquake and fire. Jefferson Square was and is a public park at the edge of the burnt area, a few blocks northwest of the ruined City Hall. One of the city's better run camps, it housed refugees from adjacent Hayes Valley. The park covers an area equal to four city blocks and is bounded by Laguna, Eddy and Gough streets, and Golden Gate Avenue. It is bisected by Turk Street and has a flat southern half (now Hayward Playground) and a sloping northern half in which this segment was filmed. The park is little changed today but the row of Victorian homes seen along Eddy Street is gone. The pan was filmed from right-to-left (east-to-north) on the curving central path near the west side of the park. The fixed view section was probably filmed further east along the same path, looking east from near the center of the park. [0244 (part 3) ] Note the " 102 " on the Army-issued <b>umbrella</b> <b>tent.</b> A couple are busy tightening the tent ropes. [0560 (part 3) ] Signs on a ramshackle structure suggest a possible public convenience. [1093 (part 3) ] Small cooking grates line the path. Note the strong afternoon west wind blowing through the trees and the soldier with a cold. A woman is seen cooking at her stove on the north side of the path. [2080 (part 3) ] A doctor, carrying his bag, pauses to look back. The woman with the polkadot blouse seems to be in charge of the grey tent at left, which may be a laundry. Note the homes on Eddy Street, north of the park, in the background. [2700 (part 3) ] An army officer gives some advice to a camp resident. [3100 (part 3) ] A man sits dozing, holding a newspaper. Washing hangs on nearby makeshift clotheslines. [3412 (part 3) ] The stationary view is of soldiers patrolling to keep order in a food line as approaching pedestrians dodge cooking grates on the path. Copyright: no reg.

Ajahn Jayasaro notes that they wandered in [...] "the traditional manner of the wandering mendicant or tudong monk, carrying their iron bowls in a cloth bag on one shoulder and their glots on the other." [...] They usually walked single file for fifteen miles a day, {{and the end of}} the day find a stream to bathe in, set up their glot <b>umbrella</b> <b>tents</b> under trees nearby, and practice meditation at night.|$|R

5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof is also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with <b>umbrella</b> <b>tents.</b> Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} been to Cromingham before. I went to the house you {{occupied}} on the Esplanade and learnt that you were all upon the beach. I walked along the sea-wall scrutinizing the various bright groups of children and nursemaids and holiday people that were scattered over the sands. It was a day of blazing sunshine, and, between the bright sky and the silver drabs of the sand stretched the low levels of a sea that had its customary green-grey touched for once with something of the sapphire glow of the Mediterranean. Here and there were gay little <b>umbrella</b> <b>tents</b> or canvas shelters, and a bather or so and pink and white wading children broke the dazzling edge of foam. And I sought you with a kind of reluctance as though finding you would bring nearer the black irrational disaster that hung over us all.|$|R
30|$|Questioned on this subject, an Alikan {{shepherd}} simply {{answered that}} the modern <b>tents,</b> whether <b>umbrella</b> <b>tents</b> or in nylon, were not the nomads' tents. This is why the mosaic tents that keep {{the spirit of the}} traditional nomadic tent (enabling a partial and gradual renewal of the vellum without obliging the owner to invest in a new tent) and maintain the identity role are preferred by the Alikan tribe than the cotton or nylon tents even if they do not practice nomadism stricto sensu anymore. Indeed, it should be known that for the past few years, there have been several cases of definitive settlement by Alikan families in the city of Van. Those families have not abandoned sheep breeding, but now practice a local transhumance in a form of seminomadism, meeting every summer on the mountain pastures situated on the heights of Lake Van. Some of these families separate from their sheep every winter by selling them and buy new flocks in the spring to produce lambs and cheese.|$|R
5000|$|Initially an {{informal}} term by the occupiers, [...] "Umbrella Square" [...] became a recognised name as people continued {{to occupy the}} site. The name became incorporated into maps.

It was reported that postal services delivered to <b>Umbrella</b> Square <b>tent</b> addresses, although the Hong Kong Post officially denies having done so.|$|R

40|$|Panoramas {{filmed in}} the ruins of {{downtown}} San Francisco and outlying refugee camps following the 1906 earthquake and fire. A scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0102] Begins with a long, pan of downtown ruins viewed from Natoma Street between 4 th and 3 rd streets. The pan is from left to right (west to northeast). Buildings of interest: The old San Francisco Mint, with classic facade and two smokestacks is in the middle background. [0285] The Flood Building at Market and Powell streets is seen. [0632] The unfinished frame of the Butler Building (now I. Magnin's department store) rises behind the ruined apse of St. Patrick's Church on Mission Street. Note that the church facade had been demolished. [0796] In the far background is the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill. Closer at left is the tower frame of the Whittell Building, unfinished {{at the time of the}} earthquake. [1016] The Call Building at left is obscured by the Aronson Building. [1250] The white Monadnock Building is at left, the dark multi-bayed Palace Hotel is at right. Both stand west of 3 rd Street, facing Market Street. [1560] The arched facade [1962] may be St. Patrick's School on Natoma Street. Next is a pan showing the ruins of San Francisco's City Hall [2169], most of the visible damage being caused by the earthquake, not the subsequent fire. City Hall was located between Larkin and McAllister streets and set a block back from Market Street. The camera view is across Market Street from the west side of 8 th Street. The pan is from northwest to northeast. In sequence are [2298] the ruined southwest wing of City Hall, [2575] Marshall Square with the 1894 Pioneer Monument in front of the central tower and cupola of City Hall, [2908] the east wing, [3285] and the domed Hall of Records (demolished 1916). Nob Hill is visible in the background, at right. [3470] The camera pans to the left across one of the refugee camps located in public parks and undeveloped areas in the unburnt parts of the city. The <b>umbrella</b> and wall <b>tents</b> were army issue; the wooden shacks [3690] were built on site. This may be camp # 13 at Clinton Mound, at Market and Duboce streets. [3929] The crowd at left may be passing through the main entrance to Market Street. [Frame: 0103] This is the start of a panorama of a well-organized camp, probably in the Presidio, the U. S. Army base. [0350] These Chinese refugees are receiving their ration of food, and the distributor writes down each portion given out. Refugees from Chinatown were gathered at nearby Fort Mason, then moved to the Presidio Golf Links. Complaints of unpleasant cooking odors led to a third move to another Presidio location. [1076] This left-to-right pan (north to southeast) was shot from the southwest corner of 3 rd and Market streets. [1310] People watch safecrackers at work (note the sign advertising their services). [1377] A street clock stands before the entrance of the Mutual Savings Bank. [2411] The camera looks part way up Kearny Street. The view is northeast toward Lotta's Fountain (1875) and the Chronicle Building. [2526] Thick dust obscures Market Street and the distant Ferry Building. [2902] The ruins of the opulent Palace Hotel (left) and its modern neighbor, the Monadnock Building (right) are visible. [3186] Looking across 3 rd Street, the camera shows the dynamited remains of the Hearst Building and the exposed interior of the Monadnock Building. [4126] The camera looks down 3 rd Street as a Keuffel Poster Company cart (drafting and surveying supplies) passes. Copyright: American Mutoscope & Biograph Company; 19 May 1906; H 77926.
