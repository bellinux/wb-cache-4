25|$|When walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> The Gap at Watsons Bay, {{there is}} flat ground in between {{two sets of}} steps. This {{continues}} for a fair way in both directions, and is the old tram right of way.|$|E
25|$|The Gates of Doom pulsate {{with green}} mist as Indiana Jones struggles {{to keep the}} doors closed. Jones, {{speaking}} in Japanese, scolds the tourists for looking {{into the eyes of}} the Crystal Skull and instructs them to proceed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> the left. The triumphant musical theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark is heard as the transport accelerates up the flight of stairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} momentarily {{appears to}} head toward an exit, {{before making a}} sharp turn into a large crumbling corridor. Lightning flashes along the walls, illuminating large cobra statues overhead as the transport continues forward. The Gates of Doom pulsate with green mist and an audio-animatronic Indiana Jones struggles to keep the doors closed. Jones scolds the tourists for looking into the idol's eyes and instructs them to proceed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> the left. The transport then accelerates up the flight of stairs.|$|E

25|$|After the screening, the {{two couples}} stayed outside the theatre {{for a while}} but {{separated}} about 23:15. Olof and Lisbet Palme headed south {{on the west side}} of Sveavägen, towards the northern entrance of the Hötorget metro station. When they reached the Adolf Fredrik Church, they crossed Sveavägen and continued on the street's east side. They stopped a moment to look at something in a shop window, continued past the Dekorima shop which was then located on the corner of Sveavägen and Tunnelgatan, and headed for the metro station entrance on the other side of Tunnelgatan. At 23:21, halfway across the street and only a few metres from the station entrance, a man appeared from behind, shot Mr. Palme at point-blank range and fired a second shot at Mrs. Palme. The perpetrator then jogged down Tunnelgatan street, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> Malmskillnadsgatan and continued down David Bagares gata , where he was last seen.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} trip to the moon, Armstrong visited the Old City of Jerusalem. Walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> the Hulda Gates, when {{informed}} of the religious belief that Jesus had walked the same steps many times, he remarked to his Israeli archaeologist guide, [...] "I am more exctied stepping on these stones than I was stepping on the moon." ...|$|E
500|$|No further {{goals were}} scored, and the referee blew for full {{time with the}} final score 3–1 to Manchester City. As the players left the field, the crowd sang a chorus of [...] "For he's a jolly good fellow" [...] in tribute to Trautmann's bravery. Roy Paul led his team <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> the royal box to receive Manchester City's third FA Cup. Trautmann's neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and the Duke of Edinburgh commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Three days later, an examination revealed that Trautmann had broken a bone in his neck.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the central}} {{fountain}} is the Heroes Monument, {{set on a}} small hillside. You can walk <b>up</b> <b>the</b> many <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top and enjoy views over the city.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{open and}} there are {{organised}} tours <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 344 <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> balcony below the lantern room. These tours are available 5 days a week in summer and less frequently during other months.|$|R
60|$|Rose {{dropped her}} work, {{hurried to the}} door, and, opening it wide, stood there smiling down upon them so happily, that {{the faces of the}} lads brightened as they ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> eager <b>to</b> show that all was well with them.|$|R
500|$|On {{the morning}} of September 24, Summerfield and Humphreys called Nixon at his Missoula hotel. After {{securing}} his agreement to fly to Wheeling if Eisenhower agreed to Chotiner's terms, the two reached Eisenhower and campaign leader New Hampshire Governor Sherman Adams in Portsmouth, Ohio, en route to Wheeling, and briefed them on the conversation with Nixon and on the flood of communications from the public. The general and governor agreed that Nixon could come to Wheeling with the assurance he would remain on the ticket. After making speeches in Missoula and at a stop in Denver, and after Eisenhower made his own speech announcing that his running mate had {{been the victim of}} an [...] "attempted smear", Nixon arrived in Wheeling late in the day on the 24th. Eisenhower came to the airport to meet the plane, and hurried <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> greet the Nixons when the door was opened.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{appears in}} the video as a hooded wizard who enters an Egyptian palace and {{attempts}} to entertain the Pharaoh's bored Queen. Two other entertainers have failed, and she has sent them to be executed. The Queen sees that this wizard is different — instead of juggling or eating fire, he walks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> her throne and sings to her, asking her if she [...] "remembers the time" [...] they were together. The Pharaoh (played by Murphy) hardly appreciates this move and summons his guards. Jackson runs away to another room and begins elaborate, Egyptian-style choreography with the Pharaoh's servants. When the guards find him, Jackson [...] turns into golden sand. [...] In the video, Jackson {{was dressed in a}} costume made of gold satin. He wore golden chain mail, a white skirt with a phallic dangling sash, black pants and black boots. This video features a physically complicated dance routine that became the centerpiece of other videos from the Dangerous album.|$|E

60|$|He came {{directly}} toward the Squire's office and, still surrounded and hustled by <b>the</b> crowd, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steep <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office within. He flung his burden heavily upon the floor {{without a word}} and wiped his streaming forehead.|$|R

2500|$|The {{struggle}} {{continued for}} a few seconds. [...] Cox grabbed a chair and raised it to hit Myles, but Lee Smart unveiled the rifle he had had wrapped in a cone of leather and fired once, hitting Rothe in the chest, killing him instantly. [...] Myles turned on Cox and slashed with his cleaver, slicing Cox along his arm. [...] The inmates quickly herded the guards into the lavatory, along with a civilian mail-sorter, and locked them in. [...] Another guard, Officer Simonsen, was coming <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> Inside Administration, and Myles and Smart took him hostage and had him call the warden.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first sign}} of Ovechkin's future came when he was two years old—while in a toy store, he grabbed a toy hockey stick and refused to let go. His parents {{treasure}} the picture to this day. Whenever he saw a hockey game on TV, he [...] "dropped all his toys" [...] {{and ran to the}} TV, protesting if his parents tried to change the channel. His parents say they knew he would be an athlete when he chose to run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> their 10th floor apartment instead of taking the elevator. They also encouraged him to be athletic, sending him out to play at nearby football pitches and basketball courts.|$|E
2500|$|Díaz relates, [...] "...the dismal drum of Huichilobos sounded again,...we saw our comrades who {{had been}} {{captured}} in Cortés' defeat being dragged <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> be sacrificed...cutting open their chests, drew out their palpitating hearts which they offered to the idols...the Indian butchers...cut off their arms and legs...then they ate their flesh with a sauce of peppers and tomatoes...throwing their trunks and entrails to the lions and tigers and serpents and snakes." [...] Guatemoc then [...] "sent the hands and feet of our soldiers, and the skin of their faces...to all the towns of our allies..." [...] The Aztec sacrificed a batch of Spanish prisoners each night for ten nights. The Aztec cast off the cooked limbs of their prisoners to [...] the Tlaxcalans, shouting: [...] "Eat the flesh of these tueles [...] and of your brothers because we are sated with it".|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hall marched <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> marched {{straight}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} parlour {{and flung}} it open. [...] "Constable," [...] he said, [...] "do your duty." ...|$|R
60|$|And, {{standing}} aside {{with the}} courtly grace peculiar {{to those of}} his nationality, he allowed his companion <b>to</b> precede him <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> which led <b>to</b> Mirrab's tent.|$|R
60|$|<b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battlements {{she went}} ahead of him, with a youthful, eager haste that took no thought for the corpulence and {{short-windedness}} {{of the following}} Seneschal. From the heights she looked eastwards, shading {{her eyes from the}} light of the morning sun, and surveyed the procession which with slow dignity paced down the valley towards Condillac.|$|R
2500|$|On July 7, 1865, at 1:15 P.M., a {{procession}} led by General Hartranft escorted the four condemned prisoners through {{the courtyard and}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> the gallows. Each prisoner's ankles and wrists were bound by manacles. Surratt led the way, wearing a black bombazine dress, black bonnet, and black veil. More than 1,000 people, including government officials, members of the US armed forces, friends and family of the accused, official witnesses, and reporters, watched. General Hancock limited attendance {{to those who had}} a ticket, and only those who had a good reason to be present were given a ticket. (Most of those present were military officers and soldiers, as fewer than 200 tickets had been printed.) Alexander Gardner, who had photographed the body of Booth and taken portraits of several of the male conspirators while they were imprisoned aboard naval ships, photographed the execution for the government. Hartranft read the order for their execution. Surratt, either weak from her illness or swooning in fear (perhaps both), had to be supported by two soldiers and her priests. The condemned were seated in chairs, Surratt almost collapsing into hers. She was seated {{to the right of the}} others, the traditional [...] "seat of honor" [...] in an execution. White cloth was used to bind their arms to their sides and their ankles and thighs together. The cloths around Surratt's legs were tied around her dress below the knees. Each person was ministered to by a member of the clergy. From the scaffold, Powell said, [...] "Mrs. Surratt is innocent. She doesn't deserve to die with the rest of us." [...] Fathers Jacob and Wiget prayed over her and held a crucifix to her lips. About 16 minutes elapsed from the time the prisoners entered the courtyard until they were ready for execution.|$|E
2500|$|Balmoral Place {{was about}} two hundred metres from the Police Station in Harrison Road. The police office was quite large. At ground floor level there was the main {{reception}} behind double entrance doors. Further in were various rooms used for storage. At this level were the cells for the prisoners just arrested and for those prisoners attending the magistrates' court in the building. There was no basement in the building and this was why the court was on the first floor. Access from the cells to the court was up a short flight of stairs which had a double doored cage around them and a door at the stairs' base. This was for security and allowed the magistrates or judge to 'send the prisoner down'. There were twelve cells in total and these were for short duration use only. The prisoners travelled to and from Leeds prison. There was a large courtyard between the court building and the police station which was used for police parades. The parade ground was also used for exercising the horses and housed four stables. From reception, going <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> the first floor the first item encountered was the police enquiry desk. Behind the desk were three corridors. One corridor to the left housed the typists' room, a small room for the senior typist and a store room. There was also a sergeants anteroom and the sergeants main room. There was another corridor to the right which housed the chief typist, an inspector, a chief inspector and a superintendent. At the far end was the chief constable's office which had a constable seated at its entrance day and night. The Criminal Investigation Department was in another corridor. There was one more set of stairs {{at the rear of}} the police station. Letters from local residents in the Press i.e. [...] "The Halifax Courier", wrote that a measure of much needed discipline continue in the Halifax Force. Richardson was considered to be the man to bring this about and he had acquired the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian which continued throughout his career. He presented his first financial accounts to the Halifax Watch Committee on 28 September 1903 where the cost of the Constabulary per week averaged £164.1s.7d. The Police were paid weekly at this time. Within weeks Richardson persuaded the Watch Committee to purchase a Black Maria, a horse and a secure trailer fitted with lockable cubicles for transporting prisoners to and from the court in Halifax to Leeds prison. He insisted the design was adjusted so that it could rapidly become an ambulance should the need arise. In 1905 he attended a meeting in Bradford of the Chief Constables Association. An official photograph by the CCA shows him, his father and his brother among 40 attendees. A similar meeting of Chief Constables in the Association took place in Brighton, Sussex, in 1906, which he attended. In August 1905 after a recommendation from the Chief Constables report of the time, the Halifax force was increased by six additional constables.|$|E

60|$|The {{church was}} open, and a peep through the swing-doors showed her {{a small group}} {{standing}} before the altar. With {{her hand on her}} side she hobbled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallery, and, helping herself along by the sides of the pews, entered the end one of them all and sank exhausted on the cushions.|$|R
60|$|Now the guardsmen were {{forcing the}} Princess of Helium <b>up</b> <b>the</b> few <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} tyrant of Okar, and I had no eyes and no {{thoughts}} for aught else. A priest opened a book and, raising his hand, commenced to drone out a sing-song ritual. Salensus Oll reached for the hand of his bride.|$|R
60|$|She was {{conscious}} of her mother, up-stairs. From her place of meditation she had <b>to</b> crawl <b>up</b> <b>the</b> many <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flat and answer at least twenty questions as to {{what she had been}} doing. Of Walter's coming she could say nothing; she could not admit her interest in a man she did not know.|$|R
6000|$|RUFIO (pointing {{from the}} loggia to {{a cloud of}} smoke {{drifting}} over the harbor). See there! (Pothinus runs eagerly <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> look out.) ...|$|E

60|$|Eva came {{tripping}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> verandah <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> her father. It {{was late}} in the afternoon, and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind her, as she came forward in her white dress, with her golden hair and glowing cheeks, her eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that burned in her veins.|$|R
60|$|In {{the shock}} of {{enlightenment}} Ercole forgot to cuff the jester for his insolence, and allowed himself once more to be hurried along, across the outer court and <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battlements.|$|R
60|$|Wondering {{what the}} old gentleman could be doing there, Harold Quaritch walked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit of the mound, and found him {{standing}} {{at the entrance to}} the mushroom-shaped summer-house, contemplating the view.|$|R
