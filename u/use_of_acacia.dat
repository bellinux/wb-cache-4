This paper {{deals with the}} water <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> mangium {{at night in the}} hilly lands of subtropical South China. Our primary goal was to reveal and understand the nature of nighttime sap flow and its functional significance. Granier's thermal dissipation method was used to determine the nighttime sap flux of A. mangium. Gas exchange system was used to estimate nighttime leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance of studied trees. Nighttime sap flow was substantial and showed seasonal variation similar to the patterns of daytime sap flow in A. mangium. Mean nighttime sap flow was higher in the less precipitation year of 2004 (1122. 4 mm) than in the more precipitation year of 2005 (1342. 5 mm) since more daytime transpiration and low soil water availability in the relatively dry 2004 can be the cause of more nighttime sap flow. Although vapor pressure deficit and air temperature were significantly correlated with nighttime sap flow, they could only explain {{a small fraction of the}} variance in nighttime sap flow. The total accumulated water loss (E-L) by transpiration of canopy leaves was only similar to 2. 6 - 8. 5 % of the total nighttime sap flow (E-t) during the nights of July 17 - 18 and 18 - 19, 2006. Therefore, it is likely that the nighttime sap flow was mainly used for refilling water in the trunk. The stem diameter at breast height, basal area and sapwood area explained much more variance of nighttime water recharge than environmental factors and other tree form features, such as tree height, stem length below the branch, and canopy size. The contribution of nighttime water recharge to the total transpiration ranged from 14. 7 to 30. 3 % depending on different DBH class and was considerably higher in the dry season compared to the wet season...|$|E

Materials and methods: A study was carried out for the possible elucidation of mechanisms justifying the traditional medicinal uses of A. leucophloea (Fabaceae) in gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases. In vitro experiments were carried out over isolated rabbit jejunum and guinea-pig ileum in order to determine spasmolytic and bronchorelaxant activities, while in vivo studies were conducted in mice for antidiarrheal properties. Results: A methanol crude extract of barks of the plant caused a concentration-dependent relaxation (0. 1 - 3 mg/ml) of isolated rabbit jejunum preparations in a pattern similar to that of nifedipine and dicyclomine, suggesting a Ca(2 +) channel-blocking mechanism in addition to an anticholinergic effect. In guinea-pig ileum the extract caused a parallel shift in the Ach-curves without suppression of maximum contractile response, followed by a non-parallel shift with the suppression of maximum contractile response at higher concentration similar to that caused by dicyclomine. Moreover, in rabbit trachea, it also caused the relaxation of carbachol (1 mu M) and high K. -induced contractions at a dose ranging between 0. 1578 and 0. 734 mg/ml and 0. 46 - 0. 94 mg/ml, respectively. These findings indicate that the extract possesses spasmolytic and bronchodilator activities, mediated possibly through blockade of Ca 2 + channels, thus justifying its medicinal use in diarrhea and asthma. Acacia leucophloea methanol extract exhibited dose-dependent (100 - 500 mg/ml) protective effect against castor oil induced diarrhea.

40|$|Emergency relief project TCP/THA/ 0052 (E) {{addressed}} the disastrous situation after Typhoon "Gay" struck {{the south of}} Thailand in 1989. It was intended to rehabilitate land {{in the areas of}} Thae Sae and Pathiu districts of Chumporn province in southern Thailand and identify short-term cash income possibilities for farmers. It aimed at producing fast-growing trees for windbreaks and to promote sericulture. The project was able to buy seedlings for windbreak establishment; purchase spare parts for a mobile sawmill, and construction material for silkworm-rearing houses; train farmers, carpenters, sawmillers, forestry technicians; and train target beneficiaries in sericulture development. Given the interest shown by the farmers in fruit and other fast-growing trees for windbreaks, it is recommended that the Department of Agriculture Extension (DOAE) review the policy of fruit-tree propagation. Seedlings could be produced, even on a contractual basis, by small, low-cost village or private nurseries. The delegation of seedling production to the rural people themselves will create a consciousness for tree establishment that will contribute to rural income-generation and diversification. DOAE's role should be defined to monitor these small-scale nurseries and to train "nursery managers" in the propagation of fruit and forest trees. The nurseries established under the project and those expected to be built in Chumporn province by the DOAE provincial office, could be utilized both for delegated seedling production and as training facilities for private or communal nursery enterprises.

Eight initial oil-in-water emulsions containing 4 % w/w oil phase and 36 % w/w carrier consisting of different food polymers as maltodextrin DE 12, acacia gum and inulin, mixed in different proportions were prepared by rotor-stator homogenization and characterized for their size, size distribution and viscosity. They were spray dried in a pilot spray dryer in the same conditions (inlet and outlet air temperatures of 180 degrees C and 90 degrees C respectively, emulsion flow rate 57 g. min(- 1)) and the properties of the dry emulsions produced were characterized. Whatever the support used, the powder yield of the spray drying process was higher than 50 % without optimization of the operating conditions. The dry emulsions produced had similar properties (size, size distribution, density and flowability) and contained more than 73 % of the initial oil with only 5 % of the oil phase on the particle surface (unencapsulated). After powder dissolution in water, the reconstituted emulsions had a size distribution similar to that of the initial emulsions, indicating that spraying did not modify the emulsion structure. Due to its emulsifying and film forming properties, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>acacia</b> gum, in combination with maltodextrin and/or inulin, allowed obtaining more stable initial emulsions with controlled size distribution (similar to 2 mu m, monodispersed) leading to higher powder yield for spray drying (e. g., superior to 65 %).

40|$|Indigenous Australians {{were also}} known to use plants for {{medicinal}} purposes. For thousands of years, Indigenous Australians have used native plants {{as a source}} of medicinal agents. Some tribes living in Central Australia still, to this day, prefer to use traditional medicines in favour of the more common and readily available western medicines. A number of plant species endemic to Australia are listed in various Aboriginal pharmacopoeias, with approximately one-third of those species belonging to two genera, Acacia and Eremophila. Of the 1100 recognised species of Acacia, approximately 900 occur in Australia. At least thirty of these species were utilised by the Indigenous Australians {{as a source of}} medicine. Extracts of 8 Acacia species were screened using four frontline bioassays. These were the brine shrimp lethality test, the crown gall tumour assays, the disc diffusion antibiotic assay and the seed germination test to determine if any of the species were biologically active. Of all the species screened, Acacia pruinocarpa showed the most promise. The species demonstrated significant activity at concentrations at low as 3. 7 ppm, which is well below the standard 400 ppm exhibited by potassium dichromate (Sam, 1993). Acacia adsurgens and A. dictophleba were the next two promising species exhibiting activity at concentrations of 16. 12 ppm and 37 ppm respectively. This was a trend that was also observed in the Lettuce seed germination test for allelopathy with these three species showing the most promise. Interestingly the potency of A. pruinocarpa extract decreased significantly when it was re- screened after being put through a polyamide column. It can therefore be suggested that as tannins are removed by the polyamide column, the biological activity exhibited by A. pruinocarpa {{is a result of the}} tannin content in the species (2 %), although more testing is required. Both A. pruinocarpa and A. adsurgens showed promise as anti-tumour activity when used in the Crown Gall Tumour Assay (CGTA). Acacia pruinocarpa and A. adsurgens both exhibited significant activity when compared to the control producing inhibition percentages of 31 % and 37 % respectively. Surprisingly, only one of the Acacia species tested inhibited pathogenic growth when tested on the common pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens and Candida albicans. Acacia bivenosa was the only species to exhibit any activity when tested on the pathogens. This activity, however is not considered to be significant, as the species was only active against one of pathogens tested, Staphylococcus aureus. In order to be considered to be significant, a species must be active against two or more pathogens. It is however, worthy of further evaluation. Acacia species are among the large number of plants that have long been regarded sources of biological activity. This study was guided by the indigenous <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> species as sources of medicine, which led to the use of front-line bioassays. All of the species tested exhibited some form of biological activity. Acacia pruinocarpa demonstrated the most promise as a source of novel biologically active compounds exhibiting activity at very low concentrations. Such compounds have not been determined as it was outside the scope of this study to identify the active constituents of this species. However, it has been suggested that tannins are responsible for eliciting some of the activity observed in A. pruinocarpa. All of the species screened in this study are worthy of further evaluation. The bioassays used in this study are good examples of front-line bioassays. All of the tests used in the study fulfil the criterion, which defines a good test...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{feed supply}} in dry areas Cue: Good feeding {{is the most}} {{important}} factor in rearing goats. It is essential for good health, good reproduction, high milk yields and high growth rates. Goats enjoy having a varied diet, but this does not mean they will eat anything. In fact they are quite fussy, moving quickly while browsing to select the best available plants and parts of plants, in order to get the best diet they can. Farmers can face a number of problems in providing good feed to their goats. Feeds may have high levels of fibre, but only small amounts of protein and minerals. This reduces the amount the goats will eat, and slows their growth. There may also be a shortage of good quality feed, and of water, during the dry season. To solve this, some farmers grow out of season forage crops, or else store feeds during times of plenty, to feed to their animals later in the year. To find out more about how farmers can provide good feed to their goats, Busani Bafana spoke to Joe Sikosana, head of Zimbabwe?s Matopos Research Institute, and an expert in goat rearing. In particular, Busani wanted to learn what strategies farmers in dry areas, such as Zimbabwe?s Matabeleland, could use to maintain good feeding of their goats throughout the year. IN:		?The farmers can improve the feed ?? OUT:		??a specialist in goat production. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Busani Bafana reporting. Those rearing goats should be aware that if they decide to introduce new feeds to their animals, they should do this very gradually. To digest the feed, goats need to build up the correct micro-organisms in their digestive system. Goat owners should only give small amounts of a new feed at first, and slowly increase this amount over several days. The interview came from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sikosana	The farmers can improve the feed supply through various ways. For example, our rangelands are characterised by trees and shrubs. These trees of the Acacia class produce fruits or pods, and these pods normally get ripe during the dry season, and they fall off from the Acacia trees. One can ask what is the value of these Acacia trees? These Acacia trees are rich in proteins, especially the fruits, and the crude protein ranges between 11 - 18 per cent, and this is equivalent to concentrate feeds which farmers can buy from shops. Those pods can be fed directly to the goats without grinding or milling, but to reduce wastage, I would encourage farmers to mill or use the traditional pestle and mortar system. Bafana	What if farmers decide to actually grow the fodder, especially the out of season forage crops. What will be the best plants for them to grow? Sikosana	The best plants for them to grow. I will give an example, we have got a special grass which is called Banna grass. This usually thrives under dry conditions. As soon as it establishes, it doesn?t need much moisture. Then we also have trees like the mulberry tree, which every household has got; also that could supply goats with feed, especially the leaves. Then we have got the cactus pear, which can easily be grown in these dry areas, and the pads or leaves can be fed to goats without any problem. Then the other feeds which can be grown, for example crop residues which farmers grow in their fields, can easily be fed to goats, especially groundnut hay, or cowpea hay, or even maize stover. Bafana	In the case of farmers who decide to in fact grow the forage, what is the cost effectiveness of actually supplying this forage to the goats? Sikosana	It really is not very expensive. It is just a matter of, for instance mulberry trees, it is just a matter of pruning the leaves and feeding them directly to the goats. For the Banna grass, also it is a cut and carry system, which is really not labour intensive. Even for the cactus pear also, it is a cut and carry system, which can not be very expensive for the farmer if you look at the labour inputs. Bafana	I would then also want to find out, nutrition is very important, but then there could be problems that are related to nutrient or mineral deficiencies. How easy is it for farmers to identify the mineral deficiencies in their goats, particularly in arid areas like Matabeleland? Sikosana	Well it is very difficult, but sometimes a farmer can identify mineral deficiencies by checking the kids which are born by goats. Some can be deformed, this could be another sign of mineral deficiency. But taking the arid regions, I would say they are very rich in mineral contents which are suitable for goats or any other livestock. Bafana	Is it the mineral deficiencies we are talking about only, or could there also be a lack of a certain type of food? Sikosana	If we take, for example, a female goat which is pregnant. During pregnancy it will need some food with high protein so as to help it to be able to produce enough milk during lactation period. And I think protein and energy are very important for goats and the animal can get those from the proper feeds, especially the Acacia pods can supply enough of that. Bafana	The timing of mating and birthing is important. I would want to find out how important is the access to water for the nannies? Sikosana	The nannies, really I will say water is very important, they will need water on a daily basis for them to supply enough milk and be able to have good health. And I will say a goat will need almost around 5 litres a day, and they need to be watered daily. Bafana	In Zimbabwe, goat farmers have developed a security strategy for their assets. Mr Sikosana, please share this with our listeners. Sikosana	Yes, goat farmers have a developed a strategy in protecting their goats. I think people are quite aware that stock theft is very rife in these communal areas. What certain farmers have done, is that they have started raising dog puppies with their goats. What they do, these dogs are fed with goat milk in the kraals, and they stay with the goats in the kraals until they are able to walk around with the goats in the grazing areas. This has worked very well, and these dogs are very protective and fearless, and they won?t allow any stranger to get into a goat flock who is not known. Bafana	There you are listeners, an innovation by goat farmers in Zimbabwe. I was speaking to Mr Joe Sikosana, who is the head of the Matopos Research Station, and a specialist in goat production.

The acacias showed no clear photosynthetic advantage over the fynbos species, although, the former tended to have higher photosynthetic capacities and water use efficiencies.

Where land tenure is clear and ownership of the trees is unambiguous, there was widespread enthusiasm for tree planting in all four areas studied. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> casuarinas on sand dune areas as a coastal protection belt, for farm windbreaks and agroforestry, seems entirely positive on all social, ecological and economic criteria. Likewise the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>acacias</b> provided significant economic and environmental benefits as an essential windbreak around (exotic) coffee and pepper plantations in the highlands near the Laos border, and in mixed plantations on farms in the low hills as a component of a mosaic landscape. Small-scale eucalyptus planting for local fuelwood and construction materials in the foothills has no discernible social or ecological ill-effects, offers one of the few economically viable land use options for both women and men, and creates a low-cost alternative to collection of wood from the few remaining natural forests. Through consultation between local villagers, government forestry extension workers, NGO assistance programmes, and other land users, appropriate species and silvicultural systems are being developed to significantly enhance social and economic welfare with minimal adverse environmental impact. The farmers concluded that provided the trees meet their needs, they do not care about the country of origin of that species...|$|R

Body weight of the Brahman steers was used as blocks while the percentage <b>of</b> dry <b>acacia</b> leaf in concentrate feed at 0, 10, 20 and 30 was used as treatment groups. The Brahman steers were fed for ninety days. The results revealed that average body weight gain, growth rate, and feed conversion ratio of Brahman steers receiving the concentrate feed with different levels <b>of</b> dry <b>acacia</b> leaf {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 05). The Brahman steers that received the percentage <b>of</b> dry <b>acacia</b> leaf in concentrate feed at 0, 10, 20 and 30 had average body weight gains of 95. 28, 100. 00, 82. 89 and 93. 32 kg/head while average growth rates were 1. 06, 1. 11, 0. 92 and 1. 04 kg/head/day, feed conversion ratios were 10. 79, 10. 01, 10. 98 and 9. 95, and the total feed cost/kg weight gain were 33. 18, 32. 11, 30. 31 and 28. 25 Baht, respectively.

40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} {{different}} <b>uses</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> introduced Australian <b>acacias</b> (wattles; Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) by rural households and communities. Location Eighteen landscape-scale case studies around the world, in Vietnam, India, Re´union, Madagascar, South Africa, Congo, Niger, Ethiopia, Israel, France, Portugal, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic and Hawai'i. Methods Qualitative comparison of case studies, based on questionnaire sent to network <b>of</b> <b>acacia</b> researchers. Information based on individual knowledge of local experts, published and unpublished sources. Results We propose a conceptual model to explain current <b>uses</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> introduced <b>acacias.</b> It highlights historically and geographically contingent processes, including economic development, environmental discourses, political context, and local or regional needs. Four main groupings of case studies were united by similar patterns: (1) poor communities benefiting from targeted agroforestry projects; (2) places where residents, generally poor, {{take advantage of}} a valuable resource already present in their landscape via plantation and/or invasion; (3) regions of small and mid-scale tree farmers participating in the forestry industry; and (4) a number of high-income communities dealing with the legacies of former or niche <b>use</b> <b>of</b> introduced <b>acacia</b> in a context of increased concern over biodiversity and ecosystem services. Main conclusions Economic conditions play a key role shaping acacia use. Poorer communities rely strongly on acacias (often in, or escaped from, formal plantations) for household needs and, sometimes, for income. Middle-income regions more typically host private farm investments in acacia woodlots for commercialization. Efforts at control <b>of</b> invasive <b>acacias</b> must take care to not adversely impact poor dependent communities. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Plant {{species have}} long been used as {{principal}} ingredients of traditional medicine in far-west Nepal. The medicinal plants with ethnomedicinal values are currently being screened for their therapeutic potential but their data and information are inadequately compared and analyzed with the Ayurveda and the phytochemical findings. Methods The present study evaluated ethnomedicinal plants and their uses following literature review, comparison, field observations, and analysis. Comparison was made against earlier standard literature of medicinal plants and ethnomedicine of the same area, the common <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> the Ayurveda and the latest common phytochemical findings. The field study for primary data collection was carried out from 2006 - 2008. Results The herbal medicine in far-west Nepal {{is the basis of}} treatment of most illness through traditional knowledge. The medicine is made available via ancient, natural health care practices such as tribal lore, home herbal remedy, and the Baidhya, Ayurveda and Amchi systems. The traditional herbal medicine has not only survived but also thrived in the trans-cultural environment with its intermixture of ethnic traditions and beliefs. The present assessment showed that traditional herbal medicine has flourished in rural areas where modern medicine is parsimoniously accessed because of the high cost and long travel time to health center. Of the 48 Nepalese medicinal plants assessed in the present communication, about half of the species showed affinity with the common <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> the Ayurveda, earlier studies and the latest phytochemical findings. The folk <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> catechu for cold and cough, Aconitum spicatum as an analgesic, Aesculus indica for joint pain, Andrographis paniculata for fever, Anisomeles indica for urinary affections, Azadirachta indica for fever, Euphorbia hirta for asthma, Taxus wallichiana for tumor control, and Tinospora sinensis for diabetes are consistent with the latest pharmacological findings, common Ayurvedic and earlier uses. Conclusions Although traditional herbal medicine is only a primary means of health care in far-west Nepal, the medicine has been pursued indigenously with complementing pharmacology and the Ayurveda. Therefore, further pharmacological evaluation of traditional herbal medicine deserves more attention. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aboriginal {{people of}} Australia possess a rich {{knowledge}} on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> medicinal plants {{for the treatment}} of sores, wounds, and skin infections, ailments which impose a high global disease burden and require effective treatments. The antibacterial and antioxidant activities and phytochemical contents of extracts, obtained from eight medicinal plants used by Aboriginal people of New South Wales, Australia, {{for the treatment of}} skin related ailments, were assessed to add value to and provide an evidence-base for their traditional <b>uses.</b> Extracts <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> implexa, Acacia falcata, Cassytha glabella, Eucalyptus haemastoma, Smilax glyciphylla, Sterculia quadrifida, and Syncarpia glomulifera were evaluated. All extracts except that of S. quadrifida showed activity against sensitive and multidrug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 7. 81 to 1000 [*]μg/mL. The sap of E. haemastoma and bark of A. implexa possessed high total phenolic contents (TPC) and strong DPPH radical scavenging abilities. A positive correlation was observed between TPC and free radical scavenging ability. GC-MS analysis of the n-hexane extract of S. glomulifera identified known antimicrobial compounds. Together, these results support the traditional <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> the examined plants for the treatment of skin related ailments and infections by Aboriginal people of New South Wales, Australia. 14 page(s...|$|R

The Ebers Papyrus from 1550 BCE and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850 BCE have within them {{some of the}} earliest documented descriptions of birth control, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> honey, <b>acacia</b> leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm. Another early document explicitly referring to birth control methods is the Kahun Gynecological Papyrus from about 1850 BCE. It describes various contraceptive pessaries, including acacia gum, which recent research has confirmed to have spermatocidal qualities and is still used in contraceptive jellies. Other birth control methods mentioned in the papyrus include the application of gummy substances to cover the [...] "mouth of the womb" [...] (i.e. the cervix), a mixture of honey and sodium carbonate applied {{to the inside of the}} vagina, and a pessary made from crocodile dung. Lactation (breast-feeding) of up to three years was also used for birth control purposes in ancient Egypt.|$|R
40|$|Lowered {{plasma protein}} {{concentration}} following single injections <b>of</b> gum <b>acacia</b> {{in the dog}} is due in some part to dilution, and in greater part to actual decrease in total circulating protein. The maximum decrease in the total circulating protein does not {{take place at the}} same time as the maximum decrease in concentration. Fluctuations in fibrinogen concentration are marked, and are not necessarily proportional to changes in plasma protein concentration. Plasma protein concentration returns to normal limits within 10 to 21 days after the injection, at which time total circulating protein and plasma volume are lower than normal. Loss of protein cannot be accounted for by increase in urinary nitrogen. It is possible to maintain dogs at low levels of plasma protein concentration for several weeks by repeated injections <b>of</b> gum <b>acacia</b> solution. Anatomical changes following such a procedure in a normal dog are most conspicuous in the liver (Fig. A). These observations further implicate the liver as a source of plasma protein. Two mechanisms for the diminution of plasma protein following gum injection are suggested. One of these is based on the possibility that the liver cells being engorged with gum acacia are not able to produce the necessary amount of plasma protein to supply the normal demand. The other possibility is that with the injection of the gum, since there is obviously a greatly increased amount of colloid in the blood, the more readily removable colloid, i. e. plasma protein, is taken out of the blood stream, in an attempt to return plasma volume and colloid osmotic pressure to the normal limits. It is probable that both of these mechanisms are involved. Injection <b>of</b> gum <b>acacia</b> is suggested as a technique for further study of disturbed liver function. It must be obvious that clinical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> gum <b>acacia</b> for intravenous injection is not without danger...|$|R

In this study, we focused on the impact <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> saligna, an Australian invasive plant species, on the coastal ecosystem’s ecology and biodiversity along the sandy coasts of Molise (southern Italy). We analyzed data from 61 vegetation plots recorded in coastal pine forest and Mediterranean scrub habitats of Molise throughout the preparatory actions of the “LIFE Maestrale” project (NAT/IT/ 000262). In order to study the ecological impact <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> saligna comparing invaded and non-invaded areas, we first assigned the Ellenberg’s indicator values to each plant species, which were then used to relate the presence <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> saligna with ecological characteristics of sites through a generalized linear model (GLM). Our results showed a significant positive relationship between the presence <b>of</b> <b>Acacia</b> saligna and high levels of soil nutrients and, on the contrary, a negative relationship with the presence of mesophilic species, which are typical of the community interest habitats of pine forest (2270 *). The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ecological indicators is effective to pinpoint the ecological effects of biological invasions, as well as to evaluate habitat conservation state and to identify vulnerable native species...|$|R
