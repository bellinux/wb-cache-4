It is {{adaptable}} tree for tropical and sub-tropical regions which requires excellent drainage and a sunny location. It grows easily from seed. Historically, this plant has long been used in India and neighboring regions as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> traditional medicines, animal fodder, green manure, timber, fish poison and fuel. Extract of the plant possess significant anti-diarrhoeal, anti-fungal, anti-plasmodial, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Its oil is a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel.</b> It has also alternative <b>source</b> <b>of</b> energy, which is renewable, safe and non-pollutant.

40|$|This work {{provides}} {{details of}} an activity undertaken {{to determine the}} relevant properties of Croton megalocarpus seeds as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> vegetable oil and its prospects as a non-food crop <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel.</b> C. megalocarpus is a tree indigenous to East Africa which grows up to a height of 35 – 40 m and produces seeds which contain 40 – 45 % oil on a mass basis. The seeds were examined and properties determined that relate to their transport and storage/handling characteristics. Oil was extracted mechanically from the seeds using a hydraulic press and chemically from the pressing residue using petroleum ether. The combustion quality of the extracted crude vegetable oil such as the gross calorific value, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen content and ash content were then determined. This study indicates that the oil from the C. megalocarpus tree has a strong potential as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} bio-feedstocks are {{currently}} being experimented for biodiesel production and usage. Algal biomass has {{emerged as one of}} the most promising <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> production. Although research into algae as a potential <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> is not new, the current oil crises and fast depleting fossil oil reserves have made it more imperative for organizations and countries to invest more time and efforts into research on suitable renewable energy options such as algal oil. Algal fuel as a viable alternative to traditional fuel (diesel) is renewable, carbon neutral, economically sustainable and environmentally friendly. Algal oil can be extracted with methanol via transesterification reaction in the presence of a catalyst to yield biodiesel. The biodiesel produced can be used as jet fuel and as <b>source</b> <b>of</b> fuel in other transportation systems. Finally, since algal oil is non-edible, it does not compromise edible oil which is for human consumption thus, erasing the food versus fuel debate. An attempt is made to review the potential and prospects of microalgae as a sustainable energy provider, thus, providing a stimulus to initiate more research in this area...|$|R
