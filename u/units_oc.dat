40|$|Summer {{cabbages}} in an alpine {{area are}} very sensitive to the fluctuations in supply and demand. Yield variability due to weather conditions dictates the market fluctuations of cabbage price. This study reports an empirical relationship based on weather conditions to estimate the growth and harvestable biomass of cabbages, factors that are critical for supply of summer cabbages. Based on experimental results testing sowing date effects over the two years from 1997 to 1998, a logistic equation was parameterized to predict leaf area expansion of summer cabbages. This logistic model for leaf area expansion was then combined with an empirical allometric relationship to predict total biomass. The final equation for estimating fresh weight accumulation of Chinese cabbage is given by: Fresh weight = 3500 /(1 +exp(5. 175 - 1. 153 ×(6 /(1 +exp(6. 367 - 0. 0064 ×PHU))))) Where PHU is potential heat <b>units</b> (<b>oC).</b> The model performance was tested using weather data from 2003 to 2006 to predict fresh harvestable biomass. Overall the model performance was satisfactory with the correlation efficient rangin...|$|E

50|$|Whilst policy {{requires}} a cadet {{to complete a}} promotion course to attain any rank from CDTCPL to CUO/CDTWO, this policy is often interpreted flexibly, with some cadets being promoted {{up to and including}} the rank of CDTSSGT without having done the course, as promotions of CDTSSGT or below are decided at the individual <b>unit</b> <b>OC's</b> discretion. Promotion above CDTSSGT need to be authorised at the Brigade/Regional Headquarters level. Promotions courses are run by each Region for their own cadets and are generally planned by the Regional Headquarters. Permission may also be extended to Battalion Headquarters (in large regions) and individual cadet units (usually school based) to run courses, as needed, independently to that of the Regional run courses, where a Brigade/Unit will supply staff to run the course.|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the temporal discharge patterns of single units from the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) of anaesthetized guinea-pigs in response to iterated rippled noise (IRN). The pitch range evoked by the stimuli was from 32 to 1000 Hz. Single units were classified into four groups using existing classification schemes: primary-like (PL), onset (O), sustained chopper (CS) and transient chopper (CT). For all unit types the delay of the IRN stimuli was well represented in the all-order interspike interval histograms (ISIHs). A subset of the onset <b>units</b> (onset-chopper, <b>OC)</b> showed a clear preference for some delays of the IRN in their first-order interval statistics. We describe this delay preference as ‘periodicity tuning’. The delay at which the pitch estimate was at its maximum was designated its best periodicity. The range of best periodicities for <b>OC</b> <b>units</b> was 3. 75 - 13 ms (between 77 and 267 Hz). The other unit types also showed enhancement of the first-order interval statistics at the delay of the IRN. The range of best periodicities was 1. 4 - 8. 8 ms (113 - 714 Hz) for the CT group, 2. 25 - 10. 8 ms (93 - 444 Hz) for the CS group and 0. 5 - 4. 6 ms (217 - 2000 Hz) for the PL group. The correlation between the maximum interval enhancement observed {{in response to the}} IRN stimuli and the peak in the first-order ISIH in response to white noise was 0. 81 for <b>OC</b> <b>units,</b> 0. 72 for CS units, 0. 44 for CT units and - 0. 15 for PL units. These results demonstrate that all unit types in the VCN can enhance the representation of the delay of IRN using first-order interspike intervals (ISIs) over a range of periodicities. CS and <b>OC</b> <b>units</b> show the greatest range of best periodicities and they are well-suited to encode the delay of IRN in their first-order ISIs {{for a wide range of}} pitches...|$|R

5000|$|The federal {{government}} of the United States {{makes no mention of}} Scoville heat <b>units</b> (SHU) or <b>OC</b> in their requirements, only CRC (only for bear attack deterrent sprays). But, there are countries (Italy, Portugal and Spain - see below, under [...] "Legality") and a few states within the US (Michigan with a 10% OC limit) that do mention OC limitations. Some manufacturers may show a very high percentage of OC and, although OC is the active ingredient within the formulation, it does not indicate pepper spray strength. High OC percentage also indicates that a spray has more oil content; which, can possibly use lower grade pepper oils (but, more of it), or lower grade capsaicinoids (within the major CRCs) and also has less ability to soak and penetrate skin than a formula with a less, but higher-quality, pepper oil, because oil has hydrophobic properties.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{composition}} and quantification of vascular plant-derived phenols in {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) is of importance in understanding and estimating carbon flux from soils under different land uses. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was used to extract waterborne organic matter (WBM), and thermally assisted hydrolysis (THM) using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was compared with gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for the quantification of oxygenated aromatics in WBM, from freshwater samples from grazed grassland, woodland and moorland land uses in southwest England, UK. WBM recovered with SPE correlated with water total organic carbon (TOC) content. SPE followed by THM was shown to be the approach for isolating and quantifying water-transportable phenols. All the different land uses exported similar amounts of lignin per <b>unit</b> weight of <b>OC</b> to the drainage water. We also conclude that {{a significant proportion of}} lignin phenols is lost from soils as a component of WBM in a particulate form, so the magnitude of total phenol loss is likely greater than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Random {{copolymers}} of e-caprolactone and 2 -oxo- 12 -crown- 4 ether, poly(CL-co-OC), {{were used}} as soft segments in the synthesis {{of a set of}} poly(urethane) urea thermoplastic elastomers. With increasing OC content, the soft segment crystallinity decreased, which influenced the mech. properties: strain induced crystn. disappeared upon the introduction of OC into poly(CL). The material therefore became weaker, however, without a redn. in strain at break. All polymers showed mech. properties that are suitable for soft tissue engineering. Degrdn. studies of poly(CL-co-OC) copolymers revealed a higher intrinsic rate of hydrolysis as compared to poly(CL). When at least two neighboring <b>OC</b> <b>units</b> were present in the soft segment, a jump in the intrinsic hydrolysis rate was obsd. From this study we deduced an ideal OC:CL ratio for the thermoplastic elastomer soft segments for soft tissue engineering applications. An in vitro degrdn. study of these poly(urethane) urea showed an increased wt. loss. Combined with the enhanced hydrophilicity and reduced crystallinity, we are confident that this will indeed lead to an increased degrdn. rate in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Permafrost thaw in the Arctic {{driven by}} {{climate change is}} mobilizing ancient terrigenous organic carbon (OC) into fluvial networks. Understanding the {{controls}} on metabolism of this OC is imperative for assessing its role with respect to climate feedbacks. In this study, we examined the effect of inorganic nutrient supply and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition on aquatic extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) in waters draining the Kolyma River Basin (Siberia), including permafrost-derived OC. Reducing the phenolic content of the DOM pool resulted in dramatic increases in hydrolase EEAs (e. g., phosphatase activity increased > 28 -fold) supporting the idea that high concentrations of polyphenolic compounds in DOM (e. g., plant structural tissues) inhibit enzyme synthesis or activity, limiting OC degradation. EEAs were significantly more responsive to inorganic nutrient additions only after phenolic inhibition was experimentally removed. In controlled mixtures of modern OC and thawed permafrost endmember OC sources, respiration rates per <b>unit</b> dissolved <b>OC</b> were 1. 3 – 1. 6 times higher in waters containing ancient carbon, suggesting that permafrost-derived OC was more available for microbial mineralization. In addition, waters containing ancient permafrost-derived OC supported elevated phosphatase and glucosidase activities. Based on these combined results, we propose that both composition and nutrient availability regulate DOM metabolism in Arctic aquatic ecosystems. Our empirical findings are incorporated into a mechanistic conceptual model highlighting two key enzymatic processes in the mineralization of riverine OM: (i) the role of phenol oxidase activity in reducing inhibitory phenolic compounds and (ii) the role of phosphatase in mobilizing organic P. Permafrost-derived DOM degradation was less constrained by this initial ‘phenolic-OM’ inhibition; thus, informing reports of high biological availability of ancient, permafrost-derived DOM with clear ramifications for its metabolism in fluvial networks and feedbacks to climate...|$|R
40|$|A common way {{to store}} {{digestate}} from anaerobic digesters is in open air lagoons. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether cooling of digestate before transfer to the storage prevents methane production. Furthermore, if methanogenesis is not prevented, to determine the potential maximum methane slip from an open air lagoon, supplied with heat exchanged digestate from a mesophilic co-digestion plant such as Linköping biogas plant. Results indicate that methane production is not terminated by cooling and that a high methane production can occur in open air lagoons if the conditions are advantageous. Furthermore, the results suggest that it can be worthwhile, from both an economical and an environmental point, to replace open air lagoons with closed post-digesting <b>units.</b> At 25 <b>oC,</b> the methane slip from an open air lagoon could reach as high as 2. 6 % of the total methane production of a biogas plant, even when the volume of the open air lagoon is only one third of the digesters volume. The combination of low additional cost of production, with significant decrease in release of green house gases to the atmosphere, makes the implementation of post-digestion units at larger biogas plants attractive...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} set-up to {{identify}} the long-term effect of biochar on soil C sequestration of recent carbon inputs. Arable fields (n= 5) were found in Belgium with charcoal enriched black spots (> 50 m 2; n= 14) dating > 150 years ago from historical charcoal production mound kilns. Topsoils from these “black spots” had a higher organic C concentration (3. 6 ± 0. 9 % OC) than adjacent soils outside these black spots (2. 1 ± 0. 2 % OC). The soils had been cropped with maize for at least 12 years which provided a continuous input of C with a C isotope signature (δ 13 C) - 13. 1, distinct from the δ 13 C of soil organic carbon (- 27. 4 ‰) and charcoal (- 25. 7 ‰) collected in the surrounding area. The isotope signatures in the soil revealed that maize derived C concentration was significantly higher in charcoal amended samples (“black spots”) than in adjacent unamended ones (0. 44 % versus 0. 31 %; P= 0. 02). Topsoils were subsequently collected as a gradient across two “black spots” along with corresponding adjacent soils outside these black spots and soil respiration and physical soil fractionation was conducted. Total soil respiration (130 days) was unaffected by charcoal but the maize derived C respiration per <b>unit</b> maize derived <b>OC</b> in soil significantly decreased about half (P< 0. 02) with increasing charcoal derived C in soil. Maize derived C was proportionally more present in protected soil aggregates {{in the presence of}} charcoal. The lower specific mineralisation and increased C sequestration of recent C with charcoal is attributed to a combination of physical protection, C-saturation of microbial communities and, potentially, slightly higher annual primary production. Overall, this study provides evidence of the capacity of biochar to enhance C sequestration in soils through reduced C turnover on the long-term...|$|R
