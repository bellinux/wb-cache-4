30|$|Automated target {{tracking}} and recognition (ATR) {{is an important}} capability in many military and civilian applications. In this work, we mainly focus on tracking and recognition techniques for infrared (IR) imagery, which is a preferred imaging modality for most military applications. A major challenge in vision-based ATR is {{how to cope with}} the variations of target appearances due to different viewpoints and underlying 3 D structures. Both factors, identity in particular, are usually represented by discrete variables in practical existing ATR algorithms [1 – 3]. In this paper we will account for both factors in a continuous manner by using view and identity manifolds. Coupling the two manifolds for target representation facilitates the ATR process by allowing us to meaningfully synthesize new target appearances to deal with previously <b>unknown</b> <b>targets</b> as well as both known and <b>unknown</b> <b>targets</b> under previously unseen viewpoints.|$|R

5000|$|A {{similar study}} {{was done in}} [...] where theauthors carry out {{experimental}} evaluation of a few uncalibrated visual servosystems that were popular in the 90’s. The major outcome was the experimental evidence {{of the effectiveness of}} visual servo control over conventionalcontrol methods.Kyrki et al. analyze servoing errors for position based and 2-1/2-Dvisual servoing. The technique involves determining the error in extractingimage position and propagating it to pose estimation and servoing control.Points from the image are mapped to points in the world a priori to obtain a mapping (which is basically the homography, although not explicitly statedin the paper). This mapping is broken down to pure rotations and translations. Pose estimation is performed using standard technique from ComputerVision. Pixel errors are transformed to the pose. These are propagating tothe controller. An observation from the analysis shows that errors in theimage plane are proportional to the depth and error in the depth-axis isproportional to square of depth.Measurement errors in visual servoing have been looked into extensively.Most error functions relate to two aspects of visual servoing. One beingsteady state error (once servoed) and two on the stability of the controlloop. Other servoing errors that have been of interest are those that arisefrom pose estimation and camera calibration. In, the authors extend thework done in [...] by considering global stability in the presence of intrinsicand extrinsic calibration errors. provides an approach to bound the taskfunction tracking error.

50|$|By 2013 {{the drug}} {{discovery}} market had begun shifting from the single to the multi-target paradigm, of which Persomics’ {{technology is a}} part. Prior to that time, popular drug discovery efforts focused on identifying single drugs that fit into specific cellular targets; this {{came to be known}} as target-based screening (i.e. reverse pharmacology). The multi-target approach entails the understanding that, although one drug compound might fit into a single target, diseases are associated with complex biological processes, and often multiple cellular targets, which are more difficult to unlock. Today phenotypic screening is enjoying a significant resurgence as part of the portfolio of drug discovery strategies leveraged at most companies. This is because phenotypic screening products (such as those offered by Persomics) offer a potentially revolutionary approach to discerning multiple cellular targets as the basis for genetic disease. Phenotypic screening can lead to the identification of a molecule that modifies an organism or disease phenotype; it does this by acting on a previously <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> or by acting simultaneously on more than one target. Phenotypic screening is therefore a method utilized in perceiving gene expression. This is of importance to human health because eukaryotic cells (e.g. human cells) have many sophisticated ways of controlling gene expression.One of those ways is through the agency of siRNAs. By directing gene silencing, siRNAs act as RNA interference, effectively inhibiting expression of a gene in question. Since the time that the human genome was sequenced, the siRNAs correlating to each gene have been synthesized by various companies. The use of siRNAs therefore facilitates research into the human genome by allowing for selective suppression of specific genes of interest. Persomics produces a ready-made experiment kit in which any of these siRNAs can be contained. The kit contains the company’s plates, which can hold approximately 3,000 spots of sub-millimeter-sized siRNAs; these can be specified by the researcher requesting the kit. The experiment allows investigators to conduct multiple experiments (up to 3,000 per plate) of different libraries. A researcher is therefore able to discern and validate several things: the ways in which genes are regulated, the specific mechanisms of biological signaling pathways, and the multiple cellular targets, and various genes manipulated as a result of disease. The approach used by the company is a variation on the efficiency and scale of phenotypic screening.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1954 Armas' CIA-backed forces {{went into}} Guatemala. A {{representative}} {{met with the}} Guatemalan military commander {{to see if he}} would lead a coup against Árbenz. The military did not act at this time, as it had its own agenda and wanted a target to be eliminated. The CIA requested permission to bomb an <b>unknown</b> <b>target,</b> but it was never granted before Árbenz resigned himself. Although the CIA's operations were a failure, the Árbenz regime suddenly collapsed without any significant violence when the Guatemalan military turned against it. The lack of actual violence was significant due to the possibility of a much larger, much bloodier revolution to dispose Arbenz. This not only included civil unrest inside Guatemala, but also action done by the U.S. government. On two occasions, CIA officers demanded a stronger U.S. presence on the ground. An unnamed dissident leader called {{for the creation of a}} covert action group to perform [...] "violent, illegal acts" [...] against the Guatemalan government, as well proposing an extermination a top-tier communist leader. Another officer radioed to LINCOLN station to request a bombing of a Guatemalan city, his message ending in [...] "Bomb Repeat Bomb". Following the appointment of John Peurifoy to the post of Ambassador to Guatemala in 1953, Peurifoy used his governmental influence in Guatemala to spur on rebellion against the Arbenz government, and helping funnel money and weapons to the rebels supporting Castillo. Lastly, Peurifoy, expecting a violent revolution, suggested that American citizens be evacuated from Guatemala. Toreillo pleaded Peurifoy to not carry out this idea, for he believed that the presence of American citizens limited violence in Guatemala, and with their evacuation there would be an increase in civil violence in Guatemala. Therefore, it demonstrates the way in which the State Department was cooperating with the CIA to funnel money and weapons into a South American country to support a pro-Western dictator, a strategy that would become common for the State Department and CIA throughout the Cold War. [...] In the eleven days after the resignation of President Árbenz, five successive military junta governments occupied the Guatemalan presidential palace; each junta was successively more amenable to the political demands of the U.S., after which, Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas assumed the Presidency of Guatemala.|$|E
