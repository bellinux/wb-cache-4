40|$|Early {{studies on}} the {{saturated}} felting value of the <b>untreated</b> plain knitted <b>wool</b> fabrics were only confined to a narrow range of yarn linear densities and machine gauges without any generalised conclusion. In this project, the plain knitted wool fabrics produced on commongauge flat-knitting machines were investigated {{in terms of a}} wide range of yarn linear densities, loop lengths, tightness factors, yarn twists and fibre diameters. The knitted fabrics were taken to undergo the IWS 6 x 5 A washing in order to obtain the saturated felting shrinkage. The data obtained after statistical analyses revealed that the saturated felting value of the <b>untreated</b> plain knitted <b>wool</b> fabrics depended upon loop length and tightness factor while the yarn linear density, fibre diameter and yarn twist had no significant effect on the saturated felting value.

5000|$|Since rabbits ingest their wool {{when they}} groom themselves, {{clipping}} their wool {{at least once}} every 90 days is considered a must to prevent wool block from occurring. A dietary supplement of papaya (from the vitamin section of the grocery store) in their diet helps wool to break down in their digestive tract. The wool swallowed by a rabbit cannot be coughed or vomited up, and will cause it to slowly starve to death as its digestive tract fills up with ingested wool; if left <b>untreated,</b> <b>wool</b> block can lead to death. It is widely held among serious Angora breeders that ample cage space to exercise and feeding fresh, horse-quality hay {{on a daily basis}} will help keep the wool moving through the system and prevent wool block.

In particular, {{the role of the}} lipid layer surrounding the wool fibers and the oxidation of wool has been studied in terms of polymer adsorption. For this, polymer particles consisting of cross-linked polystyrene cores and containing surface ammonium chloride groups have been synthesized. These colloidal particles are solely stabilized through electrostatic repulsion. It was shown that, under the same conditions, no polymer particles are adsorbed onto <b>untreated</b> <b>wool</b> while a monolayer is adsorbed onto wool of which the lipid layer has been removed. Wool oxidized with peroxomonosulfuric acid displays a very similar behavior in terms of wetting characteristics and polymer adsorption to <b>untreated</b> <b>wool,</b> despite an increased amount of cysteic acid on the fiber surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that the lipid layer is still intact after this oxidative treatment. A monolayer of polymer particles can be observed on the wool surface after the removal of the lipid layer.

Fire retardants additives used has been boric acid, borax pentahydrate, ammonium polyphosphate, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide. This {{have been added to}} the different cellulose pulps, alone and in combination, to evaluate whether they prevent or provide better conditions for mold growth. A Glava glass wool was also tested to compare the cellulose materials with a commercial product. To insure the results from the Glava testing, <b>untreated</b> glass <b>wool</b> was also tested. Two different test methods, referred to as Method 1 and Method 2, have been used to determine the extent of mold growth in the prepared samples. Method 1 was developed as a simple pretest to determine what samples was to be tested further in Method 2. Method 2 was based on a previous master thesis with a similar topic to the one in this project, and included incubating the samples with a spore suspension. As it turns out, Method 1 gave rapid results that were easy to interpret, and provided most of the results used in the conclusion of this report, while Method 1 had a slower development in the mold growth, and further study has been recommended. From the results, it was found that ammonium polyphosphate provides good conditions for mold growth in cellulose fiber, but that this can be prevented by addition of boric acid, borax pentahydrate, or also magnesium hydroxide. Aluminum hydroxide used alone do not lead to mold growth, but when used in combination with ammonium polyphosphate it increases the growth. Some mold growth was found on the surface of the tested glass wools, but it was assumed that this was due to moist debris on the surface and that the glass wool only acted as a support matrix...|$|R

The effects of treatment by commercial conditioner/shampoo or by aqueous exposure have been investigated. The cuticular structure has been imaged at medium resolution; longitudinal striations with lateral spacings of 150 - 350 nm and vertical corrugations in the range 2 - 8 nm were observed at higher resolution. The features {{are similar to those}} observed for <b>untreated</b> <b>wool</b> fibre. Both adventitious debris/contamination and residues from cosmetic treatment can be imaged with resolution in the low-nanometre range. Removal of the cuticular surface layer from treatment with alkali solution, and subsequent imaging, revealed a fibrous substructure. F-d analysis of the surface is a rich source of spatially resolved mechanical and chemical information. Surface stiffness, and an equivalent Young's Modulus, E, can be inferred from the shape of the 'approach' tip-to-surface contact curve. A value of E of 蠱 0 MPa was obtained for untreated hair. During aqueous exposure for 1 h the stiffness and modulus decreased by approximately a factor of 10. The discontinuity seen at 'lift-off' during the retract half-cycle of F-d analysis represents a measure of tip-to-surface adhesion. Adhesion decreased during aqueous exposure and was below the level of detectability after 1 h. Likewise, treatment by conditioner had the effect of lowering adhesion.

40|$|This {{work has}} used two lightboxes with Philips 500 W MBTF lamps for a {{comparative}} trial on the photoyellowing evaluation of <b>untreated</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics under dry and wet conditions.

40|$|Atmospheric-pressure plasma {{treatment}} of wool fabric produced {{a significantly higher}} level of adsorbed fiber-reactive dye when applied at 50 °C (pH 3. 0 – 6. 0) {{in the absence of}} any organic leveling agent. In addition, color yields indicated that dye was more uniformly adsorbed by the plasma-treated fabric compared with the untreated material. When untreated fabric was dyed in the presence of a leveling agent (Albegal B), the extent and levelness of dye sorption were enhanced. These enhancements were, however, relatively small on the plasma-treated wool compared with those on <b>untreated</b> <b>wool.</b> A ‘surface’ mechanism, similar to that proposed when plasma-treated wool is dyed in the absence of leveling agent, can explain the leveling ability of Albegal B under adsorption conditions. Increasing the dyebath temperature to 90 °C resulted in dye penetration of the fibers. Under these conditions, any enhancements of dye uptake produced by the {{plasma treatment}}, as well as the use of Albegal B, were relatively small, in contrast to the behavior at 50 °C. Improvements in the uniformity of dye sorption observed at 50 °C were, however, maintained at the higher temperature. It is concluded that the inability of reactive dyes to migrate (and so promote leveling and uniformity) once they have reacted with the fiber, means that differences in the uniformity of dye sorbed at 50 °C are still apparent at equilibrium. <br /...|$|E
40|$|It is {{the aim of}} this theses to {{investigate}} the possibility to bleach wool with several enzymes during the raw wool scouring process. Special emphasis lies on the bleaching of canary yellow wool and the investigation of the enzyme's influence on the morphology of the woolfibre. The bleaching of wool with horseradish-peroxidases and hydrogenperoxide showed that the achieved whitening was only due to the latter one. The enzymatic treatment with different Subtilisin-proteases () showed, that a whitening effect can be achieved, which is mainly due to the incubation time of the enzyme does not depend very much on the enzyme concentration. SEM pictures show that the incubation of wool fibres with SP 655 - even with long incubation times - has only little effect on the single fibre whereas the SEM pictures of woolfibres incubated with the other two proteases show some fibres where the whole fibre compound is badly damaged. Despite of this the separation pattern of the extractable woolproteins show no significant change of enzyme treated or <b>untreated</b> <b>wool</b> samples. The investigation of woolfibre-crosssections of samples treated with proteases by TEM show a successive degradation of the cuticle, endocuticle, the cell-membrane-complex and the cortex.

The {{effects of the}} type of buffer, the pH value, the contact time and the initial concentration of Co 2 + on the sorption behaviour of wool powders were studied. The Co 2 + releasing ability of wool powders and the re-use of wool powders to sorb Co 2 + were also examined. The optimum sorption of Co 2 + by the powders occurred at pH 8 in phosphate buffer and pH 10 in ammonium sulphate buffer. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to study the changes in chemical structure of the wool after exposure to both buffer solutions.

40|$|The chlorine-Hercosett {{process has}} been {{dominant}} in the wool shrink-proofing industry for more than 30 years. Hypochlorite breaks the hydrophobic nature of wool surface; Hercosett (cationic polyamide epichlorhydrin resin) covers wool and prevents wool from shrinking. From today's modem point of view, however, the chlorineHercosett process shows a number of drawbacks which make the search for an ecologically clean alternative worthwhile: poor handle, yellowing of wool, difficulties in dyeing and most importantly today, environmental impact (rdlease of absorbable organic halogens- AOX to the effluents). As a result, many researches {{have been carried out}} for Non-AOX rapid oxidation of wool. Potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS), hydrogen peroxide and some per acids have been concerned as possible alternatives, but only little commercial successes. It was well known that Hercosett will not deposit on the PMS or hydrogen peroxide treated wool. The key difference. in terms of polymer compatibility between chlorinated and PMS, hydrogen peroxide treated wool is the surface energy (wettability). Surface energy has influence on the spreading properties of Hercosett and wool/polymer interfacial adhesion. Resent researches have shown that this difference is associated with the removal of a fatty acid (lipid), namely IS-methyleicosanoic acid (IS-MEA), which is thought to be chemically bound to the surface of wool fibre by a thio-ester linkage. In common words, chlorination can remove this fatty acid but PMS and hydrogen peroxide treatments can not. The wool shrink-proofing research in this thesis is f<?cused on wool delipidisation. Total delipidisation (97 % of the IS-MEA was removed) is achieved by a cationic surfactant/nucleophile process. During the treatement, hydrophobic complexes between the cationic surfactant and nucleophile are formed which can diffuse into the wool lipid shell. The nucleophile will attack the eletrophilic thio-ester linkage of the wool lipid and liberate the free lipid as its carboxylate salt into water. The wool top after delipidisation, oxidative sulphitolysis and Hercosett 125 treatment shows some significant shrink resist properties when compared to the <b>untreated</b> <b>wool</b> fibre. The same wool top was spun, knitted and wash tested using the standard TM 31 wash test procedure. Such wool fabric has passed 3 x 5 A wash cycles. It was also worth mentioning that the same wool fabric has soft handle and bright shade when compared to the chlorine-Hercosett treated wool. Wool bleaching and photo-yellowing are also important subjects in wool research. The proportion of wool which is bleached is approximately IO% of the total world production. The photo-yellowing effect of ~unlighton bleached wool is greater than on <b>untreated</b> <b>wool.</b> The relationship ofwool bleaching and wool photo-yellowing is studied. FTIR studies shows that there are more wool disulphide bonds cleaved during the reduction bleaching than the oxidation bleaching. The photo-yellowing effect of sunlight on the reductive bleached wool is greater than on the oxidative bleached wool. The reduction in wool cystine residue content is a key effect in preventing photo-yellowing in bleached wool. The decomposition reaction of urea to isocyanic acid and the subsequent reaction of isocyanic acid with nucleophiles such as the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose are studied. The properties of the modified. carbamoylated cellulose have been investigated including the ease of bleaching it when tea stained and its dyeing properties with reactive dyes. The reaction of wool nucleophiles with isocyanic acid derived from sodium cyanate was studied. The properties of the modified wool were investigated.

40|$|Treated and <b>untreated</b> <b>wool</b> fibers are {{analyzed}} by methodologies based on atomic force microscopy. Untreated fibers {{are known to}} have an intact native surface lipid layer, while KOH treatment has the effect of removing this layer as well as disrupting the molecular substructure. The effective bulk Young's modulus of the untreated fibers is measured in air and in situ during exposure to water. There is a nearly instantaneous drop by a factor of two from approximately 1. 2 GPa after onset of aqueous exposure. The surface stiffness of both untreated and KOH treated fibers is measured in situ during aqueous exposure for durations up to 12 × 103 seconds. A decrease by a factor of two is observed for the untreated surface, while there is a more rapid decrease by a factor of ten for the KOH treated surface. Measurements of an equivalent Young's modulus for the near-surface layers obtained by transverse compression of less than 200 nm by the tip result in values of less than 1 MPa. Because wool is an inhomogeneous and anisotropic medium, the outcomes of the two different measurements of the modulus are complementary but not comparable. Tip-to-surface adhesion is also monitored during aqueous exposure, with the KOH treated surface exhibiting the lower value by a factor of approximately ten. There are also trends showing lower adhesion with duration of exposure. Rapid ingress of water into the bulk appears to be associated with decreased bulk stiffness, but has little immediate effect on surface and near-surface properties. The decrements in surface stiffness and observed effects on adhesion from aqueous exposure are then due to a much slower radial ingress of water, which is additionally rate-limited by the native lipid layer...|$|E
40|$|All human space {{missions}} require significant logistical {{mass and}} volume {{that will become}} an excessive burden for long duration missions beyond low Earth orbit. The current International Space Station (ISS) crew wardrobe has already evolved not only to reduce some of the logistical burden but also to address crew preference. The present study was undertaken to find ways further to reduce this logistical burden while examining human response to different types of clothes. The primary objective {{of the study is}} to measure how long people can wear the same exercise garment, {{depending on the type of}} fabric and the presence of antimicrobial treatment. The secondary objective is to assess the reasons for length of wear from perceptions of clothing characteristics, including nine ordinal scales. Cardiovascular exercise was chosen as the activity in this experiment for its profuse sweating effect and because it is considered a more severe treatment applied to the clothes than every-day usage. Study garments were exercise T-shirts and shorts purchased from various vendors. Fabric construction, fabric composition, and finishing treatment were defined as the key variables. A web-based questionnaire was used for self-reported data collection. The study was divided in three balanced experiments: a cotton-polyester-wool (CPW) T-shirts study with 61 participants, a polyester-modacrylic-polyester/cocona (PMC) T-shirts study with 40 participants, and a shorts study with 70 participants. In the CPW study, the T-shirts were made of 100 % cotton, or of 100 % polyester or of 100 % wool, and categorized into open and tight knit constructions. In the PMC study, the T-shirts were made of 100 % polyester, or of 82 % modacrylic, or of 95 % polyester with 5 % cocona fiber, without construction distinction. The shorts were made either of 100 % cotton or of 100 % polyester, and were knitted or woven. Some garments were treated with Bio-Protect 500 antimicrobial finish according the experimental design. The data collected from the questionnaire included garment identification, level of exertion, duration of exercise session, number of exercise sessions, an ordinal preference scale for nine sensory elements, and reason for retiring a used garment. From the analysis of the combined CPW and PMC shirt studies, there are statistically significant differences among the mean lifetimes of various types of shirts. The exercise shirts with the longest mean lifetimes are <b>untreated</b> <b>wool</b> (600 minutes), treated cotton (526 minutes), and untreated modacrylic (515 minutes). From the combined CPW and PMC shirt studies, the most preferred material was untreated open-knit wool, which is one of the two materials that jointly were worn the longest, <b>untreated</b> <b>wool,</b> both open-knit and tight-knit. For the CP shorts study, there were no statistically significant differences in mean lifetimes of the exercise shorts at the 5 % significance level due to the treatment combinations. There was therefore no justification to examine differences among levels of main effects or interactions. The preference for shorts was in this order: untreated woven polyester, untreated knitted polyester, untreated woven cotton, and treated knitted cotton. The nine preference scales were tabulated to determine the preference responses at the end of those exercise periods which were prior to the period when a garment was retired and a new garment was started. The assumption is that an unfavorable assessment of a garment leads to its retirement. The scent scale response was predominantly unfavorable at the end of the exercise period immediately prior to the exercise period when a new garment was started. Additional work on wool clothing is needed to assess if this material can be part of a crew wardrobe for long duration missions. The results of this study informed the choice of fabrics for an upcoming ISS intra-vehicular clothing study...|$|E
