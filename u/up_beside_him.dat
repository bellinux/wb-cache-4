500|$|On race day, {{the track}} was fast, {{and the weather}} was warm and sunny. Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham rushed <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> The two ran the first quarter in a quick :23 and the next quarter in a swift :22, {{completing}} the fastest opening half mile {{in the history of}} the race and opening ten lengths on the rest of the field. After the six-furlong mark, Sham began to tire, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued the fast pace and opened up a larger and larger margin on the field. His time for the mile was 1:34, over a second faster than the next fastest Belmont mile fraction in history, set by his sire Bold Ruler, who had eventually tired and finished third. Secretariat, however, did not falter. Turcotte said, [...] "This horse really paced himself. He is smart: I think he knew he was going [...] miles, I never pushed him." [...] In the stretch, Secretariat opened a lead of almost [...] of a mile on the rest of the field. At the finish, he won by 31 lengths, breaking the margin-of-victory record set by Triple Crown winner Count Fleet in 1943 of 25 lengths.|$|E
2500|$|This {{news was}} {{followed}} by more reported sightings, until in August 1877 {{one of the most}} notable reports about Spring-heeled Jack came from a group of soldiers in Aldershot's barracks. This story went as follows: a sentry on duty at the North Camp peered into the darkness, his attention attracted by a peculiar figure [...] "advancing towards him." [...] The soldier issued a challenge, which went unheeded, and the figure came <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> and delivered several slaps to his face. A guard shot at him, with no visible effect; some sources claim that the soldier may have fired blanks at him, others that he missed or fired warning shots. The strange figure then disappeared into the surrounding darkness [...] "with astonishing bounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{longtime}} Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's {{murder of}} Paul McGonagle's brother {{led directly to}} the Mullin Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks,"One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy pulled <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, {{the only one who}} wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was at the stove cooking, 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy looked up from the stove and said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would have gotten lung cancer. How do you want your pork chops?'" ...|$|E
60|$|Stephen walked <b>up</b> {{and stood}} <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> without speaking. Two men {{at this moment}} crept out from among {{the wheels of the}} waiting train.|$|R
60|$|Bill's shapeless hulk {{straightened}} <b>up</b> {{and stood}} <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> {{as if his}} pink flesh had suddenly turned to oak. Out of his fat cheeks his gray eyes glared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Plainly {{said and}} bravely spoken, my {{suckling}} friar," [...] roared a deep voice, {{and a heavy}} hand fell upon Alleyne's shoulder. Looking <b>up,</b> he saw <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> his former cloister companion the renegade monk, Hordle John.|$|R
60|$|She seized {{his hand}} and smiled at him when he drew her <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Abdool {{was sitting}} {{immediately}} below Harry, {{and the latter}} called to him to come <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Anderson made a slight, {{significant}} {{motion to}} the cowboys. They lined <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> and, like him, they looked dangerous.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, thank you, thank you,' {{cried the}} jackal; 'do not let us lose a moment.' And {{he held out}} his paw in such an {{inviting}} manner that the sheep got <b>up</b> and trotted <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> till they reached home.|$|R
60|$|Leland {{contrived}} {{to drive}} {{two of the}} loaded train, though his head was aching and he felt very dizzy. When at last {{he was about to}} turn off into a second sledge-track, the Sergeant pulled <b>up</b> his horse <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I see it, for instance?" [...] His {{mother got}} <b>up,</b> and sat <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "You do, every day. The sky is beautiful, the stars, and moonlit nights, {{and then the}} birds, the flowers, the trees--they're all beautiful. Look out of the window--there's beauty for you, Jon." ...|$|R
60|$|She stood <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> shook herself, {{and tried}} to get a breath of air. She was dazzled blind by the sunshine.|$|E
60|$|He had no {{more than}} opened the window when an exclamation burst from his lips, and without delay I clambered <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|And John {{found himself}} without much {{volition}} lifted and helped into the carriage, where Cecil Evelyn scrambled <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> {{and put an}} arm round him.|$|E
60|$|Then he saw she {{was still}} safe on the sloping shelf. Carefully and painfully she drew herself to her knees and, dinging to the rope, crept up the rock hand over hand. When she came within his reach he grasped her arms and lifted her <b>up</b> into safety <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Giles Jackman was {{the first}} who rose. Treading water and {{brushing}} the hair out of his eyes, he gazed wildly about. Barret came <b>up</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> almost a moment later. He had barely taken breath, when the others rose at various distances. A cry not far from him caused him to turn. It was poor Robin Tips, struggling for life. A few powerful strokes carried Barret alongside. He got behind the boy, caught him under the armpits, and thus held him, at arm's length, until he could quiet him.|$|R
60|$|George {{was working}} in the summer fallow a few days after his return from Grant's homestead, when a man rode across the plowing and pulled <b>up</b> his horse <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> He was on the whole a {{handsome}} fellow, well mounted and smartly dressed, but there was a hint of hardness in his expression. George recognized him as the landlord of a hotel at the settlement.|$|R
6000|$|... "By God! not I," [...] and a brawny Kentish man-at-arms ranged <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> {{his cloak}} thrown {{over his left}} arm, and his sword in his right hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "How do {{you like}} that, Cousin Jerry?" [...] said a voice right in his ear. Paddy the Beaver had climbed <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> {{and his eyes were}} twinkling.|$|E
60|$|As Carthoris {{leaped to}} the rostrum he drew Thuvia <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> {{and then he}} turned upon the departing jeddak with an angry {{challenge}} and a sword thrust.|$|E
50|$|Rufio is {{the leader}} of the Lost Boys and Peter's {{successor}} who was hand-chosen by him when he chose to leave Neverland for good. Although initially refusing to believe that Peter Banning is Pan grown <b>up,</b> Rufio fights <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> in the final battle against Hook's pirates but is slain by Hook. He dies in Peter's arms after admitting that his one wish was to have a father like Peter. He was played by Dante Basco.|$|R
6000|$|Slackbridge jumped <b>up</b> {{and stood}} <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> gnashing and tearing. 'Oh, my friends, what {{but this did}} I tell you? Oh, my fellow- countrymen, what warning but this did I give you? And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws {{are known to have}} fallen heavy? Oh, you Englishmen, I ask you how does this {{subornation}} show in one of yourselves, who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours, and to your children's and your children's children's?' ...|$|R
50|$|On June 21, 1914, Ralphs {{was with}} his family for a weekend trip to the San Bernardino Mountains. While taking a walk {{with his wife in}} Waterman's Canyon, Ralphs stopped to rest on top of a boulder. As he {{attempted}} to help his wife <b>up</b> to sit <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> the boulder became dislodged and began rolling down the mountain side along with Ralphs. In the process, one of his legs got caught and was severely injured. He was taken to Ramona Hospital (now known as Community Hospital of San Bernardino) where he underwent surgery to have his injured leg amputated. Ralphs awoke from the surgery and spoke to his wife for a few minutes, but died of shock later that afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|As Carl {{turned to}} face the tent door again the manager ranged <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> trying to conceal the black-jack in his hand, and casually murmuring, [...] "Scared, Hawk?" ...|$|E
60|$|He waited breathless and rigid, expecting {{every moment}} {{to see a}} form loom <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> in the darkness. It was useless to run. His only chance was to stay {{perfectly}} quiet.|$|E
60|$|Mark made no {{move toward}} leaving the platform, from which {{he could have a}} full view of the harbor, and, seeing that he was not {{disposed}} to act upon her suggestion, Susan clambered <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} that this mound {{happened}} to be so close, for a dark cloud which had been overspreading the sky for some time began to send down snow-flakes, and frequent gusts of wind gave indications of an approaching storm. Having placed Gartok in such a position that he was quite sheltered from the wind, Cheenbuk took off his upper seal-skin coat, {{laid it on the}} snow, and lifted the injured man on to it. He then wrapped it round him and folded the hood under his head for a pillow, bidding the boy bank <b>up</b> the snow <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> {{in such a way as}} to increase the shelter. While thus engaged he saw with some anxiety that Gartok had become deadly pale, and his compressed lips gave the impression that he was suffering much.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better answer it, I suppose." [...] He {{went across}} to the writing-table. With the usual perversity of bedroom stationery, there were innumerable {{envelopes}} and no paper. He rang. No one came. Tommy fumed at the delay. Then he remembered {{that there was a}} good supply in Julius's sitting-room. The American had announced his immediate departure, there would be no fear of running <b>up</b> against <b>him.</b> <b>Besides,</b> he wouldn't mind if he did. He was beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said. Old Julius had taken them jolly well. He'd apologize if he found him there.|$|R
60|$|Lingard {{watched the}} shore astern. The woman shook {{her hand at}} him, and then squatted {{at the feet of}} the man who stood motionless. After a while she got <b>up</b> and stood <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> {{reaching}} <b>up</b> to his head--and Lingard saw then that she had wetted some part of her covering and was trying to wash the dried blood off the man's immovable face, which did not seem to know anything about it. Lingard turned away and threw himself back in his chair, stretching his legs out with a sigh of fatigue. His head fell forward; and under his red face the white beard lay fan-like on his breast, the ends of fine long hairs all astir in the faint draught made by the rapid motion of the craft that carried him away from his prisoner--from the only thing in his life he wished to hide.|$|R
60|$|As soon as Tom had {{followed}} these instructions, Ned handed {{him up the}} bows and arrows and spears, and then clambered <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> As the fire again burned low, an animal was seen to approach, cautiously.|$|E
6000|$|I stood <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> {{and looked}} out. I {{was a little}} flushed, my ears a little reddened, by the {{inconvenience}} of my curiosities, and by my uneasy sense of profound moral differences. He was taller than I. [...] .|$|E
60|$|When {{her eyes}} fluttered open, Dick nodded Graham <b>up</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> At first bewilderment {{was all she}} betrayed, then her eyes focused first on Dick's face, then on Graham's, and, with recognition, her lips parted in a pitiful smile.|$|E
60|$|That {{night he}} slept like a top, and woke with his knee of almost normal size. He again {{spent the morning}} in his chair on the grass patch, {{scribbling}} down verses; but in the afternoon he wandered about with the two little boys Nick and Rick. It was Saturday, so they were early home from school; quick, shy, dark little rascals of seven and six, soon talkative, for Ashurst had a way with children. By four o'clock they had shown him all their methods of destroying life, except the tickling of trout; and with breeches tucked up, lay on their stomachs over the trout stream, pretending they had this accomplishment also. They tickled nothing, of course, for their giggling and shouting scared every spotted thing away. Ashurst, on a rock {{at the edge of}} the beech clump, watched them, and listened to the cuckoos, till Nick, the elder and less persevering, came <b>up</b> and stood <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sven Nys of Belgium {{was the big}} {{favourite}} {{before the}} race, having dominated the races of the month leading <b>up</b> to it. <b>Beside</b> <b>him</b> were Lars van der Haar of Netherlands, winner of the World Cup, and Belgian Tom Meeusen, {{the only one to}} somewhat keep equal footing to Nys as well as winner of the last World Cup race (where Nys did not participate). Outsiders were Francis Mourey of France as well as other Belgians: Niels Albert, winner in Hoogerheide in the 2009 World Championship, Kevin Pauwels, always good on fast and dry tracks, and Klaas Vantornout, silver medal the year before in Louisville. The big unknown factor was Czech Republic's Zdeněk Štybar. Touted by Nys as being his main opponent, the World Champion of 2010 and 2011 had only taken part in six races during the season and was only taking part in the World Championship as an aside in his preparation for the road season. Due to his bad place in the UCI ranking, Štybar was only placed on the fourth start row.|$|R
6000|$|At {{first the}} stout Eskimo meditated {{an attempt to}} escape. Indeed he made one {{vigorous}} effort when they were leading him through the bush with his hands tied behind him. Just as {{they came to the}} place where the canoes were lying, the thought of home, and of his probable fate as a prisoner, pressed so heavily on him that he suddenly became furious, tripped <b>up</b> the man <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> with his foot, kicked over the one behind him with his heel, ran his head like a battering-ram {{into the back of the}} man in front of him, and then strove to burst his bonds with a succession of mighty wriggles, but, not being quite equal to Samson, he failed, and on seeing that two savages stood over him with drawn scalping-knives, while Magadar put the muzzle of a gun to his head, he deemed it wise to give in and uttered the exclamation [...] "hoi!" [...] with the air of one who feels that his game is played out. He marched forward after that in submissive silence.|$|R
