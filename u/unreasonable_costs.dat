This research has narrowed the lunar base sites to the polar regions as these sites offer the highest scientific value. The overarching problem is how to supply continuous power to lunar bases located at the poles. This study focuses on the feasibility and architectural analysis of wireless power transfer to lunar polar outposts. Two wireless power transfer methods, microwave and laser, were integrated into satellite constellations and the overall system architecture. The two architectures were modeled, analyzed, and evaluated to determine which method is more feasible. The results showed that while both the use of microwave and laser transmission were feasible, the microwave approach produced large transmitter and receiver antenna sizes driving <b>unreasonable</b> <b>cost.</b> The laser transmission approach showed less end-to-end efficiency and therefore higher per satellite cost but resulted in a lower total system cost and was the more feasible architecture.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforcement}} is {{the process}} of introduction of fibers of different origins into binding system to enhance strength, stress-strain behavior of products and structures. Maximal effect of reinforcing process is possible when optimal parameters (length and consumption of fibre) are determined. Moreover one need to consider particle-size composition and hardening process of binding system. In this paper the critical length of natural and sinthesized fibres as well as minimally required content in cellular systems is calculated with the mathematical apparatus of structural topology. As an example the foam concrete based on cement-free nanostructured binder with basalt fibre and microreinforcing constructional polymeric fibre is studied. Fiber diameter, refined with microstructure analysis, accomplished by SEM-microscopy and experimentally determined packing density in loose and compact state are applied as input parameters. Measurement of the fibre topological characteristics with acceptable is accomplished according to material porosity and pore size. So the minimal effective fibre length taking into account homogeneous distribution in bulk of composite matrix is less of 1 mm; minimal fibre consumption is 0, 2 – 0, 5 (by wt. %).

This is directly reflected as an economically <b>unreasonable</b> <b>cost</b> and a low overall reliability. Within the research reported in this thesis it is shown how the problem of complexity {{in the design of}} robotic hands can be tackled, taking advantage of modern technologies (i. e. rapid prototyping), leading to innovative concepts for the design of the mechanical structure, the actuation and sensory systems. The solutions adopted drastically reduce the prototyping and production costs and increase the reliability, reducing the number of parts required and averaging their single reliability factors. In order to get guidelines for the design process, the problem of robotic grasp and manipulation by a dual arm/hand system has been reviewed. In this way, the requirements that should be fulfilled at hardware level to guarantee successful execution of the task has been highlighted. The contribution of this research from the manipulation planning side focuses on the redundancy resolution that arise in the execution of the task in a dexterous arm/hand system.

However, due diligence may also refer to actions aimed at ensuring that neither the pa-tient nor the healthcare payer is re-quired to incur <b>unreasonable</b> <b>costs</b> {{in the process}} of treatment. The validity of that statement stems not only from normative acts but also from ethical standards laid down in the Medical Code of Ethics (Article 57 section 2). It often happens that the provision of optimal treatment calls for deviations from the formal provisions included in Summary Product Characteristics (SPCs), and the application of drugs that are bioequivalent to reference drugs, which translates into a significant reduction of costs. The present study addresses the problem of acceptabili-ty of a specific form of drug substitu-tion consisting in the replacement of a reference drug with a generic drug.

40|$|States are reticent {{to support}} the idea that they have human rights {{obligations}} to people other than their own. However decades of United Nations consideration and human rights standard-setting in the area of international cooperation have advanced interpretations of the obligation whereby economic and other policies should be designed {{in such a way as}} to avoid causing injury to the interests of developing States and to the rights of their people, and, moreover, should actively seek to address existing deprivations. This latter obligation to fulfil socio-economic rights elsewhere gives rise to a host of important legal issues that provide the focus for this article. Should we understand the obligations to be those of individual States or can we speak of collective legal obligations in this area? Is the extraterritorial obligation to fulfil socio-economic rights limited to the transfer of financial resources, and if not what else might it entail? Are they best framed as secondary obligations triggered only if the rights-holder’s own State is unable or unwilling to fulfil them or as simultaneous obligations? If, as per the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its monitoring Committee we recognise capacity as a basis to assist, how might the obligations among all those States with capacity be divided?

40|$|Optimization {{of costs}} is {{important}} for increasing competitiveness and profitability of the enterprise, therefore, {{the purpose of the}} study is to establish and visualize the basis of cost optimization on the example of hotel-restaurant complex enterprises. The essence of cost optimization is investigated through the analysis of the views of various scholars for this purpose. It is established that cost optimization is the process of planning, accounting, analysis, cost control for searching and selecting of the most effective methods of managing of the conditions of limited resources. The author has developed the sequence of cost optimization on the example of enterprises of the hotel-restaurant complex, which helps to structure the process of cost management. In this sequence, there are areas where costs can be reduced, and the technical and economic conditions under which they can be changed. In addition, it is noted that such implementation is important in the cost management at the enterprise. It is also proposed to optimize costs using the simplex method to carry out a quantitative assessment of the quality of services by the qualimetric method. It is noted that it is necessary to form alternative ways of using resources for rational use of scarce resources. The article proposes cost grouping by the XYZ-analysis with individual approaches to cost management, namely, target costing, the theory of constrains, lean manufacturing. For this purpose, the author develops the table that should be filled in to compare which costs and ways can be reduced or replaced. Besides, the author has added recommendations for filling in the table and commented that with this analysis a transaction and <b>unreasonable</b> <b>costs</b> can be controlled. Thus, with such a sequence of actions, redistribution of funds is possible to optimize costs and save money, which can be directed to enterprise development.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the limitations of the}} application of traditional information privacy theory to disputes relating to modern technologies. If information privacy is understood as an individual’s right to full control over his information, activities involving the collection, process and use of personal data cannot be conducted without the data subject’s consent because his privacy rights would be affected as a result of such activities. Instead of the privacy interest approach, this article introduces a privacy harm approach to reconcile the defects of traditional privacy theory. The privacy interest approach helps identify situations in which an individual’s information privacy conflicts with the free flow of information, and the privacy harm approach comes into play to precisely evaluate and determine the reasonable extent of protection of the respective interest. This article applies this privacy-harm-oriented approach to Taiwan Taipei High Administrative Court Judgment, Tsai v. NHIA, to examine that the modified information privacy theory is helpful to resolve the information privacy dispute at issue. This article elaborates the reasons why imposing a universal rule that the data controller must obtain the data subject’s consent before using his health data is of no real help in protecting health privacy and is detrimental to medical research. This notion can be supported by the following concepts: 1. shifting the liability of privacy protection to the data subject will increase the risk of privacy invasion; 2. in the multi-faceted privacy interest concept, granting decision-making rights to an individual cannot guarantee privacy protection; 3. it will add <b>unreasonable</b> <b>costs</b> to medical research. By applying the privacy harm approach, this article further analyzes the importance of considering the likelihood of privacy harm regarding health information. In this approach, because identifiable health information and identified health information are subject to different likelihoods of privacy harm, different degrees of privacy protection and privacy rules should apply to them in their respective contexts...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author gives an {{overview}} of the emergence and evolution of the idea of discharge or modification of contract due to supervening events, from Roman to contemporary law, with special emphasis on the evolution of the doctrine and its development as a legal institution in the European legislation or case law. The institution of changed circumstances (supervening events) allows the discharge or (judicial) modification of a contract in a situation when the performance of an obligation has not become impossible, but it would require <b>unreasonable</b> <b>costs</b> or the performance would be inexpedient, hence it {{is considered one of the}} most striking exceptions to the principle of pacta sunt servanda. It belongs to the group of a very few institutions in relation to which one cannot claim to have direct and clear roots in Roman law. In the works of learned lawyers one may find only sporadic traces of it. In contrast to Roman legal science, Roman philosophy was more favourable to the theory of supervening events, a fact very well proven by the works of Cicero and Seneca. In the late Middle Ages the canonists and, especially, postglossators gave the greatest contribution to the evolution of the theory of supervening events. The school of postglossators considered supervening events a general legal institution, tacitly implied in every legal statement constituting obligation. The ideas of postglossators left a great impact on further evolution of the theory. Even the designation of the institution, clausula rebus sic stantibus, generally accepted in contemporary literature, derives from them. In the period following the postglossators' time, lasting until the end of the 18 th century, there is still an interest in the theory of supervening events in literature. However, under the influence of the school of natural law a somewhat restrictive approach is adopted, in the German doctrine in the first place, according to which the clausula rebus sic stantibus should not be implied in all contracts, but applied exceptionally, if specific conditions are met. The first European civil codes, the Bavarian, Prussian and Austrian, do regulate the effect of supervening events explicitly, in content which is, in general, in line with these theoretical standpoints. It seems that in the 19 th century legal science nearly abandoned the idea of supervening events, which could be considered as a consequence of the inviolable primacy of the tenet of pacta sunt servanda, at the time. In line with that, the most important civil codes of this era, such as the French, German and Swiss did not govern the effect of supervening events as a general legal institution. The institution of supervening events is gradually accepted in the case law after the First World War, while the period after the Second World War is heralded by the tendency of its statutory regulation. The ever-growing number of states that regulated supervening events as a general legal institution of contract law included the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, too, as well as the Republic of Serbia and the other states that were once members of the common, South Slavic federal state...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{provision}} of transverse openings in floor beams {{to facilitate the}} passage of utility pipes and service ducts results not only in a more systematic layout of pipes and ducts, it also translates into substantial economic savings {{in the construction of}} a multi-storey building. To investigate the problem of openings in beams, the author initiated a research program in the early 1980 s. Since then extensive research has been carried out giving a comprehensive coverage on both circular and large rectangular openings under various combinations of bending, shear and torsion. In this paper, major findings relevant to the analysis and design of such beams under the most commonly encountered loading case of bending and shear are extracted and summarized. An attempt has been made to answer the frequently asked questions related to creating an opening in an already constructed beam and how to deal with multiple openings. It has been shown that the design method for beams with large openings can be further simplified without sacrificing rationality and having <b>unreasonable</b> additional <b>cost...</b>|$|R

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a body of research methodologies to evaluate overall efficiencies and identify the sources and estimate the amounts of inefficiencies in inputs and outputs. In DEA, the best performers are called DEA efficient and the efficiency score of a DEA efficient unit is denoted by a unity. It is possible to prevent wasting resources and <b>unreasonable</b> increase of <b>costs</b> by measuring efficiency of various sections of the economy, especially servicing and nonprofit units. This research attempts to measure and compare technical efficiency value of 17 municipalities of Markazi province (Iran) in urban Water and Wastewater Company (WWC) by using DEA. Data for 2006 were used to estimate efficiency scores. The results indicated less than 30 % of municipalities were fully technically efficient that could be referred as inefficient units. Capital input and water losses were the major source of the inefficiency. Thus, the policy makers should focus on rebuilding the infrastructure of the water networks, beginning with the most DEA inefficient municipalities in order to minimize water losses and maximize efficiency of capital input...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze {{possibilities}} and specifics of management of information systems in non-governmental organizations and to demonstrate it on the case study. The general analysis of information systems in non-profit sector is focused on influence of specifics of this sector on information systems management and on comparison how type of sector is affecting development and operation of information systems. As a case study Diakonie ČCE was chosen. Diakonie ČCE consists of large number of non-governmental organizations. It is relatively complicated structure which characteristic {{is very close to}} a holding company. Thesis pays an increased attention to the description of this structure. Case study consists of an information strategy design for the target organization. For this design and the development modern methodic and tools of development an information strategy were used. Strategy works with the real global strategy of researched organization and it is completed with specification of the concrete projects which are implementing strategy. Range of strategy is affected by limited financial sources of Diakonie ČCE for its creation. This is why elements which would <b>cost</b> <b>unreasonable</b> expenses for the researched organization were omitted...|$|R
