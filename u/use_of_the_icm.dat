We examine the processes that generate the entropy in order to understand why previous analytic shock heating models failed. We find that: (1) The energy that is thermalised in the collision greatly exceeds the kinetic energy available when the systems first touch. The smaller system penetrates deep into the potential well before it is disrupted. (2) For unequal mass mergers, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy is thermalised in the more massive component. <b>The</b> heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final system.

The first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock wave is generated that propagates outwards from the centre. This causes the combined system to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. The second episode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. This revised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physical understanding of cosmological gas simulations. Comment: 30 pages, 26 figures. MNRAS, accepted.

40|$|<b>The</b> high {{metallicity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intra-cluster medium (<b>ICM)</b> {{is generally}} interpreted on <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galactic wind scenario for elliptical galaxies. In this framework, we develop a toy-model to follow <b>the</b> chemical evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICM,</b> formulated in analogy to chemical models for individual galaxies. The model computes the galaxy formation history (GFH) of cluster galaxies, connecting the final luminosity function (LF) to the corresponding metal enrichment history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICM.</b> <b>The</b> observed LF can be reproduced with a smooth, Madau-plot like GFH peaking at z~ 1 - 2, plus a "burst" of formation of dwarf galaxies at high redshift. The model {{is used to}} test <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predicted metal content and abundance evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICM</b> to varying input galactic models. The chemical enrichment is computed from "galactic yields" based on models of elliptical galaxies with a variable initial mass function (IMF), favouring <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> massive stars at high redshift and/or in more massive galaxies. For a given final galactic luminosity, these model ellipticals eject into <b>the</b> <b>ICM</b> a larger quantity of gas and of metals than do standard models based on the Salpeter IMF.
