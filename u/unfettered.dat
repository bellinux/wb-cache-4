5|$|Market Forces is a science-fiction thriller set nearly {{fifty years}} after its writing {{featuring}} a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story's satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices.

5|$|The Cooper {{hijacking}} {{marked the}} beginning of the end for <b>unfettered</b> and unscrutinized airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal sky marshal program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were for the specific purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits charging that such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.|$|E
5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually <b>unfettered.</b> We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or <b>unfettered</b> discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer, containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on <b>unfettered</b> movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or <b>unfettered</b> discretion was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E

5|$|The {{journey to}} the Eastern Mediterranean was inevitably long and eventful. Travelling overland, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, drowned in the Saleph River, and few of his men reached the Eastern Mediterranean. Travelling by sea, Richard the Lionheart, King of England conquered Cyprus in 1191 in {{response}} to his sister and fiancée, who were travelling separately, being taken captive by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos. Philip II of France was the first king to arrive at the siege of Acre; Richard arrived on 8June 1191. The arrival of the French and Angevin forces turned the tide in the conflict, and the Muslim garrison of Acre finally surrendered on 12July. Philip considered his vow fulfilled and returned to France to deal with domestic matters, leaving most of his forces behind. But Richard travelled south along the Mediterranean coast, defeated the Muslims near Arsuf, and recaptured the port city of Jaffa. He twice advanced to within a day's march of Jerusalem before judging that he lacked the resources to successfully capture the city, or defend it in the unlikely event of a successful assault, while Saladin had a mustered army. This marked the end of Richard's crusading career and was a calamitous blow to Frankish morale. A three-year truce was negotiated that allowed Catholics <b>unfettered</b> access to Jerusalem. Politics in England and illness forced Richard's departure, never to return, and Saladin died in March 1193. Emperor HenryVI initiated the German Crusade to fulfil the promises made by his father, Frederick, to undertake a Crusade to the Holy Land. Led by Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, the army captured the cities of Sidon and Beirut. However, in 1197 Henry died and most of the Crusaders returned to Germany to protect their holdings and take part in the election of his successor as Emperor.|$|E

30|$|First, {{religious}} reform {{would be}} {{of particular interest to}} a student of the history of religion, independent or comparative. When reforms within religion are studied as a process interior to a distinct religious ecosystem, it avails a religio-centric lens for challenges and ramifications within a religious society. Furthermore, the study can be conducted without the need to import the value benchmarks from another parallel system. It was not that colonial discourse was not completely oblivious to the concept of ‘religious reform’ as we argue here, but the benchmarks of reform were limited to the western religious import of <b>unfettering</b> from idolatry and polytheism. These major themes of Hinduism that are anathematic to the Christian worldview constricted the colonial notion of religious reform. It explains the making of Rammohan Roy as an unparalleled religious reformer of that era 3 whose voice echoed like none other in the Unitarian literature in Britain and the United States. Thus, for the Bishop of Calcutta, Reginald Heber, Sahajanand Swami was a ‘mass reformer’ who was yet clinched in Hindu polytheism and thus, he was very distant from the truth (Williams 1984, 85).|$|R

Why, Furman asks at the outset, had France known four revolutions since the 18th century, and some 15 constitutions, and the United States just one of each? Bourgeois society in America, he argued, had from the beginning combined exceptional dynamism with extreme stability: a combination that could not be understood apart from the peculiar salience of Protestantism in its formation. America included both the <b>unfettering</b> of a drive for knowledge and a biblical respect for the immutability of the constitution. Though officially church and state were separated, the reigning ideology of the nation mingled religious rituals and symbols with secular forms and themes in a promiscuous potpourri whose very lack of clear divisions or borders was permissive of continual economic and social change.|$|R
