Nonetheless, the direct in vivo use of information pertaining to trabecular {{bone structure}} necessitates some predictive analytical model linking structure measures to mechanical properties. In this context, {{the purpose of this}} study was to combine BV/TV and topological parameters so as to better estimate the mechanical properties of trabecular bone. Thirteen trabecular bone mid-sagittal sections were imaged by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at the resolution of 117 x 117 x 300 microm(3). Topological parameters were evaluated in applying the 3 D-line skeleton graph analysis (LSGA) technique to the binary MR images. The same images were used to estimate the elastic moduli! by finite element analysis (FEA). In addition to the mid-sagittal section, two cylindrical samples were cored from each vertebra along vertical and horizontal directions. Monotonic compression tests were applied to these samples to measure both vertical and horizontal <b>ultimate</b> <b>stresses.</b> BV/TV was found as a strong predictor of the mechanical properties, accounting for 89 - 94 % of the variability of the elastic moduli and for 69 - 86 % of the variability of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>stresses.</b> Topological parameters and BV/TV were combined following two analytical formulations, based on: (1) the normalization of the topological parameters; and on (2) an exponential fit-model.

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{favorable for}} the development of uniform bond stress in a short anchorage length of a reinforcing bar in a pull-out test are rarely present in practical reinforced concrete (RC) members. The determination of a representative average <b>ultimate</b> bond <b>stress</b> for use when designing the anchorage of tensile bars in RC flexural members is complicated by fluctuating bond stress conditions arising from the presence of cracks crossing the anchorage length. This research is aimed at assessing typical bond failures at the anchorages of tensile bars in RC beams and slabs, and hence determining the representative value of average <b>ultimate</b> bond <b>stress</b> for designing the anchorages. An experimental study was conducted to assess the impacts of monotonically increasing loads on the anchorage requirements of small diameter deformed bars in tension, including the cases of end development and lapped splices. The study revealed that the value of the average <b>ultimate</b> bond <b>stress</b> that develops at failure in an anchorage is not only heavily dependent on the bar diameter, but is also dependent on the anchorage length. The measured value of average <b>ultimate</b> bond <b>stress</b> for shorter anchorage lengths is higher than that for longer anchorage lengths. Analytical modelling based on the structural mechanics of bond has been undertaken to reasonably represent the variable degree of plasticity in the concrete around an anchored bar, and to calculate a more reliable estimate of the average <b>ultimate</b> bond <b>stress.</b> The practical implications of the mean local bond stress-slip models for modelling longer anchorages have been assessed, and the bond-slip models have been recalibrated to account for the variations of average <b>ultimate</b> bond <b>stress</b> for different anchorage lengths and bar diameters. The recalibration of the bond-slip laws for selected RC anchorage specimens has been undertaken according to a viable analytical modelling procedure, and a modified model of the peak bond stress has been proposed for the splitting type bond failures typically observed in RC flexural members. Finite element modelling of the RC anchorage specimens has been undertaken using the recalibrated bond-slip laws and the numerical results are in good agreement with the laboratory measurements. The analytical and numerical modelling provides for rational simulations of the strength and failure modes of anchorages of tensile bars in RC flexural members...|$|R
