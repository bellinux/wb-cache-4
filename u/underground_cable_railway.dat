Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street <b>Cable</b> <b>Railway,</b> which operated from 1886 to 1898. The most extensive cable system in the US was in Chicago between 1882 and 1906.|$|R

40|$|By {{the rapid}} of urban growth, it is {{impossible}} to accommodate the number and size of feeder required for distribution using the overhead line system approach. As an alternative the <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> becomes more increasingly necessary to replace some of the overhead line for power transmission and distribution. Because of that reason, <b>underground</b> XLPE <b>cables</b> are the most popular for the underground systems. Performance of <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> in service is being critical because of ageing mechanisms influences. There are many suitable techniques can be used to evaluate performance of aged and unaged <b>underground</b> <b>cables.</b> One of the techniques is based on tan delta and capacitance parameters of <b>underground</b> <b>cables.</b> This study only focuses on <b>underground</b> XLPE <b>cables,</b> which are voltage rated atl lkV and 22 kV for 1 -core and 3 -cores types. By using Tettex Instruments — Schering Bridge Model 2816, tan delta and capacitance data of XLPE <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> are obtained. Tan delta and capacitance measurements were performed at ambient temperature (26. 6 °C) and at power frequency (50 Hz). From these analyses, show that tan delta values will be increased proportional with aging time of cables in service. Aging mechanisms are contributes these deteriorations of cables in service and consequently values of tan delta are increased with aging time of cable. Meanwhile, form capacitance analysis, the values of capacitance will be increased when contaminants, protrusions and voids are affected cables insulation and when moisture enters inside <b>underground</b> <b>cable</b> systems...|$|R

In order to accommodate intermediate levels, turnouts were used to allow wagons to leave and join the <b>cable</b> <b>railway</b> part way along its length.

40|$|Transmission network {{development}} plans {{have led to}} protests throughout Germany. Many studies present <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> {{as a means to}} increase public agreement to transmission line construction. This paper investigates this thesis reporting results of a Contingent Valuation study conducted in late 2012 in four regions of Germany, which are affected by transmission line development in different ways. In an analysis of 1. 003 household responses a majority of households favours <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> (about 60 %). Willingness-to-pay, however, relativizes this result. Almost 50 % of households voting for <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> are not willing to accept an increase in electricity prices to finance cable projects (free riders). The fact that positive willingness-to-pay does not correlate positively with increasing lengths of <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> in 60 % of cases underlines that cables are not supported unconditionally. All-in-all, the thesis that cables increase acceptance of grid development has to be rejected based on the WTP-evaluation presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focus on}} the problem of {{locating}} single-phase faults in mixed distribution electric systems, with overhead lines and <b>underground</b> <b>cables,</b> using voltage and current measurements at the sending-end and sequence model of the network.
