40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} {{and environmentally}} friendly alternative fuel derived from natural fats or vegetable oils {{and it is}} considered as an attractive alternative to replace diesel fuels. To optimize the application of biodiesel on vehicle diesel engines, the power and fuel economies performances of a diesel fueled with soybean biodiesel were investigated under different engine loads and speeds. Experimental results show that, compared with diesel fuel, with increase in the biodiesel in the blends, the brake power and torque and the brake specific energy consumption increase, the smoke density <b>under</b> <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> decreases except B 10, the NOX emissions increase. The trade-off relationship is clear between the NOX and smoke density when the diesel engine fueled with different biodiesel percentage in the blends. From the trade-off relationship between NOX and smoke density, the optimum blend ratio is B 20 in the experimental study...|$|E

The main aim of the preliminary engine test was to use of the crankshaft <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> method for detection of diesel knock phenomenon. For this research, each combustion chamber was equipped with AVL cooled pressure sensor mounted {{at the top of}} engine head. Using of such sensors and special prepared at Technical University of Radom data acquisition system allow to record time histories of in-cylinder pressure variations at conditions of <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the engine crankshaft. Results presented in this paper show, that such transient engine conditions can be successfully used for detection of diesel knock phenomenon. High frequency pressure oscillations, typical for knocking were observed in {{the first phase of the}} acceleration process for selected combustion chambers. Experimental tests have been done for engine fuelled with regular diesel oil (DF) and its blend with Ethyl Tert Butyl Ether (ETBE) used as an oxygenated additive. Engine test procedure, used methodology and data acquisition system and engine test results carried out in non-stationary conditions with using of crankshaft acceleration method are presented in the paper...|$|R

50|$|While the use {{of atoms}} offers easy access to higher {{frequencies}} (and thus accuracies) than light, atoms are affected much more strongly by gravity. In some apparatuses, the atoms are ejected upwards and the interferometry takes place while the atoms are in flight, or while falling in free flight. In other experiments gravitational effects by <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> are not negated; additional forces are used to compensate for gravity. While these guided systems in principle can provide arbitrary amounts of measurement time, their quantum coherence is still under discussion.

The results indicate that exact dual control based on specification of the source <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> and blocked force is strictly valid only if phase is taken into account. However, extremal dual control without phase alleviates overtesting without risk of undertesting, when the limit acceleration and force specifications are chosen to envelope the coupled system results. Several approaches to deriving appropriate force specifications are explored. Random vibration parametric results from the literature are used to estimate the limit force between coupled oscillators with different source and load masses...|$|R
