5|$|In July 2016, the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan {{announced}} the South Circular would {{become part of}} the London <b>Ultra-Low</b> Emission Zone boundary in 2020, meaning a daily charge of £12.50 for cars/vans/motorcycles and £100 for coaches/HGVs/buses, would need to be paid by vehicles not meeting key exhaust emission standards. The boundary had originally been proposed by Johnson the previous year, but covering a narrower area.|$|E
5|$|Starting in June 2006, {{petroleum}} refiners {{were required}} by the EPA to begin producing <b>ultra-low</b> sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel, which has 97% less sulfur than the previous low sulfur diesel fuel. When fuel containing sulfur is burned, sulfur dioxide is produced, a main component of acid rain. ULSD, together with new air pollution control technologies required in trucks (starting with model year 2007), will reduce harmful emissions by 90%.|$|E
5|$|The UX52VS has {{the option}} of Intel's <b>ultra-low</b> voltage i5 or i7 mobile processors, up to 10GB of RAM and an optical disc drive. The latter is a first for the Zenbook product series. It drew {{criticism}} for its high price and lack of touch screen, but the screen quality, keyboard and system speed were praised. The battery life was considered acceptable {{taking into account the}} form-factor and the discrete GPU, despite it being significantly shorter than the UX31A.|$|E
5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook Touch series has touch screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook Touch series includes the UX31A which is the same as the Zenbook Prime, but with a touch enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A with a touch enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ is thicker than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the <b>ultra-low</b> voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically pushing it out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the touch screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E
25|$|American Honda {{has also}} {{been active in the}} {{deployment}} of low-emissions vehicles in the U.S., including the first gasoline-powered vehicles to meet California's Low-Emission Vehicle (LEV), <b>Ultra-Low</b> Emission Vehicle (ULEV), and Super <b>Ultra-Low</b> Emission Vehicle (SULEV) exhaust emissions requirements.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014 and December 2015, the {{government}} extended {{the program with}} modifications. Eligible <b>ultra-low</b> emission vehicles (ULEVs) included hydrogen fuel cell cars.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Arm renewed a five-year, $5 million {{research}} {{partnership with}} University of Michigan, which extended their existing research partnership to 2015. This partnership {{will focus on}} <b>ultra-low</b> energy and sustainable computing.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel {{contains}} {{virtually no}} sulfur, {{and it is}} often used as an additive to <b>Ultra-Low</b> Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel to aid with lubrication, as the sulfur compounds in petrodiesel provide much of the lubricity.|$|E
25|$|The air {{entering}} a cleanroom from outside is filtered to exclude dust, {{and the air}} inside is constantly recirculated through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and/or <b>ultra-low</b> particulate air (ULPA) filters to remove internally generated contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Today TSMC {{has five}} {{versions}} of 28nm:HP (high performance),HPM (high performance mobile),HPC (high performance computing),HPL (high performance low power), andLP (low power).Two additional processes were added:HPC+ {{which is an}} even faster version of HP andULP which is <b>ultra-low</b> power for IoT and other battery powered applications.|$|E
25|$|The European Union is also {{active in}} the areas of energy research, {{development}} and promotion, via initiatives such as CEPHEUS (<b>ultra-low</b> energy housing), and programs under the umbrella titles of SAVE (energy saving) ALTENER (new and renewable energy sources), STEER (transport) and COOPENER (developing countries). Through Fusion for Energy, the EU is participating in the ITER project.|$|E
25|$|A Bose–Einstein {{condensate}} (BEC) is a {{state of}} matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent. A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air, to <b>ultra-low</b> temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The Conroe-L and Merom-L {{processors}} {{are based}} {{around the same}} core as Conroe and Merom, but only contain a single core and 1 MB of L2 cache, significantly reducing production cost and power consumption of the processor {{at the expense of}} performance compared to the dual-core version. It is used only in <b>ultra-low</b> voltage Core 2 Solo U2xxx and in Celeron processors and is identified as CPUID family 6 model 22.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ultra-low</b> sulfur {{kerosene}} is a custom-blended fuel {{used by the}} New York City Transit Authority {{to power}} its bus fleet. The transit agency started using this fuel in 2004, prior to the widespread adoption of ultra-low-sulfur diesel, which has since become the standard. In 2008, the suppliers of the custom fuel failed to tender for a renewal of the transit agency's contract, leading to a negotiated contract at a significantly increased cost.|$|E
25|$|At present, {{the primary}} method of {{controlling}} desert locust infestations is with insecticides applied in small concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers at <b>ultra-low</b> volume (ULV) rates of application. The insecticide is {{acquired by the}} insect directly or via secondary pickup (i.e. walking over or eating the residue on a plant). Control is undertaken by government agencies in locust-affected countries or by specialized {{organizations such as the}} Desert Locust Control Organization for East Africa (DLCO-EA).|$|E
25|$|Anti-fouling is {{the process}} of {{preventing}} accumulations from forming. In industrial processes, bio-dispersants can be used to control biofouling. In less controlled environments, organisms are killed or repelled with coatings using biocides, thermal treatments, or pulses of energy. Nontoxic mechanical strategies that prevent organisms from attaching include choosing a material or coating with a slippery surface, creation of an <b>ultra-low</b> fouling surface with the use of zwitterions, or creation of nanoscale surface topologies similar to the skin of sharks and dolphins which only offer poor anchor points.|$|E
25|$|The Tanpopo {{mission is}} an orbital {{astrobiology}} experiment by Japan {{that is currently}} investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo module of the International Space Station. The mission will collect cosmic dusts and other particles for three years by using an <b>ultra-low</b> density silica gel called aerogel. The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis {{and the possibility of}} natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors. Some of these aerogels will be replaced every one or two years through 2018. Sample collection began in May 2015, and the first samples will be returned to Earth in mid-2016.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel is {{made from}} animal fats or {{vegetable}} oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (<b>ultra-low</b> sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.|$|E
25|$|At the 25th ISCTRC (International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis Research and Control) in Mombasa, Kenya, in October 1999, {{the idea}} of an African-wide {{initiative}} to control tsetse and trypanosomiasis populations was discussed. During the 36th summit of the Organization for African Unity in Lome, Togo, in July 2000, a resolution was passed to form the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). The campaign works to eradicate the tsetse vector population levels and subsequently the protozoan disease, by use of insecticide-impregnated targets, fly traps, insecticide-treated cattle, <b>ultra-low</b> dose aerial/ground spraying (SAT) of tsetse resting sites and the sterile insect technique (SIT). The use of SIT in Zanzibar proved effective in eliminating the entire population of tsetse flies but was expensive and is relatively impractical to use in many of the endemic countries afflicted with African trypanosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|As in Egypt and {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, {{radiocarbon}} dates run one or two centuries earlier than the dates proposed by archaeologists. It {{is not at all}} clear which group is right, if either. Mechanisms have been proposed for explaining why radiocarbon dates in the region might be skewed. Equally logical arguments have been made suggesting that the archaeological dates are too late. Time will tell. The spread of accelerator based carbon dating techniques may help clear up the issue. Another promising front is the dating of lime plaster from structures. Recently, radiocarbon dates from the final destruction of Ebla have been shown to definitely favour the middle chronology (with the fall of Babylon and Aleppo at c. 1595 BCE), and do not seem to fall with the <b>ultra-low</b> chronology (same event at c. 1499 BCE), although it is emphasized that this is not to be seen as a decisive argument.|$|E
25|$|Reducing water {{consumption}} and protecting water quality are key objectives in sustainable building. One critical issue of {{water consumption}} {{is that in}} many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout {{the life of a}} building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as <b>ultra-low</b> flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. Point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.|$|E
500|$|In the UK the Plug-in Car Grant scheme {{provided}} a 25% incentive towards {{the cost of}} new plug-in electric cars that qualify as <b>ultra-low</b> carbon vehicles, capped at [...] (...) until February 2016. Both private and business fleet buyers are eligible for the government grant. In December 2015, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that Plug-in car grant was extended to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy cleaner vehicles. The criteria for the Plug-in Car Grant was updated and the maximum grant dropped from [...] (~) to [...] (~).

500|$|In 1965 the Kubricks bought Abbots Mead on Barnet Lane, {{just south}} of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex in England. Kubrick worked almost {{exclusively}} from this home for 14 years where, with some exceptions, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed <b>ultra-low</b> light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films. In 1978, Kubrick moved into Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, a mainly 18th century stately home, which was once owned by a wealthy racehorse owner, about [...] north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. His new home became a workplace for Kubrick and his wife, [...] "a perfect family factory" [...] as Christiane called it, and Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror {{began in}} 1979, {{starting}} with a blank manufactured by Corning from their <b>ultra-low</b> expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each one inch (25.4mm) thick, sandwiching a honeycomb lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force. This ensured that the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984. The mirror was completed {{by the end of}} 1981; it was washed using 2,400 gallons (9,100 L) of hot, deionized water and then received a reflective coating of [...] 65nm-thick aluminum and a protective coating of 25nm-thick magnesium fluoride.|$|E
