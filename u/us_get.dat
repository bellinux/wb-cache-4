5|$|After {{the release}} of Don't Bore <b>Us,</b> <b>Get</b> to the Chorus!, a {{greatest}} hits record, the duo took a hiatus from the mid-1990s before returning with the albums Have a Nice Day (1999) and Room Service (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards {{until the beginning of}} the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again {{for the first time in}} 8 years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour. In 2011, they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years. This was followed by Travelling a year later.|$|E

Let <b>us</b> <b>get</b> a little stronger in it and we shall once more continue on our quest. That {{is why we have}} invited Gordon Craig. After wandering about in search of new ways, we shall again return to realism for more strength. I do not doubt that every abstraction on the stage, such as impressionism, for instance, could be attained by way of a more refined and deeper realism. All other ways are false and dead.|$|E
500|$|After his Eurovision experience, Dustin {{returned}} to Ireland where {{he launched a}} campaign against the Lisbon Treaty in the European Union, calling for a 'No' vote by the Irish on the referendum for the amendment of the Irish constitution to allow {{the adoption of the}} treaty. Dustin's campaign included the slogan [...] "They didn't vote for <b>us.</b> <b>Get</b> them back. Vote 'No' to Lisbon", referring to his failure at Eurovision.|$|E

500|$|In October 1995, Roxette {{released}} {{their first}} greatest hits compilation, Don't Bore <b>Us,</b> <b>Get</b> to the Chorus! This {{reached the top}} 5 in many European countries including the UK, {{as well as the}} top 10 in Australia. It featured four new songs, three were released as singles, including the ballad [...] "You Don't Understand Me," [...] co-written by Desmond Child. Also that year, a compilation of demos, B-sides and remixes, alongside some of the 1993 MTV Unplugged material, was released in Japan and parts of South America under the title Rarities.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Fredriksson {{released}} a greatest hits compilation called Äntligen (At Last), which {{went on to}} be a big seller in Sweden, peaking at No.1 for three weeks. Meanwhile, Roxette signed a US distribution deal with Edel Music, which re-released Don't Bore <b>Us,</b> <b>Get</b> to the Chorus! In doing so, it replaced some non-US hits with songs from Have a Nice Day. To promote the release the duo did a small tour of America, performing at the Boston Mixfest and at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square. The single [...] "Wish I Could Fly" [...] included in the album reached No.27 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and No.40 on the Adult Top 40 tally.|$|E

500|$|Also {{writing in}} The Atlantic, {{a year after}} Carr, the {{futurist}} Jamais Cascio argued that human cognition has always evolved to meet environmental challenges, and that those posed by the internet are no different. He described the 'skimming' referred to by Carr {{as a form of}} attention deficit caused by the immaturity of filter algorithms: [...] "The trouble isn’t that we have too much information at our fingertips, but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy... many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help <b>us</b> <b>get</b> some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn’t the problem; it’s the beginning of a solution." [...] Cascio and Carr's articles have been discussed together in several places. Pew Research used them to form a tension-pair question survey that was distributed to noted academics. Most responded in detail; concurring with the proposition [...] "Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid". In The Googlisation of Everything, Vaidhyanathan tended to side with Carr. However, he thought both arguments relied too much on determinism: Carr in thinking that an over-reliance on internet tools will inevitably cause the brain to atrophy, and Cascio in thinking that getting smarter is the necessary outcome of the evolutionary pressures he describes. In From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg Naughton noted that, while many agreed Carr had hit on an important subject, his conclusions were not widely supported.|$|E
500|$|While Allied leaders {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings}} on Patton's capabilities, the German High Command was noted {{to have more}} respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943. Adolf Hitler reportedly called him [...] "that crazy cowboy general". Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war, {{and many of its}} highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. Erwin Rommel credited Patton with executing [...] "the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare". Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, {{chief of staff of the}} German Army, stated that Patton [...] "was the American Guderian. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes." [...] Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring noted that [...] "Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with Generalfeldmarschall Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare." [...] Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein, Fritz Bayerlein opined that [...] "I do not think that General Patton would let <b>us</b> <b>get</b> away so easily." [...] In an interview conducted for Stars and Stripes just after his capture, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt stated simply of Patton, [...] "He is your best." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the 2009 All Star Game, Marquis (a former Cardinal) {{received}} {{one of the}} biggest ovations during pregame introductions of any non-Cardinal player, and then warmed up in the ninth inning but never did enter the game.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the animators was to create {{movement}} that mimicked the soft fluidity of the hand-drawn art found in older Disney animated films. Keane credited Disney 3D animator Kyle Strawitz with helping to combine CGI with the traditional hand-drawn style. [...] "He took the house from Snow White and built it and painted it so {{it looked like a}} flat painting that suddenly started to move, and it had dimension and kept all of the soft, round curves of the brushstrokes of watercolor.

2500|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the domestic resource base would not be sufficient to meet the Italy’s growing energy demand, Mattei recognized the need to secure foreign supplies. Driven by his ambition to make ENI a player on par with the Exxons and Totals of the world, Mattei expanded abroad and {{turned his attention to the}} international oil markets. He invented (or at least, used to tell very often) the story of the little cat: [...] "A little cat arrives where a few big dogs are eating in a pot. The dogs attack him and toss him away. We Italians are like that little cat: in that pot there is oil for everybody, but someone does not want to let <b>us</b> <b>get</b> close to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 2004 a US subsidy {{has been}} paid to {{companies}} that blend biofuel and regular fuel. [...] The European biofuel subsidy is paid at the point of sale. [...] Companies import biofuel to the US, blend 1% or even 0.1% regular fuel, and then ship the blended fuel to Europe, where it can get a second subsidy. [...] These blends are called B99 or B99.9 fuel. [...] The practice is called [...] "splash and dash". [...] The imported fuel may even come from Europe to the <b>US,</b> <b>get</b> 0.1% regular fuel, and then go back to Europe. For B99.9 fuel the US blender gets a subsidy of $0.999 per gallon. The European biodiesel producers have urged the EU to impose punitive duties on these subsidized imports. [...] In 2007, US lawmakers were also looking at closing this loophole.|$|E

2500|$|After another five-year layoff, Zevon {{signed with}} {{industry}} veteran Danny Goldberg's Artemis Records and again rebounded with the mortality-themed 2000 release Life'll Kill Ya, containing the hymn-like [...] "Don't Let <b>Us</b> <b>Get</b> Sick" [...] and an austere version of Steve Winwood's 1980s hit [...] "Back in the High Life Again". With record sale brisk and music critics giving Zevon his best notices since Excitable Boy, Life'll Kill Ya {{is seen as}} his second comeback. He followed with the album My Ride's Here (2002), with its morbid prescience of things to come; the album included [...] "Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)" [...] (co-written by Mitch Albom, the author of Tuesdays with Morrie, and featuring Paul Shaffer, the Late Night band, and a spoken vocal from TV host David Letterman) and the ballad [...] "Genius" [...] (later used {{as the title of}} an anthology of Zevon's recordings, in 2002), with a string section that attests to the lasting influence of Stravinsky on Zevon's work.|$|E
2500|$|Van Morrison {{included}} Tench {{in a new}} band lineup as {{the lead}} guitarist and a vocalist, in March 1978 to record the Wavelength album. Tench was recommended to Morrison by drummer Peter Van Hooke, after Hooke had seen him perform with Streetwalkers. In an interview with Johnny Rogan Tench stated: [...] "I quite liked the songs [...] "Natalia" [...] and [...] "Wavelength" [...] because I {{had a lot to}} do with them. They came together quickly. He's a very quick worker and once it's there he doesn't see why you can't record it. He let <b>us</b> <b>get</b> on with it, really. It was a good band". He was credited with production assistance, guitar, and backing vocals on this album, which became Morrison's best selling album at that time. He also contributed lead guitar and vocals to the promotional Wavelength tour which followed. The tour started in Santa Clara, California on 30 September 1978 and ended on 1 March 1979 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. By the end of the tour he had appeared in Morrison's lineup sixty two times.|$|E
2500|$|A July 2015 {{campaign}} press release, issued {{one month}} after Trump announced his presidential run, said that the FEC filing [...] "was not designed {{for a man of}} Mr. Trump's massive wealth" [...] and that his [...] "net worth is in excess of [...] ". However, Trump has testified that [...] "my net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings—even my own feelings." [...] On the same day, Trump's own stated estimates of his net worth have varied by as much as $3.3 billion. Trump has also acknowledged that past exaggerated estimates of his wealth have been [...] "good for financing". Forbes has said that although Trump [...] "shares a lot of information with us that helps <b>us</b> <b>get</b> to the figures we publish," [...] he [...] "consistently pushes for a higher net worth—especially {{when it comes to the}} value of his personal brand." [...] Forbes reduced its estimate of Trump's net worth by $125million following Trump's controversial 2015 remarks about Mexican illegal immigrants, which ended Trump's business contracts with NBCUniversal, Univision, Macy's, Serta, PVH Corporation, and Perfumania. An internal Young & Rubicam study of Trump's brand among high-income consumers showed [...] "plummeting" [...] ratings for traits such as [...] "prestigious", [...] "upper class", and [...] "glamorous" [...] at the end of 2015, suggesting that Trump's various businesses could face market difficulties and financing challenges in the future.|$|E
