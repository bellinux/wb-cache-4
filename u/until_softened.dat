50|$|The {{fruits of}} the Callery pear are small (less than one cm in diameter), and hard, almost woody, <b>until</b> <b>softened</b> by frost, after which they are readily taken by birds, which {{disperse}} the seeds in their droppings. In summer, the foliage is dark green and very smooth, and in autumn the leaves commonly turn brilliant colours, ranging from yellow and orange to more commonly red, pink, purple, and bronze. Sometimes, several of these autumn colours may be present on an individual leaf. However, since the colour often develops very late in autumn, the leaves may be killed by a hard frost before full colour can develop.|$|E

The vegetarian version is referred to as maigre ("lean"). When ham or bacon is added, it is called gras ("fat," [...] i.e., containing meat). Frequently the vegetables serve as a bed on which to cook meat, poultry, and fish dishes; or as a stuffing; but sometimes the Matignon is served as separate side dish in its own right.|$|E

40|$|Along {{with sugar}} {{accumulation}} and colour development, softening {{is an important}} physiological change during the onset of ripening in fruits. In this work, we investigated the relationships among major events during softening in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) by quantifying elasticity in individual berries. In addition, we delayed softening and inhibited sugar accumulation using a mechanical growth-preventing treatment {{in order to identify}} processes that are sugar and/or growth dependent. Ripening processes commenced on various days after anthesis, but always at similarly low elasticity and turgor. Much of the softening occurred in the absence of other changes in berry physiology investigated here. Several genes encoding key cell wall-modifying enzymes were not up-regulated <b>until</b> <b>softening</b> was largely completed, suggesting softening may result primarily from decreases in turgor. Similarly, there was no decrease in solute potential, increase in sugar concentration, or colour development until elasticity and turgor were near minimum values, and these processes were inhibited when berry growth was prevented. Increases in abscisic acid occurred early during softening {{and in the absence of}} significant expression of the V. vinifera 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases. However, these increases were coincident with decreases in the abscisic acid catabolite diphasic acid, indicating that initial increases in abscisic acid may result from decreases in catabolism and/or exogenous import. These data suggest that softening, decreases in turgor, and increases in abscisic acid represent some of the earliest events during the onset of ripening. Later, physical growth, further increases in abscisic acid, and the accumulation of sugar are integral for colour development. © 2015 The Author 2015.

40|$|Nd:YAG laser {{debonding}} occurs by thermal softening, thermal ablation or thermally induced photoablation. In thermal softening, {{the bonding}} agent is heated <b>until</b> it <b>softens.</b> Thermal ablation {{occurs when the}} laser energy is high enough to raise {{the temperature of the}} resin, whereas photoablation occurs when the high laser energy interacts with the resin material. [17] Porcelain laminate veneers (PLVs) are frequently used in restorative dentistry because of their esthetic properties. [18] These restorations are a safe and an effective treatment modality for teeth with poor esthetics. However, they have limited longevity because luting resin cements are sensitive to discoloration, wear, microleakage and marginal fractures, which adversely affect the esthetic results. Microleakage has been more frequently encountered with an exposed dentine during the preparation for PLVs. [19] In addition, microleakage was associated with the presence of caries, discoloration or a gingiva...|$|R

There were many variations of ātōle: a mixture of 1/10 maguey syrup made nequātōle; adding chili ground with salt and tomato would make iztac ātōle; letting maize dough sour for 4-5 days and then adding more fresh dough with chili and salt would make xocoātōle. Beans, baked corn tortillas with the crust cut off, toasted maize, chia, amaranth and honey could also be added and there was pinolli, ground toasted maize that was carried by travelers in sacks which could be mixed with water on the road for an instant meal.|$|R

40|$|Closed-form {{solutions}} for the plastic response of a symmetric double-lap joint are presented. The adherents are assumed to behave linear elastically in pure tension, whereas the adhesive {{is assumed to be}} in a state of pure shear. The shear stress-strain behavior of the adhesive is approximated by a bilinear curve, and both hardening plasticity approximating ductile adhesive behavior, and softening plasticity approximating brittle adhesive behavior, are considered. The main emphasis is given to the softening behavior, as it includes some particularly intriguing features of joint behavior, e. g., limited ductility, limited bearing capacity, and the occurrence of local failure in the adhesive. For softening plasticity, two fundamentally different behaviors are identified depending on the joint parameters: one in which no local failure will occur before the bearing capacity of the joint has been completely exhausted, and another where local failure will begin at the boundary of the joint and spread <b>until</b> the <b>softening</b> zone has reached the center of the joint. In the subsequent response, the failed region will remain constant in size. Shakedown considerations are also included...|$|R

5000|$|Gum {{should not}} be used less than 15 minutes after eating or {{drinking}} as doing so will reduce absorption.

Dosage suggested by the Dental-professional.com website is: weeks 1-6: 1 piece every 1 to 2 hours; weeks 7-9: 1 piece every 2 to 4 hours; weeks 10-12: 1 piece every 4-8 hours; no more than 24 pieces per day.
