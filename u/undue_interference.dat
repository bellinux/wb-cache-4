5|$|The {{first serious}} {{allegation}} against Pleydell in the Star Chamber concerned the forced expulsion of an occupant of the manor house at East Grafton, Somerset in late 1553. He {{was accused of}} assisting John Berwick in the original infringement and composing an amenable jury in Marlborough to avoid conviction. Both were found innocent of breaching the peace and claimed to have acted at the reasonable request of their employer, Anne Seymour; <b>undue</b> <b>interference</b> with judicial proceedings was ruled out. Around the same time, Pleydell was sued for forcible entry and illegal seizure of property at Little Bedwyn (with similar offences at Collingbourne Ducis) but claimed to be acting on {{the failure of the}} plaintiff to punctually pay rent.|$|E

The {{relations}} between the two were not good and Oxenstierna always attributed the exiguousness of Sweden's gains under the Peace of Westphalia − Sweden gained only Pomerania, Usedom, Wollin, Wismar and Bremen-Verden − following the conference in Osnabrück to Christina's <b>undue</b> <b>interference.</b> When the queen, a few years later, wanted to abdicate, Oxenstierna at first opposed this because he feared mischief to Sweden from the unruly and adventurous disposition of her preferred successor, Charles X Gustav. The chancellor changed his mind about Charles Gustav, however, and gave Christina the help she needed to go through with her abdication. Oxenstierna died a couple of months after the ascension of the new king.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzed}} {{the contribution of}} the Ghana Schools Feeding Programme to basic school participation in selected schools in the Kwaebibirim District of Ghana. A total of 94 respondents were involved in the study. Both simple random and purposive sampling techniques were applied in the selection of respondents. Secondary data was also obtained through the review of documents and reports on the subject. The study found out that the policy interventions have contributed to enrolment, attendance and retention in public primary schools. It has improved school attendance by at least 1 percent and at most 15 percent in the schools studied. It is however worth noting that the programme is bedevilled with challenges such as inadequate funds and delays in it release, reduction in contact hours with pupils and students, and <b>undue</b> <b>interferences</b> in the appointment of caterers...|$|R

Cohn-Bendit also said that he [...] "did not care about Klaus' opinions on the Lisbon Treaty, that Klaus would simply have to sign it". Cohn-Bendit also told the Czechs not to interfere with passage of the EU's climate change package. This meeting was negatively commented in the Czech Republic as an <b>undue</b> <b>interference</b> in Czech affairs.

2500|$|The {{plurality}} opinion {{stated that it}} was upholding what it called the [...] "essential holding" [...] of Roe.

The plurality asserted that the fundamental right to abortion is grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the plurality reiterated what the Court had said in Eisenstadt v. Baird: [...] "f the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{letter to}} Mr. Towers {{was written in}} quite a {{different}} strain. Mr. Slope conceived that he completely understood the difference in character and position {{of the two men}} whom he addressed. He knew that for such a man as Sir Nicholas Fitzwhiggin a little flummery was necessary, and that it might be of the easy, everyday description. Accordingly his letter to Sir Nicholas was written, currente calamo, with very little trouble. But to such a man as Mr. Towers it was not so easy to write a letter that should be effective and yet not offensive, that should carry its point without <b>undue</b> <b>interference.</b> It was not difficult to flatter Dr. Proudie or Sir Nicholas Fitzwhiggin, but very difficult to flatter Mr. Towers without letting the flattery declare itself. This, however, had to be done. Moreover, this letter must, in appearance at least, be written without effort, and be fluent, unconstrained, and demonstrative of no doubt or fear {{on the part of the}} writer. Therefore the epistle to Mr. Towers was studied, and re-copied, and elaborated at the cost of so many minutes that Mr. Slope had hardly time to dress himself and reach Dr. Stanhope's that evening.|$|E

40|$|The inter-relationship between risk, {{poverty and}} {{agriculture}} in development economics has gained increased attention. Agriculture {{in which the}} poor predominantly operate is a fragile and risk-prone sector. The risks range from the large (aggregate) ones to the small (idisyncratic). Aggregate risks such as droughts,cyclones,floods, and market fluctuations tend to affect the whole community simultaneously, while idisyncratic risks affect a particular household or individual such as with respect to illness, death, and disability. The contribution of Agricultural cooperatives as instruments of development has been widely acknowledged. This study highlights the role of agricultural cooperatives in tackling both risks and poverty in the Malaysian agriculture sector. It was found that with 5. 685 million members, share capital amounting to RM 6. 849 billion and total assets worth RM 34. 868 billion the Malaysian agricultural cooperatives were well placed to manage poverty related risks afflicting local paddy farmers, fishermen and smallholders through their diverse functions in credit/finance, plantation, housing, consumer, transport and services. Nevertheless, in conclusion, to better harness their strength these cooperatives must be less dependent on government funding to gain better freedom from <b>undue</b> <b>interferences...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{empirical}} assessment {{of service delivery}} in Nigerian Local Government system using Idah Local Government Area of Kogi State {{as a case study}} from 2003 - 2010. Structured questionnaire made up of open and close ended questions; personal observation and interview were used to collect primary data. The secondary data were collected through textbooks, journals, newspapers, government and internet publications. Analysis of data was through descriptive statistics of pie charts, tables and simple percentages. The study revealed that Idah Local Government has averagely performed in service delivery. In spite of this, the study discovered that some of the factors affecting the discharge of service delivery in Idah Local Government in terms timeliness, satisfaction, adequacy and effectiveness are insufficient funds; irregular payment of salaries and allowances; <b>undue</b> political <b>interference</b> and divided loyalty; poor observance of the principle of meritocracy in recruitment and promotion of staff and corruption. It was recommended among others that employment and promotion should be based on ability, high performance, experience, qualification and not patronage; intensification of the campaign against corruption at the local government level by bringing to book all corrupt public officials; regular payment of salaries and allowances and increase funding backed up by prudent management.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} Commisa v. PEP {{in which}} the District Court for the Southern District of New York recognized a Mexican award, despite its annulment at the seat, {{on the grounds that}} the annulment was "repugnatnt to fundamental notions of what is decent and just in the United States" and violated the "basic notions of justice" to which the United States subscribe. The reason for this finding was that the annulment was based on a statute that retroactively rendered the underlying dispute unarbitrable. The District Court's decision is an important development in the jurisprudence that rejects the proposition that awards annulled at the seat cannot be recognized. In the United States the enforceability of such awards was first upheld nearly two decades ago in Chromalloy and continued to be held possible by later cases, albeit subject to strict conditions which were not considered to be satisfied. By holding that Chromalloy "remains alive" and refusing to defer to a foreign annulment that flouted recognized principles of international arbitration, Commisa is evidence of the emergence of a more modern and arbitration-friendly approach to the treatment of annulled awards. The article discusses the broader implications of Commisa in the light of the debate on Article V(1) (e) of the New York Convention and on the treatment of foreign annulment judgements and advocates a more pro-arbitration stance aimed at preventing <b>undue</b> <b>interferences</b> by the courts of the seat from extending extraterritoriality...|$|R

This paper attempts to fill this gap. Drawing on fieldwork in Ghana, it argues that, from the perspective of district assemblies, five major challenges inhibit planning, namely: an inflexible land ownership system, an unresponsive legislative framework, <b>undue</b> political <b>interference,</b> an acute human resource shortage, and the lack of a sustainable funding strategy.
