5|$|Noting Daniels' {{admiration of}} the work of John Waters and Pedro Almodóvar and the joking {{attitude}} he and the actors sometimes took towards their material while making the movie, Jim Emerson argued that Precious is best <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a deliberately over-the-top piece of camp in the vein of Waters's Female Trouble.|$|E

5000|$|Salvation, for Palaeologus {{comes only}} through faith, which he <b>understands</b> <b>as</b> being {{achieved}} [...] (Romans 10:17), through hearing and sharing the revealed word of God {{in the congregation}} of the faithful. Faith is assailed by sin, which Palaeologus <b>understands</b> <b>as</b> wrong intention rather than as wrong action; sin arises from seeking something that revealed scripture shows {{ought not to be}} desired.|$|R
50|$|There is {{therefore}} doctrinal agreement on:Neither Church community subscribes to the Protestant teachings {{expressed in the}} five solae, especially regarding the teachings of salvation through faith alone (which these two communities <b>understand</b> <b>as</b> requiring no acts of love and charity) or of sola Scriptura (which they <b>understand</b> <b>as</b> excluding doctrinal teachings passed down through the Church from the apostles {{in the form of}} sacred tradition).|$|R

5|$|Aristotle's {{work was}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, {{as well as}} in Europe during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which was generally <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.|$|E
5|$|Early {{contributions}} to design management show how different design disciplines were coordinated to achieve business objectives at a corporate level, and demonstrate the early understanding of design as a competitive force. In that context, design was merely <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> an aesthetic function, {{and the management}} of design was {{at the level of}} project planning.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a physical principle {{that could be}} {{described in terms of}} the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E

5|$|John Knight Bostock {{says that}} {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} that the Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. As a result, this notion has resulted in theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of the goddesses Sinthgunt and Sunna, in that the two may have been <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their {{functional}} state, are readily <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make {{no sense at all}} if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{is not completely}} <b>understood,</b> <b>as</b> the event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous. While {{it is possible that}} more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis, based on established research in the fields of biochemistry and forensic taphonomy, and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a non-viable fetus.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} {{the subject matter of the}} poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} Perl can be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a {{response}} to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.|$|E

5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field can be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> a gauge field, i.e., {{as a field}} that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} layers {{deposited}} varies with {{location in the}} Lake Lewis basin. This can best be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> the result of multiple floods; the variable levels correspond to Lake Missoula breaching the ice dam at varying lake levels, releasing different volumes of flood waters. This would suggest the time between floods is variable.|$|E
5|$|The shortest-lived known isotope of {{beryllium}} is 13Be which decays through neutron emission. It has a half-life of 2.7×10−21 s. 6Be is {{also very}} short-lived with a half-life of 5.0×10−21 s. The exotic isotopes 11Be and 14Be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo. This phenomenon can be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> the nuclei of 11Be and 14Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.|$|E

5|$|The three sonatas are {{cyclically}} interconnected by diverse structural, harmonic and melodic elements tying {{together all}} movements in each sonata, {{as well as}} all three sonatas together; consequently, they are often regarded as a trilogy. They also contain specific allusions and similarities to other Schubert compositions, such as his Winterreise song cycle; these connections point to turbulent emotions expressed in the sonatas, often <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> highly personal and autobiographical. Indeed, some researchers have suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on historical evidence concerning the composer's life.|$|E
5|$|Thelema is a {{rarely used}} in {{classical}} Greek. There {{are very few}} documents, the earliest being Antiphon the Sophist (5th century BCE). In antiquity it was beside the divine will which a man performs, just {{as much for the}} will of sexual desire. The intention of the individual was less <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> an overall, generalized, ontological place wherever it was arranged.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{is known}} {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This process can be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> the field lines wrapping around an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E
