He is a very good professional who is always on the training field. That is why his career has lasted as long as it has. Jerry is a very good influence on the dressing room as well and I'm delighted that he will be staying with us.|$|E

It has the layout of a conventional out-of-town retail park, with large stores such as Barker and Stonehouse, Toys R <b>Us,</b> <b>NEXT</b> Home and Staples. McDonald's and Pizza Hut are both situated to the south of the Retail Park site (in addition to other sites for both restaurants in Metrocentre itself). Until August 2007 the retail park was not actually under the ownership of Capital Shopping centres; it was purchased for £82.5 million.|$|E

500|$|On 20 May 2005, Challinor joined Conference National club Exeter City on {{a two-year}} contract. Manager Alex Inglethorpe {{described}} him by saying [...] "He's 24 {{years of age}} and he fits the bill of the type of player that will help <b>us</b> <b>next</b> season. I liken him to Tim Cahill of Everton. He likes to get forward and score goals, and has a good grounding in both League and non-League football." [...] Challinor made his debut in a 2–0 win away to Gravesend & Northfleet on 13 August 2005, before scoring his first goal on 3 September in a 2–2 away to Dagenham & Redbridge. He scored in a 4–0 win over former club Aldershot on 26 December 2005, during which he was targeted by opposition fans, after his former manager Terry Brown claimed he left Aldershot for financial reasons. After the match, Challinor said [...] "I got one over on the manager and proved him wrong, he didn't think I was good enough. Their fans were at me throughout the game but it only made me focus more." [...] He finished 2005–06 with 13 goals in 48 appearances for Exeter.|$|E
500|$|The {{two teams}} {{did not play}} in the same division. However, each AFL team played all other {{teams in the league}} each year, {{allowing}} the Raiders and Jets to forge a bitter rivalry. In 1963, Oakland general manager (later owner) Al Davis traded guard Dan Ficca to New York during training camp, without mentioning to Ewbank (who was also the Jets' general manager) that Ficca would not be released from his military service for another six weeks. In 1966, with less than a minute to go and the Raiders leading at the new Oakland Coliseum, 28–20, Jets left tackle Winston Hill predicted to Namath in the huddle that the man he was blocking, Ben Davidson, would rush on the next play, leaving the Raiders exposed to a draw play. Namath called the draw, and handed the ball off to running back Emerson Boozer for 47 yards and a touchdown. After a Jets two-point conversion, the game ended in a 28–28 tie, and an embittered Davidson stated, [...] "I'll get even. They still have to play <b>us</b> <b>next</b> year." [...] They did, twice. In Week 4, the Jets defeated the Raiders at Shea Stadium, 27–14; this was the Raiders' only regular season loss. In Week 14, each team's 13th game, the teams met again, in Oakland. Sportswriter Paul Zimmerman said of the second 1967 Jets-Raiders game: ...|$|E

2500|$|Bemies {{was trained}} as gymnast and also {{instructed}} Geneva College students in fencing, boxing and wrestling. [...] He also played {{at first base}} for Geneva's baseball team in 1892. [...] In an 1892 report, Geneva's Board of Trustees wrote of Bemies:"Strong inducements to leave us have been held out to Prof. O.C. [...] Bemies {{of the department of}} physical culture. [...] The Board could ill afford to keep him; and still less could it afford to lose him. [...] He is a master in the work of physical culture, and has far greater worth, to us, for the culture of the soul. [...] Prof. Bemies is a thoroughly conscientious and consistent Christian, outspoken in his opposition to dancing, card playing, theater going, tobacco using, and all such degrading and demoralizing habits, which are so ensnaring to students. [...] Arrangements have been made by which he will be with <b>us</b> <b>next</b> year." ...|$|E

Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot called the album [...] "a pure-pop candy cane, meant to be enjoyed, consumed and forgotten", commenting that [...] "thinking would ruin everything" [...] and [...] "its mixture of smut, vulnerability, menace and dancefloor celebration tells <b>us</b> <b>next</b> to nothing {{about what is going on}} between Chris Brown’s ears, which is probably for the best." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times likened its trendy musical style to a product's shelf life and attributed it to [...] "Brown's reflex of curbing his creative impulses at nearly every turn, with a few killer exceptions, and showing a conservatism unbecoming such a self-styled renegade." ...|$|E
