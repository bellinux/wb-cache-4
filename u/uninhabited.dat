5|$|Gareloi Island is <b>uninhabited</b> and {{is part of}} the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge {{managed by}} the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{wrote of}} the Neuri tribe, who lived beyond the Scythians and {{to the north of}} whom the land was <b>uninhabited</b> as far as he knew.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Landsat 1 {{discovered}} a tiny <b>uninhabited</b> island 20 kilometers off the eastern coast of Canada. This island was thereafter designated Landsat Island after the satellite.|$|E

5|$|Cres– Lošinj and Krk– Rab island chains {{divide the}} Kvarner Gulf into four {{distinct}} areas: Rijeka Bay, Kvarner (sensu stricto), Kvarnerić, and Vinodol Channel. The Cres– Lošinj group {{also includes the}} inhabited islands of Ilovik, Susak, Unije, Vele Srakane, and Male Srakane, {{as well as a}} larger number of small, <b>uninhabited</b> islands. Zadar Archipelago extends to the southeast of the island group. The Krk– Rab island group includes only <b>uninhabited</b> islands in addition to Krk and Rab, the largest among them Plavnik, Sveti Grgur, Prvić, and Goli Otok. The Krk– Rab island group is usually thought to represent a single archipelago with the island of Pag (southeast of Rab) and islets surrounding Pag.|$|E
5|$|Fearing similar {{damage to}} Aitutaki, a pre-emptive state of {{emergency}} was issued for Rarotonga. This was soon lifted as Pat ultimately spared Rarotonga and little damage took place there. Gale-force winds and heavy rains impacted Rarotonga and Palmerston islands. Large swells affected the <b>uninhabited</b> Penrhyn atoll, interfering with a study of marine turtles.|$|E
5|$|Highway 60 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with Highway 11 in Huntsville. It crosses through central Ontario in a generally east–west orientation. The triangle-shaped area bounded by Highways 11, 17 and 60 is largely <b>uninhabited</b> wilderness dotted with lakes and muskeg.|$|E

5|$|The Barra Head Lighthouse, {{built by}} Robert Stevenson, has {{operated}} since 1833. From 1931 to 1980 Barra Head was inhabited {{only by the}} lighthouse keepers and their wives but the lighthouse is now automated and the island completely <b>uninhabited.</b> The rough seas that surround the island {{have been used to}} test prototype lifeboats.|$|E
5|$|The Lamb is an <b>uninhabited</b> island about 100m long by 50m wide, {{flanked by}} the skerries North Dog and South Dog. There are other skerries {{between it and}} the shore {{including}} Bubbly Buss, the Law Rocks and the Hummel Ridges. In February 2009, the island was bought by the Israeli paranormalist Uri Geller for £30,000.|$|E
5|$|The Round Island Lighthouse {{is located}} {{just south of}} the island on the small, <b>uninhabited</b> Round Island. The light was built in 1894 and {{automated}} in 1924. Extensive restoration efforts began in the 1970s and the exterior and structure have since been repaired.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} <b>uninhabited</b> by Europeans until after World War II, when a severe drought caused white Afrikaans {{speaking}} farmers (Boers) to move in. The farm was later procured by the apartheid government {{as part of}} the Odendaal Plan and became part of the Damaraland bantustan. The white settlers left in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} comprehensive written list of Hebridean island names {{was undertaken}} by Donald Monro in 1549, {{which in some}} cases also provides the earliest written form of the island name. The derivations {{of all of the}} inhabited islands of the Hebrides and some of the larger <b>uninhabited</b> ones are listed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} table gives {{a list of}} {{the islands}} of the Firth of Clyde with an area greater than 40hectares (approximately 100acres) plus adjacent smaller <b>uninhabited</b> islets, tidal islets only separated at higher stages of the tide, and skerries which are only exposed at lower stages of the tide.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of islands}} with an area greater than 25 {{hectares}} (approximately 37 acres). Records for the last date of settlement for the smaller <b>uninhabited</b> islands are incomplete, but most of the islands listed here would have been inhabited {{at some point during the}} Neolithic, Iron Age, Early Historic or Norse periods.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uninhabited</b> South Islands include: Calf of Flotta, Cava, Copinsay, Corn Holm, Fara, Glims Holm, Hunda, Lamb Holm, Rysa Little, Switha and Swona. The Pentland Skerries lie further south, {{closer to}} the Scottish mainland.|$|E
5|$|A {{traveller}} called Demetrius of Tarsus {{related to}} Plutarch {{the tale of}} an expedition {{to the west coast}} of Scotland in or shortly before AD 83. He stated it was a gloomy journey amongst <b>uninhabited</b> islands, but he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men. He mentioned neither the druids nor the name of the island.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were <b>uninhabited</b> {{at the time}} of their {{discovery}} by Europeans. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E
5|$|At Isle of Palms in South Carolina, {{workers and}} dozens of firefighters {{prepared}} sandbags in preparation for high tide after waves from the storm previously caused moderate beach erosion. As a precaution, officials there intentionally cut power and gas to multiple <b>uninhabited</b> buildings. Officials closed schools in Dare County, North Carolina due to the threat for high winds from the storm. The North Carolina Department of Transportation also canceled ferry transportation to and from Ocracoke and Knotts Island, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{lies on the}} {{northern}} portion of the Sibuyan Sea, and is equidistant between Marinduque Island {{to the north and}} Tablas Island to the south. It is composed of the main island of Banton and the <b>uninhabited</b> islands of Bantoncillo, Carlota and Isabel, the last two of which are collectively known as the Dos Hermanas Islands. There is also an islet near Tabonan Beach on the north-west of the island.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{remained}} <b>uninhabited</b> and undisturbed through World War II and afterwards. It remained under British jurisdiction, repossessed by the British Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and governed {{as part of}} the Central and Southern Line Islands. In January 1972, the Central and Southern Line Islands, including Caroline, {{were joined}} with the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, which had become autonomous in 1971 as part of British decolonization efforts.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{in order}} to further {{capitalize}} upon the massive public interest in celebrations marking the arrival of the year 2000, Caroline Island was officially renamed Millennium Island. Although <b>uninhabited,</b> a special celebration was held on the island, featuring performances by Kiribati native entertainers and attended by Kiribati president Tito. Over 70 Kiribati singers and dancers traveled to Caroline from the capital Tarawa, accompanied by approximately 25 journalists. The celebration, broadcast by satellite worldwide, had an estimated audience of up to one billion viewers.|$|E
5|$|John Eves likely {{settled in}} the valley of Little Fishing Creek before 1774 and {{possibly}} as early as 1769. In 1778, Moses Van Campen led a scouting part past from Fort Wheeler to Chillisquaque Creek via Little Fishing Creek. The headwaters of Little Fishing Creek were <b>uninhabited</b> considerably after the valleys of Greenwood and Jerseytown were inhabited.|$|E
5|$|Lady Grange was {{abducted}} {{from her home}} {{on the night of}} 22 January 1732 by two Highland noblemen, Roderick MacLeod of Berneray and Macdonald of Morar, and several of their men. After a bloody struggle, she was taken out of the city in a sedan chair and then on horseback to Wester Polmaise near Falkirk, where she was held until 15 August {{on the ground floor of}} an <b>uninhabited</b> tower. She was by then over fifty years old.|$|E
5|$|One legend {{states that}} when Andrew the Apostle visited the <b>uninhabited</b> {{mountains}} in the mid-stream of the Dnieper River (today's Andriyvskyy Descent area), he put up a cross atop of the hill where the descent starts and prophesied a foundation of a great Christian city. Since that time, wooden churches sprang up around in the vicinity, completing his prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An <b>uninhabited</b> area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Renaud's {{squadron}} sailed on 19 October, {{seeking the}} British {{to the north}} of the island. At 11:00 on 22 October, close to the <b>uninhabited</b> islet of Île Ronde northwest of Île de France, the French sighted the British. Osborne issued orders to sail towards the French squadron; Renaud responded by forming his ships in a line of battle and advancing to meet Osborne. Prudente led the French line, closely followed by Cybèle, Jean-Bart, and Coureur, Osborne focusing on Prudente and ordering Smith to engage Cybèle.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Canada {{purchased}} the North-Western Territory and Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1868, {{under the terms}} of the Rupert's Land Act 1868 for £300,000 British pounds. Both purchased territories were largely <b>uninhabited,</b> consisting mostly of uncharted wilderness. After the purchase, the Government decided to merge both of the properties into a single jurisdiction and appoint a single territorial government to run both. The purchase of the two territories added a sizable portion of the current Canadian landmass.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of definition are considerable in some cases. For example, Haswell-Smith (2004) treats Lunga {{as a single}} island, although during high tides it becomes one inhabited island and numerous <b>uninhabited</b> tidal islets. Another example is the smaller island of Eilean Mòr in Loch Dunvegan, which joins with nearby Eilean Dubh and Garay Island at low tides.|$|E
5|$|The lake lies {{in parts}} of five counties: Box Elder, Davis, Tooele, Weber, and Salt Lake. Salt Lake City and its suburbs are located to the {{southeast}} and east of the lake, between the lake and the Wasatch Mountains, but land around {{the north and west}} shores are almost <b>uninhabited.</b> The Bonneville Salt Flats are to the west, and the Oquirrh and Stansbury Mountains rise to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} breeds on exposed and usually <b>uninhabited</b> islands which it visits only at night. It {{otherwise}} frequents mid-depth waters {{away from the}} coastal zone, but not over the ocean deeps. In the breeding season, it is mainly found between the 10–25°C July isotherms. In Europe, it is rarely seen from land except in autumn storms.|$|E
