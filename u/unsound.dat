5|$|As {{a part of}} Las Casas's defense by offense, he had {{to argue}} against Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. Sepúlveda was a doctor of {{theology}} and law who, in his book Democrates Alter, sive de justis causis apud Indos (Another Democrates /or A New Democrates, or on the Just Causes of War against the Indians) had argued that some native peoples were incapable of ruling themselves and should be pacified forcefully. The book was deemed <b>unsound</b> for publication by the theologians of Salamanca and Alcalá for containing <b>unsound</b> doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.|$|E

5|$|A {{person is}} disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include {{engaging}} in acts incompatible {{with being a}} Singapore citizen, being of <b>unsound</b> mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence.

5|$|As was {{usual in}} the district, the inquest {{was held at}} the Lamb Tap public house, Chiswick, by the coroner Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock, on 2 January 1889. The coroner's jury {{concluded}} that Druitt had committed suicide by drowning while in an <b>unsound</b> state of mind. He was buried in Wimborne cemetery the next day. At probate, his estate was valued at £2,600 (equivalent to £ today).|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} narrow and {{structurally}} <b>unsound,</b> leading {{the authorities to}} rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, {{and the introduction of}} the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to coarse stone, the latter with the {{potential}} to be structurally <b>unsound.</b> The occasional layer of shale also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered.|$|E

5|$|A member may be disqualified if he {{is found}} to be of <b>unsound</b> mind, if he becomes {{insolvent}} or is an undischarged bankrupt, {{if he is}} convicted and sentenced to imprisonment of not less than one year or a fine of not less than S$2,000, or if he has lost his Singaporean citizenship or declared himself allied to a foreign country. Any questions as to membership or disqualification are determined by a tribunal convened in secret that consists of a Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two members appointed by the Council. The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically <b>unsound.</b> With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{reaction}} {{ranged from}} those believing in literal creation from the Quran to many educated Muslims who subscribed to {{a version of}} theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval madrasahs taught the ideas of Al-Jahiz, a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection. However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the Muslim world, as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning philosophy of materialism as <b>unsound</b> to human origins and a denial of Allah. Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the Western world.|$|E

5|$|St. Mary's Church is a Grade I listed Anglican {{church in}} Chesham, Buckinghamshire, and {{is part of}} the Diocese of Oxford. Built on the site of a Bronze Age stone circle of puddingstones, parts of the church {{building}} date to the 12th century. Remodelled in the 15th and 17th centuries, the church is architecturally a mixture of English Gothic styles. Weakened by additions to the church tower and undermined by burials in and around the church, by the 19th century the building was structurally <b>unsound.</b> The church was remodelled and strengthened in the 1860s by George Gilbert Scott and again in the 20th century by Robert Potter.|$|E
5|$|The Albert Bridge is a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, {{it proved to be}} structurally <b>unsound,</b> so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The German attack caught {{large numbers}} of Soviet Air Force {{aircraft}} on the ground. Faulty tactics – sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically <b>unsound</b> formations – accounted for many more. Kesselring reported {{that in the first}} week of operations Luftflotte 2 had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air and on the ground. Even Göring found these figures hard to believe and ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo over the front in his Focke-Wulf Fw 189.|$|E

5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was <b>unsound.</b>|$|E
5|$|Five bridges {{have been}} {{constructed}} across the Indian River Inlet. The first was a creosote timber trestle bridge built in 1934; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the inlet. It {{was replaced by a}} concrete-and-steel swing bridge, the first to be named for Cullen, construction of which began in 1938. This swing bridge, which included a 4-foot (1.2-meter) pedestrian walkway and cost $165,900, opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28, 1940, but collapsed on February 10, 1948, succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers; a pickup truck on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collapse fell into the inlet, killing three men who drowned inside the truck. Another concrete-and-steel swing bridge completed in 1952, the second to be named for Cullen, also became structurally <b>unsound</b> due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage.|$|E
5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be {{seized by the}} government due to <b>unsound</b> lending practices. Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E
