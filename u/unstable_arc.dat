50|$|An AC {{supply is}} {{recommended}} for twin-carbon arc welding. In case a DC supply is used, the positive electrode will disintegrate and consume at a much faster rate as compared to negative electrode, because two-thirds of the total heat is generated at the positive pole. This will produce an <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> and require frequent adjustment of the electrodes. In AC welding, because of alternate reversals of polarity, both the electrodes will be affected equally and present no problem.|$|E

Six different shielding gas compositions in addition to pure argon (Ar) and pure CO 2 were studied in this work using flux cored arc welding (FCAW) process. For bead-on-plate (B. O. P) specimens pure Ar shielding gas has excellent arc stability; however, with increase of the CO 2 percent in the shielding gas compositions, the arc stability becomes noisy (<b>unstable</b> <b>arc)</b> especially for pure CO 2. 75...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental {{features}} of the arc stability in a dc arc furnace of 720 V/ 100 kA/ 72 MW have been investigated. The Cassie-Mayr arc model has been employed and applied for the target dc arc furnace. In order to characterize {{the parameters of the}} Cassie-Mayr arc model and the behavior of <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> dynamics, the advanced arc simulations of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) have been performed. From the results of MHD simulation, the dc arc dynamic resistance is proposed to be an effective arc stability function reflecting the instability of dynamic arc behavior. A control strategy of the 12 -pulse thyristor rectifier system to regulate the arc stability function is also proposed in this paper. The simulation and experimental results confirm the usefulness of the proposed dynamic arc resistance as the arc stability function along with the active control strategy. The proposed arc stability function can be regarded as an effective criterion for the overall power conversion system to maintain highly stable arcing operation leading to better productivity and reliability in a dc arc furnace...|$|E
40|$|Arc {{stability}} and erosion behavior were studied on a hollow graphite DC cathode in an argon atmosphere at atmospheric pressure. It {{was found that}} the arc stability is associated with the electron emission mode transition of the cathode operation. Estimation of current densities, SEM pictures, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of total voltage, and measurement of cathode surface temperature supported this. Stable arcs are in the thermionic emission regime while <b>unstable</b> <b>arcs</b> in the thermofield emission regime. Higher argon gas flow rate is believed to cause the shift of the mode from the thermofield emission to the thermionic emission by increasing the arc root temperature through steepening the thermal gradient at the arc root and increasing ionization phenomena inside the arc. Sharp cathode tip geometry usually leads to the thermionic emission while a rounded tip geometry encourages the thermofield emission. For the <b>unstable</b> <b>arcs,</b> the high voltage fluctuation resulted from the jumping of the arc root between different cathode spots and changes in the arc length. In the stable arcs, however, the voltage was almost constant because of the absence of arc jumping. The standard deviation of the voltage was used as the arc stability indicator and was less than 3 V for the stable arc in this transferred arc system. The erosion rate of the cathode in this work ranged from 0. 41 to 2. 61 mug/C. At 150 A runs the arc stability strongly influenced the erosion rate; as the arc stability increased, the erosion rate decreased. Higher currents runs (300 and 400 A), however, showed the opposite trend because of the carbon vapor redeposition. The total erosion rates of 150 A runs were separated into the stable (Es) and the unstable (Eu) erosion rate. The Eu was more than 3 times higher in this work. It is believed that the thermofield emission of the <b>unstable</b> <b>arcs</b> produced more erosion because of the higher local heat flux to the cathode spots...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of electrical power in today's automobile {{has led to}} the research and development of a new 42 V standard. One danger at this new voltage is stable electrical arcing. At the higher voltage, stable electric arcs do not self extinguish and can cause damage to the arcing conductors and cause a fire. This work evaluates possible methods to use to detect and stop electrical arcing before any major damage can occur to the vehicle and more importantly to the passengers. Electronic detection is proposed as the best approach. Arcing current of stable and <b>unstable</b> <b>arcs</b> at- 42 V and- 14 V are produced by the rebuilt apparatus of a previous MIT experiment that used a motor controlled mechanical switch to periodically energize a conductor to produce stable and <b>unstable</b> <b>arcs.</b> Fourier analysis is performed on the measured current waveforms to look for arc signatures in the frequency domain. Fourier analysis on the average of ten spectra of stable arcs showed that there were no consistent features universally present in stable arcs. Current waveforms of real electrical loads are also measured using electrical accessories (windows,door locks, seat adjustment, lights, sunroof, CD changer, radiator cooling fan) on an electrically operationa...|$|R
40|$|Tetrahedral bonded {{amorphous}} carbon (ta-C) layers {{are a new}} generation of diamond-like carbon (DLC) layers. Ta-C is hydrogen-free. Coatings made of ta-C have a 2 - 3 fold higher hardness (4000 - 5000 HV) and show an improved wear resistance under lubricated and non-lubricated conditions compared with classical DLC coatings. A new technol. for the pptn. of ta-C (Diamor) is described. C-ions, impinging deeply into a surface, form ta-C under the pressure of adjacent atoms if pptn. is performed in vacuum below 100 Deg. The high-energetic C-ions are produced by a short (130 micro s) vacuum arc which had been ignited by a high-energetic laser pulse (laser-arc-principle).

40|$|Electric arc {{furnaces}} (EAFs) {{contribute to}} almost {{one third of}} the global steel production. Arc furnaces use a large amount of electrical energy to process scrap or reduced iron and are relevant to study because small improvements in their efficiency account for significant energy savings. Optimal controllers need to be designed and proposed to enhance both process performance and energy consumption. Due to the random and chaotic nature of the electric arcs, neural networks and other soft computing techniques have been used for modeling EAFs. This study proposes a methodology for modeling EAFs that considers the time varying arc length as a relevant input parameter to the arc furnace model. Based on actual voltages and current measurements taken from an arc furnace, it was possible to estimate an arc length suitable for modeling the arc furnace using neural networks. The obtained results show that the model reproduces not only the stable arc conditions but also the <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> conditions, which are difficult to identify in a real heat process. The presented model can be applied for the development and testing of control systems to improve furnace energy efficiency and productivity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the infl uence of oxygen additions (0. 5 % to 2. 0 %) to argon-rich shielding gas on nitrogen degassing during the autogenous arc welding of a high-manganese nitrogen-alloyed austenitic stainless steel, previously commercially available under the trade name of Cromanite. Autogenous arc welding of this steel in inert shielding gas results in considerable nitrogen losses from the weld pool, characterised by an <b>unstable</b> <b>arc,</b> spattering and violent metal expulsion from the weld pool. Oxygen additions to the shielding gas stabilise the arc and curb nitrogen-induced porosity, but at least 2. 0 % oxygen (by volume) is required to maintain the weld metal nitrogen content {{at the level of}} the parent material prior to welding. The benefi cial effect of oxygen additions to the shielding gas is attributed to the formation of a solid MnCr 2 O 4 spinel phase on the weld pool surface during welding, which retards nitrogen degassing by reducing the area available for the adsorption of nitrogen atoms prior to their recombination to form N 2. This layer has a granular, irregular appearance and presents a less effective barrier to nitrogen degassing than the continuous, uniform liquid slag layer that forms when the Cr-Ni 300 -series austenitic stainless steels are welded in oxygen-containing shielding gas mixtures...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{decomposition}} of <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> evaporated Ti 0. 6 Al 0. 4 N at elevated temperatures and quasihydrostatic pressures {{has been studied}} both experimentally and by first-principles calculations. High pressure and high temperature (HPHT) treatment of the samples was realized using the multi anvil press and diamond anvil cell techniques. The products of the HPHT treatment of Ti 0. 6 Al 0. 4 N were investigated using x-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy. Complimentary calculations show that both hydrostatic pressure and high temperature stabilize the cubic phase of AlN, {{which is one of}} the decomposition products of Ti 0. 6 Al 0. 4 N. This is in agreement with the experimental results which in addition suggest that the presence of Ti in the system serves to increase the stability region of the cubic c-AlN phase. The results are industrially important as they show that Ti 0. 6 Al 0. 4 N coatings on cutting inserts do not deteriorate faster under pressure due to the cubic AlN to hexagonal AlN transformation.

5000|$|George Francis Fitzgerald first {{realized}} in 1892 {{that if the}} damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, it would produce continuous oscillations. In the same year Elihu Thomson built a negative resistance oscillator by connecting an LC circuit to the electrodes of an arc, perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. William Duddell, a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention. Due to its negative resistance, the current through an <b>arc</b> was <b>unstable,</b> and <b>arc</b> lights would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an LC circuit across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc. To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it. Duddell's [...] "singing arc" [...] oscillator was limited to audio frequencies. However, in 1903 Danish engineers Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field, inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, which was widely used until the 1920s.|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of Tsp, a periplasmic endoprotease of Escherichia coli, {{has been characterized}} by assaying the cleavage of protein and peptide substrates, determining the cleavage sites in several substrates, and investigating the kinetics of the cleavage reaction. Tsp efficiently cleaves substrates that have apolar residues and a free alpha-carboxylate at the C-terminus. Tsp cleaves its substrates at a discrete number of sites but with rather broad primary sequence specificity. In addition to preferences for residues at the C-terminus and cleavage sites, Tsp displays a preference for substrates that are not stably folded: <b>unstable</b> variants of <b>Arc</b> repressor are better substrates than a hyperstable mutant, and a peptide with little stable structure is cleaved more efficiently than a protein substrate. These data are consistent with a model in which Tsp cleavage of a protein substrate involves binding to the C-terminal tail of the substrate, transient denaturation of the substrate, and then recognition and hydrolysis of specific peptide bonds...|$|R
30|$|The {{stochastic}} {{shortest path}} length {{is defined as}} the arrival probability from a given source node to a given destination node in the stochastic networks. We consider the topological changes and their effects on the arrival probability in directed acyclic networks. There is a stable topology which shows the physical connections of nodes; however, the communication between nodes does not stable and that {{is defined as the}} <b>unstable</b> topology where <b>arcs</b> may be congested. A discrete time Markov chain with an absorbing state is established in the network according to the unstable topological changes. Then, the arrival probability to the destination node from the source node in the network is computed as the multi-step transition probability of the absorption in the final state of the established Markov chain. It is assumed to have some wait states, whenever there is a physical connection but {{it is not possible to}} communicate between nodes immediately. The proposed method is illustrated by different numerical examples, and the results can be used to anticipate the probable congestion along some critical arcs in the delay sensitive networks.|$|R
30|$|Underwater welding is {{used for}} the repair welding of ships and {{offshore}} engineering structures like oil drilling rigs, pipelines, and platforms. The commonly used underwater welding processes nowadays are shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and flux cored arc welding (FCAW). The water surrounding the weld metal reduces the mechanical properties of weld done underwater due to the effect of the fast cooling rate of the weld. Heat loss by conduction from the plate surface into the moving water environment and heat loss by radiation are the major heat losses in underwater welding. Underwater welding requires a higher current for the same arc voltage to achieve a higher heat input as compared to air welding. The fast cooling rate of underwater welding results in the formation of constituents such as martensite and bainite for conventional welding of steels. These constituents lead to a high-strength, brittle material and susceptibility to hydrogen-induced cracking. The weld bead shape for underwater wet welding are more spread out and less penetrating than air welds. Underwater welding arc is constricted at increased depth or pressure. However, welding in shallow depth is more critical than that in higher depth. The <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> results in porosity which affects the soundness of the weld. Weld metal carbon content increases with increase in water depth. Also, manganese and silicon which are deoxidizers are increasingly lost at increased water depth (Omajene et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|After {{the demise}} of the Cold War, US {{strategic}} planning gradually adjusted to the new security environment, aiming to maintain its dominant global position while increasingly emphasizing regional security, governance issues and threats from non-state actors. The George W. Bush administration greatly accelerated these trends. US grand strategy today is one of global primacy, characterized by a dual focus on preventing the rise of any regional hegemonic powers while addressing regional security issues stemming from transnational and non-state threats. Current US grand strategy exhibits, as it has for decades, two fundamental components: geopolitical reasoning and ideological interests. The geographical focus of US strategy has gradually shifted to a broad arc stretching from Western Africa to Southeast Asia, an area rich in vital strategic resources and widespread political and social instability. Located {{at the center of this}} <b>unstable</b> <b>arc,</b> Central Asia contains many of the global challenges facing the US: regional powers, unstable and authoritarian states, energy resources, terrorism, proliferation threats and international criminal networks. With its regional strategy, the US seeks to shift the political center of gravity away from Russia and China by encouraging economic and political linkages between Central Asia and the region's southerly neighbors. This study reveals that the geopolitical and ideological elements in US strategy create both surprising synergies as well as classic conflicts of interest for policymakers.

40|$|Anthracites are {{utilised}} in {{the reduction}} of ilmenite in most South African ilmenite processing plants. The smelting mechanism reported by Pistorius (2008) involves {{the reduction of}} iron oxide and titanium dioxide, in the ilmenite, using carbon monoxide (generated by the Boudouard reaction) to produce pig iron, titania rich slag and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is converted to carbon monoxide via the Boudouard reaction. The anthracite utilised in the process influences {{the efficiency of the}} process. It has been reported that the use of alternative anthracites has affected the smelter operation in the following manner: • Furnace foaming can occur which results in operational downtime and out of specification product • Impurities in the reductant can also result in out of specification product • Smelting reactivity can result in unstable furnace performance and resultant downtime • Decrepitation of reductant can result in carbon losses and an <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> in the furnace with associated resultant downtime The reasons why different anthracites have a particular effect on the operation have not been determined. The samples evaluated in Jordan (2009) and in the current investigation included a Russian (R), Vietnamese (V), Vietnamese Low Volatile (VLV) and a South African Anthracite (SAA). A representative 5 - 8 mm sample was used for reactivity test in Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA) at Mintek. Average apparent reactivity was calculated for tests conducted between 850 oC and 1600 oC (250 oC interval).

40|$|I {{introduce}} a critical-state theory incorporating both flux cutting and flux transport {{to calculate the}} magnetic-field and current-density distributions inside a type-II superconducting cylinder at its critical current in a longitudinal applied magnetic field. The theory {{is an extension of}} the elliptic critical-state model introduced by Romero-Salazar and Perez-Rodriguez. The vortex dynamics depend in detail upon two nonlinear effective resistivities for flux cutting (ρ_∥) and flux flow (ρ_), and their ratio r = ρ_∥/ρ_. When r < 1, the low relative efficiency of flux cutting in reducing the magnitude of the internal magnetic-flux density leads to a paramagnetic longitudinal magnetic moment. As a model for understanding the experimentally observed interrelationship between the critical currents for flux cutting and depinning, I calculate the forces on a helical vortex arc stretched between two pinning centers when the vortex is subjected to a current density of arbitrary angle ϕ. Simultaneous initiation of flux cutting and flux transport occurs at the critical current density J_c(ϕ) that makes the vortex <b>arc</b> <b>unstable.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} a {{methodology}} for testing MAG wires was conducted. The method {{involves the use}} of some advanced technologies like a high speed camera and a high frequency data logging devise to capture the welding starting properties, in which six wires both copper and bare were selected for the tests, while setting most parameters such as work piece material, power source, voltage, current and wire feed speed as constants. The main purpose is to evaluate the High Speed Camera usage as a non-real-time sensor for the suggested method. At the mean time a comparison was established between the selected wires, entailing their coating, type of arc used, welder’s opinions on performance, integrity of solidified weld among others. This project was divided into 3 tasks, the first task was recording welding tests using the high speed camera, the second task involved testing the wires manually with experienced welders to compare their subjective opinion to the data collected from the first task, and finally the third task was a comparison of the filet weld size of the same six wires, thus reflecting weld integrity. Using the method of high speed camera and data logger shed some light on several features and introduced fresh new aspects that were not possible to attain otherwise such as the time to establish a stable arc for each wire and its dependence on wire cuts and type of arc used, while comparisons between wires showed how wire composition, coating type and arc applied affect welding starting properties and voltage/current trends. It was concluded that the <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> duration is prolonged in case of the presence of wire-cuts or solidified droplets on wire tips and that copper-coated wires have fewer spatter and non-spherical shaped droplets compared to bare wires. Finally, it was also proven that weld bead integrity and flatness increases with increasing applied voltage...|$|E
40|$|Theories of {{international}} law and politics are a product of their times. They focus on the issues of the day (or of the immediate past) and their assumptions are often the assumptions of the society in which they were born. Perhaps that it is why so many international relations scholars were surprised {{by the end of the}} Cold War: Their theories were so informed by bipolarity that they were unable to see the actual changes that would transform the state system. As international relations scholars are re-assessing their theories in a post-Cold War world, lawyers may do the same concerning international legal jurisprudence. Throughout the Cold War, the New Haven School of policy-oriented jurisprudence attempted to describe how law was actually used in the policymaking process and to suggest how it should be used towards the goals of securing human dignity and the spread of free societies. But with the titanic struggle between competing world orders being replaced by parochial fights and feuds, whither the New Haven School? What insights does it have for today 2 ̆ 7 s world? Does the New Haven School 2 ̆ 7 s theory need to catch up to the practice {{of international}} law? This Article considers the strengths and weaknesses of the New Haven School in light of the competition among multiple conceptions of 2 ̆ 2 world public order 2 ̆ 2 that exist today. As a test case, I will look at the competition on the 2 ̆ 2 grand chessboard 2 ̆ 2 of Eurasia. At one time called the 2 ̆ 2 world island 2 ̆ 2 by geo-strategists, Eurasia today is home to seventy-five percent of the world 2 ̆ 7 s population, sixty percent of the global GNP, and contains about seventy-five percent of known energy sources. It is also a geographic space where multiple conceptions of public order, including those of the United States, the European Union, Russia, and Islamic fundamentalists, overlap, interact, and at times compete. This is especially so in the <b>unstable</b> <b>arc</b> of states bordering Russia: from Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine in the West; down to the Caucasian countries of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan in the Russian southwest; and ultimately the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to the Russian south. In Part II, I will introduce the idea of 2 ̆ 2 diverse systems of public order 2 ̆ 2 described in policy-oriented jurisprudence. I will also situate the New Haven School as part of the liberal modernist tradition that attempts to find universal norms and/or techniques to address questions of political or normative conflict. Part III will examine the different public orders in today 2 ̆ 7 s multi-polar, multi-normative world. In Part IV, I will propose the concepts of systemic borderlands—states that are the geopolitical crossroads between two or more normative realms—and of normative friction, the process in which competing conceptions of public order interact in these borderland states, as a means of describing the normative interactions in a multi-polar world. Part V will consider examples of systemic borderlands and normative friction in Eurasia. In Part VI, I will propose ways in which the New Haven School can build on some of its own original insights on the existence of diverse systems of public order in light of changes in international politics. As this short Article can only scratch the surface of so many issues, I will also set out questions for further investigation...|$|E
