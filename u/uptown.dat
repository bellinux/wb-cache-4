5|$|Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the <b>Uptown</b> District boomed {{during the}} 1970s and early 1980s when a {{collection}} of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate610 West. <b>Uptown</b> {{became one of the}} most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in <b>Uptown</b> is the 64-floor, -tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in <b>Uptown</b> after 30years. The <b>Uptown</b> District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, <b>Uptown</b> had more than 23million square feet (2,100,000m²) of office space with 16million square feet (1,500,000m²) of class A office space.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1966 <b>Uptown</b> {{was among the}} {{possible}} sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The <b>Uptown</b> site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those concerned for the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units {{for the development of}} Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the <b>Uptown</b> Peoples Law Center.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{became an}} intern at New York's <b>Uptown</b> Records. While talent {{director}} at <b>Uptown,</b> he helped develop Jodeci and Mary J. Blige. In his college days Combs {{had a reputation}} for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants. In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game. The event was oversold, and a stampede occurred in which nine people died.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{depressing}} sections of Chicago is the <b>Uptown</b> area on the North Side. Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new alderman, Helen Shiller, {{and she has a}} vision of what that seedy old neighborhood should be in the future. And apparently her vision is that <b>Uptown</b> should remain a seedy old neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Helen Shiller and her long-time {{staff member}} Maggie Marystone were interviewed in {{separate}} chapters in Hope Dies Last, {{a collection of}} oral histories by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and <b>Uptown</b> resident Studs Terkel.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, Chabon {{confirmed}} he {{had been}} hired to do revisions to the script for Disney's John Carter. In 2014, Chabon was also involved in writing lyrics for Mark Ronson's album <b>Uptown</b> Special.|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, <b>uptown</b> means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term <b>uptown</b> also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above urban villages, Phoenix {{has a variety of}} commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as Downtown, Midtown, <b>Uptown,</b> West Phoenix, North Phoenix, South Phoenix, Biltmore Area, Arcadia, and Sunnyslope.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the city's early {{prosperity}} {{funded the}} construction of a number of elegant Craftsman, Georgian, storybook, Tudor, Greek Revival, Italianate, Spanish revival, and colonial revival homes (many of which can be found in Tulsa's <b>uptown</b> and Midtown neighborhoods).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the 40 Watt Club became a {{well-known}} regional attraction for music fans, and {{was followed by}} the <b>Uptown</b> Lounge; with the local industry's growth in the 1980s, both the 40 Watt Club and the <b>Uptown</b> Lounge moved to larger spaces, the latter taking over the landmark Georgia Theatre. The early 1980s saw a host of new bands and venues appear, while the city's musical subculture became more diversified. LSD, a hallucinogenic drug, was widely used in the college music scene in this era. Many members of Athens's most prominent later bands became locally renowned starting in the 1970s, including The B-52's.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{played their}} first season at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina, as their {{facility}} in <b>uptown</b> Charlotte {{was still under}} construction. Ericsson Stadium, called Bank of America Stadium since 2004, opened {{in the summer of}} 1996.|$|E
5|$|During Miller's tenure the synagogue's {{neighborhood}} {{began to}} deteriorate. Members started moving <b>uptown,</b> and the congregation {{embarked on a}} search for a new location. In 1963 Beth Israel purchased a block of land at 7000 Canal Boulevard at Walker Street in the Lakeview neighborhood. It moved into its new larger building there in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Even as the {{building}} was under construction, the ethnic makeup of the church's neighborhood was rapidly changing; native-born Baptists were displaced by Irish and German immigrants. As members moved <b>uptown,</b> the congregation decided to follow and sold their building in 1860 to Alanson T. Biggs, a successful local merchant. The departing Baptist congregation founded the Fifth Avenue Baptist church, then founded the Park Avenue Church, and finally built the Riverside Church.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) {{was built}} through the Pine Bush, disrupting habitat and ecology. Further {{development}} {{took place in}} the 1950s and 60s with the construction of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus and the SUNY Albany <b>uptown</b> campus. In the 21st century, the remaining Pine Bush represents only about 10% of the undeveloped land that existed prior to 1950.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan Island is loosely {{divided into}} Downtown (Lower Manhattan), Midtown (Midtown Manhattan), and <b>Uptown</b> (Upper Manhattan), with Fifth Avenue {{dividing}} Manhattan's {{east and west}} sides. Manhattan Island is bounded by the Hudson River {{to the west and}} the East River to the east. To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island from the Bronx and the mainland United States.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, March 8, 2005, The Get Up Kids {{announced}} that after ten years, {{they were calling}} it quits. They embarked on a national farewell tour, ending the band after a sold-out show on July 2, 2005 in their hometown of Kansas City, Missouri at the <b>Uptown</b> Theater.|$|E
5|$|Previously, K-Ci & JoJo {{had been}} {{members of the}} group Jodeci, which {{consisted}} of them and another pair of brothers, DeVante Swing and Mr. Dalvin. Under <b>Uptown</b> Records, the group released three studio albums certified platinum by the RIAA: Forever My Lady (1991), Diary of a Mad Band (1993), and The Show, The After Party, The Hotel (1995).|$|E
5|$|Shiller {{separated}} from her husband Mark Zalkin, one of the Mayor Harold Washington's assistant press secretaries, and with Shiller {{a leader of the}} 46th Ward Community Service Center (later the <b>Uptown</b> Community Service Center) and an editor of Keep Strong magazine, and with Shiller and Coleman an editor of All-Chicago City News. Zalkin passed on February 23, 1998 at age 49 due to complications from multiple sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|Space Center Houston is the {{official}} visitors' center of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The Space Center has many interactive exhibits including moon rocks, a shuttle simulator, and presentations {{about the history of}} NASA's manned space flight program. Other tourist attractions include the Galleria (Texas's largest shopping mall, located in the <b>Uptown</b> District), Old Market Square, the Downtown Aquarium, and Sam Houston Race Park.|$|E
5|$|Voters {{rejected}} {{efforts to}} have separate {{residential and commercial}} land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Consequently, rather than a single central business district {{as the center of}} the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to downtown which include <b>Uptown,</b> TexasMedicalCenter, Midtown, GreenwayPlaza, Memorial City, Energy Corridor, Westchase, and Greenspoint.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Chinese {{community}} leaders secured approximately 50ten-year leases on {{properties in the}} newly developing Chinatown. Jim Moy, director of the Association, then decided that a Chinese-style building should be constructed as a strong visual announcement of the Chinese community's new presence in the area. With no Chinese-born architects in Chicago at the time, Chicago-born Norse architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad were asked to design the On Leong Merchants Association Building {{in the spring of}} 1926. Moy decided to employ the pair again after Michaelsen and Rognstad's firm built Moy's Peacock Inn in <b>Uptown</b> in 1920.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Bill Peduto {{defeated}} Jack Wagner, Jake Wheatley and A. J. Richardson. Peduto {{gained a}} majority of the vote, with about 52 percent. Wagner, Wheatley and Richardson finished with about 40, 8 and 1 percent, respectively. Peduto carried much of the vote in wards in and around Downtown and to the east, {{with the exception of one}} ward carried by Wheatley in the <b>uptown</b> section. Wagner was most successful in the South Side and portions of the North Side.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation was {{produced}} by Coyle's production company, Ten Ten Films, and the company Farnam Street II, in association with Cabin 14 Productions. It was distributed by First Look International. About {{a year before the}} film was released, Coyle asked Anne Marie Gillen to serve as executive producer. Gillen said she had not responded to a script in such an emotional way since the 1991 drama film Fried Green Tomatoes, which she also produced. Filming, which began in May 2008, took place entirely in Minneapolis. It included several scenes staged in the city's <b>Uptown</b> commercial district, where Coyle lived.|$|E
5|$|Superman premiered at the <b>Uptown</b> Theater in Washington, D.C. on December 10, 1978, with {{director}} Richard Donner {{and several}} cast members in attendance. Three days later, on December 13, {{it had a}} European Royal Charity Premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square in London {{in the presence of}} HM Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew. It went on to gross $134.21million in North America and $166million internationally, totaling $300.21million worldwide. Superman was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978 (behind only Grease), and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time after its theatrical run. It was also Warner Bros.' most successful film at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Carolina Panthers {{are legally}} {{registered}} as Panther Football, LLC. The team is headquartered in Bank of America Stadium in <b>uptown</b> Charlotte; also the team's home field. They {{are one of}} the few NFL teams to own the stadium they play in, which is legally registered as Panthers Stadium, LLC. The Panthers are supported throughout the Carolinas; although the team has played its home games in Charlotte since 1996, it played home games at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina during its first season. The team hosts its annual training camp at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The Riverview {{became one}} of the few {{remaining}} single-screen theaters in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area; by the end of the 1980s, it was one of only six left, and after 1998, it was one of only four left, with the <b>Uptown</b> and Parkway Theaters and the Oak Street Cinema, although since 1998, several new single-screen theaters–the Trylon Microcinema and the Heights Theater–have opened. The owners installed new seats in 1999 that allowed for greater leg room and more space between patrons.|$|E
5|$|The city's skyline {{changed in}} the 1960s and 1970s with the {{construction}} of office towers around the Empire State Plaza and at the <b>uptown</b> campus of SUNY Albany, mainly under the direction of Governor Nelson Rockefeller. While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to urban sprawl and suburbanization, many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector.|$|E
5|$|The contest {{affects their}} sleep, and the {{remaining}} contestants suffer insomnia. Only the eliminated Kramer can sleep peacefully. Elaine shares a cab ride with Kennedy, and she tells him that she lives <b>Uptown</b> near Jerry in order to extend the ride. She then learns that Kennedy wants to see her, and says he'll drop by Jerry's apartment. Eventually, the pressure becomes {{too much for her}} and she is the second person to be knocked out of the contest.|$|E
5|$|With the album's {{critical}} acclaim and the band's steady touring, the Afghan Whigs attained a cult following and was courted by several major labels {{who wanted to}} sign them. Frustrated with the distribution limitation of a small record label, they signed to Elektra Records after their final release for Sub Pop, an EP of soul cover songs called <b>Uptown</b> Avondale (1992). Their major label debut Gentlemen was released in 1993 to {{critical acclaim}} and mainstream exposure. Congregation later was reissued in September 1998.|$|E
5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about <b>Uptown</b> in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In February 1990, the Southern Rockers vacated the {{championship}} and left PNW. They began {{competing for the}} United States Wrestling Association, where they quickly won the USWA World Tag Team Championship. Three days after winning the title belts, King and Doll dropped them to Robert Fuller and Brian Lee. They regained them six days later, however. On April 28, they lost the title to The <b>Uptown</b> Posse but were able to regain it {{less than a month}} later. On June 2, King competed in a handicap match, in which he faced The Dirty White Boys (Tony Anthony and Tom Burton). Unable to defeat both men, he lost the match and {{the championship}}.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{world premiere}} was on April 2, 1968, at the <b>Uptown</b> Theater in Washington, D.C. It opened {{two days later}} at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in Hollywood and the Loew's Capitol in New York. Kubrick then deleted {{nineteen}} minutes of footage from the film before its general release in five other U.S. cities on April 10, 1968, and internationally in five cities the following day, where it was shown in 70mm format, used a six-track stereo magnetic soundtrack, and projected in the 2.21:1 aspect ratio. The general release of the film in its 35mm anamorphic format took place in autumn 1968 and used either a four-track magnetic stereo soundtrack or an optical monaural soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the opening}} of Phase 1, {{ridership}} on the Lexington Avenue Line at the 68th Street, 77th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street stations decreased in January 2017 compared to in January 2016. The Second Avenue Line's three stations and the renovated Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station saw an average weekday ridership of more than 150,000 {{by the end of}} January. The 72nd Street station was the busiest of the line's new stations, with an average daily ridership of 44,000. By April, taxi usage in the area also saw a decline of more than 20% compared to before the line's opening. By May 15, Second Avenue ridership had increased to 176,000 passengers a day, reducing overall usage on the Lexington Avenue Line by 26% while representing a 42% increase from the Second Avenue ridership in January. Because of the increasing demand, Q service will be increased by one downtown trip in the morning and by one <b>uptown</b> trip in the evening on November 6, 2017. In addition, one northbound R trip was rerouted from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to further boost service. This trip will return southbound in the evening in Q service.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by <b>Uptown</b> residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E
