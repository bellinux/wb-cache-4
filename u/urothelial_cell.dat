40|$|We {{studied the}} {{localization}} and physiological {{functions of the}} transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPV 1 (TRP vanilloid 1) and TRPV 4 (TRP vanilloid 4) in the mouse bladder, because both channels {{are thought to be}} mechanosensors for bladder distention. RT-PCR specifically amplified TRPV 4 transcripts from the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas TRPV 1 transcripts were barely detectable. ISH experiments showed that TRPV 4 transcripts were abundantly expressed in the urothelium, whereas TRPV 1 transcripts were not detectable in the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunoblotting and IHC studies showed that TRPV 4 proteins were mainly localized at the basal plasma membrane domains of the basal <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> In contrast, TRPV 1 -immunoreactivities were found not in the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> but in the nerve fibers that innervate the urinary bladder. In Ca 2 +-imaging experiments, 4 α-phorbol 12, 13 -didecanoate, a TRPV 4 agonist, and hypotonic stimuli induced significant increases in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in isolated <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas capsaicin, a TRPV 1 agonist, showed no marked effect on the cells.

This study examines the expression of PGE 2 synthesis and degradation enzymes in <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> during differentiation. We measured immunoprotein expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), prostaglandin E 2 synthase (PGES) and 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) in human <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and in immortalized <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from the bladders of IC/PBS patients or normal subjects during stratification and differentiation produced by increased calcium and fetal bovine serum (Ca/FBS) in the culture medium for 1, 3 and 7 days.

40|$|Bladder cancer, {{the fourth}} most common noncutaneous {{malignancy}} in the United States, is characterized by high recurrence rate, with a subset of these cancers progressing to a deadly muscle invasive form of disease. Exosomes are small secreted vesicles that contain proteins, mRNA and miRNA, thus potentially modulating signaling pathways in recipient cells. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell–cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells. EMT has been implicated in the initiation of metastasis for cancer progression. We investigated the ability of bladder cancer-shed exosomes to induce EMT in <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from T 24 or UMUC 3 invasive bladder cancer cell conditioned media or from patient urine or bladder barbotage samples. Exosomes were then added to the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and EMT was assessed. <b>Urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> treated with bladder cancer exosomes showed an increased expression in several mesenchymal markers, including α-smooth muscle actin, S 100 A 4 and snail, as compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) -treated cells. Moreover, treatment of <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> with bladder cancer exosomes resulted in decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin, {{as compared with the}} control, PBS-treated cells. Bladder cancer exosomes also increased the migration and invasion of <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> and this was blocked by heparin pretreatment. We further showed that exosomes isolated from patient urine and bladder barbotage samples were able to induce the expression of several mesenchymal markers in recipient <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> In conclusion, the research presented here represents both a new insight into the role of exosomes in transition of bladder cancer into invasive disease, as well as an introduction to a new platform for exosome research in <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Oncogenesis (2015) 4, e 163; doi: 10. 1038 /oncsis. 2015. 21; published online 17 August 201...|$|R

40|$|Background: The tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) superfamily of ligands and receptors mediates immune cell survival. Some members {{possess a}} death domain, a protein motif that functions to transmit apoptotic signals, whereas others, such as CD 40, do not. CD 40 is expressed by both normal and malignant epithelial cells. To investigate the functional {{significance of this}} expression, we studied the effects of ligation of CD 40, Fas, and TNF receptors (TNFRs) on the proliferation and survival of normal and malignant human <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> with disabled p 53 function. Methods: Normal and malignant human <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured with soluble TNF family agonists (CD 40 ligand [CD 40 L], TNF-{alpha}, anti-Fas antibody, or cocultured with mouse fibroblasts stably transfected with plasmids that caused the cells to constitutively express CD 40 L or CD 32; cell proliferation was estimated by an [3 H]thymidine incorporation assay, and apoptosis was determined by Annexin V staining and by a DNA fragmentation assay. Messenger RNA levels for CD 40 and potential downstream effector molecules were quantified by polymerase chain reaction-based and ribonuclease protection assays, respectively, and nuclear factor (NF) {kappa}B nuclear translocation was detected by immunofluorescence. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Soluble trimeric CD 40 L inhibited the growth of normal and malignant <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> but did not induce apoptosis. Cell surface-presented CD 40 L induced massive apoptosis in CD 40 -positive transitional cell carcinoma cells but not in normal <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Normal cells underwent CD 40 L-mediated apoptosis only {{in the presence of}} other TNFR agonists. An agonistic anti-CD 40 antibody presented on the surface of CD 32 -transfected fibroblasts also induced apoptosis in transitional cell carcinoma cells and in normal <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Apoptotic responses of tumor (but not normal) cells to soluble agonists were enhanced by blocking protein synthesis. Karyotypically normal <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> with disabled p 53 function underwent apoptosis during coculture with CD 40 L-expressing fibroblasts alone but were not additionally sensitive to additional TNFR agonists. Conclusions: Susceptibility to CD 40 ligation-induced apoptosis may be a novel mechanism for eliminating neoplastically transformed <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Loss of CD 40 expression may be an important adaptive mechanism for transitional cell carcinoma development and progression...|$|R

Singly dispersed TCC cells grew in 0. 3 % agarose semisolid medium with a cloning efficiency ranging from 0. 02 % to 0. 71 %. Singly dispersed normal ureteral <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> under the same conditions did not form colonies in 0. 3 % agarose. Neither singly dispersed TCC nor normal <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> formed colonies when plated on collagen-gel substrates.

40|$|The {{differentiation}} of <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> results in normal terminally differentiated cells or by alternative pathways in low-grade or high-grade urothelial carcinomas. Treatments with traditional surgical and chemotherapeutical approaches are still inadequate and expensive, as bladder tumours are generally highly recurrent. In such situations, alternative approaches, using irradiation {{of the cells}} and nanoparticles, are promising. The ways in which <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> at different differentiation levels, respond to UV-irradiation (photolytic treatment) or to the combination of UV-irradiation and nanoparticles (photocatalytic treatment), are unknown. Here we tested cytotoxicity of UV-irradiation on (i) normal porcine <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> (NPU), (ii) human low-grade <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells</b> (RT 4), and (iii) human high-grade <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells</b> (T 24).

On the other hand, the majority of T 24 cells survived 1 minute of UV-irradiation. Moreover, even a prolonged UV-irradiation for 30 minutes killed < 50 % of T 24 cells. When T 24 cells were pre-supplemented with mesoporous TiO 2 microbeads and then UV-irradiated, the viability of these high-grade <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells</b> was reduced to < 10 %, which points to the highly efficient cytotoxic effects of TiO 2 photocatalysis. Using electron microscopy, we confirmed that the mesoporous TiO 2 microbeads were internalized into T 24 cells, and that the cell's ultrastructure was heavily compromised after UV-irradiation. In conclusion, our results show major differences in the sensitivity to UV-irradiation among the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> with respect to cell differentiation.

Materials and Methods: MN assay was performed on buccal mucosa, <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> and peripheric blood lymphocyte samples obtained from 15 healthy male smokers (> 5 pack-years) and 15 healthy male nonsmoker controls who had not been exposed to any known genotoxic agent. Statistical Analysis Used: The statistical differences between smoker and nonsmoker groups were calculated by using student t test. The differences between smoker-group tissues were compared by ANOVA. Results: It was found that MN frequency (mean value ± standard deviation) in oral mucosa cells from smokers and controls were 1. 20 ± 0. 22 % and 0. 26 ± 0. 10 %; in <b>urothelial</b> exfoliative <b>cells,</b> 1. 29 ± 0. 28 % and 0. 12 ± 0. 08 %; in peripheric blood lymphocytes, 1. 53 ± 0. 23 % and 0. 38 ± 0. 12 %, respectively.

Our aim was to test 1. 9 nm biocompatible gold nanoparticles as a novel marker of internalization into the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> under physiological conditions in vivo. Methods: We compared normal and neoplastic mice urothelium. Neoplastic lesions were induced by 0. 05 % N-butyl-N-(4 -hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) in drinking water for 10 weeks. Nanoparticles, intravenously injected into normal and BBN-treated mice, were filtered through the kidneys and became constituents of the urine within 90 minutes after injection. Results: Gold nanoparticles were densely accumulated in the urine, while their internalization into <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> depended on the cell differentiation stage. In the terminally differentiated superficial <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> of normal animals, nanoparticles were occasionally found in the endosomes, {{but not in the}} fusiform vesicles. Regions of exfoliated cells were occasionally found in the normal urothelium. Superficial <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> located next to exfoliated regions contained gold nanoparticles in the endosomes and in the cytosol beneath the apical plasma membrane.

We evaluate in vitro use of small intestinal submucosa to support the individual and combined growth of bladder <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and smooth muscle cells for potential use in tissue engineering techniques, and in vitro study of the cellular mechanisms involved in bladder regeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary cultures of human bladder <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and smooth muscle cells were established using standard enzymatic digestion or explant techniques. Cultured cells were then seeded on small intestinal submucosa at a density of 1 x 105 cells per cm. 2, incubated and harvested at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. The 5 separate culture methods evaluated were <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> seeded alone on the mucosal surface of small intestinal submucosa, smooth muscle cells seeded alone on the mucosal surface, layered coculture of smooth muscle cells seeded on the mucosal surface followed by <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> 1 hour later, sandwich coculture of smooth muscle cells seeded on the serosal surface followed by seeding of <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> on the mucosal surface 24 hours later, and mixed coculture of <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and smooth muscle cells mixed and seeded together on the mucosal surface. Following harvesting at the designated time points small intestinal submucosa cell constructs were formalin fixed and processed for routine histology including Masson trichrome staining. Specific cell growth characteristics were studied with particular attention to cell morphology, cell proliferation and layering, cell sorting, presence of a pseudostratified urothelium and matrix penetrance. To aid {{in the identification of}} smooth muscle <b>cells</b> and <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> in the coculture groups, immunohistochemical analysis was performed with antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin and cytokeratins AE 1 /AE 3. RESULTS: Progressive 3 -dimensional growth of <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and smooth muscle cells occurred in vitro on small intestinal submucosa. When seeded alone <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and smooth muscle cells grew in several layers with minimal to no matrix penetration. In contrast, layered, mixed and sandwich coculture methods demonstrated significant enhancement of smooth muscle cell penetration of the membrane. The layered and sandwich coculture techniques resulted in organized cell sorting, formation of a well-defined pseudostratified urothelium and multilayered smooth muscle cells with enhanced matrix penetration. With the mixed coculture technique {{there was no evidence of}} cell sorting although matrix penetrance by the smooth muscle cells was evident. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and smooth muscle cells maintain the expression of the phenotypic markers of differentiation alpha-smooth muscle actin and cytokeratins AE 1 /AE 3. CONCLUSIONS: Small intestinal submucosa supports the 3 -dimensional growth of human bladder cells in vitro. Successful combined growth of bladder cells on small intestinal submucosa with different seeding techniques has important future clinical implications with respect to tissue engineering technology. The results of our study demonstrate that there are important smooth muscle cell-epithelial cell interactions involved in determining the type of in vitro cell growth that occurs on small intestinal submucosa.

A molecular connection between TRPV 4 and different adherence junction components was investigated using immunofluorescence, Western blot and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Results revealed TRPV 4 on <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> membranes near adherence junctions. Results were comparable in the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> line, human bladders and mouse bladders. Subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments established a molecular connection of TRPV 4 to alpha-catenin, {{an integral part of}} the adherence junction that catenates E-cadherin to the actin-microfilament network. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for the location of TRPV 4 in human bladder urothelium. TRPV 4 is molecularly connected to adherence junctions on the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> membrane. TRPV 4 coupling to a rigid intracellular and intercellular structural network would agree with the hypothesis that TRPV 4 can be activated by bladder stretch...|$|E
40|$|The morphometric {{differences}} between the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> in the voided urine of 24 patients with grade I and grade II bladder tumours were measured. In both wet-fixed Papanicolaou-stained smears as in air-dried Giemsa-stained preparations, the cells in the grade I tumours are larger and have more pronounced anisocytosis and a smaller nucleus to cytoplasm area (N/C) ratio. Although absolute dimensions of cells and nuclei in the two preparatory technique differ significantly, the average N/C ratios are similar. In both methods almost all grade I tumours have average N/C cell size ratios of less than 0. 6 and grade II tumours more than 0. 6. Morphometrically <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> could not be distinguished from cells exfoliated from grade I bladder tumours. The results indicate that it is feasible to classify bladder tumours using the morphometric values of the exfoliated <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> alone...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the proliferation quality of mouse <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> on 3 natural matrixes of human amniotic membrane (AM), peritoneum, and omentum, and to compare them with collagen matrix. Materials and Methods: Mouse <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> were isolated by collagenase IV, and the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> (10 5 cells per milliliter) were cultured on the AM, peritoneum, omentum, and collagen. The pattern of growth and asymmetric unit membrane formation were analyzed by histologic examination and immunocytochemistry on the detached urothelium with pancytokeratin and uroplakin III, respectively. Electron micrographs were taken and cell layers, organelles, desmosomes, and junctions were studied. Results : Immunocytochemistry of cultivated <b>cells</b> confirmed the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> phenotype. Up to 4 cell layers were obtained on the AM and 1 to 2 layers on the peritoneum. Distribution of the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> on the omentum was not favorable, which was due to its large pores. Cell proliferation started later on the AM (7 th day) compared to collagen (3 rd day). Also, apoptosis started later on the AM (after 14 days) compared to collagen (7 days). Conclusion : These results showed that the AM can act as a cell carrier for culture of the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> and its exceptional properties such as having various growth factors, availability, and cost-effectiveness make it a unique biological matrix for urothelial culture. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{differentiated}} superficial {{cells of}} the urothelium restrict urine flow into the bladder wall. We have demonstrated that <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from bladders of patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) fail to release PGE 2 in response to tryptase. This study examines the expression of PGE 2 synthesis and degradation enzymes in urothe-lial cells during differentiation. Materials and Methods Wemeasured immunoprotein expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), prostaglandin E 2 synthase (PGES) and 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) in human urothe-lial cells and in immortalized <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from the bladders of IC/PBS patients or normal subjects during stratification and differentiation produced by increased calcium and fetal bovine serum (Ca/FBS) in the culture medium for 1, 3 and 7 days. Results PGES immunoprotein expression increased during differentiation in normal and IC/PBS <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> COX- 2 expression also increased in cells from normal patients following dif-ferentiation. Remarkably, no COX- 2 expression was detectable in <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from 3 out of 4 IC/PBS patients. PGDH immunoprotein expression decreased in normal cells after 1 and 3 days of Ca/FBS addition, but returned to normal after 7 days. PGDH ex-pression was unchanged during differentiation at 1 and 3 days, but was more than 2 -fol...|$|R
40|$|The {{classification}} of poorly differentiated carcinomas involving the renal medullary/sinus region might be challenging on conventional histomorphologic grounds alone. However, delineation of high-grade renal cell carcinomas such as collecting duct (Bellini) carcinoma from <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> {{carcinoma of the}} renal pelvis is critical, as it conveys important therapeutic implications. We assessed the so far neglected differential diagnostic role of protein gene product 9. 5, a neuropeptide involved in intracellular proteolysis, in terms of differentiating invasive <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas of the renal pelvis from high-grade renal cell carcinomas infiltrating the renal medullary/sinus region. To this aim, 21 invasive <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas of the renal pelvis and 27 high-grade renal cell carcinomas (8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation and 5 type 1 and 7 type 2 papillary renal cell carcinomas as well as 7 collecting duct carcinomas) were stained with antibodies directed against protein gene product 9. 5, CD 10, vimentin, CEA, p 63, CK 5 / 6, CK 7, CK 20, PAX 2, PAX 8, CD 117 (c-Kit), AE 1 / 3, α-methyl CoA racemase, actin, and desmin. Briefly, strong protein gene product 9. 5 expression was observed in 6 (86 %) of 7 collecting duct carcinomas, 8 (67 %) of 12 papillary renal cell carcinomas, and 2 (25 %) of 8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation. Conversely, none of the 21 <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas investigated showed protein gene product 9. 5 expression. Our findings suggest that protein gene product 9. 5, particularly if {{used in conjunction with}} p 63 and CK 5 / 6, might be helpful in differentiating high-grade renal cell carcinomas from <b>urothelial</b> <b>cell</b> carcinomas of the renal pelvis, whereas its specificity with respect to the histologic subtyping of renal cell carcinomas seems to be low. However, because of the limited number of study cases enrolled in our investigation, our findings need to be validated in the future...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the intracellular signaling mechanisms underlying the release of nitric oxide (NO) evoked by �-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists in urinary bladder strips and cultured bladder <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> from adult rats. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that inducible NO synthase and endothelial NOS but not neuronal NOS genes were expressed in <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> NO release from both <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and bladder strips was decreased (37 – 42 %) {{in the absence of}} extracellular Ca 2 � (100 �M EGTA) and was ablated after incubation with BAPTA-AM (5 �M) or caffeine (10 mM), indicating that the NO production is mediated in part by intracellular calcium stores. NO release was reduced (18 – 24 %) by nifedipine (10 �M) and potentiated (29 – 32 %) by incubation with the Ca 2 � channel opener BAYK 8644 (1 – 10 �M). In addition, �-AR-evoked NO release (isoproterenol; dobutamine; terbutaline; 10 � 9 to 10 � 5 M) was blocked by the NOS inhibitors N G-nitro-L-arginine methy...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Golgi apparatus in the surface cells of mouse urinary bladder during embryonic development was investigated by electronmicroscopic cytochemistry. The distributions of NADPase and TPPase activities were studied in the urinary bladder during day 15 to day 18 of gestation. At the early embryonic stage, {{the products of the}} NADPase and TPPase reactions were visible exclusively in 1 to 2 medial and/or trans Golgi saccules. The strongest increment of NADPase and TPPase positive Golgi cisternae was detected at day 17 when the activity of the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> was very prominent. At this age, NADPase activity was detected also in lysosomes and on the apical surface of the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> The highest distribution pattern of NADPase and TPPase activities observed at this stage rapidly decreases at day 18 of fetal life. The results suggest that the organization of the Golgi apparatus reflected the intensity of the processes occuring in the <b>urothelial</b> <b>cells</b> during gestation...|$|R
40|$|Cholesterol content {{can vary}} {{distinctly}} between normal and cancer cells, with elevated levels in cancer cells. Here, we investigated cholesterol sequestration with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD), and pore-formation with the ostreolysin A/pleurotolysin B (OlyA/PlyB) protein complex that binds to cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains. We evaluated {{the effects on}} viability of T 24 invasive and RT 4 noninvasive human <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells</b> and normal porcine <b>urothelial</b> (NPU) <b>cells.</b> Cholesterol content strongly correlated with cancerous transformation, as highest in the T 24 high-grade invasive <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells,</b> and lowest in NPU cells. MCD treatment induced prominent cell death of T 24 cells, whereas OlyA/PlyB treatment resulted in greatly decreased viability of the RT 4 low-grade noninvasive carcinoma cells. Biochemical and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that MCD and OlyA/PlyB induce necrotic cell death in these cancer cells, while viability of NPU cells was not significantly affected by either treatment. We conclude that MCD is more toxic for T 24 high-grade invasive <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells,</b> and OlyA/PlyB for RT 4 low-grade noninvasive <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells,</b> and neither is toxic for NPU cells. The cholesterol and cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains in <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells</b> thus constitute a selective therapeutic target for elimination of <b>urothelial</b> cancer <b>cells...</b>|$|R
