5000|$|Plans {{to replace}} the Tajewala Barrage {{had been in the}} works since the early 1970s but an {{agreement}} between the governments of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh (which share the water it diverts) was not made until July 1994. Although the barrage was completed in late 1999, it was not operational until March 2002 because of work delays. The barrage is 360 m long and its spillway is composed of ten main floodgates along with five <b>undersluices</b> on its right side and three on its left. The maximum discharge of the barrage is [...] (1 in 500 year flood).|$|E
50|$|The dam was {{originally}} built by Karikalan about 1500 years ago.The {{idea behind the}} construction of the dam was to divert the river to the delta districts thereby boosting irrigation. The dam was re-modeled by the British during the 19th century. In 1804, Captain Caldwell, a military engineer, was appointed by the British to make a study on the Kaveri river and promote irrigation for the delta region. He found that a large amount of water passed onto the Kollidam leaving behind a small volume for irrigation purposes. Caldwell initially proposed a solution by raising the dam and hence raised the dam stones to a height of 69 cm, thus increasing the capacity of the dam. Following this, Major Sim proposed the idea of <b>undersluices</b> across the river with outlets leading to the Kollidam River (Coleroon) thus preventing formation of silt. The Lower Anaicut built by Sir Arthur Cotton in 19th century CE across Coleroon, the major tributary of Cauvery, {{is said to be a}} replicated structure of Kallanai.|$|E

5000|$|The barrage is 455 m {{long and}} {{sits at the}} head of a 23000 km2 {{catchment}} area. It contains 15 spillways gates and 7 <b>undersluice</b> gates, all 18 m wide. The flood discharge of the barrage is [...] Adjacent to it, on the right bank of the river, the barrage diverts water into the Upper Ganges Canal. The canal system is immense, consisting of 6450 km of main canal and branches, providing irrigation for up to 2023000 ha. At a distance of 13 km down the main canal, water reaches the 20.4 MW Pathri Power Plant at [...] It contains three 6.8 MW Kaplan turbine-generators and has a design hydraulic head of 9.75 m. Further down the main canal, and south of Manglaur, is the 9.3 MW Mohammadpur Power Plant at [...] It contains three 3.1 MW Kaplan turbine-generators and has a design head of 5.79 m. The design discharge of both power plants is about [...] Although both power plants are owned by Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd., canal flows are regulated by the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department.|$|R
40|$|Different design {{criteria}} for successful flushing of hydropower headworks have been evaluated. Main {{focus has been}} on handling of floating debris for small hydropower plant in Norway, as well as sediment handling for run of the river-projects in sediment-carrying rivers. As a new way of cleaning intake screens clogged by debris, the concept of backflushing has been investigated. The intake screen, called trash rack, is then cleaned by a reveresed water flow over a short period of time, and the clogged material flushed out thorugh a flushing pipe. A physical test tank was developed to evaluate parameters for a successful flushing of trash racks with different degrees of clogging. A test device was developed to evaluate adhesion, i. e. the level of friction between clogged material and the trash rack. The required gross water velocity over a trash rack during flushing for detaching of the clogged material was found to be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 m/s, with a typical value of 0. 12 m/s. The clogged material tend to resist a maximum limit of pressure difference over the trash rack before it detaches. Results are showing a pressure difference resistance in the range of 0. 05 - 0. 10 meterWater Column (mWC). The pressure difference prove hard to obtain as parts of the trashrack is cleaned. Hence, a flushing gate should be opened at a high rate to obtain the best flushing efficiency. A field trip to Nepal has been conducted to gain experience in sediment handling, and to work with physical models at HydroLab Pvt Ltd in Kathmandu. Observed intake solutions have been evaluated both against existing theory and results from a physical model study. It has been documented through a model test series that the flushing ability of an <b>undersluice</b> gate is limited to only a few meters upstream of the flushing gate. The limit for flushing by bed transport has been tested in a model, and compared to theory for evaluating initial movement of the sediment bed. Experiments are supporting that Shield s theory of critical shear stress can be used to predict the occurrence of bed movement. Design and operation of settling basins have been investigated, together with the appurtenant different strategies for flushing. The possibility of applying the concept of backflushing of trash racks for headworks arrangements including sediment settling basins have been evaluated. For projects where the trash rack can be located upstream of the settling basin, the combination seems feasible, as parts of the water storage in the settling basin could be used for the backflushing. However, the trash rack should be placed downstream of the settling basins for most Himalayan headworks arrangements, which makes backflushing impossible...|$|R
