We study the expressive power of FOcard on the class of languages of ranked, finite, labelled trees with successor relations. Our first main result characterises the class of FOcard-definable tree languages in terms of algebraic closure properties of the tree languages. As it can be effectively checked whether the language of a given tree automaton satisfies these closure properties, we obtain a decidable characterisation of the class of regular tree languages definable in FOcard. Our second main result considers first-order logic with <b>unary</b> <b>relations,</b> successor relations, and two additional designated symbols < and + that must be interpreted as a linear order and its associated addition. Such a formula is called addition-invariant if, for each fixed interpretation of the <b>unary</b> <b>relations</b> and successor relations, its result is independent of the particular interpretation of < and +. We show that the FOcard-definable tree languages are exactly the regular tree languages definable in addition-invariant first-order logic. Our proof techniques involve tools from algebraic automata theory, reasoning with locality arguments, and the use of logical interpretations. We combine and extend methods developed by Benedikt and Segoufin (ACM ToCL, 2009) and Schweikardt and Segoufin (LICS, 2010) ...|$|R

40|$|To {{ensure the}} re-use of domain ontologies the usual {{approach}} {{relies on a}} pivot language, e. g., Kif, into and from which the domain ontology is translated. This requires several distinct trans-lators for the different target Knowledge Based System (KBS).

It relies on a Domain Ontology Description Lan-guage which allows writing domain ontologies in a declarative manner and a Model Ontology Description Language, a meta-language which allows a declarative description of any model based on frames, objects, relations, and De-scription Logic. Both languages are based on Kif binary and <b>unary</b> <b>relations.</b> Starting from these relations, we have identified {{a certain number of}} concepts which enable a user to per-form explicitly a semantic enrichment of binary and <b>unary</b> <b>relations.</b> We introduce the con-cept of meta-relation which allows the expres-sion of knowledge on the relations themselves.
