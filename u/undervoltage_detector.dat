40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of the power subsystem for the Atmospheric Explorer spacecraft are discussed. The additional functional redundancy which was added in several component areas to improve the overall subsystem reliability is analyzed. The battery charging technique has been modified to include third electrode overcharge control. The automatic removal of all battery charge is provided to correct abnormally high battery voltages. An <b>undervoltage</b> <b>detector</b> has been added which removes all nonessential spacecraft loads when the battery voltage falls below a given level. All automatic functions can be over-ridden by ground command...|$|E
40|$|The NCP 1562 x is {{a family}} of voltage mode {{controllers}} designed for dc-dc converters requiring high-efficiency and low parts count. These controllers incorporate two in phase outputs with an overlap delay to prevent simultaneous conduction and facilitates soft switching. The main output is designed for driving a forward converter primary MOSFET. The secondary output is designed for driving an active clamp circuit MOSFET, a synchronous rectifier on the secondary side, or an asymmetric half bridge circuit. The NCP 1562 family reduces component count and system size by incorporating high accuracy on critical specifications such as maximum duty cycle limit, <b>undervoltage</b> <b>detector</b> and overcurrent threshold. Two distinctive features of the NCP 1562 are soft-stop and a cycle skip current limit with a time threshold. Soft-stop circuitry powers down the converter {{in a controlled manner}} if a severe fault is detected. The cycle skip detector enables a soft-stop sequence if...|$|E

40|$|The NCL 30051 is a {{combination}} of PFC and half−bridge resonant controllers optimized for off−line LED lighting solutions. This device integrates all the features needed to implement a highly efficient and small form factor LED Driver/Power Supply. It contains a critical conduction mode (CrM) power factor correction (PFC) boost controller and a half−bridge resonant controller with a built−in 600 V driver. The half−bridge stage operates at a fixed frequency, greatly simplifying the control implementations. The output (current or voltage) regulation is achieved by adjusting the PFC stage output voltage − based on a control signal generated external to the NCL 30051. This device includes an enable input on the PFC feedback pin, open feedback loop protection and PFC overvoltage and <b>undervoltage</b> <b>detectors.</b> Other features included in the NCL 30051 are a 600 V startup circuit and an adjustable frequency oscillator with a divide by 2 circuit to assure true symmetric duty ratio. The controllers are properly sequenced, simplifying system design...|$|R
