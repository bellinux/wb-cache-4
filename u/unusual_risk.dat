40|$|Qualifications to {{an audit}} report {{may provide the}} basis for an auditor's claim that the user was warned about an <b>unusual</b> <b>risk.</b> If audit {{qualifications}} highlight changes in firm risk that are material, then the announcement of a qualification should be associated with an increase in the risk of the affected firm. In this paper, we test this proposition. Our initial tests do not detect a shift in systematic risk around qualification announcements; however, subsequent analysis shows that firms announcing recurring material uncertainties have higher levels of systematic risk than firms announcing initial qualifications. Furthermore, we document a significant decrease in systematic risk for firms publicly announcing qualification withdrawals. These results are consistent with announcements of qualification withdrawals providing more timely information to capital market participants than announcements of qualification issuances, which {{are more likely to have}} been pre-empted by alternative sources of information. Our findings also indicate that unsystematic, or firm-specific, risk changes significantly around qualification and withdrawal announcement dates. Although systematic risk is of primary importance to investors, information regarding company-specific risk may assist other outside users (i. e., lenders, regulators, employees, rating agencies, etc.) in evaluating a given firm's ability to satisfy its existing contracts. In total, this paper provides evidence that may be useful to many external parties regarding the association between the material uncertainties that are highlighted in audit reports and changes in firm risk.

This shape seems to be pivotal to its toxicity potential. [8] This fairly novel material can cause <b>unusual</b> <b>risks</b> {{to the health of}} workers following pulmonary exposure in the occupational environment. This study combines literature review of the toxicity potential of graphene materials with different characterizations following pulmonary exposure. The studies use two different exposure techniques namely instillation and inhalation, therefore a comparison was made to see which of the two was a more effective method. Moreover, experimental data from an ongoing study assessing short and long term inflammation and total protein concentration in BAL fluid of Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide(rGO) was included and compared to the results from the literature studies. The results obtained from our study showed that from exposure to rGO there occurred increased inflammation 1 day post exposure, compared to VC and Carbon Black (CB). The inflammation decreased afterwards up to 3 months Whereas, from exposure to GO, there was an increase in inflammation, until Day 2,which then decreased until after 3 months. Further, the results showed that GPs which went up to 25 μm in diameter caused inflammation and frustrated phagocytosis.

40|$|Systems {{of systems}} (SOS) present some <b>unusual</b> <b>risk</b> {{management}} challenges that often are not explicitly addressed, yet can impact the resulting degree of system effectiveness. Potential {{risks associated with}} integrating a diverse set of systems and associated hardware/hardware, hardware/software, and software/software often exist; these are {{made all the more}} difficult by individual systems at different levels of maturity and potential risks that do not exist at the individual system level.

40|$|Nanotechnologies are {{the fastest}} growing {{industry}} sector ever recorded. The US budget for nanotechnology is predicted to reach the 1 trillion dollar threshold in 2015, meaning that nanotechnologies will indeed be larger than all other technologies combined. High aspect ratio nanomaterials (HARN) become increasingly important in the nanotechnology industries, and show great promise, offering many advantages and improvements to a significant range of products. The main feature of HARN is {{the ratio of the}} width of a nanomaterial to its height which can be up to 1000, making the material fibre or platelet- shaped. However, this feature leads to comparison between HARN and other high aspect ratio materials including fibre shaped materials, such as asbestos fibres. Due to the structural similarities between fibrous HARN and asbestos the question arises- do HARN pose the same risk as asbestos? This project aimed to assess the potential of a range of HARN to cause similar pathological effects as asbestos fibres. In order to address this aim a panel of HARN was tested against the fibre pathogenicity paradigm in vivo by examining the pulmonary and pleural responses as well as in vitro to reveal the mechanism of cell/HARN interaction. The first part of the study focused on fibre-shaped HARN, including a panel of distinct length classes of silver nanowires (AgNW) which were injected directly into the pleural space, a target tissue for asbestos related diseases. Injection of high aspect ratio AgNW into the pleural space of mice revealed a length dependent inflammatory response in line with the fibre pathogenicity paradigm which explains fibre pathogenicity. AgNW from 5 μm in length and above led to a significant increase in granulocytes in the pleural space which is similar to that seen after treatment with long amosite asbestos. The use of additional HARN with different compositions allowed us to identify a threshold length for fibre-induced pleural inflammation, which is 5 μm. Frustrated phagocytosis has been stated as an important factor in the initiation of an inflammatory response after fibre exposure. A novel technique, backscatter scanning electron microscopy (BSEM), was used to study frustrated phagocytosis since it provides high-contrast detection of nanowires, allowing clear discrimination between the nanofibres and other cellular features. Using this technique we showed that the onset of inflammation does not correlate with the onset of frustrated phagocytosis, with a fibre length of ≥ 5 μm and ≥ 10 μm, respectively, leading to the conclusion that intermediate length fibres fully enclosed within macrophages as well as frustrated phagocytosis are associated with a proinflammatory state in the pleural space. We further showed that fibres compartmentalise in the mesothelial cells at the parietal pleura as well as in inflammatory cells in the pleural space. To investigate the mechanism of the lengthdependent inflammation caused by AgNW, the NALP 3 inflammasome activation pathway was studied in vitro, however no clear correlation could be identified. We further aimed to investigate the threshold length of fibre-induced inflammation in the lung and the effect of fibre length on macrophage locomotion in an in vitro macrophage migration assay. Pharyngeal aspiration of AgNW resulted in a length dependent inflammatory response in the lungs with threshold at a fibre length of 14 μm. Shorter fibres including 3, 5 and 10 μm elicited no significant inflammation. This identified threshold length differs from that in the pleural space which may be explained by differences in clearance mechanism of deposited fibres from the airspaces compared to the pleural space. Particle clearance from the lung is partly performed by migration of particle-laden macrophages to the mucociliary escalator. We investigated if uptake of longer fibres leads to restricted mobility and showed that exposure to AgNW in the length of ≥ 5 μm resulted in impaired motility of macrophages in the wound closure assay. The second part of the study focused on HARN in the form of nanoplatelet-shaped particles since nanoplatelets may pose an <b>unusual</b> <b>risk</b> to the lungs and the pleural space because of their aerodynamic properties. We first derived the respirability of graphene nanoplatelets (GP) from the basic principles of the aerodynamic behaviour of plate-shaped particles which allowed us to calculate their aerodynamic diameter. This showed that the nanoplatelets, which were up to 25 μm in diameter, were respirable and so would deposit beyond the ciliated airways following inhalation. We therefore utilized models of pharyngeal aspiration and direct intrapleural installation of GP, as well as an in vitro model, to assess their inflammatory potential. These large but respirable GP were inflammogenic in both the lung and the pleural space at an acute timepoint although they decreased in their inflammatory potential over a 6 weeks period. Oxidation of GP in the lung tissue was investigated in order to identify if GP degraded over the 6 week period in the lung tissue and therefore showed reduced inflammogenicity. Raman spectroscopy was used to measure the oxidation state and revealed that no change occurred over the observed timeframe. The mechanism underlying acute GP inflammation was studied in THP- 1 macrophages exposed to GP. These investigations showed that GP exposure led to significant expression of IL- 1 β, which could be blocked via a number of inhibitors related to the NALP 3 inflammasome activation. This study highlights the importance of shape/length of HARN as a driver for in vivo and in vitro inflammogenicity by virtue of their respirable aerodynamic diameter, despite a considerable 2 -dimensional size which leads to an inflammatory response when deposited in the distal lungs and the pleural space. The identification of the threshold length for nanofibre-induced pathogenicity in the pleura and the lung has important implications for the understanding of the structure–toxicity relationship for asbestos-induced mesothelioma. It also contributes to risk assessment by offering a template for production of safer synthetic nanofibres by the adoption of a benign-bydesign approach. The results of this work highlight the importance of testing new HARN to protect workers in nanotechnology industries and the public...|$|E

Such insights include: The great value of careful, informed assessment of preclinical information gleaned from laboratory experiments. By and large, such assessments point the way toward appropriate clinical evaluation. For Viagra, early in its development it was noted that besides exerting a major inhibitory effect on the intended target, the vascular-associated enzyme phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5), the drug also exerts a lesser but definite inhibitory effect on the closely related PDE 6, located in the retina. For this reason, preclinical evaluation of the drug included electroretinography plus postmortem histology. In addition, an extended eye examination was incorporated into clinical protocols. The often chaotic but invaluable information stream that becomes available once marketing approval has been gained and large populations begin to use a drug. False alarms, misattribution, and erroneous information are the order of the day. Nevertheless, as information accumulates, patterns of response clarify and the true nature of special susceptibility for subpopulations, if any, becomes apparent. A role for the astute clinician remains: Subtle changes or <b>unusual</b> <b>risks</b> for subpopulations can be missed entirely for long periods of time. A manifest need for improvement in evaluation of postmarketing side-effects. This need has led to the establishment of a new discipline: pharmacoepidemiology. In ophthalmology, the National Registry of Drug Induced Ocular Side-Effects maintains a constant and invaluable surveillance. Examples are supplied to illustrate each of these major points: Our presentation will include data gleaned from clinical trials plus postmarketing information on the incidence, duration, and type of color vision defects observed at different doses of Viagra...|$|R
40|$|A female {{professional}} orchestra violin player, age 54, with an 8 -year {{history of}} severe left shoulder problems, presented with reproducible, acute, incapacitating left shoulder pain when playing the lowest violin string. This complaint was found caused by compensatory left arm positions for unnoticed finger extensor excursion limitations in a wellhealed scar bed from two dorsal wrist ganglion operations 11 and 13 years before. Immediately after extensor tendon mobilization in the scar bed, the patient could assume a normal playing position, which was pain free, and {{could return to}} orchestral duties without further major shoulder complaints (follow-up of 10 years). The case study presents finger extensor excursion limitations at the wrist as an <b>unusual</b> extra-regional <b>risk</b> factor for a shoulder complaint and analyses the biomechanics linking these limitations to the complaint. The case illustrates the importance of long-term postoperative hand surgery rehabilitation in musicians. © Clinical Rheumatology 2013. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
