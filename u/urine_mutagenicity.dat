40|$|Phosphine {{has been}} claimed to cause {{chromosomal}} damage at exposures {{close to the}} current time weighted average exposure standard of 0. 3 ppm (0. 4 mg/m 3). The current study involved 31 phosphine fumigators and 21 controls during the high fumigation season. All were volunteers and were evaluated for genotoxicity variables, including micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes and <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity.</b> In parallel, all fumigators and 17 controls were evaluated for full haematology, multiple biochemical analysis, whole blood organochlorines, and whole blood and serum cholinesterase activity. The results for micronuclei showed {{no significant differences between}} fumigators and controls, but detected a strong association between age and increased frequency of micronuclei. Measurement of <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> did not show any significant difference between fumigators and controls, but did show increased excretion of mutagens in smokers. All haematological and biochemical variables were within normal ranges, except for some non-specific changes in biochemistry. At monitored occupational exposures of < 2. 4 ppm/h our results show no association between phosphine exposure and genotoxic or toxicological effects in fumigators...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in northern Bohemia to simultaneously evaluate personal exposures to air pollution {{in the form of}} respirable particles containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and biomarkers of exposure, biological effective dose, genetic effects, and metabolic susceptibility. The series of biomarkers included PAH metabolites in urine, <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity,</b> PAH-DNA adducts in white blood cells determined by 32 P-postlabeling, PAH-albumin adducts determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), DNA damage in lymphocytes detected by comet assay, chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, and glutathione S-transferase M 1 (GSTM 1) genotypes. For these studies, a group of women who work outdoors about 30 % of their daily time was selected. In a pilot study, a group of women from a polluted area of the Teplice district (northern Bohemia) was compared with a group of women from a control district of southern Bohemia (Prachatice). In a follow-up repeated-measures study, a group of nonsmoking women from Teplice was sampled repeatedly during the winter season of 1993 to 1994. Personal exposure monitoring for respirable particles (< 2. 5 microns) was conducted for the 24 -hr period before collection of blood and urine. Particle extracts were analyzed for carcinogenic PAHs. In the pilot study and in the follow-up study, a highly significant correlation between individual personal exposures to PAHs and DNA adducts was found (r = 0. 54, p = 0. 016; r = 0. 710, p < 0. 001, respectively). The comet parameter (percentage DNA in tail; %T) correlated with exposures to respirable particles (r = 0. 304, p = 0. 015). The GSTM 1 genotype had a significant effect on urinary PAH metabolites, <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity,</b> and comet parameters (% T and tail moment) when the GSTM 1 genotype was considered as a single factor affecting these biomarkers. Multifactor analysis o variance considering exposure and adjusting the data for GSTM 1, age, and diet showed that the effect of personal exposures to PAHs on the variability of biomarkers (DNA adducts, comet parameters, <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity)</b> might be higher than the effect of the GSTM 1 genotype. These results show the importance of considering all potential factors that may affect the biomarkers being analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} haematological parameters, <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> (on three Salmonella typhimurium strains), and DNA damage (using {{the comet}} assay) in mononuclear leucocytes of farmers {{before and after}} a one-day spraying period of pear and apple trees with the fungicide captan in usual conditions. Methods: Fruit growers were exposed to captan during the 1998 (n =  12) and/or the 2000 spraying seasons (n =  17). Biological samples were collected {{on the morning of}} the day of spraying (S 1), the evening after spraying (S 2), and the morning of the day after (S 3). The UK Predictive Operator Exposure Model (UK-POEM) was used to quantify pesticide exposure intensity. Results: No effect was observed on haematological parameters for these two spraying seasons. Proportions of mutagenic urine samples did not significantly differ between S 1 and S 2 /S 3 sampling points. In contrast with strains TA 97 a and YG 1041 mainly sensitive to frameshift mutations, a positive trend was observed between the difference (S 3 –S 1) of mutagenic power on strain TA 102 detecting base-pair mutations and the exposure predicted value given by UK-POEM, mainly due to parameters related to protective clothing. No significant variations in DNA damage levels were observed between S 1 and S 3, nor were correlations observed with parameters of pesticide exposure. Conclusions: A one-day spraying period with captan and other pesticides does not significantly induce DNA damages in mononuclear leucocytes. In contrast, an inefficient protective clothing could correlate with an increase in <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> as assessed by the TA 102 tester strain...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} of genotoxic hazard in the rubber industry {{was performed in}} 19 male workers and 20 age-matched controls in a local health unit in northern Italy. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were analyzed {{for the presence of}} DNA damage (single-cell microgel-electrophoresis, or comet assay) and for cytogenetic parameters (sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei frequency, and proliferative rate index). The following bioassays were performed in <b>urine</b> samples: a) <b>mutagenicity</b> test and concentration of thioethers as markers of exposure, and b) excretion of D-glucaric acid and 6 -beta-hydroxycortisol (related to 17 -hydroxycorticosteroid excretion) as indicators of the inductive status of the microsomal enzyme system (phase-I). The exposed subjects showed statistically higher mean values of 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids and micronuclei and lower values of 6 -beta-hydroxycortisol than controls, when taking cigarette smoking into account. The comet assay showed higher values for migration distance in exposed subjects than controls, although the differences were not significant at a p-value of 0. 05. These findings suggest that industrial exposure in the rubber processing industry may cause genetic damage and may modify the activity level of some enzymes; these results should be considered with caution due to the small number of subjects enrolled...|$|R
40|$|Urines from {{patients}} administered mutagenic antineoplastic drugs were significantly mutagenic in the Ames assay, and hence may pose a genotoxic hazard to hospital personnel {{or family members}} caring for the patient. The urines were tested for mutagenicity in several different strains of Salmonella typhimurium that were uvr positive or negative (TA 98, TA 100, TA 102, UTH 8413, UTH 8414). The urines were fractionated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the fractions assayed for mutagenicity in the strains in which the whole urine was mutagenic. Only fractions of urines containing the parent compound (cisplatin, doxorubicin, or mitomycin) were mutagenic; no other fraction showed significant <b>mutagenicity.</b> However, <b>urine</b> containing cyclophosphamide had two fractions that were mutagenic. One fraction, the fraction containing cyclophosphamide, required metabolic activation for mutagenicity. The other fraction did not require activation for mutagenicity. ^ The chemical and mutagenic stability of these urines at room temperature was assayed over a 14 day period. The parent compound degraded within the first seven days, but the urines remained mutagenic. Cis-platinum was chemically stable in the urine; however, the <b>urine</b> decreased in <b>mutagenicity.</b> The decrease was probably the result of stable ligands binding to the platinum. ^ Inactivation methods were developed to reduce the genotoxic hazard. Urine containing cisplatin was inactivated by complexing the cisplatin with diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC). Oxidation with NaOCl of urines containing mitomycin and doxorubicin (sodium thiosulfate must {{be added to the}} doxorubicin urine) results in mutagenic inactivation. Inactivation of urine containing cyclophosphamide requires oxidation with alkaline potassium permaganate and trapping of active degradation products with sodium thiosulfate. Urines containing these drugs can be inactivated, but not always by the same method that inactivates the drug alone in solution. Therefore, in the future development of inactivation methods, both chemical and mutagenic assays are necessary to determine effectiveness. Methods of inactivation of mutagenic excreta developed in this study are both effective and practical. ...|$|R
40|$|Blood {{samples were}} {{obtained}} from a population of refinery workers representing different age groups. Sixty six men with low average exposure to benzene and 33 male controls were investigated. An examination of cell cycle kinetics and sister chromatid exchange was carried out on control and exposed individuals. No {{significant differences were found}} between groups of individuals varying in their drinking and smoking habits or their exposure to diagnostic x rays. Individuals with the lowest and highest phenol values were examined for <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity,</b> with urinary phenol used here as an indicator of benzene exposure. There was no difference in the number of revertant colonies in strains TA 98 and 100 between the high and low urinary phenol groups. There were also no differences in any of the biochemical measures or haematological parameters investigated in all the individuals except that higher values for mean corpuscular volume were found in exposed than in control individuals. These values, however, were within the normal clinical range...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTobacco toxicant-related {{exposure}} {{reduction is}} an important tool in harm reduction. Cigarette per day reduction (CPDR) occurs as smokers migrate from smoking cigarettes to using alternative tobacco/nicotine products, or quit smoking. Few reports characterize the dose–response relationships between CPDR and effects on exposure biomarkers, especially {{at the low end}} of CPD exposure (e. g., 5 CPD). We present data on CPDR by characterizing magnitudes of biomarker reductions. We present data from a well-controlled, one-week clinical confinement study in healthy smokers who were switched from smoking 19 – 25 CPD to smoking 20, 10, 5 or 0 CPD. Biomarkers were measured in blood, plasma, urine, and breath, and included smoke-related toxicants, <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity,</b> smoked cigarette filter analyses (mouth level exposure), and vital signs. Many of the biomarkers (e. g., plasma nicotine) showed strong CPDR dose–response reductions, while others (e. g., plasma thiocyanate) showed weaker dose–response reductions. Factors that lead to lower biomarker reductions include non-CPD related contributors to the measured response (e. g., other exposure sources from environment, life style, occupation; inter-individual variability). This study confirms CPDR dose-responsive biomarkers and suggests that a one-week design is appropriate for characterizing exposure reductions when smokers switch from cigarettes to new tobacco products...|$|E
40|$|Ba c k g r o u n d: Exposure to {{disinfection}} by-products (DBPs) {{in drinking}} water {{has been associated with}} cancer risk. A recent study (Villanueva et al. 2007; Am J Epidemiol 165 : 148 – 156) found an increased bladder cancer risk among subjects attending swimming pools relative to those not attending. Objectives: We evaluated adults who swam in chlorinated pools to determine whether exposure to DBPs in pool water is associated with biomarkers of genotoxicity. Met h o d s: We collected blood, urine, and exhaled air samples from 49 nonsmoking adult volunteers before and after they swam for 40 min in an indoor chlorinated pool. We estimated associations between the concentrations of four trihalomethanes (THMs) in exhaled breath and changes in micronuclei (MN) and DNA damage (comet assay) in peripheral blood lymphocytes before and 1 hr after swimming; <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> (Ames assay) before and 2 hr after swimming; and MN in exfoliated urothelial cells before and 2 weeks after swimming. We also estimated associations and interactions with polymorphisms in genes related to DNA repair or to DBP metabolism. Re s u l t s: After swimming, the total concentration of the four THMs in exhaled breath was seven times higher than before swimming. The change in the frequency of micronucleated lymphocyte...|$|E
40|$|Reports of {{the health}} effects of {{handling}} cytotoxic drugs and compliance with guidelines for handling these agents are briefly reviewed, and studies using analytical and biological methods of detecting exposure are evaluated. There is little conclusive evidence of detrimental health effects from occupational exposure to cytotoxic drugs. Work practices have improved since the issuance of guidelines for handling these drugs, but compliance with the recommended practices is still inadequate. Of 64 reports published since 1979 on studies of workers' exposure to these drugs, 53 involved studies of changes in cellular or molecular endpoints (biological markers) and 12 described chemical analyses of drugs or their metabolites in urine (2 involved both, and 2 reported the same study). The primary biological markers used were <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity,</b> sister chromatid exchange, and chromosomal aberrations; other studies involved formation of micronuclei and measurements of urinary thioethers. The studies had small sample sizes, and the methods were qualitative, nonspecific, subject to many confounders, and possibly not sensitive enough to detect most occupational exposures. Since none of the currently available biological and analytical methods is sufficiently reliable or reproducible for routine monitoring of exposure in the workplace, further studies using these methods are not recommended; efforts should focus instead on wide-spread implementation of improved practices for handling cytotoxic drugs...|$|E
40|$|Urine {{samples taken}} after work {{and after a}} free weekend from 50 workers {{employed}} in various activities in a chemical plant manufacturing explosives were analysed. On the basis of hygienic surveys, the subjects were divided into three categories of exposure to trinitrotoluene (TNT). The urine analyses consisted of gas chromatographic identification of TNT and its two metabolites, 4 -ADNT and 2 -ADNT, and a determination of the mutagenic activity. Two frame shift detector strains of Salmonella typhimurium were used, TA 98 and TA 98 NR, the latter being deficient in endogenous nitroreductase activity. On the basis of previous results on TNT mutagenicity, no exogeneous metabolic system {{was used to test}} the urine concentrates. Both tester strains showed that the mean urinary mutagenic activity was higher in the after work samples than in post weekend samples from the same subjects, showing that bacterial nitroreductase activity was not significantly responsible for the mutagenicity, although the response was higher with strain TA 98 than with TA 98 NR. The interindividual variation in <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity</b> was high, however, and {{the difference between the two}} sampling times was statistically significant (p less than 0. 05) only for the high exposed group (workers in trotyl foundry and sieve house). Correlation between urinary mutagenicity and concentration of TNT in urine was poor; correlation was significant only with the urinary concentration of 4 -ADNT. The correlation between urinary TNT and both metabolites was good (p less than 0. 001). These results suggest that analysis of 4 -ADNT in urine would be a sufficient biological measure for controlling exposure to TNT...|$|E
40|$|Genotypes {{responsible}} for interindividual differences in ability to activate or detoxify genotoxic agents {{are recognized as}} biomarkers of susceptibility. Among the most studied genotypes are human glutathione transferases. The relationship of genetic susceptibility to biomarkers of exposure and effects was studied especially {{in relation to the}} genetic polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase M 1 (GSTM 1). For this review papers reporting the effect of GSTM 1 genotype on DNA adducts, protein adducts, <b>urine</b> <b>mutagenicity,</b> Comet assay parameters, chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), micronuclei, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase mutations were assessed. Subjects in groups occupationally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzidine, pesticides, and 1, 3 -butadiene were included. As environmentally exposed populations, autopsy donors, coal tar-treated patients, smokers, nonsmokers, mothers, postal workers, and firefighters were followed. From all biomarkers the effect of GSTM 1 and N-acetyl transferase 2 was seen in coke oven workers on mutagenicity of urine and of glutathione S-transferase T 1 on the chromosomal aberrations in subjects from 1, 3 -butadiene monomer production units. Effects of genotypes on DNA adducts were found from lung tissue of autopsy donors and from placentas of mothers living in an air-polluted region. The GSTM 1 genotype affected mutagenicity of urine in smokers and subjects from polluted regions, protein adducts in smokers, SCE in smokers and nonsmokers, and Comet assay parameters in postal workers. A review of all studies on GSTM 1 polymorphisms suggests that research probably has not reached the stage where results can be interpreted to formulate preventive measures. The relationship between genotypes and biomarkers of exposure and effects may provide an important guide to the risk assessment of human exposure to mutagens and carcinogens...|$|E
