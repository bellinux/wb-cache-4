6000|$|His creditor, at {{the hour}} it suited her, {{transferred}} her {{base of operations}} to town, to which impenetrable scene she had also herself retired; and his raising of the first Two Hundred, during five exasperated and miserable months, and then of another Seventy piecemeal, bleedingly, after long delays and under the epistolary whiplash cracked by the London solicitor in his wretched ear even to an effect of the very report of Miss Cookham's tongue--these melancholy efforts formed a scramble up an arduous steep where steps were planted and missed, and bared knees were excoriated, and clutches at wayside tufts succeeded and failed, on a system to which poor Nan could have intelligently entered only {{if she had been}} somehow less ladylike. She kept putting into his mouth the sick quaver of where he should find the rest, the always inextinguishable rest, long after he had in silent rage fallen away from any further payment at all--at first, he had but too blackly felt, for himself, to the still quite possible non-exclusion of some penetrating ray of [...] "exposure." [...] He didn't care a tuppenny damn now, and in point of fact, after he had by hook and by crook succeeded in being able to <b>unload</b> <b>to</b> the tune of Two-Hundred-and-Seventy, and then simply returned the newest reminder of his outstanding obligation unopened, this latter belated but real sign of fight, the first he had risked, remarkably caused nothing at all to happen; nothing at least but his being moved to quite tragically rueful wonder as to whether exactly some such demonstration mightn't have served his turn at an earlier stage.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveDetermine {{the effect}} of loading upon MRI-based mean medial {{femorotibial}} cartilage thickness (mMFT_th) and radiograph-based minimum joint space width (mJSW), and determine loading's effect {{on the relationship between}} these measures. MethodsMRI and radiographs were analyzed of 25 knees in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions. Eight subjects had a Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grade of 0, indicating no evidence of radiographic OA. The rest were KL =  2 or KL =  3, indicating mild to moderate OA. The change from <b>unloaded</b> <b>to</b> loaded conditions was calculated. ResultsJoint space measures decreased from <b>unloaded</b> <b>to</b> loaded conditions for both radiographs (mJSW =  3. 29  mm <b>unloaded</b> <b>to</b> 3. 16  mm loaded, P <  0. 05) and MRI (mMFT_th =  2. 70  mm <b>unloaded</b> <b>to</b> 2. 55  mm loaded P <  0. 001). The mean absolute difference measured from radiographs was larger for the OA group than the control group, at − 0. 20  mm for OA vs + 0. 01  mm for control. Loaded X-ray and loaded MRI joint space values from our study were no better correlated to one another than loaded X-ray and unloaded MRI. ConclusionKnee loading does not add a very significant value to the study of joint space on healthy knees, but loading {{may play a role in}} the study of OA knees. Unloaded MRI assessments of cartilage thickness are as correlated to loaded JSW as to loaded MRI measurements. More study is necessary to determine whether loaded MRI adds significant value to the study of OA progression...|$|R
50|$|Landing craft are {{designed}} to carry troops, vehicles, or cargo from ship to shore under combat conditions, to <b>unload,</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from the beach, and {{to return to the}} ship. They are rugged, with powerful engines, and usually armed. There are many types in today's navies including hovercraft. They will typically have a power-operated bow ramp, a cargo well and after structures that house engine rooms, pilot houses, and stowage compartments. These boats are sometimes carried by larger ships.|$|E
50|$|Grain hopper {{trailers}} typically {{feature a}} rolling tarp {{on the top}} of the trailer, to enable easy loading of the product to be transported, and also offer protection during transport. They utilize two hoppers on the base of the trailer to <b>unload</b> <b>to</b> product, one servicing the rear half of the trailer, the other the front half. The output of these hoppers is usually controlled by a sliding plate on the base of the hopper, controlled by a user-operated crank handle.|$|E
5000|$|In 1802, a roadway {{was built}} to develop the port, which {{extended}} by 1835, to a breakwater with a navigational lighthouse at its end. The development, included new basins for ships to <b>unload</b> <b>to</b> barges which carried goods further up the river. This development moved the town into {{the area of the}} city which is now called the district of [...] "Little Morocco". This development made the town the base for the passenger steamships of the Nantes-Saint-Nazaire line, as well as making the town the alternate port for ships which could not access Nantes.In 1856, the first wet dock basin was dug in the handle of [...] "Halluard City", making it possible for ships to moor and turn. This brought about the construction of the town's first railway connection. In 1857, the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans railroad company of Orléans connected Saint-Nazaire to Nantes. In 1862, the first transatlantic telegraph lines were installed from France towards South America, which came ashore at Saint-Nazaire. 1862 also saw the construction of major ship building facilities, including those of Chantier Scott, which launched of the first French constructed ships with metal hulls (the company went bankrupt in 1866). In 1868, Saint-Nazaire became a sub-prefecture in lieu of the town of Savenay. A second dock basin was created at Penhoët in 1881, to allow the servicing of larger ships, but a lock gate built to access it cut the town in two, thus creating Old Saint-Nazaire and an artificial island called [...] "Little Morocco".|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the vascular transport of exogenously applied proteins and compared their delivery to various aerial {{parts of the}} plant with carboxy fluorescein dye. Alexafluor tagged bovine serum albumin (Alexa-BSA) moves at a low level to upper parts of the plant and unloads to the apoplast. Alexafluor tagged Histone H 1 (Alexa-Histone) moves rapidly throughout the plant and is retained in the phloem and phloem parenchyma. Both Alexa-Histone and -BSA were exported from leaf veins class II and III but they unloaded completely into the leaf lamina with barely any residual fluorescence left inside the leaf veins. Fluorescein tagged hepatitis C virus core protein (fluorescein-HCV) moves more rapidly than BSA through the plant and was restricted to the leaf veins. Fluorescein-HCV failed to <b>unload</b> <b>to</b> the leaf lamina. These combined data {{suggest that there is}} not a single default pathway for the transfer of exogenous proteins through the plant. Specific protein properties appear to determine their destination and transport properties within the phloem...|$|E
40|$|Hydro-mechanical {{behaviors}} of a saturated clay with various strain-rate and different stress histories are investigated {{through a series}} of consolidated-undrained and K 0 consolidated undrained (K 0 CU) tests which were conducted on reconstituted specimens. The samples were taken from an excavation site in Macau and reconstituted in the laboratory to provide homogenous specimens. A total of four CU tests and four K 0 CU tests were undertaken on 38 mm diameter samples. The samples were saturated first by use back pressure saturation method (back pressure 200 kPa), after saturation, they were loaded to a confining stress 400 kPa and then <b>unload</b> <b>to</b> 50 kpa, 100 kPa, 200 kPa, 400 kPa (OCR= 8, 4, 2, 1) and finally were sheared at constant shear rate (0. 1 %/h, 1 %/h, 10 %/h) to failure. In this research the responses of marine clay under various strain rates under different OCRs on the strain-rate effects will be discussed, parameters for accounting the strain-rate effects on undrained shear strength will be proposed...|$|E
40|$|Sheet metal {{formability}} is conventionally {{assessed in}} a two-dimensional plot of principal strains or stresses {{in comparison to}} a forming limit curve. This method of assessment implicitly assumes that the forming limit is isotropic in {{the plane of the}} sheet. While the assumption of isotropy in the forming limit is perhaps a good engineering approximation, it is intrinsically inconsistent with the use of material models that are anisotropic. Since the trend today is to utilize models with full anisotropy in order to more accurately capture the physics of material behavior, the issue of anisotropy of forming limits must also be addressed. The challenge is that the forming limit is no longer defined by a curve but requires the definition of a surface in strain or stress space, and therefore it is no longer appropriate to view these limits with the convenience of two-dimensional diagrams. Furthermore, recent developments in the characterization of sheet forming limits under non-proportional loading suggest that is advantageous to view forming limit behavior in terms of stresses rather than strains, a view that is adopted in this paper. A solution to the challenge of assessing formability for an anisotropic material is proposed that rescales the stresses by a factor so that the scaled stresses have the same relationship to a single forming limit curve in a 2 D plot in stress-space, as the actual stresses have to the true anisotropic forming limit in 3 D space. The rescaling enables engineers to accurately view the formability of all the elements at the same time for a given finite element analysis of an application. This paper also discusses other challenges of using stresses in the assessment of formability, focusing on an analysis of the 2 -Stage Forming Benchmark highlighted in the Numisheet ' 99 Conference. Stresses are found in this application to <b>unload</b> <b>to</b> non-critical values after reaching critical levels earlier in a forming process, which suggests that a full integration of the stress-based forming limit criterion with FE simulation is required to detect critical states that may temporarily occur during the forming process...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the evolution of}} intrinsic permeability of Indiana Limestone obtained from testing cylindrical samples subjected to isotropic confining pressure. The cylindrical samples measured 200 mm in height and 100 mm in diameter and were subjected to confining pressure ranging from 5 MPa to 60 MPa. The permeability was determined by subjecting the sample to a constant hydraulic gradient perpendicular to the bedding direction. Three different types of tests were performed: partial-loading and <b>unloading</b> in cycles <b>to</b> a the peak load of 60 MPa, monotonic loading to peak value of 60 MPa, followed by complete <b>unloading</b> <b>to</b> 5 MPa and reloading, monotonic loading to a confining pressure less than 60 MPa and <b>unloading</b> <b>to</b> the reference confining pressure of 5 MPa. It was observed that significant irreversible reductions in permeability took place. Three model curves are proposed to describe this permeability change for the loading, unloading and reloading paths. The results of the research indicate that only one data set from the third test was necessary to develop the model that accurately matched {{the second and third}} test...|$|R
