40|$|Background: Angiogenesis is {{essential}} for development, growth and advancement of solid tumors. Cyclooxygenase (cox) - 2 is recognized as an angiogenic factor in various tumors. This prompted us to study the clinical implications of cox- 2 expression and angiogenesis in <b>uterine</b> endometrial <b>cancers.</b> Patients and methods: Fifty patients underwent curative resection for <b>uterine</b> endometrial <b>cancers.</b> In <b>uterine</b> endometrial <b>cancers,</b> cox- 2 levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay, and the localization and counts of microvessels were determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: There was a significant correlation between microvessel counts and cox- 2 levels in <b>uterine</b> endometrial <b>cancers.</b> Cox- 2 localized in the cancer cells, {{but not in the}} stromal cells of <b>uterine</b> endo-metrial <b>cancer</b> tissues. Cox- 2 levels decreased with the advancement. Furthermore, cox- 2 levels sig-nificantly correlated with VEGF levels in <b>uterine</b> endometrial <b>cancers.</b> Conclusions: VEGF associated with cox- 2 might work on angiogenesis at an early status in growth. Therefore, long-term administration of cox- 2 inhibitors might be effective in the suppression of recurrent initiation of <b>uterine</b> endometrial <b>cancers</b> after curative resection.

40|$|Angiogenesis {{contributes}} to the growth and secondary spreading of solid tumours. Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) is identified as such an angiogenic factor. In the present study, the prognosis of the patients with high PD-ECGF <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers</b> was worse than those with low PD-ECGF cancers, and PD-ECGF expression correlated with cellular proliferation and with vascular density and venous invasion in <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers.</b> Therefore, PD-ECGF might contribute {{to the growth of}} <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers</b> via angiogenesis related to vascular spreading. Furthermore, PD-ECGF and its mRNA had a wide range and were highly expressed in <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers,</b> especially squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of clinical stage. Therefore, PD-ECGF in <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers</b> might play a role of basic angiogenesis in all processes of advancing of <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers.</b> This indicates that 5 ′-deoxy- 5 -fluorouridine might be highly effective in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, which possesses a high activity of thymidine phosphorylase to convert 5 ′-deoxy- 5 -fluorouridine to 5 -fluorouracil, and that some angiogenic inhibitors of new capillary formation might be effective in the inhibition of tumour growth and spreading associated with angiogenesis. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lymph node {{status is}} an {{important}} prognostic factor and a criterion for adjuvant therapy in <b>uterine</b> <b>cancers.</b> While detection of micrometastases by ultrastaging techniques is correlated to prognosis in several other cancers, this remains {{a matter of debate}} for <b>uterine</b> <b>cancers.</b> The objective of this review on sentinel nodes (SN) in <b>uterine</b> <b>cancers</b> was to determine the contribution of ultrastaging to detect micrometastases. Methods Review of the English literature on SN procedure in cervical and endometrial cancers and histological techniques including hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, serial sectioning, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular techniques to detect micrometastases. Results In both cervical and endometrial cancers, H&E and IHC appeared insufficient to detect micrometastases. In cervical cancer, using H&E, serial sectioning and IHC, the rate of macrometastases varied between 7. 1 % and 36. 3 % with a mean value of 25. 8 %. The percentage of women with micrometastases ranged from 0 % and 47. 4 % with a mean value of 28. 3 %. In endometrial cancer, the rate of macrometastases varied from 0 % to 22 %. Using H&E, serial sectioning and IHC, the rate of micrometastases varied from 0 % to 15 % with a mean value of 5. 8 %. In both cervical and endometrial cancers, data on the contribution of molecular techniques to detect micrometastases are insufficient to clarify their role in SN ultrastaging. Conclusion In <b>uterine</b> <b>cancers,</b> H&E, serial sectioning and IHC appears the best histological combined technique to detect micrometastases. Although accumulating data have proved the relation between the risk of recurrence and the presence of micrometastases, their clinical implications on indications for adjuvant therapy has to be clarified. </p...|$|R

In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but without success. Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), moved to the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she spent the rest of her life there raising the children. She did it from a sense of duty, but she was a stern woman who expected respect, rather than love.

40|$|Summary To {{know the}} {{potential}} of growth, invasion and metastasis of <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancer</b> associated with neovascularization, localization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density in tumours were determined by immunohistochemical staining, the levels of VEGF subtypes were determined by Western blot analysis and by a sandwich enzyme immunoassay, and the levels of VEGF subtype mRNAs were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) – Southern blot analysis in <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers.</b> The relation between VEGF subtype expressions and microvessel density, histological types and clinical stages of <b>uterine</b> cervical <b>cancers</b> was analysed.

50|$|The BARD1/BRCA1 {{interaction}} is disrupted by tumorigenic amino acid substitutions in BRCA1, {{implying that the}} formation of a stable complex between these proteins may be an essential aspect of BRCA1 tumor suppression. BARD1 may be the target of oncogenic mutations in breast or ovarian cancer. Mutations in the BARD1 protein that affect its structure appear in many breast, ovarian, and <b>uterine</b> <b>cancers,</b> suggesting the mutations disable BARD1's tumor suppressor function. Three missense mutations, each affecting BARD1's BRCT domain, are known to be implicated in cancers: C645R is associated with breast and ovarian cancers, V695L is associated with breast cancer, and S761N is associated with breast and <b>uterine</b> <b>cancers.</b> BARD1 expression is upregulated by genotoxic stress and involved in apoptosis through binding and stabilizing p53 independently of BRCA1.|$|R
