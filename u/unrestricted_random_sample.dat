40|$|Background: Due to {{the limited}} {{availability}} of data related to anemia in hospitalized children, this research was conducted to study the occurrence, morphological patterns, distribution in different age groups, sex, and severity of anemia among children aged 6 months- 12 years. Setting: Inpatients in department of pediatrics at a multispecialty hospital, Bangalore. Study Design: Descriptive cross sectional study from Oct, 2011 to Sep, 2012. Materials and Methods: Ethical clearance {{was obtained from the}} ethical committee of the hospital as per 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. <b>Unrestricted</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> method was used to select the study group consisting of 882 children between the age of 6 months and 12 years. After obtaining the consent, data were obtained and statistically analyzed using statistical tools like mean, median, standard deviation, and Chi-square test. Results: Out of 882 children selected, 642 (72. 79 %) were anemic, out of which a majority of 629 (98 %) children suffered from nonhemoglobinopathies and a meagre 13 (2 %) suffered from hemoglobinopathies. Children in the age group of 6 months- 1 year were most affected with nonhemoglobinopathies (33 %). Moderate degree of anemia (hemoglobin = 7 - 9. 9 g/dL) was the commonest grade of anemia (80 %), while microcytic hypochromic anemia was commonest morphological type of anemia (48 %). Among hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia major was the most common (69 %, that is 9 out of 13 patients). Conclusion: The occurrence of anemia among children aged between 6 months and 12 years is high and nonhemoglobinopathies predominate over the hemoglobinopathies...|$|R

40|$|All {{those who}} like {{experimentation}} are sooner or later faced with a need of random selection of elements or objects of interest {{that they want to}} study (persons, patients, animals, cells, etc.). Randomization, a basic requirement in appropriate planning of experiment, may be performed either to select series of randomly assigned elements/objects or to allocate the studied objects to a given group, medical or diagnostic procedure, treatment protocol, etc. The principal advantage of random selection is to minimize effects of bias and confounding variables, two fundamental threats known to weaken research credibility. Simple, <b>unrestricted</b> <b>random</b> selection can lead to undesirable imbalance in baseline characteristics, thus affecting any credible reasoning. Restricted randomization (with blocking or stratification) includes procedures used along with <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> that help to achieve balance between study groups in their baseline characteristics or in size.

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>sampling</b> is a {{technique}} for signal acquisition which is gaining popularity in practical signal processing systems. Nowadays, event-driven analog-to-digital converters make <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> feasible in practical applications. A process of <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> is defined by a sampling pattern, which indicates signal sampling points in time. Practical <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> patterns are constrained by ADC characteristics and application requirements. In this paper authors introduce statistical methods which evaluate <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> pattern generators with emphasis on practical applications. Furthermore, the authors propose a new random pattern generator which copes with strict practical limitations imposed on patterns, with possibly minimal loss in randomness of sampling.
