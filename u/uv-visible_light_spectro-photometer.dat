The laser probe beam was passed through interface of cell membrane/culture medium of a cultured human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG 2. Deflection of the laser probe beam, which was induced by changes in concentration gradients due to the active materials movement across the cell membrane, was monitored. When a toxic hazard existed, a living cell {{was expected to be}} killed or injured, or cellular behaviors to be changed greatly. Then, the changing deflection signal from the living cell would become unchanged or altered in a different way. This was successfully demonstrated with cytotoxity of UV light and H 2 O 2. Most of the cultured HepG 2 cells showed changing deflection signals after 10 min illumination of <b>UV-visible</b> <b>light</b> longer than 370 nm, while almost all HepG 2 cells showed unchanged deflection signal after 10 min illumination of <b>UV-visible</b> <b>light</b> with wavelength longer than 330 nm.
