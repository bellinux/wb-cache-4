5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is <b>used,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would go for a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} hold the games at the Shenton Park Annexe of the Royal Perth Hospital but this was abandoned due the need for temporary buildings. The Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in the suburb of Claremont was <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had an oval and buildings for accommodation and events. A major advantage of the venue was that all facilities were on one level. There was no suitable facility for basketball and after much debate a wooden court was laid on a sand foundation {{in front of the}} main grandstand. Beatty Park was used for swimming events.|$|E

5|$|Superman Returns {{was shot}} using Panavision's Genesis digital camera. Production {{designer}} Guy Hendrix Dyas {{was influenced by}} Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters {{for the design of}} the Daily Planet. ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences, but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor. A total of 1,400 visual effects shots were created. The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer-generated imagery was <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots. A second unit crew traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. The scenes of Metropolis was actually {{a modified version of the}} skyline of Manhattan. Using footage from the original Superman (1978) film as a reference point, Marlon Brando was re-created by Rhythm & Hues using CGI. The opening credits for Superman Returns are presented in an intended recreation of the style used for Superman, again to the accompaniment of John Williams's theme music.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described from Europe in 1789 by German naturalist August Batsch as Peziza citrina. Elias Fries sanctioned this {{name in the}} second volume of his Systema Mycologicum (1821). Jean Louis Émile Boudier transferred the species to Calycella in 1885. Another historical name for the fungus was derived from Johann Hedwig's 1789 Octospora citrina. Fries referred Hedwig's name to Helotium in 1846, and for several decades the fungus was known as either Calycella citrina or Helotium citrinum, depending on which generic concept an author accepted. In a 1974 publication, Richard Korf noted that the generic name Helotium competes with a basidiomycete genus of the same name, and under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the ascomycete version of the name had to be abandoned because the basidiomycete version was sanctioned by Fries in 1832, and thus had priority. He {{also pointed out that}} the generic name Calycella could not be <b>used,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is a synonym of an older name Calycina, which contains species that bear no taxonomic relationship to Helotium citrinum. Accordingly, he formally transferred Helotium citrinum to Bisporella, to produce the new combination Bisporella citrina. Korf further noted that since Bisporella was published by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1884, it had priority over Boudier's 1885 Calycella. Calycella has since been folded into Bisporella.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{otoliths}} accrete {{layers of}} calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix throughout their lives. The accretion rate varies with {{growth of the}} fish – often less growth in winter and more in summer – which results in the appearance of rings that resemble tree rings. By counting the rings, {{it is possible to}} determine the age of the fish in years. Typically the sagitta is <b>used,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is largest, but sometimes lapilli are used if they have a more convenient shape. The asteriscus, which is smallest of the three, is rarely used in age and growth studies.|$|E
25|$|A serious {{design fault}} in these {{locomotives}} was their very high unsprung weight of 33 tons. Geared motors {{had not been}} <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was {{thought they would be}} noisy in the confines of a tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons.|$|E

25|$|A crystal {{detector}} includes a crystal, a special thin wire that contacts the crystal, and the stand that holds those components in place. The most common crystal used {{is a small}} piece of galena; pyrite was also often <b>used,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was a more easily adjusted and stable mineral, and quite sufficient for urban signal strengths. Several other minerals also performed well as detectors. Another benefit of crystals was that they could demodulate amplitude modulated signals. This device brought radiotelephones and voice broadcast to a public audience. Crystal sets represented an inexpensive and technologically simple method of receiving these signals {{at a time when the}} embryonic radio broadcasting industry was beginning to grow.|$|E
25|$|Contracts totaling $31,100,000 were {{finalized}} with McShain and {{the other}} contractors on September 11, and ground was broken for the Pentagon the same day. Among the design requirements, Somervell required the structural design to accommodate floor loads of up to 150 pounds per square foot, which was done in case the building became a records storage facility at some time {{after the end of}} the current war. A minimal amount of steel was <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in short supply during World War II. Instead, the Pentagon was built as a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River, and a lagoon was created beneath the Pentagon's river entrance. To minimize steel usage, concrete ramps were built rather than installing elevators. Indiana limestone was used for the building's façade.|$|E
