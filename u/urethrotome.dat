50|$|At {{this time}} a rigid <b>urethrotome</b> or a {{flexible}} cystoscope/urethrotome combination will be inserted and guided to {{the face of the}} stricture and a small blade towards the tip of the instrument will be deployed using a trigger mechanism to cut the stricture at locations determined by the surgeon. Upon completion of the internal incision(s), the instrument is withdrawn and an appropriately sized Foley catheter will be inserted through the repair and into the urinary bladder, and locked into place by filling its balloon (positioned inside of the bladder near the urethral junction) with sterile water. The Foley catheter serves two purposes, first, it provides drainage of the urine produced in the kidneys, and secondly, it secures the incised areas, holding them open for three to seven days to permit thorough healing of the urethra. The catheter is then attached to a urinary catheter drainage system (large bag or leg bag) via clear polypropylene tubing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research and treatments in 41 children (from two months to 15 years of age) with urethral valves. In all, 16 patients were treated using the endoscopic method, 7 patients by employing the polyethylene <b>urethrotome</b> and 18 patients treated by the proposed method, using a metallic <b>urethrotome.</b> Diagnosis of the urethral valves was done using ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram, urethrocystoscopy, uroflowmetry and cystomanometry. Mathematical modeling was applied to assess the treatment methods. The proposed method, using the metallic <b>urethrotome,</b> was preferable to the endoscopic method...|$|E
50|$|Special {{surgical}} instruments {{were designed for}} lithotomy, consisting of dilators of the canal, forceps and tweezers, lithotomes (stone cutter) and cystotomes (bladder cutter), <b>urethrotomes</b> (for incisions of the urethra) and conductors (grooved probes used as guides for stone extraction). The patient is placed in a special position in a lithotomy operating table, called the lithotomy position (which, curiously, retains this name until the present day, when the same position is used for other unrelated medical procedures).|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of the surgical treatment of the posterior urethral valves (PUV) in 58 children (between 2 months and 15 years of age), between 1998 and 2009. In all, 26 patients were treated using the endoscopic method (EM) and 32 patients were treated by the proposed method, using a metallic <b>urethrotome</b> (MU). Diagnosis of the urethral valves was done using ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram, urethrocystoscopy, uroflowmetry and cystomanometry. Mathematical modeling was applied to assess the treatment methods. The proposed method, using the metallic <b>urethrotome,</b> was preferable to the endoscopic method...|$|E
40|$|Seventy-two {{patients}} {{suffering from}} urethral stricture were treated at our clinic between May 1975 and December 1980. The clinical findings are reported. The common {{causes of the}} urethral stricture were trauma and infections, but iatrogenic (postoperative) cases have recently increased. Optical urethrotomy provided greater dilatation of the urethral stricture than the internal urethrotomy done using a Meisonneuve internal <b>urethrotome.</b> Optical urethrotomy is recommended {{for the treatment of}} urethral strictures because of the high success rate and safety...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{results of}} using the Otis <b>urethrotome</b> as a dilator only in females with lower urinary tract symptoms are reported. Out of 103 patients, 80 % were symptomatically improved or cured at initial follow up and this was maintained at 18 months in 62 % of cases. Optimal, long-term results (78 % improvement or cure) were obtained in the subgroup of patients who had recurrent urinary tract infections. The results compare favourably with those reported following urethrotomy. The advantages of urethral overdilatation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We report 4 {{cases of}} {{complete}} traumatic disruption of urethra treated by endoscopic management, core-through optical internal urethrotomy. A direct vision <b>urethrotome</b> {{was used to}} incise the totally obliterated urethra with transvesical endoscopic guidance and digital rectal or perineal control. Postoperatively, the patients required an average of 1. 3 subsequent urethrotomies. The results were satisfactory in three cases and one case was under observation. All patients were continent and {{three of them were}} potent. We suggest that the endoscopic approach should be considered as an initial procedure for restoring urethral continuity prior to more extensive surgical repair...|$|E
40|$|Many urologists {{have had}} prejudices against {{internal}} urethrotomy without good reason. Only {{a small number}} of patients with urethral stricture has been treated in Japan by internal urethrotomy. Twelve cases of urethral stricture were treated by internal urethrotomy and were followed up from two to eighteen months. Maisonneuve <b>urethrotome</b> was used in combination with catheterization for three weeks to maintain separation of the cut surfaces while epithelialization took place. Complications have been minimal and our results are gratifying. In five cases, urethra has been excellently repaired by only a single procedure. In other five cases, urethra had appeared as wide as healthy one just after the procedure, but a few months later urethrogram revealed an inconsiderable stricture without any complaints. In the remaining two patients, who had recieved regular interval dilatation over a long term, the procedure was proved to be rather ineffective. From our experiences, we believe that internal urethrotomy is a valuable procedure for male urethral stricture, which should be used more widely and it would seem advisable to need much deeper incision for stricture extending over a wide area of the anterior urethra...|$|E
