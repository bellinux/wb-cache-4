The reasoning in Dowling v.

40|$|In {{the case}} of Mattel Inc v Walking Mountain Productions, the toy doll {{manufacturer}} Mattel sought to prohibit a Utah photographer called Thomas Forsythe from producing and selling a series of 78 photographs entitled "Food Chain Barbie". The work had strong social and political overtones. The artist said that he chose to parody Barbie in his photographs {{because he wanted to}} challenge the beauty myth and the objectification of women. He observed: "Barbie is the most enduring of those products that feed on the insecurities of our beauty and perfection-obsessed consumer culture. " The company Mattel argued that the photographs infringed its copyrights, trade marks, and trade dress. It was concerned that the artistic works would erode the brand of Barbie by wrongfully sexualising its blonde paragon of womanhood. However, Lew J of the Central District Court of California granted summary judgment for the photographer. The Court of Appeals upheld this verdict. Pregerson J held that the use of the manufacturer's copyrighted doll in parodic photographs constituted a fair use of copyright works. His Honour held that the use of manufacturer's "Barbie" mark and trade dress did not amount to trade mark infringement or dilution. This article provides a case commentary upon the Court of Appeals decision in Mattel Inc v Walking Mountain Productions, and its wider ramifications for the treatment of artistic parody <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> trade mark <b>law.</b> It contends that the decision highlights the need for reform in Australian jurisprudence and legislation in respect of artistic parody...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{generated}} {{materials are}} ubiquitous and we encounter {{them on a}} daily basis, even though most people are unaware {{that this is the}} case. Blockbuster movies, television weather reports and telephone directories all include material that is produced by utilising computer technologies. Copyright protection for materials generated by a programmed computer was considered by the Federal Court and Full Court of the Federal Court in Telstra Corporation Limited v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd.   The court held that the White and Yellow pages telephone directories produced by Telstra and its subsidiary, Sensis, were not protected by copyright because they were computer-generated works which lacked the requisite human authorship. The Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) does not contain specific provisions on the subsistence of copyright in computer-generated materials. Although the issue of copyright protection for computer-generated materials has been examined in Australia on two separate occasions by independently-constituted <b>Copyright</b> <b>Law</b> Review Committees over a period of 10 years (1988 to 1998), the Committees’ recommendations for legislative clarification by the enactment of specific amendments to the Copyright Act have not yet been implemented and the legal position remains unclear.

40|$|This Article is {{the third}} and final piece of a series of {{articles}} that examine the applicability of intellectual property law to tattoos. The second article in the series, The Enforcement Challenges for Tattoo Copyrights, concluded that copyright owners can and should enforce their rights against users outside of the tattoo artist-customer relationship. This Article explores a different source of intellectual property protection for tattoos: the right of publicity. As tattooing has become increasingly prevalent among celebrities, tattoos have become “one” with the persona of the tattoo bearer. A tattoo that carries the meaning of a celebrity tattoo bearer serves as indicia of that celebrity’s identity. The Article proposes that when a tattoo becomes associated with the meaning of a celebrity’s identity, rather than solely retaining the message of the tattoo itself, the tattoo moves beyond mere protection <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> acquires additional protections under the right-of-publicity laws. This transformation of intellectual property rights is the subject of the Article. Right-of-publicity laws exist in more than thirty of the states in the United States, in common law, by statute, or both. 1 Therefore, assuming a state recognizes the right of publicity, and even if a celebrity (1) owns the identity at issue (validity) and (2) shows unauthorized third-party use of the identity {{in a way that is}} harmful to the commercial value of the identity (infringement), the claim may conflict with First Amendment interests. This Article also considers the various tests employed by courts to accommodate the conflicting interests of the First Amendment and the right of publicity. The Article endorses the Predominant Use test, which properly recognizes the prevalence of mixed commercial and expressive uses for tattoos...|$|R

40|$|Overlaps exist across various doctrines {{in federal}} {{intellectual}} property law. Software can be protected <b>under</b> both <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> patent law; logos can be protected <b>under</b> both <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> trademark <b>law.</b> Design patents provide a particular opportunity {{to consider the}} issue of overlap, as an industrial design that qualifies for design patent protection might also, in particular circumstances, qualify for copyright protection as well as function as protectable trade dress. When an overlap issue arises—that is, when an intellectual property rights holder asserts rights under more than one doctrine—the question then becomes how courts should respond. One response, of course, is that courts should do nothing, {{on the theory that}} the doctrines developed in a way that permit such overlapping rights, and so the courts should continue to enforce them. The opposing response is to argue that overlapping rights make it difficult for intellectual property users to determine the scope of another’s rights, particularly when those rights have different terms or limitations, and so the courts should require intellectual property owners to choose the right they want enforced at the outset. Neither response is entirely satisfying. Without some signal from Congress that it intended to limit the scope of intellectual property rights when overlaps occur, the imposition of restrictions by the courts simply to achieve predictability for users seems problematic. At the same time, courts should not be blind to the difficulties that doctrinal overlap pose for potential defendants and the temptation it presents to intellectual property owners to push for even stronger protection. This Article therefore proposes something of a middle ground. Courts should not require intellectual property owners to elect one form of protection at the outset. But they should be attentive to whether the right asserted in any litigation proceeding aligns with the harm claimed by the plaintiff and, relatedly, should try to devise remedies that address only those harms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Copyright</b> <b>law</b> {{encourages}} {{authors to}} create and share their works with the public by affording them legal protection over their works when published. However, <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> does not give authors absolute rights so as {{to ensure that the}} public will benefit from the works produced by authors. In this way, <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> promotes the progress of arts and science. The importance of maintaining a balance of interests between copyright owners and the public is widely acknowledged and emphasized in international treaties on intellectual property rights {{as well as by the}} courts in case law. The development of digital technologies has brought substantial challenges to <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> The process of copying and sharing of digital works is made extremely easy and at low cost. Copyright owners have thus lobbied for stronger protection <b>under</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> succeeded in doing so. It is therefore crucial to study how <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> accommodates the issues raised by digital technologies and whether it provides a balance of interests between copyright owners and the public in doing so. This thesis examines the application of Malaysian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> in addressing the issues arising in relation to digital technologies and whether it maintains a balance of interests between copyright owners and the public in the digital environment. The advent of digital technologies has raised a wide range of copyright concerns. This thesis looks into the questions in five selected areas, namely, digital appropriation of copyright works, the setting of links on websites, peer-to-peer file sharing, the limitation of liabilities of service providers and legal protection over technological protection measures. This thesis analyzes the Copyright Act 1987, being the statute governing copyright matters in Malaysia. It also makes reference to three main jurisdictions, namely, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, wherever it is necessary <b>and</b> relevant. Malaysian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> is inadequate <b>and</b> insufficient in many ways in addressing the issues in the identified areas. Overall, Malaysian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> tilts in favour of copyright owners at the expense of public interest. This thesis concludes with recommendations on how Malaysian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> may handle the issues raised by digital technologies more adequately and efficiently, with the ultimate object of striking a balance between the interests of copyright owners and the public...|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, {{we provide}} {{an account of}} the burgeoning trend in Australian <b>copyright</b> case <b>law</b> towards a more {{sympathetic}} treatment of copyright users. Traditionally, Australian cases involving internet intermediaries have disregarded the interests of copyright users, treating the fundamental balance as being between protecting creative authors, on the one hand, and promoting technological innovation on the other. Users’ interests were therefore relegated to the sidelines. However, hints of judicial dissatisfaction with the copyright status quo have begun to appear in the case law. In this chapter, we discuss the subtle shifts in the Federal Court’s approach to copyright users as people rather than pirates, beginning around the turn of this last decade in EMI Songs Australia Pty Ltd v Larrikin Music Publishing Pty Ltd [2011] FCAFC 47 and Singtel Optus Pty Ltd v National Rugby League Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) [2012] FCA 34.
