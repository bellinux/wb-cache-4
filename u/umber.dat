5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO2) {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural <b>umber.</b>|$|E

When Smalljon <b>Umber</b> proves that Rickon Stark is captured by presenting Shaggydog's head, Sansa tells Ramsay that he will die the next day and rides off.

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. The spores are {{typically}} 7.5–9 by 7.5–9µm, spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, and thin-walled. Under a microscope, the spores appear hyaline (translucent), and are amyloid—meaning they will turn bluish-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia are 30.5–57 by 8–16µm, four-spored, and not clamped at the base. The margin {{cells of the}} gills are plentiful, spherical, club-shaped or swollen spherically at the tip, hyaline, and measure 13–58 by 8–33µm. The cap cuticle consists of a 130–220µm wide, strongly gelatinised suprapellis (upper layer) and a dense, non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap are made of abundant spherical, elliptic and club-shaped cells that are 21–119 by 14.5–115µm, intermixed with hyphae 4–9µm wide and pale <b>umber</b> in colour, and either arranged irregularly, or with a vertical orientation.|$|E

25|$|From 1905 to 1923 front-line express {{locomotives}} were a dark {{shade of}} <b>umber.</b> Lining was black with a gilt line either side. Cab roofs remained white. Frames were black, wheels <b>umber,</b> and buffer beams returned to signal red. The company's initials were {{painted on the}} tender- or tank-sides (initially 'L.B.& S.C.R.', but after 1911 the ampersand and the R were removed) in gilt. Secondary passenger locomotives had the same livery, but instead of gilt lining chrome yellow paint was used. Goods engines were gloss black with double vermillion lining. Names and numbers were in white letters with red shading. Carriages were initially all olive green with white lining and detailing. From 1911 this changed to plain <b>umber</b> with black lettering picked out with gold shading.|$|E

25|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, many {{pigments}} {{were known}} by the location where they were produced. Pigments based on minerals and clays often bore {{the name of the}} city or region where they were mined. Raw Sienna and Burnt Sienna came from Siena, Italy, while Raw <b>Umber</b> and Burnt <b>Umber</b> came from Umbria. These pigments were among the easiest to synthesize, and chemists created modern colors based on the originals that were more consistent than colors mined from the original ore bodies. But the place names remained.|$|E

25|$|Where the {{dialectic}} nature of Paul Cézanne's {{work had been}} influential between 1908 and 1910 during the expressionistic phase of Cubism, the flat, linear structures of Georges Seurat would capture {{the attention of the}} Cubists from 1911. In addition to the flattened depth of field, the colors (subtle blues, raw <b>umber</b> and burnt sienna) employed in La Femme au Cheval bear a resemblance to the colors of Seurat's 1889–90 Le Chahut and his 1887–88 Parade de Cirque.|$|E

New Jersey–based Thursday signed a multimillion-dollar, multi-album contract with Island Def Jam after their 2001 album, Full Collapse, reached <b>umber</b> 178 on the Billboard 200.

In a February 1978 trade that relieved the financially struggling Indiana Loves of the remainder of their obligation under the two-year $250,000 contract for Vitas Gerulaitis, the Golden Gaters acquired Gerulaitis for cash consideration and then sent him to the New York Apples in exchange for Sandy Mayer.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no other}} 17th-century artist who {{employed}} the exorbitantly expensive pigment lapis lazuli (natural ultramarine) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours <b>umber</b> and ochre should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed. This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer’s understanding of Leonardo’s observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object. This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.|$|E
25|$|No.62 Martello went to Butlins Heads-of-Ayr camp in 1963, and was {{displayed}} alongside 46233 Duchess of Sutherland before being loaned, and then {{sold to the}} museum at Bressingham.

In her Marsh <b>Umber</b> livery numbered 662 with LBSC on her tanks, she has visited several heritage railways in the UK since being returned to traffic. In May 2011 she was repainted in BR black as 32662 with the late BR logo, at Loughborough on the Great Central in readiness to join 32670 and 32678 on the K for the Last Train Commemoration that took place on 11 June 2011.|$|E
