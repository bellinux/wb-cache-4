3000|$|Sustainability {{forms the}} core of {{corporate}} sustainability and is of utmost concern to all the stakeholders. There has been a growing awareness among the corporates to address environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues to contribute towards sustainable development. The development of sustainable organisations by improving environmental and social performance has become a global challenge for businesses around the world (Marrewijk 2003). There have been many studies addressing the need for incorporating sustainability into core business strategy (Dyllick and Hockerts 2002; Salzmann et al. 2005; Weber et al. 2008). Banking sector {{plays a crucial role}} in promoting sustainable development as it acts as an intermediary in the development of economy (Jeucken and Bouma 1999; Scholtens 2009). Prior literature shows that initially sustainable practices of the banks were confined to internal environmental management practices for energy efficiency, less resource consumption, and low carbon emission (Babiak and Trendafilova 2011), later complemented with the integration of environmental issues in lending and financing activities in the banking operations (Scholtens 2006; Johnsen 2003). The paradigm shift in the banks strategies to integrate environment, social and governance (ESG) issues in banking operations is crucial for moving towards sustainable development (van Gelder 2006). The banking sector is increasingly implementing sustainable banking practices as an important tool to address sustainable development issues (IFC 2007). The adoption of innovative sustainable products & services by the banks has witnessed tremendous growth in the recent years (Krosinsky and Robins 2008). The emergence of nonfinancial reporting through BRR, SR, CSR report and the likes, {{in the past two decades}} has been an attempt by the organizations to engage all the stakeholders in information dissemination and communicate nonfinancial performance of the business on environmental & social issues (Khan et al. 2009). Various frameworks, guidelines and standards have been evolved nationally and internationally like National Voluntary Guidelines (in India), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), <b>United</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> (UNGC) principles, ISO 14001 and ISO 26000 which are widely adopted by organisations to improve social & environmental performance (Isaksson & Steimle 2009; Gupta & Mohanty 2014; Mitra & Schmidpeter 2017). Range of studies have been conducted in the field of sustainability reporting especially, in developed and developing economies (see, Willis 2003; Frost et al. 2005; Raman 2006; Roca & Searcy 2012; Khan et al. 2009; Ghosh 2017), but there is scant empirical research on the extent of sustainability reporting by Indian companies. The content of nonfinancial reporting particularly in the Indian banking sector too is understudied. It is in this context, this study attempts to answer following questions. How the banks in India report their sustainable practices? Is there any variation in the sustainability reporting practices of PSBs and private sector banks in India? [...]...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed some light on {{understanding}} why companies adopt environmentally responsible behavior and what impact this adoption has on their performance. This is an empirical study that focuses on the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> (UN) <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> (GC) initiative as a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mechanism. A survey was conducted among GC participants, of which 29 responded. The survey relies on the anticipated and actual benefits noted by the participants in the GC. The results, while not conclusive, indicate that companies have more than one reason for adopting environmentally responsible behavior and that ethical and economic reasons co-exist. In terms of performance, the impact of participation in the GC seems to be particularly high in securing network opportunities and improved corporate image. The results indicate that companies that have participated many years in the GC, have submitted the most projects and have attended the most GC meetings also regard their CSR involvement as having had a strong, positive influence on their market performance. GC participation does not result in significant cost advantages, but this does not seem to have been regarded as a goal anyway. Costs seem to be affected to a large extent by existence of in-house research and development and the capability of developing environmentally sound technologies. Overall, the company receives both ethical and economic benefits from joining the GC...|$|R

It now has over 12, 000 participants [URL]. In 2007, the UN launched the Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) to inspire responsible management education and research. Over 500 business schools and management-related academic institutions are signatories to PRME [URL]. However, many practising managers were not exposed to these principles when they went through university. To ensure that managers pay more than {{lip service to the}} <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> principles, such as being opposed to child labour and corruption, managers need time to think through the principles and how to apply them in their contexts. There is an opportunity for coaches, mentors and others involved in leadership development to enable managers to genuinely engage with the principles of responsible management and commit to implementing responsible management practices. This paper makes the case for coaching {{to be a part of}} such an initiative, exploring the literature related to coaching for change and reporting on a small pilot study of the views of coordinators of graduate coaching programs as to whether coaching could make a useful contribution. The paper concludes that academics and practitioners could and should collaborate to develop knowledge, resources, models, skills and methods to coach their clients to engage with and implement the UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> principles, and to validate the effectiveness of this coaching approach through empirical researc...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} Finnish multinational companies' (MNCs) engagement to {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) is examined based on the large Finnish MNCs voluntary engagement in the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> (UN) <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> initiative. The focus {{of this study is}} firstly, to analyse the factors affecting the decision of Finnish MNCs to join the UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> and secondly, the implications of UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> participation on the company's financial performance. The factors are analysed based on their effect on CSR in {{this research}} are research and development (R&D) intensity, internationalization level, and firm size in terms of assets and personnel. Company participation in UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> is compared to company financial performance in terms of return on assets (ROA). Accounting data was gathered from the annual reports of 24 large publicly listed Finnish MNCs between 2003 and 2012. Two regression analyses were performed. Firstly, t-test were used to predict the financial performance from UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> participation and the factors related to UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> engagement; Secondly, z-test were used to predict the likelihood of UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> participation from the factors related to UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> engagement. Statistical significance was tested at 5 %. Based on the empirical analysis it was found that UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> participation has a negative correlation with financial performance. Additionally, it was found that firm size had a positive correlation with UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> engagement, while internationalization level and R&D intensity were insignificant. The results of this study imply that participating in the UN <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> may scatter CSR resources too far from the company's core competence and therefore act as a financial burden for the company...|$|R
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} of business {{is becoming an}} increasingly relevant subject of research  in political science, sociology, economics and law. The {{social responsibility}} of business is becoming  the object of close attention of both governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and the  priority of its development is provided at the national, supranational and international levels.  This  article considers the political and legal dimensions of the model of corporate social responsibility  implemented through the <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> as an unprecedented private initiative of the United  Nations. A study of the social consequences of the Global Compact offers the opportunity to  observe {{the development of an}} extremely important initiative: the dissemination of practices and  models of corporate social responsibility and the possible implications of this action for society, for  business and for the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> itself.  Corporate social responsibility, having an internal and  external dimension, social and political content, goes far beyond the formal legal aspect. At the  same time, states, including the BRICS countries, interested in developing corporate social  responsibility practices, by legal means, {{in one way or another}} contribute to the development of  the most promising practices of the social responsibility of business from their point of view.

40|$|It is not {{possible}} to introduce the basic principles of social responsibility (SR) by domestic pharmaceutical enterprises without analysis of international experience. There is no unified and authoritative definition of social responsibility concept in business. It is scientific polemics that fills the concept of social responsibility with different content, it is stipulated by methodological competition of theoretical approaches from different points of view: sociology, management and economics, law, philosophy, etc. Transformation of social values and priorities requires a change in management practices, ensuring the integration of principles, methods and SR instruments in the activity of pharmaceutical companies. The aim of the work was to study and create approaches to the understanding of social responsibility, determination of its content in the pharmaceutical sector. Materials and methods: We used such methods of investigations: analysis and synthesis of information sources of data, marketing analysis, concerning understanding of social responsibility, determining its nature in the pharmaceutical sector. In this work components of the conception were analyzed in various aspects and their integration into the definition of SR business. To accomplish the appropriate corporate civil role, the firm must fulfill obligations – economical - to earn enough profit for its own joint-stock fund to satisfy shareholders, to provide products to satisfy buyers, to create new jobs and new material values for their own business, to promote innovation, legal - to stick to the Law, ethical - to be moral, honest, fair and respect people rights, to avoid harm or social injustice; philanthropic - to carry out useful work for the community. Despite the huge number of approaches in the determining of SR, all the approaches are identical in the same thing: SRB - {{it is the responsibility of}} the company (the firm) to all physical and legal persons which it deals with in the normal course of business and to the society as a whole. According to the ISO- 26000 Standard “The Guidance on social responsibility” the basic principles of social responsibility are defined: accountability, transparency, ethical behavior, interaction with the party interested, the legal norm, the international norm, human rights. One of the important global landmarks in the development of social responsibility issues became the UN International initiative - <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Global</b> Treaty (<b>Global</b> <b>Compact).</b> It is a voluntary initiative that unites private companies, UN agencies, business associations, non-governmental organizations and trade unions in a single forum for stable development through responsible and innovative corporate leadership. Ukraine joined The <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> in April 2006. At present, the number of the <b>Global</b> <b>Compact</b> participants in Ukraine exceeds 130. This national network was set up for the purpose of extending the initiative of corporate social responsibility in Ukraine, exchange of experience, training, and joint actions. Conclusion: The approaches of understanding of social responsibility from different points of view: sociology, management and economics, law and philosophy were analyzed and summarized. Despite the variety of approaches in determining the SR, all the approaches are united in the same: SRB - it is the responsibility of company (firm) to all physical and legal persons which it deals with in the normal course of business and to the society as a whole. The fundamental principle of social responsibility is the respect for the priority of the law and compliance with the obligations defined by the law. At the same time, social responsibility includes consistent actions of companies, organizations, within the law, and the recognition of obligations to another party, which are not caused by the legislation. Pharmacy, as a socially oriented industry requires a specific approach to the definition of “social responsibility” and integrated introduction of SR basic principles in the activities of enterprises...|$|R
