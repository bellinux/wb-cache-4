5|$|According to the Ayyubid-era chronicler and {{one-time}} {{resident of}} al-Rahba, Ibn Nazif, the fortress of al-Rahba was rebuilt again by Shirkuh's grandson, al-Mujahid Shirkuh II (r. 1186–1240), in 1207. Al-Rahba was the easternmost fortress of Shirkuh II's Homs-based emirate, {{and was one}} of the four principal centers of the emirate, the other three being Homs itself, Salamiyah and Palmyra. He personally oversaw the demolition of al-Rahba's ruins and the construction of the new fortress. Al-Rahba remained in the hands of Shirkuh's descendants <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years after the annexation of Ayyubid Syria by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1260.|$|E
5|$|Captain Dibble was the Scottish Grand National {{winner in}} 1992 and vied for {{favouritism}} for the Grand National <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{days before the}} race. Scudamore had turned down a host of competitors to take the ride in his 13th National, and the pair were sent off at 9/1. Scudamore saw trainer Martin Pipe waving at him near the water jump to stop. The jockey had never won the National in his previous 12 attempts, and retired from racing a short time later.|$|E

5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at around {{three or four}} years of age and males at around five; however, males often do not {{successfully}} breed <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years later. A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the Seattle Aquarium {{died at the age of}} 28 years. Sea otters in the wild often develop worn teeth, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.|$|E
5|$|First {{mentioned}} {{during the}} 17th century, the Rodrigues solitaire {{was described in}} detail by François Leguat, {{the leader of a}} group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693. It was hunted by humans and introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 18th century. Apart from Leguat's account and drawing, and a few other contemporary descriptions, nothing was known about the bird <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1789. Thousands of bones have subsequently been excavated. It is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius.|$|E
5|$|From 1976 <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{weeks before}} his death, Caspersen ran the Hodson Trust, {{established}} by Beneficial founder Clarence Hodson to award grants to four colleges in Maryland: Hood College, The Johns Hopkins University, St. John’s College, and Washington College. Under the first 25 years of Caspersen's stewardship, the trust donated over $118million {{to the four}} institutions. Caspersen was awarded honorary degrees for his service to education; Washington College conferred an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1981 and Hood College awarded Caspersen with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1983.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for {{security}} reasons. However, {{the troops were}} not briefed on the operation <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours before it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have long}} speculated about the {{influence}} – if any – of Hamnet's death upon William Shakespeare's writing. Unlike his contemporary Ben Jonson, who wrote a lengthy piece {{on the death of}} his own son, Shakespeare, if he wrote anything in response, did so more subtly. At the time his son died, Shakespeare was writing primarily comedies, and that writing continued <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years after Hamnet's death, when his major tragedies were written. It is possible that his tragedies gained depth from his experience.|$|E
5|$|Balchen's fleet was {{successful}} in driving off the French, who retired {{in the face of}} his superior fleet without firing a shot, and Hardy's convoy was escorted safely to Gibraltar. On the way to the Portuguese Coast, Balchen finally made his fortune in prize money, capturing six heavily laden French West Indiamen. On his return journey however, the fleet was sailing through the Western Approaches in early October when it was hit by a violent storm. Scattered across the Channel, they one by one returned to England in a battered and leaking condition <b>until,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later, only HMS Victory was missing. Victory, Balchen's flagship, was, at the time, one of the largest ships in the world, holding a broadside of 100 guns. She was also very new, having been completed less than seven years before.|$|E

5|$|During the 640s, the Muslim {{conquest of}} Syria and Egypt {{created a new}} threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer {{significant}} recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of Alexandria in 644, they took to creating a navy of their own. In this effort the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented {{northern part of the}} Arabian peninsula, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered Levant (especially the Copts of Egypt), which <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines. There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed. The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about the specifics of the early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between the two cultures, Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities. This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of Byzantine military manuals were available to the Arab admirals.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} did {{not take}} part in any fighting <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months later when, in January 1943, it {{took part in the}} defence of Wau after the 17th Brigade was despatched to reinforce Kanga Force. Sailing to Port Moresby from Milne Bay on the MV Duntroon, an advance party of two companies from the battalion was flown into Wau on 24 January to hastily reinforce the small force around Ballams. The remainder– totalling about 450 men– arriving on 29 January, after which they secured the airfield, which was now under direct Japanese fire, as the two companies that had arrived earlier were pulled back from Ballams. In early February, as the Australians gained the initiative, the battalion was relieved from holding the airfield, and went on the offensive, attacking alongside the 2/7th Battalion, in an effort to push the Japanese away from their positions {{on the bank of the}} Bulolo River, around Crystal Creek, to the south-west of Wau. The fighting was intense, and over the course of three days, the battalion lost 27 killed and 31 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The major British {{assault of}} the first day was {{directly}} east of Arras, with the 12th Division attacking Observation Ridge, north of the Arras—Cambrai road. After reaching this objective, they were to push on towards Feuchy, as well as the second and third lines of German trenches. At the same time, elements of the 3rd Division began an assault south of the road, with the taking of Devil's Wood, Tilloy-lès-Mofflaines and the Bois des Boeufs as their initial objectives. The ultimate objective of these assaults was the Monchyriegel, a trench running between Wancourt and Feuchy and {{an important component of the}} German defences. Most of these objectives, including Feuchy village, had been achieved by the evening of 10 April though the Germans were still in control of large sections of the trenches between Wancourt and Feuchy, particularly in the area of the heavily fortified village of Neuville-Vitasse. The following day, troops from the 56th Division were able to force the Germans out of the village, although the Monchyriegel was not fully in British hands <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later. The British were able to consolidate these gains and push forward towards Monchy-le-Preux, although they suffered heavy casualties in fighting near the village.|$|E

5|$|Wizard {{then went}} to Epsom Downs for the Derby Stakes, where he was again ridden by Clift, {{as he had been}} in his {{previous}} two races. He started as the odds-on favourite, priced at about 8/11. Fair Star was the second favourite, with Salivator third in the betting. Salivator took the lead and held it until the field turned into the finishing straight, where Wizard overtook him. Wizard was in front <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> yards from the finish, where he was passed by Pope, a 20/1 outsider. Pope won the race by a neck from Wizard with Salivator in third and Fair Star in fourth. In his last race of the season Wizard finished fourth in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster. The race was won by Ashton, who had started as favourite. The St. Leger was the first time Wizard had not been ridden by William Clift, with Francis Buckle riding him.|$|E
5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's {{right to}} erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross {{was different from the}} Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied {{to erect a}} cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice Department.|$|E
