5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of <b>unwanted</b> <b>noise</b> in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

25|$|Acoustical {{engineering}} {{is one of}} many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical {{engineering is}} the study of Sound and Vibration. These engineers work effectively to reduce noise pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of <b>unwanted</b> <b>noise.</b> The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sirens mounted behind the engine grill or under the wheel arches {{produces}} less <b>unwanted</b> <b>noise</b> inside the passenger cabin and {{to the side and}} rear of the vehicle while maintaining noise levels to give adequate warnings. The inclusion of broadband sound to sirens has the ability to increase localisation of sirens, as in a directional siren, as a spread of frequencies makes use of the three ways the brain detects a direction of a sound: Interaural level difference, interaural time difference and head-related transfer function.|$|E
25|$|Active noise-cancelling {{headphones}} use a microphone, amplifier, {{and speaker}} to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this {{to some extent}} cancels out <b>unwanted</b> <b>noise</b> from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments {{with other types of}} noise.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the drum}} {{magazine}} provided significant firepower, in military service {{it was found}} to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing <b>unwanted</b> <b>noise.</b> For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility {{was not included in the}} design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.|$|E
500|$|In {{conventional}} musical practices {{sounds that}} are considered unmusical tend {{to be treated as}} noise. Oscillations and Waves defines noise as irregular vibrations of an object, in contrast to the periodical, patterned structure of music. More broadly, electrical engineering professor Bart Kosko in the introductory chapter of his book Noise defines noise as a [...] "signal we don't like." [...] Paul Hegarty, a lecturer and noise musician, likewise assigns a subjective value to noise, writing that [...] "noise is a judgment, a social one, based on unacceptability, the breaking of norms and a fear of violence." [...] Composer and music educator R. Murray Schafer divided noise into four categories: <b>Unwanted</b> <b>noise,</b> unmusical sound, any loud system, and a disturbance in any signaling system.|$|E
2500|$|According to Murray Schafer {{there are}} four types of noise: <b>unwanted</b> <b>noise,</b> unmusical sound, any loud sound, and a {{disturbance}} in any signaling system (such as static on a telephone). Definitions regarding what is considered noise, relative to music, have changed over time. Ben Watson, in his article Noise as Permanent Revolution, points out that Ludwig van Beethoven's Grosse Fuge (1825) [...] "sounded like noise" [...] to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven's publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, {{replacing it with a}} sparkling Allegro. They subsequently published it separately.|$|E

The most frequent effort is to suppress these <b>unwanted</b> <b>noises.</b> While suppressing the noises, the most problematic part is that it always depends on subjective evaluation of the listener. Practical impacts of these noises were researched throughout two listening tests. Afterwards, {{it was necessary to}} choose proper (ordinal) evaluating scale.

Noise control principles are implemented into technology and design in a variety of ways, including control by redesigning sound sources, the design of noise barriers, sound absorbers, suppressors, and buffer zones, and the use of hearing protection (earmuffs or earplugs).|$|E

It is a {{low frequency}} and selfexcited vibration that is often generated before and after the wiper reverses direction.

This paper intends to propose a control technique that is capable of reducing chatter noise and vibration in the automotive windshield wiper system. In doing so, an existing two-dimensional mathematical model of a wiper system is adopted. MATLAB Simulink is then used to simulate vibration response of the wiper. The simulated results are then verified by those obtained in the experiment. With the verified model, a control strategy, namely, input shaping is introduced. It is found that input shaping technique can reduce vibration level by approximately 30 percents over the model without control scheme...|$|R
