On the left side, however, dilated seminal vesicle and reflux up the left dilated ureter were demonstrated. These suggested crossed ectopia of the left ureter and its ectopic opening into the left seminal vesicle. The renal pelvis was not visualized {{at the time of}} reflux (Fig. 5). On cystoscopy both ureteral orifices and trigone were normal except for cystic elevation of the right side of trigone.

40|$|Introduction Of all {{children}} born with congenital anomalies, 30 - 40 % have urogenital abnormalities. Most {{of them are}} asymptomatic, but if any symptoms occur, they are usually symptoms of urinary infections. Case report A four-year old girl was admitted because of recurrent urinary infections {{and in order to}} perform a thorough clinical examination. Clinical examination showed an asymmetrical glutens and presence of a fibroma in the same region. Detailed radiologic examinations (ultrasonography, plain X-ray, excretory urography, voiding urethrocystography) revealed a triplicate ureter on the right side with a vesicoureteral reflux of the fifth grade on the same side. Intraoperatively, type III ureteric triplication according to Smith's classification was established. Ureteral remodeling and reimplantation was done. The postoperative course was good, and follow-up voiding urethrocystography showed absence of reflux. Discussion Ureteral triplication is a consequence of either development of three buds on the mesonephric duct, or development of two buds, one of which further divided into two parts. Most common anomalies associated with ureteral triplication are: <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> on the other side (37 %), ectopy of the ureteric orifice (28 %) and kidney dysplasia (8 %). Vesicoureteral reflux is very common on affected or on both sides. Symptomatology is the same as in <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> - dominated by signs of urinary infections. Conclusion Diagnosis of <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> requires detailed imaging.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONA {{woman with}} {{bilateral}} complete <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> with stones simultaneously obstructing both limbs {{of the left}} double ureter is presented. A search of the English medical literature suggests {{that this is the}} first reported case. Based on the initial difficulty accessing the stones via ureteroscopy we make recommendations regarding how this rare problem should be approached if encountered. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 37 -year old woman with left-sided flank pain was discovered on CT scan to have bilateral complete <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> and three stones obstructing both limbs of the left double ureter. Ureteroscopy was initially unsuccessful due to the very small calibre and unyielding nature of the ureters and both ureteral limbs were stented. Repeat ureteroscopy was easily achieved after pre-stenting and the impacted stones were completely cleared with intracorporeal laser lithotripsy. DISCUSSIONThe smaller calibre of both double ureters and their presence in a common adventitial sheath distally, made initial attempts at ureteroscopy difficult. Stenting both limbs increased ureteral compliance, passively dilated both ureters and allowed for improved manoeuvrability and retrograde passage of the ureteroscope. Based on the experience with this first reported case it is recommended that pre-stenting should be routinely performed prior to any attempt at ureteroscopy in cases of stones complicating completely duplicated ureters. CONCLUSIONWe report the first recorded case of bilateral complete <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> with stones simultaneously obstructing both limbs of the double ureter and recommend that routine pre-stenting be done prior to ureteroscopy to allow easy uncomplicated retrograde passage of the ureteroscope...|$|E

Renal abnormalities have also been reported with the complex, but the incidence of associated genitourinary malformations has not been defined. MethodWe have reviewed our experience with 28 children with Goldenhar syndrome evaluated during the past twelve years. Twenty children underwent imaging evaluation of the urinary tract and 14 (70 % of those imaged) children had urinary tract anomalies. ResultsThe majority of anomalies presented as an incidental finding on a screening ultrasound (8 patients) or during cardiac catheterization (2 patients). Two children presented with urinary tract infection, 1 child presented with renal failure, and another was diagnosed antenatally. The genitourinary anomalies included the following: ectopic and/or fused kidneys (8 patients), renal agenesis (7), vesicoureteral reflux (5), ureteropelvic junction obstruction (2), <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> (2), and multicystic kidney (1 patient).

The present {{study was conducted to}} determine the value of diagnostic ultrasonography in patients with meatal stenosis. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 120 patients with meatal stenosis, referred to Naghavi Hospital, Kashan, Iran, from July 2000 to March 2002. Symptoms and findings on physical examination were recorded for every patient, ultrasonography of the urinary tract, and urinalysis and urine culture were also performed. Results: Mean age of the patients was 2. 5 years (range, 3 months to 6 years). The common symptoms were dysuria (35 %), decreased urine caliber (33. 3 %), and bloody spotting (15 %), while 26. 6 % of the patients were asymptomatic. Paraclinical findings were microscopic hematuria (17. 5 %), bacteriuria (1. 6 %), and <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> (0. 8 %). No case of obstructive uropathy was detected by ultrasonography.

40|$|Duplicated ureter is a {{congenital}} {{condition in}} which the ureteric bud, the embryological origin of the ureter, splits resulting in two ureters draining a single kidney (figure 1). It {{is the most common}} renal abnormality, occurring in approximately 1 % of the population. 1 2 Duplicated ureter is more common in women. <b>Ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> is either partial, that is, the two ureters drain into the bladder via a single common ureter or complete in which two ureters drain separately.

40|$|Complications of the {{transplant}} ureter {{are the most}} important cause of surgical morbidity after renal transplantation. The presence of <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> in the renal graft might result in an increased complication rate. We analyzed our data of double-ureter renal transplantations using a case-control study design. Additionally, we performed a review of the literature. From January 1995 to April 2012, 12 patients received a donor kidney with a double ureter (0. 8 %). We created a control group of 24 patients matched in age, sex, donor type, and ureteral stenting. Patient charts and surgical reports were reviewed retrospectively. In 7 patients both ureters were separately anastomosed to the bladder. In 4 patients a common ostium was created. In 1 patient 1 of the 2 ureters was ligated. No postoperative urologic complications occured. In the single-ureter group, the urologic complication rate was 17 % (P =. 71). Mean creatinine levels after transplantation were comparable between both groups.

40|$|Bedside {{ultrasound}} {{is becoming}} a very important tool in emergency medicine. One of the staples of bedside ultrasound is its potential in assisting the clinician with information on local anatomy and organ function. A previously healthy 44 -year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute dysuria and left flank pain. A renal bedside ultrasound was obtained and showed excellent urine flow into the bladder from bilateral duplicated ureters (Fig. 1) and no hydronephrosis. An acute ureteral obstruction was therefore excluded. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection {{in the setting of}} duplex collecting system.

The medical records of all pediatric patients (age range, 0 - 14 years) who underwent intraureteral injection of NASHA/Dx gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization for the treatment of primary high-grade VUR during the period June 2006 -June 2010 were reviewed. Eighty-nine children (61 boys, 28 girls; M:F ratio, 2. 1) underwent intraureteral injection of NASHA/Dx gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization for the treatment of primary high-grade VUR during the study period. VUR completely disappeared after the injection of NASHA/Dx gel into 105 (73 %) of 144 ureters, with no further treatment required. Thirty-five (24. 3 %) required a second injection, and 2 (1. 4 %) required a third injection for resolution of their VUR. No intraoperative complications were observed. No ureteral obstruction during follow-up was observed using ultrasound or micturition studies. Intraureteral injection of NASHA/Dx gel under direct ureteroscopic visualization is safe and effective in the treatment of primary high-grade VUR, including cases with <b>ureteral</b> <b>duplication,</b> if the ureteral meatus is easy to pass through without mechanical dilation.

Cystoscopy and radiological examinations showed left ectopic ureteral opening into the seminal vesicle associated with left renal agenesis. The left ureter and seminal vesicle were extirpated. Case 2 was a 21 year old who complained of lower abdominal pain. On physical examination, a child's head sized mass was palpable in the midline {{of the lower}} abdomen. Operation was performed under diagnosis of intrapelvic tumor, but the mass was cystic dilatation of left ureter which opened into the seminal vesicle. Case 3 was a 19 year old who complained of right CVA colic pain. On cystoscopy, the right ureteral orifice was absent. During the operation, right ureter was found to open into the posterior urethra. Case 4 was a 57 year old who complained of fever. Plain X-ray on the pelvic cavity showed a 82 X 10 mm calcified shadow. CT revealed a right ectopic ureteral opening into the posterior urethra with a ureteral stone in it.

40|$|Introduction and Objective:					<b>Ureteral</b> <b>duplication</b> is {{the most}} common urologic abnormality. The upper pole ureter can {{sometimes}} be associated with a ureterocele. In rare cases the ureteral insertion is extravesical and can result in significant hydroureteronephrosis. Patients can present with urinary tract infection, abdominal mass or urinary obstruction. Traditional procedures include ureteral reimplantation, ureteroureterostomy or heminephroureterectomy. These reconstructive procedures are technically challenging in small infants, especially when the hydroureteronephrosis is severe. In some cases a distal cutaneous ureterostomy is performed for immediate drainage followed by definitive surgery when the child is older. We describe our initial experience with a novel cystoscopic technique which provides drainage of the upper pole ureter and avoids the need for an incision or stoma. 													Materials and Methods:					A 3 month-old boy presented with urinary tract infections and failure to thrive. Ultrasound revealed severe upper pole hydroureteronephrosis. Voiding cystourethrography did not reveal vesicoureteral reflux or the presence of a ureterocele. The patient underwent cytoscopy. The ectopic ureteral orifice was not identified. A transurethral, transvesical needle puncture and confirmatory ureteropyelography was used to access the dilated upper pole ureter. Guidewire passage, followed catheter dilation then allowed creation of a new ureteral orifice using a holmium laser. 													Results:					The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the incidence of urinary tract anomalies associated with first UTI. Methodology: We reviewed 158 patients (aged one month to 15 years) who were hospitalized with symptomatic UTI during a 2 -year period (2001 - 2003). Patients with incomplete investiga-tions were excluded from the study. One hundred twenty six patients (100 girls and 26 boys) were included in the study. Ninety-seven (77 %) were under 5 years. Confirmed cases of UTI underwent renal and urinary tract ultrasonography (US), voiding cystourethrography (VCUG),and 99 mTc-dimercaptosuccinc acid (DMSA) scan. Results: The most common presentation were fever (83 %) and dysuria (48 %). The commonest causative agent was E coli (88 %). VUR was found in 50 (39. 6 %), 39 girls, and 11 boys. Other urinary tract abnormalities were renal stone in 10 (8 %) patients, pelvic ureteric junction obstruction in 8 (6. 3 %), neurogenic bladder in two boys and one girl, double collecting system in 2 girls, posterior urethral valves in two boys and ureterocele in one girl, respectively.

40|$|The {{medical records}} linkage {{system of the}} Rochester Project at the Mayo Clinic was used to {{identify}} births at Rochester hospitals from 1922 through 1976 to women with epilepsy and to the wives of men with epilepsy. The children were followed up to determine the incidence of congenital malformation and seizure disorders among them. In 133 births to women before the onset or after the remission of epilepsy, there were no major malformations. Among children born to mothers who had active epilepsy but did not take anticonvulsants during pregnancy, the rate of malformations was not excessive (2 / 82, or 2. 4 per cent). Children of mothers who took anticonvulsants during pregnancy had {{a high incidence of}} major congenital malformations (19 / 177, or 10. 7 per cent).
