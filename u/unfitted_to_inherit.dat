50|$|Yang Jun never {{completely}} recovered from his illness. He died in 600. Emperor Wen, reasoning that Princess Cui's crime tainted Yang Hao {{and that his}} brother Yang Zhan (楊湛) was born of a concubine and therefore <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> the title, did not allow either <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> the title of Prince of Qin, and in fact ordered that Yang Jun's staff members serve as his mourners, suggesting that both Yang Hao and Yang Zhan {{were excluded from the}} funeral proceedings.|$|R
5000|$|Infante Carlos was {{the senior}} male-line {{descendant}} of Ferdinand IV and III of Naples and Sicily (Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies) {{and as such}} [...] "first born legitimate heir of the Farnese" [...] (primogenito legittimo farnesiano), as Ferdinand was designated by his father, King Charles III of Spain, on 16 October 1759 (ten days after abdicating the Two Sicilies Crown). Although Ferdinand had two elder brothers, his eldest brother was mentally retarded and deemed <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> any crown; his next eldest brother, meanwhile, was his father's heir to the crown of Spain; treaty provisions prevented the union of the crowns of Spain, Naples and Sicily {{on the head of}} one person.|$|R
5000|$|Parr's sister, Catherine Parr, in March 1543 {{used her}} {{influence}} {{to help her}} brother and on 17 April 1543, he obtained an Act of Parliament, repudiating Anne and her child, who was declared a bastard, and <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> <b>inherit.</b> The act was styled in the Lords' journal as a Bill [...] "to bar and make base and bastards, the child which be, or shall be borne in adultery by the Lady Anne, wife of the Lord Parr". This act was read {{for the first time}} on 13 March 1543. The Act stated in the 34th Year Hen. VIII: [...] "That for the last two years she Anne had eloped from her husband, William Lord Parr, and had not in that time ever returned to nor had any carnal intercourse with him, but had been gotten with child by one of her adulterors and been delivered of such child, which child 'being as is notoriously known, begotten in adultery, and born during the espousals' between her and Lord Parr 'by the law of this realm is inheritable and may pretend <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> all &c;' and the Act therefore declared the said child to be a bastard. At this time, his sister Catherine was being courted by King Henry VIII. Anne spent the next few years living in exile at the manor of Little Wakering, in Essex. She was allegedly reduced to a state of poverty.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{diagnoses of}} workers being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work {{may be a}} {{relevant}} health indicator. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to analyze the one-year incidence of an <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work diagnosis. Method: This one-year prospective study included all workers undergoing annual work medical examination from occupational health services in Troyes, France. Results: Twenty-one occupational physicians followed 54, 026 employees. The all-cause incidence of being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> return to work was 0. 772 %. The two main causes of being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work were musculoskeletal disorders (61 %) and psychopathologies (24 %). The relative risk (RR) of being <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work, independent of the cause, was higher when employees were aged over 50 years (RR = 2. 51), and female (RR = 1. 51). Conclusions: Prospective results from occupational physicians’ medical records may provide significant and cost-effective directions to prioritize actions and target health promotion in the workplace...|$|R
50|$|According to the defense, Robert Kissel {{told his}} wife {{on the night of}} 2 November 2003, that he was filing for divorce, saying that the {{decision}} was final, and that she was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> care for their children. The defense also alleged she had long suffered from physical and sexual abuse. Nancy Kissel pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility and provocation. Kissel admitted to having an extramarital relationship with a TV repairman, and the prosecution alleged that she planned to run away with her lover in the United States after her husband's death, and that she stood <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> her husband's estate worth US$18 million.|$|R
