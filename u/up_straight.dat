5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E

The performer of Gunther, for example, {{was expected to}} sing leaning forward in Act 1 of Götterdämmerung until he felt his authority challenged by Hagen and sat <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> It {{is hard to imagine}} a greater contrast with traditional operatic acting.|$|E

Yes, Sir, something was bobbing along right at Peter Rabbit's heels.|$|R
25|$|Carotid arteries supply {{blood to}} the brain and neck. Marked {{narrowing}} of the carotid arteries can present with symptoms such as a feeling of weakness, {{not being able to}} think straight, difficulty speaking, becoming dizzy and difficulty in walking or standing <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> blurred vision, numbness of the face, arms, and legs, severe headache and losing consciousness. These symptoms are also related to stroke (death of brain cells). Stroke is caused by marked narrowing or closure of arteries going to the brain; lack of adequate blood supply leads to the death of the cells of the affected tissue.|$|E
25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims the hoof {{wall to the}} desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog of the hoof with a hoof knife. Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the hoof should line <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> with both bones in the pastern. If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|E
25|$|Following the marriage, Tudor {{transferred}} to the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Tank Corps, which was based at Lydd, Kent, England. Larissa was ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and spinal caries {{and was unable to}} sit <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> She spent her days reclining in an elongated bath chair. The couple lived privately, but were often overheard laughing in the garden of their house. Though Tudor's income had been reduced when he left the Hussars and he had no personal fortune, he had enough money to pay for a nurse for Larissa and to keep a horse stabled at a nearby farm.|$|E

She turns to Eric for help, who is not {{interested}} (seeing this turn of events {{as a chance to}} get Sookie for himself), but he ends up sending werewolf Alcide Herveaux (Joe Manganiello) for assistance after it is revealed that Bill was taken by V-addicted werewolves in the employ of the 3000-year-old vampire king of Mississippi, Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare). Meanwhile, back in Bon Temps, Lafayette embarks on a relationship with his mother's care nurse and brujo Jesús Velasquez (Kevin Alejandro) and learns about his own special powers as a medium, while Sam hires a new waitress at Merlotte's, Wiccan Holly Cleary (Lauren Bowles).|$|E
25|$|As a young child, Gould {{was taught}} piano by his mother. At {{the age of}} 10, he began {{attending}} The Royal Conservatory of Music (known until 1947, when it received a Royal Charter from King George VI, as the Toronto Conservatory of Music) in Toronto. He studied music theory with Leo Smith, the organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back {{as a result of}} a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is almost certainly related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould's mother would urge the young Gould to sit <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> at the keyboard. He used this chair for the rest of his life and took it with him almost everywhere. The famous chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low at the keyboard. The chair allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of his teacher at the Conservatory, Alberto Guerrero.|$|E

500|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} Jason Voorhees {{has gone through}} changes, some subtle and some radical. For Friday the 13th, the task of coming up with Jason's appearance was the responsibility of Tom Savini, whose design for Jason was inspired by someone Savini knew as a child whose eyes and ears did not line <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> The original design called for Jason to have hair, but Savini and his crew opted to make him bald, so he would look like a [...] "hydrocephalic, mongoloid pinhead", with a dome-shaped head. Savini created a plaster mold of Ari Lehman's head and used that to create prosthetics for his face. Lehman personally placed mud—from {{the bottom of the}} lake—all over his body to make himself appear [...] "really slimy." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy {{as you can get}} for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I sat <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for– he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." [...] In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, {{was looking}} for {{something}} more stable than the usual feature movies. He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel's son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. [...] "Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed that I just fit right in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude." [...] Instead, he was told to just [...] "stand <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> [...] normal voice," [...] and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.|$|E

500|$|In 19 September 2011 episode, Poppy {{discovers that}} Jodie's fiance Darren (Hawkins) has cheated on her. Hawkins {{assessed}} the situation Poppy was in: [...] "as everyone knows, Poppy's loyalties lie with Jodie– they're super best friends! Poppy wants Darren to own <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> away, because {{she feels that}} if he doesn't, she'll be lying to Jodie as well". He explained, [...] "Poppy doesn't want to see Jodie in pain, but she can't keep the secret". Poppy and Jodie were reportedly used to add humour to the soap, {{in the style of}} reality-drama series The Only Way Is Essex, but The Sun assessed that the attempt had [...] "flopped". On 24 October 2011 it was announced that the pair were to leave the show. Her departure storyline saw her to start to date Anthony (Lapinskas), who considered his character to be [...] "pleased that somebody likes him". He added that while his character was also interested in Jodie, he did what he thought was expected of him in asking Poppy out. After he and Jodie kissed, Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy. An Inside Soap writer predicted that Anthony was heading for trouble, and that he was [...] "playing with fire" [...] by kissing both Poppy and Jodie. A source told RTÉ, [...] " [...] and Poppy have never let a man come between them. Poppy may have something to say to Jodie when she finds out they have kissed". The Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly and the Daily Star Susan Hill confirmed that Poppy would forgive Jodie, and they made their final appearance on 14 November 2011. According to an EastEnders spokesperson, there was potential for Poppy to return in the future; in an interview with Inside Soap, EastEnders executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "We may see Poppy pop up as I'm a big fan of Rachel Bright and the character, but Kylie is keen to pursue other roles".|$|E
2500|$|Competitors {{in a hurry}} {{sometime}} use thinning shears to {{trim the}} mane and {{give the appearance of}} having been pulled. However, the effect only lasts a couple of weeks at most before the cut hairs begin to grow out and stick <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> into the air. Thus, this method is not advised. [...] Pulled manes also grow out, but take longer, and when the hair begins to grow, it is less stiff and tends to blend more easily with the existing mane.|$|E

Below decks, any person over five feet (150 cm) tall {{would be unable to}} stand <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> The maximum possible space for each person would have been slightly less than the size of a standard single bed.|$|E

[...] These lyrics {{did not receive}} wide attention at the time. The existence of Mitchell's daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell's art-school days in the 1960s sold {{the story of the}} adoption to a tabloid magazine. By that time, Mitchell's daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997. After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter's birth and her inability {{to take care of her}} as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had really begun. When she could not express herself to the person she wanted to talk to, she became attuned to the whole world and she began to write personally.|$|E
2500|$|Wesley was {{initially}} {{designed to be}} a foil for the character of Rupert Giles. Actor Alexis Denisof comments that Wesley and Giles come from very similar backgrounds, but have gone in different directions [...] "with the tools that they had"; he was conceived as a [...] "nemesis" [...] for Giles and Buffy. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, who wrote Wesley's first episode [...] "Bad Girls", explains, [...] "The way Faith is a reflection of Buffy, Wesley takes up a lot of the space that Giles traditionally occupies." [...] He elaborates that, because Giles is usually the [...] "stuffy guy from England who tells you to sit <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and obey the rules", introducing Wesley, who embodies those traits [...] "to the nth degree", allows Giles to become [...] "subversive" [...] and [...] "cool". Writer Jane Espenson claims that the character was intended for viewers to have antipathy towards, since he was trying to undermine Giles.|$|E
