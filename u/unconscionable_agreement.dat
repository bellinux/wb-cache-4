40|$|Unilateral-modification clauses {{give one}} party the {{unfettered}} right to amend or reject the underlying contract, often with neither notice to nor consent {{from the other}} party. State and federal courts are divided {{on the issue of}} whether employment arbitration agreements subject to such clauses are enforceable (and the courts holding the arbitration agreements are unenforceable are divided on which of several contract law doctrines apply). The majority of courts refuse to compel arbitration when the employer 2 ̆ 7 s unilateral-modification rights create a lack of consideration, a non-mutual agreement, an illusory promise to arbitrate, or an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>agreement.</b> A minority of courts find that the promise of continued employment is adequate consideration and that arbitration agreements containing unilateral-modification clauses are enforceable. This article argues that an employer 2 ̆ 7 s promise of continued at-will employment is illusory and therefore, by itself does not supply consideration for an employee 2 ̆ 7 s promise to arbitrate. The article also argues that under existing contract law doctrines, arbitration agreements subject to unrestricted unilateral-modification provisions should not be enforceable. However, courts should permit employers to retain the ability to unilaterally modify arbitration agreements so long as the agreements provide employees with (1) adequate notice of changes, (2) sufficient consideration for the promise to arbitrate, and (3) conscionable arbitration terms. Courts can overlay this three-step framework onto existing contract doctrines to fairly and consistently analyze the enforceability of unilateral-modification clauses in employment arbitration agreements...|$|E
25|$|<b>Unconscionable</b> <b>agreements</b> can be escaped where {{a person}} was under duress or undue {{influence}} or their vulnerability was being exploited when they ostensibly agreed to a deal. Children, mentally incapacitated people and companies, whose representatives are acting wholly outside their authority, are protected against having agreements enforced against them where they lacked the real capacity {{to make a decision}} to enter an agreement. Some transactions are considered illegal, and are not enforced by courts because of a statute or on grounds of public policy. In theory, English law attempts to adhere to a principle that people should only be bound when they have given their informed and true consent to a contract.|$|R
40|$|Arbitration, {{as a form}} of {{alternative}} dispute resolution, is a favored method of settling legal disputes because it resolves disputes faster and more cost effectively than in-court litigation. Corporations often exploit the private nature of arbitration by including complex provisions in consumer contracts that require certain disputes to be resolved through arbitration. Consumers subject to these arbitration provisions often do not realize the existence of the provisions, and do not understand that because of undue corporate influence over arbitrators, arbitration tends to favor the corporations against which they arbitrate. Unfortunately, because the U. S. Supreme Court has declared that the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) preempts states’ ability to declare forced arbitration <b>agreements</b> <b>unconscionable,</b> consumers struggle to challenge unfavorable arbitration awards. To remedy the abuses consumers face in the arbitration arena, this Note argues that Congress should amend the FAA to allow states to declare forced arbitration <b>agreements</b> <b>unconscionable...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which {{declared}} the arbitration <b>agreement</b> <b>unconscionable</b> under California law. That precluded arbitration proceedings and allowed Adams {{to pursue a}} regular lawsuit in California courts. Adams was then able to pursue the original claims notwithstanding the decision by Justice Kennedy. In {{the aftermath of the}} case, legal analysts said that this case would be important for future arbitration case law.|$|R
50|$|In California, an {{agreement}} is very powerful. A couple can waive {{their rights to}} share property (community property). It can limit spousal support (although a court at the divorce can set this aside if it deems that the limitation is <b>unconscionable).</b> The <b>agreement</b> {{can act as a}} contract to make a will requiring one spouse to provide for the other at death. It can also limit probate rights at death, such as the right to a probate allowance, the right to act an executor, the right to take as a predetermined heir, and so forth. In California, Registered Domestic Partners may also enter into a prenup. Postmarital agreements are treated very differently in California law. Spouses have a fiduciary duty to one another so premarital agreements come under a special category of agreements. There is a presumption that the postmarital agreement was obtained by undue influence if one party gains an advantage. Disclosure cannot be waived {{in the context of a}} postmarital agreement.|$|R
5000|$|... "Inequality of {{bargaining}} power" [...] is a {{term used}} in English law to express essentially the same idea as unconscionability, which can in turn be further broken down into cases on duress, undue influence and exploitation of weakness. In these cases, where someone's consent to a bargain was only procured through duress, out of undue influence or under severe external pressure that another person exploited, courts have felt it was <b>unconscionable</b> to enforce <b>agreements.</b> Controversy exists as to whether a contract should be voidable simply because one party was pressured by circumstances wholly outside the other party's control.|$|R
40|$|A {{field in}} which {{reliable}} social welfare statistics as {{to the effect of}} legal principles in actual operation would be of inestimable value in deciding what the law ought to be, is that of attorney 2 ̆ 7 s contingent fee contracts. The argument from necessity for such contracts is obvious: that otherwise poor suitors with deserving cases would find it impossible to get their cases into court. Hence the validity of such contracts is usually upheld in this country. Just as obvious is {{the fact that there is}} now afforded unworthy members of the profession an opportunity availed of all too often for making extortionate and <b>unconscionable</b> <b>agreements</b> and for speculating in weak cases, accompanied, as such practice usually must be, by the worst forms of solicitation and touting of business. Statistics, if available, as to the number of meritorious cases saved by contingent fee contracts, the number of cases decided for defendants instituted under such agreements and the like would throw much light upon the desirability of the present legal viewpoint. The proper result may well be that it is more desirable to provide for the needs of poor litigants in other ways, such as the legal aid society and similar agencies. At any rate courts may well refuse to uphold such contracts when the necessity for them does not exist or is outweighed by other considerations. Thus the law 2 ̆ 7 s well-known abhorrence of divorce leads to a refusal to enforce contingent fee contracts to procure divorces. In Baca v. Padilla (1920, N. M.) 190 Pac. 730, the same principle was applied to an attorney 2 ̆ 7 s contract to assist in the prosecution of a criminal case for a fee contingent upon the conviction of the accused. There has been considerable question as to the wisdom of allowing private counsel to assist in public prosecution at all; whether the interest of state and accused are not better served by having the prosecution entirely in the hands of a disinterested public official. Most courts have thought such assistance permissible, however, so long as the actual control of the prosecution remains with the public prosecutor. But a contingent fee contract under such circumstances must rest upon not one but two principles of doubtful societal value and the court properly refused to enforce it...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to court decisions ruling arbitration <b>agreements</b> <b>unconscionable,</b> some businesses began adding [...] "consumer-friendly" [...] provisions to their arbitration clauses. For example, after court decisions striking down their arbitration clauses, PayPal and Second Life changed their terms {{to allow the}} claimant to choose optional non-appearance-based arbitration for small claims or {{to go to court}} under the terms of a forum selection clause. According to David Horton, following court decisions striking class action waivers, some businesses unilaterally added [...] "elaborate schemes" [...] that would provide an incentive for consumers to bring low-value claims in arbitration, such as paying all arbitration costs and automatically awarding successful plaintiffs attorney's fees. Horton wrote that such provisions were designed primarily to convince courts that arbitration provisions were not unconscionable, rather than to attract customers from competitors on the basis of such arbitration terms. Horton also suggested, though, that decisions upholding a class action waiver would cause businesses to remove consumer-friendly clauses to reduce the incentive for consumers to bring claims. Myriam Gilles said that businesses' usage of consumer-friendly arbitration provisions could avoid outright bans on consumer arbitration by the federal government.|$|R
