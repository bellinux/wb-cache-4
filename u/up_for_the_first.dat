On 16 May he completed a third consecutive century, and on 31 May he was called <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Test against Australia at Trent Bridge. By the end of the 1964 season, Boycott had topped the country's domestic averages with 59.45.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, {{which led to}} an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E

Australia bowled first, and Lindwall took the wicket of Cyril Washbrook, before {{he was forced to}} leave the field with a groin strain with figures of 1/30.

Lindwall could not bowl in the second innings as Australia completed an eight wicket victory.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{returned}} for the Europe/Africa Zone Group II tie versus Luxembourg. He beat Laurent Bram, a tennis coach, 6–0, 6–0, 6–0, {{the last time}} a Briton had achieved this score line in Davis Cup was Alan Mills defeating Josef Offenheim in 1959, also against Luxembourg.

5|$|Granderson led off {{the first}} inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E

25|$|Toyota {{redesigned}} {{this series}} {{from the ground}} <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time since the V30 and XV10.

As a consequence, Toyota claimed the XV30 to have cost 30percent less to design and develop than its predecessor. XV30 also had increased parts content over the XV20, but did not cost any more to manufacture.|$|E
25|$|The judging {{takes place}} on just {{a small part of}} the circuit, a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and {{opportunities}} for drifting. The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, except as it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> judged corner. In the tandem passes, the lead driver (in the lead car, Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi), however in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points.|$|E
