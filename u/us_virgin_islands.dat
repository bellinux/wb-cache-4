The rain flooded roads and prompted officials opened shelters on all three islands on October6. In Saint Croix, a roadway section leading into Enfield Green collapsed, temporarily cutting the neighborhood off to traffic until a makeshift roadway was created the next day. In La Vallée, on the island's north shore, floods and landslides affected low-lying areas. Traffic on Saint Thomas and Saint John initially remained unhindered; however, as the rain continued for several days, flooding, rockslides and asphalt erosion forced authorities to close several roads and highways.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands)</b> have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them do not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> which {{are located in the}} Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had an Organic Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in {{addition to}} having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies.

5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the <b>US</b> <b>Virgin</b> <b>Islands,</b> mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
