5|$|At the twenty-minute {{arraignment}} hearing at the Dirksen {{federal courthouse}} before Durkin, Hastert entered a plea of not guilty. Durkin set a $4,500 <b>unsecured</b> bond {{as well as}} various other conditions of pretrial release, and Hastert surrendered his passport.|$|E
5|$|Enron was {{estimated}} to have about $23 billion in liabilities from both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans. Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase in particular appeared to have significant amounts to lose with Enron's bankruptcy. Additionally, many of Enron's major assets were pledged to lenders {{in order to secure}} loans, causing doubt about what, if anything, <b>unsecured</b> creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings.|$|E
5|$|In Arizona v. Gant (2009), the Court {{ruled that}} a law {{enforcement}} officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an arrest of an occupant of that vehicle, unless 1) {{at the time of}} the search the person being arrested is <b>unsecured</b> and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2) police officers have reason to believe that evidence for the crime for which the person is being arrested will be found in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second lift arrived, the first supply drop was made onto LZ 'L'. Although most {{supplies}} arrived, {{only a small amount}} could be collected as the area was not under full British control. The poor radio communication meant that {{it was not possible to}} alert the RAF and <b>unsecured</b> drop zones would be a major problem in the days to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 and 1976, several {{stockholder}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against American Financial, and Keating was {{under fire for}} aspects involving <b>unsecured</b> loans, stock warrants, and {{the sale of the}} Enquirer. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms. Keating resigned from American Financial in August 1976, with conflicting stories {{as to whether or not}} Keating and Lindner had remained close or whether they had fallen out.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} {{the right wing of}} a devotional and hinged triptych; the lost center panel is {{recorded}} in sixteenth-century inventories as a Virgin and Child. The panels were commissioned by Tommaso, a member of a prominent Florentine family. Tommaso was an intimate of Charles the Bold and an ambitious manager of the Bruges branch of a bank controlled by Lorenzo de' Medici, and a well known and active patron of Flemish art. Tommaso eventually lost his position due to a series of large and risky <b>unsecured</b> loans given to Charles.|$|E
5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had <b>unsecured</b> debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust {{in the years immediately}} following his disappearance. His family was granted probate over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, Lord Bingham, was refused permission to take his father's title and seat in the House of Lords. Following the passage of the Presumption of Death Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a High Court hearing at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father's title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.|$|E
5|$|On January11, Tropical Depression 04F {{produced}} a record 293.2mm (11.5in) {{of rain in}} a 24‑hour span on Rotuma. However, little damage resulted from the heavy precipitation. Cyclone Tam produced heavy rainfall in American Samoa which triggered damaging floods. Several buildings were flooded, and an estimated 70% of the island's crops were destroyed. Sustained winds of up to 55km/h (35mph), with gusts reaching 95km/h (59mph), tore a few roofs off <b>unsecured</b> homes. Scattered power outages were reported throughout the island. A few landslides were also reported {{as a result of}} the storm. Damage from the storm totaled $26,000 on the island. Relatively little damage was recorded in Futuna; there, the storm downed several trees and stranded a yacht on a reef. On Niuafo'ou, a weather station recorded sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts of up to 75km/h (45mph), along with a minimum pressure of 991hPa (mbar). Minor damage, consisting of fallen branches and isolated power outages also occurred on Niue.|$|E
5|$|After the {{elections}} {{in the fall of}} 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding the state government or making tax provisions. This rapidly led to a crisis as the state government began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run the state government, Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided the state with more than $1 million (USD) in <b>unsecured</b> loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. There was little the legislature could do but watch.|$|E
5|$|Although {{unknown to}} the Australians at the time, the earlier attack on Lang Phuoc Hai had been a {{deliberate}} attempt by the Viet Cong to provoke a reaction from 1 ATF. As such {{there would be no}} withdrawal on this occasion. Anticipating that any relief force would move by road, the Viet Cong had subsequently established an extensive ambush in the buildings alongside Route 44, which led into the village itself. Although the presence of this trap was not detected by the Australians, Murphy's evasion had ensured that his APCs had avoided it, moving the infantry by a cross-country route instead. However, with C Company delayed as a result, A Company made their airmobile assault onto an <b>unsecured</b> landing zone at 13:45, supported only by indirect fire from the artillery at Dat Do in suppression, which was initially limited due to delay in setting up the fire support base. Under the command of Major Owen O'Brien, A Company then began to advance into the fringe of thick rainforest to secure the southern edge of the landing zone for the arrival of B Company and the remainder of the battalion. Finally, over 30 minutes after the lead company had flown in, the APCs began to receive sniper fire as they neared the landing zone.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 February 6 RAR deployed into the area north-west of Hoi My by American UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) {{in an attempt to}} cut off the anticipated Viet Cong withdrawal, establishing blocking and assault forces. Following an airmobile assault into an <b>unsecured</b> landing zone at 13:45, A Company 6 RAR was subsequently surprised by a strong, well-sited and dug-in Viet Cong force, which, rather than withdrawing, had likely remained in location as part of an attempt to ambush any reaction force sent to the area. The Australians were soon contacted by heavy small arms fire, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. A Company subsequently broke contact and withdrew under heavy fire from {{what appeared to be a}} Viet Cong base area. Initially believing they were opposed by only a company, 6 RAR subsequently launched a quick attack by two companies. However, unknown to the Australians the Viet Cong had been reinforced and they now faced a battalion-sized force in well prepared positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} {{was found}} on 22November 1918 {{at a depth of}} , and was salvaged on 12August 1922. Investigations indicated that just one third of the cargo had been stowed in the hold, the rest <b>unsecured</b> on deck. The salvage operation turned into a bizarre public attraction; for example, a sewing machine from the steamer was smashed into pieces and sold for one crown each. It is estimated that about 20,000 people came to watch the raising of the ship, requiring the addition of trains from Norrköping. Newsreels featuring the raising of the ship were shown in cinemas all over Sweden. In order to finance the salvage operation, the Per Brahe was sent on a macabre tour throughout Sweden. The newspapers fed people's superstitions that the mythical creatures of the forests had claimed Bauer by sinking the ship. The most common theme was connected to the tale Agneta och sjökungen (Agneta and the Sea King) from 1910 in which the Sea King lures a maiden into the depths. On 18August 1922, the Bauers were buried at the Östra cemetery in Jönköping (in quarter 04 plot number 06).|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and {{included}} {{the sale of}} Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United's financial situation with the new stadium, {{and the threat of}} administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United's Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club's plight through a series of meetings and events, including a 'Scarf of Unity', which was a collection of scarfs from various clubs which was long enough to stretch {{around the perimeter of the}} pitch. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd's 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for £1, with which he also inherited the club's estimated £15 million debt. Kassam reduced the £9 million of the debt to just £900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which <b>unsecured</b> creditors who were owed over £1,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for £6 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled. The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unsecured</b> {{creditors}} {{are generally}} {{divided into two}} classes: <b>unsecured</b> priority creditors and general <b>unsecured</b> creditors. <b>Unsecured</b> priority creditors are further subdivided into classes {{as described in the}} law. In some cases the assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all priority <b>unsecured</b> creditors in full; in such cases the general <b>unsecured</b> creditors receive nothing.|$|E
25|$|Secured and <b>unsecured</b> {{creditors}} {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both secured and <b>unsecured</b> creditors {{are ahead of}} shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the <b>unsecured</b> creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the <b>unsecured</b> creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|Dynegy {{agreed to}} auction off its Roseton and Danskammer energy plants in New York state in order to emerge from bankruptcy. Dynegy had signed a sale-leaseback {{agreement}} in 2001 with Public Services Enterprise Group for the Roseton and Danskammer facilities. Fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction {{would be used to}} pay bondholders (up to $571 million), while the remaining 50 percent would be used to pay <b>unsecured</b> creditors. The <b>unsecured</b> creditors would get $200 million in cash. <b>Unsecured</b> creditors also would receive 99 percent of Dynegy's new stock, with the company retaining the rest (with warrants to purchase 13.5 percent of the stock after five years). Dynegy also agreed to pay holders of $206 million in subordinated capital income securities just $55 million in principal and $16 million in interest to settle their claims. The bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between Dynegy Holdings and Dynegy, Inc.|$|E

25|$|As the {{stalemate}} between HSG and its creditors continued, on May 24, 2010 the Texas Rangers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575 million. Much of the <b>unsecured</b> debt was owed in back salary. Officially, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez topped {{the list of}} <b>unsecured</b> creditors with an estimated $24.9 million owed by the Rangers. Additionally, the Rangers also owed Baltimore Orioles pitcher Kevin Millwood $12.9 million, and current Rangers third baseman Michael Young $3.9 million. At a press conference, the Greenberg-Ryan group proposed to buy the team for $575 million. The sale would repay all the team's creditors, including players owed back salary.|$|E
25|$|Because LCDS trades {{are linked}} to secured {{obligations}} with much higher recovery values than the <b>unsecured</b> bond obligations that are typically assumed {{the cheapest to deliver}} in respect of vanilla CDS, LCDS spreads are generally much tighter than CDS trades on the same name.|$|E
25|$|If the Trustee (or debtor in possession, in many chapter 11 cases) rejects a contract, the debtor's {{bankruptcy}} {{estate is}} subject to ordinary breach of contract damages, but the damages amount is an obligation and is generally treated as an <b>unsecured</b> claim.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics argue}} that limited {{liability}} favors creditors {{who are in the}} position to negotiate secured terms, whereas small creditors' debts are left <b>unsecured.</b> Others argue that while some limited liability is beneficial, the privilege ought not to extend to liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury.|$|E
25|$|The FDIC {{created the}} Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to {{strengthen}} confidence and encourage liquidity {{in the banking}} system by guaranteeing newly issued senior <b>unsecured</b> debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.|$|E

25|$|The basic loan process {{involves}} a lender providing a short-term <b>unsecured</b> loan to be repaid at the borrower's next payday. Typically, some verification of employment or income is involved (via pay stubs and bank statements), although {{according to one}} source, some payday lenders do not verify income or run credit checks.

25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} <b>unsecured</b> mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an <b>unsecured</b> SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine shutoff. On 29 November, the 2007–2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|E
