5|$|World War II {{was also}} the first {{conflict}} in which women, other than nurses, were allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. However, when the United States entered World War II, Puerto Rican nurses volunteered for service but were not accepted into the Army or Navy Nurse Corps. As a result, many of the island's women work force migrated to the mainland <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the factories which produced military equipment. In 1944, the Army Nurse Corps decided to actively recruit Puerto Rican nurses so that Army hospitals would not {{have to deal with the}} language barriers. Among them was Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler, who became one of the first Puerto Rican female military officers.|$|E

25|$|After college, Coons {{worked in}} Washington, D.C., for the Investor Responsibility Research Center, where {{he wrote a}} book on South Africa and the U.S. {{divestment}} movement. He then worked as a volunteer for the South African Council of Churches and as a relief worker in Kenya, before returning to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for the Coalition for the Homeless in New York. In 1992, he earned a J.D. degree from Yale Law School, and a master's degree in ethics from Yale Divinity School.|$|E

25|$|For this reason, {{many from}} this {{municipality}} {{and others from}} the Sierra Gorda, have migrated out to cities in Mexico and to the United States in order to work. The municipality estimates that about 35% of its population has migrated abroad, equaling about 8 thousand people. Others suggest the numbers are even higher, with an estimate of four people in the United States for each family here. No one knows exactly how many {{from the state of}} Querétaro have gone to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or the amount which is sent back in remittances each year. However, it is estimated that the Sierra Gorda region receives between 50,000 and 100,000 USD per day or 18.2 million dollars each year. This is larger than the municipal budget of Pinal de Amoles. These remittances have come to overshadow earnings made locally from small shops, livestock and agriculture. In Pinal de Amoles and other areas of the Sierra Gorda, the dollar {{has become part of the}} economy, especially around Christmas when many come back to visit families for the holiday season. This has led to many businesses accepting the dollar as a medium of exchange in many businesses including restaurants and bars. Many families now use it as a regional currency. However, remittance money sent back can vary depending on economic and political factors. As of January 2011, the amount sent back to the Sierra Gorda fell about forty percent. Officials blame the security situation on the US-Mexican border, with many younger people in the US not visiting during the Christmas season.|$|E
500|$|In November, Higgins {{released}} a self-titled extended play (EP) which contained four songs including [...] "All for Believing" [...] and [...] "Greed for Your Love", the song {{she had written}} in Europe. In 2004 she travelled to the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with British musician and record producer John Porter and engineer and mixer Jay Newland. Porter assembled a group of session musicians for the album, including drummer Michael Barker, bassist John Patitucci and cellist Martin Tillman.|$|E

This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

500|$|Wennersten {{contacted}} Sparks when Jasenko Selimovic, {{the head}} of SR Radioteatern, decided that the station would produce {{a number of new}} musicals. She thought Sparks would be suitable for the format: [...] "They are a bit extravagant; they have a larger-than-life quality, and above all, they make music that is colourful enough for it not to feel like you miss a visual component." [...] Sparks were initially somewhat surprised by the invitation to write a musical for Swedish radio, and were hesitant to take on the project. However, after several months of persuasive effort from Wennersten, via e-mail and telephone, they decided to accept the challenge. [...] "We originally thought of it as a side project between albums, but once we started working on it, it took on a bigger life," [...] Sparks have said. [...] "As Americans we have almost abandoned radio drama and it was truly exhilarating for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a medium where the imagination of the listener is so integral a part of the work. Aside from our love of Bergman, we have a love of Orson Welles and his use of the medium of radio was something that inspired us in this work." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{mayor of}} Newark, New Jersey, he [...] "drew {{criticism}} from liberal allies for embracing charter schools and voucher programs advocated by libertarians." [...] "He also championed “enterprise zones,” a free-market approach to solving urban blight credited {{to the late}} Jack Kemp, a hard-core supply-sider and occasional Republican presidential contender who helped raise money for Booker’s first mayoral campaign." [...] Besides social media advances, Booker {{wants to see the}} rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. “We’re not moving at the speed of innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries are leaving the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies are leaving the U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs. Booker supports abortion rights and affirmative action.|$|E
500|$|With {{no single}} party having {{achieved}} an overall majority, the 2010 general election {{resulted in the}} first hung parliament since 1974. When {{it became clear that}} no party would achieve the outright majority needed to form the next government, the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for putting together an administration with the other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron to act [...] "in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage". However, having stated before the election that the party with the most seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Speaking outside the Liberal Democrat headquarters he said: [...] "It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest." [...] Brown said he intended to play his part in securing [...] "a stable, strong and principled government", and indicated his willingness to speak with both Clegg and Cameron on how to achieve this, saying: [...] "What we have seen are no ordinary election results." [...] But shortly after, Cameron held a press conference at which he invited the Liberal Democrats to talks, saying: [...] "I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems - the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system." ...|$|E

"Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential.

[...] While some of his lyrics are reminiscent of political slogans, such as [...] "Rights for Gays", he comments that his intention was to follow some social idioms [...] "through to [...] absurd conclusions where interesting things are more likely to happen. That's when the politics of aesthetics it's not in the protest lyrics." [...] On the song [...] "Cop Killer", he explains, [...] "I'm not talking about shooting or killing a human being, I'm talking about ... the cops in our heads, the cops that are everything other than us, everything inhuman, that would put <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> towards an end other than each other." ...|$|E

In August 2004, the Sugababes released [...] "Caught in a Moment", the fourth and final single from Three, and also confirmed that recording for the group's fourth album had commenced. During their break between September 2004 and August 2005, speculation arose about the band's future, which included rumours of a greatest hits album being released and that the group would later split. Band member Heidi Range expressed her distaste with the media speculation, saying: [...] "You know what? At first it would make us angry, then we'd laugh it off and now we don't even {{pay any attention to}} it.
