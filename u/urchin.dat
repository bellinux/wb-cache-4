5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea <b>urchin</b> populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea <b>urchin</b> species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea <b>urchin</b> populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E

Similarly, sea <b>urchin</b> shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{polonium}} {{was produced}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project during World War II. It was a critical part of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki in 1945.

The <b>urchin</b> ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.|$|E

5|$|Monsanto {{was already}} {{working on a}} key {{component}} of the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the <b>urchin</b> detonators.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{keystone}} species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into <b>urchin</b> barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest.

5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the <b>urchin</b> initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E

5|$|The Sea <b>Urchin</b> is a 1913 American silent short romantic drama film {{directed}} by Edwin August and starring Jeanie MacPherson and Lon Chaney. The film was {{the earliest known}} character role by Lon Chaney and the first screenplay by MacPherson. The story follows a hunchback fisherman, who finds a young girl and raised her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} marrying her. A handsome boy soon gains her affections and the hunchback threatens him with a knife. The next day, the boat tips over during an argument and the hunchback saves the girl. As the young lovers reunite, he sees how happy they are together and he takes his leave. The film was released on August 22, 1913 and was played across the United States. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea <b>urchin</b> populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.|$|E
