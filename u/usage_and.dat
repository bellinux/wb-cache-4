40|$|Trade <b>usages</b> <b>and</b> {{business}} practices are {{key elements of}} international commerce. In their day-to-day activities, traders and business {{people around the world}} constantly rely upon trade <b>usages</b> <b>and</b> {{business practices}} across a variety of industries. <b>Usages</b> <b>and</b> practices tend to be dignified by the business community with a status equivalent to that of actual law. As a matter of fact, many business persons often tend to regard trade <b>usages</b> <b>and</b> business practices as very powerful tools to ensure the stability of their bargain and, at times, transact business solely based on such <b>usages</b> <b>and</b> practices, without any written contract. Due to the importance of this subject, distinguished international legal commentators have often attempted to define trade <b>usages</b> <b>and</b> business practices and, in doing so, they have indeed succeeded at providing a substantial amount of theoretical ammunition {{for the benefit of the}} interpreter. What is more challenging, in my opinion, is to understand the interplay (and the related legal and commercial consequences) arising from the application of trade <b>usages</b> <b>and</b> business practices alongside the black letter rules of international conventions and model law instruments, which often refer to <b>usages</b> <b>and</b> practices without defining them...|$|R

The paper identifies the terminology or ontology used to describe a business model, and compares this terminology with previous work. Then the general <b>usages,</b> roles <b>and</b> potential of the concept are outlined. Finally, the connection between the business model concept and Information Systems is described in the form of eight propositions to be analyzed in future work...|$|R
