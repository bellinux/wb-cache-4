Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the rebound effect.|$|E

Some advocacy groups are concerned that workers may receive reduced benefits or incur additional costs as a result of employers' cost-control strategies.
