Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and <b>Unlimited</b> levels, and pilots who have reached Advanced and <b>Unlimited</b> levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|E

5|$|The team {{sought to}} create an {{immersive}} world for the player and {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Commercially, Flight <b>Unlimited</b> II performed well enough to recoup its development costs. Critics lauded the game's graphics and simulated airspace, and several praised its physics. However, some considered the game to be inferior to Microsoft Flight Simulator '98. Following the completion of Flight <b>Unlimited</b> II, its team split up to develop Flight <b>Unlimited</b> III (1999) and Flight Combat (later Jane's Attack Squadron) simultaneously. Both projects were troubled, and they contributed to the closure of Looking Glass in May 2000.|$|E

The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010.

On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the <b>unlimited</b> plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the <b>unlimited</b> plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E

5|$|Flight <b>Unlimited</b> II is a 1997 flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Looking Glass Studios {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. The player controls one of five planes in the airspace of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent aircraft directed by real-time air traffic control. The game eschews the aerobatics focus of its predecessor, Flight <b>Unlimited,</b> in favor of general civilian aviation. As such, new physics code and an engine were developed, the former because the programmer of Flight Unlimiteds computational fluid dynamics system, Seamus Blackley, had left the company.|$|E
5|$|Flight <b>Unlimited</b> III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five planes first included in Flight <b>Unlimited</b> II. Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight <b>Unlimited</b> II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|E

5|$|Flight <b>Unlimited</b> was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight <b>Unlimited</b> based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight <b>Unlimited</b> in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight <b>Unlimited.</b> Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight <b>Unlimited</b> II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the albums produced, music from the original soundtracks of the SaGa games has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Books are available for Romancing SaGa 3, Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song, SaGa Frontier, SaGa Frontier II, and <b>Unlimited</b> SaGa. The compositions from <b>Unlimited</b> SaGa were rewritten by Tadaomi Idogawa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. The music for the other books was written by Asako Niwa for piano solos of similar difficulty.|$|E
