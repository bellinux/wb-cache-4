(4) Adaptive optics: In {{adaptive}} optics (AO) a deformable mirror {{is used to}} pre-distort a transmitted laser beam so that on its passage through the turbulent atmosphere it arrives at the receiver as an <b>undistorted</b> <b>wave.</b> In most long range OW demonstrations that {{have been carried out}} to-date AO has been used to attempt to mitigate the effects of the turbulent channel. Unfortunately, as pointed out by Stotts et al. [164] [...] "the ability of an {{adaptive optics}} (AO) system to compensate turbulence along a path is limited by the transmitter and receiver Rayleigh ranges, proportional to the diameter of the optics squared and inverse of the wavelength of light utilized." [...] AO is ineffective when the total range is greater than the sum of the Rayleigh ranges. The Rayleigh range is R [...]...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Asymptotic decay {{laws for}} planar and nonplanar shock waves {{and the first}} order {{associated}} discontinuities that {{catch up with the}} shock from behind are obtained using four different approximation methods. The singular surface theory is used to derive a pair of transport equations for the shock strength and the associated first order discontinuity, which represents the effect of precursor disturbances that overtake the shock from behind. The asymptotic behaviour of both the discontinuities is completely analysed. It is noticed that the decay of a first order discontinuity is much faster than the decay of the shock; indeed, if the amplitude of the accompanying discontinuity is small then the shock decays faster as compared to the case when the amplitude of the first order discontinuity is finite (not necessarily small). It is shown that for a weak shock, the precursor disturbance evolves like an acceleration wave at the leading order. We show that the asymptotic decay laws for weak shocks and the accompanying first order discontinuity are exactly the ones obtained by using the theory of nonlinear geometrical optics, the theory of simple waves using Riemann invariants, and the theory of relatively undistorted waves. It follows that the relatively <b>undistorted</b> <b>wave</b> approximation is a consequence of the simple wave formalism using Riemann invariants. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—New {{solutions}} of the homogeneous {{wave equation}} {{of the type}} usually referred to as relatively <b>undistorted</b> <b>waves</b> are presented. Such solutions relate to the so-called “splash modes”, from which indeed they can be generated by applying the Laguerre polynomial operator. Accordingly, the solutions here presented resort to the relativistic Laguerre polynomials — introduced about one decade ago within a purely mathematical context — which in fact appear as modulating factor of the basic “splash mode ” waveform. Similar solutions of the homogeneous spinor wave equation are also suggested. 1...|$|R

40|$|A general {{method is}} {{developed}} for finding approximate "asymptotic " solutions {{to a large}} class of non-linear partial differential equations. Solutions are presented for signals having one predominant mode, with a characteristic length scale much shorter than all other lengths characteristic of the signal geometry or of the medium being traversed. Non-linear {{distortion of a signal}} of arbitrary initial waveform is described, in addition to the relaxation damping and modulation as it penetrates disturbed or inhomogeneous regions. Equations also are derived showing how the signal drives its "background", forcing this slowly to drift. The asymptotic procedure extends the basic concept of "relatively <b>undistorted</b> <b>waves</b> " (Courant & Hilbert, 1965; Varley & Cumberbatch, 1970) using an approach applied initially to the modulation of non-linear pulses (Parker & Varley, 1968). For disturbances of restricted amplitude this description gives a "non-linear acoustics", allowing profile distortion and shock formation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Propagation of {{disturbances}} {{through a}} uniform region of a relaxing gas in a duct with spatially varying cross section is analysed using {{the methods of}} relatively <b>undistorted</b> <b>waves</b> and weakly nonlinear geometrical optics. Particular {{attention is focused on}} situations when the disturbance amplitude is finite, arbitrarily small and not so small. In certain situations a complete history of the evolutionary behaviour of waves including weak shocks can be traced out. The asymptotic decay laws for weak shocks in a non-relaxing gas are exactly recovered. The damping effects of relaxation and non-planar wavefront configurations on the distortion, attenuation and shock formation of pulses, as they propagate, are described in detail. In the small-amplitude high-frequency limit, a solution up to the second order is obtained and numerical computations are carried out for typical values of the physical parameters involved in the solution. Transport equations are derived for signals having all possible wave modes which are mutually coupled and interact resonantly among themselves. The progressive wave approach describes the far field behaviour which is governed by the generalized Burger's equation...|$|R

The general form of this Bateman transform in an orthogonal curvilinear cylindrical coordinate system is discussed and a specific problem of physical feasibility of the obtained solutions, connected with their dependence on the cyclic coordinate, is addressed. The limiting case of zero eccentricity, in which the elliptic cylindrical coordinates turn into their circular cylindrical counterparts, is shown to correspond to the focused wave modes of the Bessel-Gauss type...|$|R
50|$|The most {{efficient}} valve-based RF amplifiers operate Class C. If used with no tuned circuit in the output, this would distort the input signal, producing harmonics. However, class C amplifiers normally use a high Q output network which removes the harmonics, leaving an <b>undistorted</b> sine <b>wave</b> {{identical to the}} input waveform. Class C is suitable only for amplifying signals with a constant amplitude, such as FM, FSK, and some CW (Morse code) signals. Where the amplitude of the input signal to the amplifier varies as with single sideband modulation, amplitude modulation, video and complex digital signals, the amplifier must operate class A or AB, to preserve the envelope of the driving signal in an undistorted form. Such amplifiers {{are referred to as}} linear amplifiers.|$|R

40|$|The spatio-temporal {{evolution}} of nonlinear oscillations in multi-species plasma is revisited {{to provide more}} insight into the physics of phase mixing by constructing two sets of nonlinear solutions {{up to the second}} order. The first solution exhibits perfect oscillations in the linear regime and phase mixing appears only nonlinearly in the second order {{as a response to the}} ponderomotive forces. This response can be both direct and indirect. The indirect contribution of the ponderomotive forces appears through self-consistently generated low frequency fields. Furthermore, the direct and indirect contributions of the ponderomotive forces on the phase mixing process is explored and it is found that the indirect contribution is negligible in an electron-ion plasma and it disappears in the case of electron-positron plasma, yet represents an equal contribution in the electron-positron-ion plasma. However, the second solution does not exhibit any phase mixing due to the absence of ponderomotive forces but results in an <b>undistorted</b> nonlinear traveling <b>wave.</b> These investigations have relevance for laboratory/astrophysical multi-species plasma.

We use a double pulse-echo technique to provide an accurate measure of transit time through the thickness of aluminum discs produced by hydrostatic extrusion (25 % area reduction). The residual stress state produced during extrusion is axi-symmetric and we are able to separately determine residual radial and hoop stresses by a single longitudinal wave measurement at points on the disc face. The technique is extremely rapid and accurate, and the acoustic results are cross-checked by both x-ray measurements and finite element simulation of the extrusion process...|$|R
