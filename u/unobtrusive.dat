5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, <b>unobtrusive,</b> and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Warnecke's {{design for}} the square {{was based on the}} {{architectural}} theory of contextualism. Not only did Warnecke's design build the first modern buildings on Lafayette Square, but they were the first buildings in the city to utilize contextualism as a design philosophy. Warnecke's {{design for the}} Markey National Courts Building was to create tall, flat structures in red brick which would serve as relatively <b>unobtrusive</b> backgrounds to the lighter-colored residential homes like the Cutts-Madison House. The Cutts-Madison House, Cosmos Club building, and Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House were joined, and a courtyard built between them and the National Courts Building.|$|E
5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his {{generosity}} and kindness {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the <b>unobtrusive</b> {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, <b>unobtrusive</b> and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E
5|$|Well {{established}} in the imperial capital, Honório Hermeto campaigned in 1829 to become a general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national lower house) as a representative for his native Minas Gerais. He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his policies. As a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an <b>unobtrusive</b> role for the first couple of years, having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at first glance. Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had self-confidence and a powerful charisma, and was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of its citizens on 13 January, the US government stated that it recognised that Zanzibar lay within Britain's sphere of influence, and would not intervene. The US did, however, urge that Britain cooperate with other Southeast African countries to restore order. The first British military vessel on the scene was the survey ship HMS Owen, which was diverted from the Kenyan coast and arrived {{on the evening of}} 12January. Owen was joined on 15January by the frigate Rhyl and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Hebe. While the lightly armed Owen had been able to provide the revolutionaries with an <b>unobtrusive</b> reminder of Britain's military power, the Hebe and Rhyl were different matters. Due to inaccurate reports that the situation in Zanzibar was deteriorating, the Rhyl was carrying a company of troops of the first battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment from Kenya, the embarkation of which was widely reported in the Kenyan media, and would hinder British negotiations with Zanzibar. The Hebe had just finished removing stores from the naval depot at Mombasa and was loaded with weapons and explosives. Although the Revolutionary Council was unaware of the nature of Hebes cargo, the Royal Navy's refusal to allow a search of the ship created suspicion ashore and rumours circulated that she was an amphibious assault ship.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1859 {{there was}} no {{standard}} colour, although {{there is evidence that}} the lettering and Royal Cypher were sometimes picked out in gold. In 1859, a bronze green colour became standard until 1874. Initially, it was thought that the green colour would be <b>unobtrusive.</b> Too <b>unobtrusive,</b> as it turned out — people kept walking into them. Red became the standard colour in 1874, although ten more years elapsed before every box in the UK had been repainted.|$|E

25|$|We hate {{poetry that}} has a palpable design upon us—and {{if we do not}} agree, seems to put its hand in its {{breeches}} pocket. Poetry should be great & <b>unobtrusive,</b> a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.|$|E
25|$|The modern office wing {{that connects}} the parish hall to the church has {{vertical}} wood siding, large casement windows and a flat roof. The modern classroom extension {{to the west of}} the parish hall has a similar treatment. Both of these elements are sited so as to be <b>unobtrusive</b> from the street.|$|E
25|$|The salvage of {{a vessel}} that is damaged but still afloat is called afloat salvage. This type of salvage is mostly <b>unobtrusive</b> and {{involves}} primarily damage control work such as hull welding, stabilization (rebalancing ballast tanks and shifting cargo) and structural bracing. In some cases, the vessel can remain underway with little disruption {{to its original}} purpose and crew.|$|E
25|$|Pawson {{played a}} number of times for Oxford during the {{following}} three seasons, picking up dismissals at a steady if unspectacular rate. His final appearance was in the Varsity Match against Cambridge at Lord's in July 1911. Although Oxford won the game, Pawson himself had an <b>unobtrusive</b> match, scoring 5* and 11* from number eleven and claiming no dismissals.|$|E
25|$|Show {{events such}} as Western {{pleasure}} use much flashier equipment, unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and <b>unobtrusive.</b> Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver. The rider may add a jacket or vest, and women's clothing in particular features vivid colors and even, depending on current fads, rhinestones or sequins.|$|E
25|$|In office, Gowrie was {{a popular}} if <b>unobtrusive</b> figure in Australia. The days when Governors-General {{exercised}} significant power, or even participated in negotiations between the Australian and British governments, had now passed, but Gowrie set a precedent in 1938 when he toured the Netherlands East Indies {{at the invitation of}} the colonial administration. This {{was the first time that}} a Governor-General had represented Australia abroad.|$|E
25|$|The Kangxi Emperor {{was also}} {{fond of the}} Jesuits' respectful and <b>unobtrusive</b> manner; they spoke the Chinese {{language}} well, and wore the silk robes of the elite. In 1692, when Fr. Thomas Pereira requested tolerance for Christianity, the Kangxi Emperor was willing to oblige, and issued the Edict of Toleration, which recognized Catholicism, barred attacks on their churches, and legalized their missions {{and the practice of}} Christianity by the Chinese people.|$|E
25|$|Many of Llywelyn's Welsh allies had {{abandoned}} him during England's invasion of Gwynedd, preferring an overlord far away {{rather than one}} nearby. These Welsh lords expected an <b>unobtrusive</b> English crown, however King John had castles built in Ystwyth in Ceredigion, and John's direct interference in Powys and the Perfeddwlad caused many of these Welsh lords to rethink their position. John's policy in Wales demonstrated his resolve to subject the Welsh, argued Professor John Davies.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} viaduct {{had not had}} parapets and {{had probably}} never had handrails, which were now essential for safety. It was considered appropriate to make them of steel in an authentic period style, and after examining photographs of the cast iron railings of Chirk Aqueduct and other early examples, masonry copings and light-coloured railings were provided. The preservation of the 300mm distortion of arch 2 was maintained; the light coloured railings are <b>unobtrusive</b> visually against the sky.|$|E
25|$|At the {{northern}} end of the base there is a 9-hole golf course, the Sail Ho Golf Course. It was built in the 1920s as a recreational facility for the base. It is now privately operated and open to the public. Sam Snead managed the course as a recreation officer during his stint in the Navy. An unusual feature of the golf course is an <b>unobtrusive</b> pair of graves between two fairways, where a former commander and his wife are buried.|$|E
25|$|Upon emergence, first-instar {{caterpillars}} (or larvae) {{eat their}} eggshells. The caterpillars from a clutch initially stay together, feeding in a small, <b>unobtrusive</b> web. Second or third instar caterpillars disperse into smaller groups. Then the third instars tend {{to feed and}} rest solitarily; they rest beneath dead leaves at night and during bad weather. The caterpillar hibernates for the winter in a hibernaculum, made from a curled dead leaf by spinning its edges together. Hibernacula are usually close to the ground. Although most caterpillars hibernate singly, they sometimes group in twos and threes, although 15 to 20 caterpillars {{have been found in}} single hibernaculum.|$|E

25|$|Ruby on Rails is also {{noteworthy}} for its {{extensive use}} of the JavaScript libraries, Prototype and Script.aculo.us, for scripting Ajax actions. Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight SOAP for web services; this was later replaced by RESTful web services. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called <b>Unobtrusive</b> JavaScript to separate the functionality (or logic) from {{the structure of the}} web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. Additionally, CoffeeScript was introduced in Rails 3.1 as the default Javascript language.|$|E
25|$|Warnecke's {{design was}} based on the {{architectural}} theory of contextualism, where modern buildings are harmonized with the urban forms usual to a traditional city. Not only did Warnecke's design build the first modern buildings on Lafayette Square, but they were the first buildings in the city to utilize contextualism as a design philosophy. Warnecke's design for the National Courts Building was to create tall, flat structures in red brick which would serve as relatively <b>unobtrusive</b> backgrounds to the lighter-colored residential homes like the Cutts–Madison House.

25|$|The jedars of Jabal Lakhdar {{seem to have}} {{displayed}} a dedicatory inscription {{on one side of}} the top. This inscription was in Latin, but not deeply engraved and hence in every case is now almost illegible; the inscribed blocks are also very damaged. Enough remains only to confirm that these were tombs, but not whose they were. However, these jedars display an enormous range of stonecutters' marks, from isolated letters to partial names. Most of these are also Latin, some have been postulated to be Tifinagh. There are a few <b>unobtrusive</b> Christian symbols, and a couple of roughly carved panels (apparently hunting scenes) similar to many ancient Lybico-Berber rock carvings.|$|E
25|$|Caillebotte painted many {{domestic}} and familial scenes, interiors, and portraits. Many {{of his paintings}} depict members of his family; Young Man at His Window (Jeune Homme à la fenêtre) (1875) shows René in the home on rue de Miromesnil; The Orange Trees (Les Orangers) (1878), depicts Martial Jr. and his cousin Zoé {{in the garden of}} the family property at Yerres; and Portraits in the Country (Portraits à la campagne) (1875) includes Caillebotte's mother along with his aunt, cousin, and a family friend. There are scenes of dining, card playing, piano playing, reading, and sewing, all executed in an intimate, <b>unobtrusive</b> manner that portrays the quiet ritual of upper-class indoor life.|$|E
25|$|Designing {{systems in}} churches and similar {{religious}} facilities often poses a challenge, because the speakers {{may have to}} be <b>unobtrusive</b> to blend in with antique woodwork and stonework. In some cases, audio designers have designed custom-painted speaker cabinets so that the speakers will blend in with the church architecture. Some church facilities, such as sanctuaries or chapels are long rooms with low ceilings, which means that additional fill-in speakers are needed throughout the room to give good coverage. An additional challenge with church SR systems is that, once installed, they are often operated by amateur volunteers from the congregation, which means that they must be easy to operate and troubleshoot.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Ireland, {{phosphorus}} enrichment {{of lakes}} due to agriculture {{is a significant}} problem. Locally available laterite—a low-grade bauxite rich in iron and aluminium—is used in acid solution, followed by precipitation to remove phosphorus and heavy metals at several sewage treatment facilities. Calcium-, iron- and aluminium-rich solid media are recommended for phosphorus removal. A study, using both laboratory tests and pilot-scale constructed wetlands, reports the effectiveness of granular laterite in removing phosphorus and heavy metals from landfill leachate. Initial laboratory studies show that laterite is capable of 99% removal of phosphorus from solution. A pilot-scale experimental facility containing laterite achieved 96% removal of phosphorus. This removal is greater than reported in other systems. Initial removals of aluminium and iron by pilot-scale facilities have been up to 85% and 98% respectively. Percolating columns of laterite removed enough cadmium, chromium and lead to undetectable concentrations. There is a possible application of this low-cost, low-technology, visually <b>unobtrusive,</b> efficient system for rural areas with dispersed point sources of pollution.|$|E
25|$|The three jedars of Jabal Lakhdar are {{believed}} to be the oldest. Within this group, the relative chronology is now believed known, from study of the stonemasons' marks. The largest, with funerary chambers, known as Jedar A, is the oldest; very soon after, solid Jedar B was constructed by many of the same workmen. The last jedar, C, {{is believed to have been}} incomplete when it was very hurriedly finished and its occupant interred, perhaps a generation later. Taking into account the <b>unobtrusive</b> nature of the Christian symbols, it is believed the occupants of these tombs were not themselves Christian but ruled over Christian subjects. Remains of a wooden coffin from Jedar B returned a C14 date of 410 ± 50 CE. Calibrating the date on the OxCal system gives a range of 410 - 615 AD at 95.4% probability. A recent re-reading of the dedication from Jedar A has proposed a 4th-century date.|$|E
25|$|With little {{talent and}} less acquirements, he was, {{throughout}} his life, {{one of the}} most considerable men in the country and a striking instance of that most agreeable truth—that courage and honesty in great situations more than supply the place of policy or talent. It was not his relationship to Lord Rockingham, though no doubt an advantage, nor his princely fortune, though a yet greater, which conferred the sort of importance he enjoyed for half a century in this country. He derived it more directly and more certainly from his goodness and generosity, and from the combination of gentleness and courage which distinguished his amiable and unpretending character. Such unblemished purity and such <b>unobtrusive</b> intrepidity, such generosity of feeling, firmness of purpose, and tenderness of heart, meeting in one of high station and princely fortune, commanded the affection and confidence of the public; and Lord Fitzwilliam enjoyed them, beyond even those of his own class who united much greater reach of understanding and more assiduity of business to superior personal accomplishments and advantages.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabinets}} of the Netherlands and Belgium {{are excellent}} models of design. These {{pieces of furniture}} were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, would hardly to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the Oudenaarde Town Hall. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, {{each of which is}} carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an <b>unobtrusive</b> figure. In the Palais de Justice we see that great scheme of decoration which takes up the whole of the fireplace end of the hall. Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms.|$|E
25|$|Airtemp {{was more}} {{sophisticated}} and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and <b>unobtrusive.</b> Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E
25|$|The large main {{stage was}} {{elevated}} {{and set up}} at the end of each arena, with a long catwalk extending from its middle to the center. The midsection had a circular stage, while the pathway ended into a heart-shaped stage. In order to facilitate Madonna and her dancers to appear anytime onstage, there were openings throughout the length of the stage, as well as causeways for disappearing beneath the structure at the end of each song. At the end of the main stage there were three large video screens in front of which the band was present, along with Madonna's two background vocalists. Stufish, who had previously developed the structures for The MDNA Tour, were enlisted for the stage on Rebel Heart also. They developed the elaborate and the main inspiration behind the shape was a hybrid between a cross, an arrow and a heart. The perpendicular structures emanating from the middle of the runway allowed Madonna and her dancers to reach more audience. A number of barriers and encasings were supplied by Mojo Barriers to separate the stage from the audience and the front production areas. All the barriers were supplied in black aluminium, in line with Madonna’s wish for the barriers to be <b>unobtrusive.</b>|$|E
