25|$|With the {{incumbent}} mayor retiring, Lake sought {{to be elected}} as mayor in the November 2005 election. He faced two others: public relations worker Al McNair and crime-prevention officer Pete Backus. City debt emerged as a primary point of contention during the campaign, with Lake arguing that the debt is an investment {{in the community and}} was at a manageable level, and McNair arguing it was too high and uncontrollable. Lake won the election with an unexpectedly high number of votes (11,727) while spending $38,564. He identified airport expansion as his top priority. However, WestJet resisted flying to Kamloops by demanding guaranteed revenue and federal MP Betty Hinton and provincial MLA Kevin Krueger both saw highway upgrades as higher priorities. In 2006, Lake was appointed to the board of governors for B.C. Transit. Also in 2006, Lake opposed his council who voted in favour of sending a letter to the province requesting a ban on <b>uranium</b> <b>exploration</b> and mining and Lake sought reforms to the Agricultural Land Commission (via a motion to the Union of B.C. Municipalities) after they refused two Kamloops development applications. As {{a board member of the}} Thompson-Nicola Regional District, Lake suggested the province should enable local governments (outside of Metro Vancouver) to levy a gasoline tax so that local public transit could be removed from property taxes. While Kamloops was struggling with a bylaw to ban cosmetic pesticides, Lake advocated for a province wide ban. Lake traveled to Japan and China in October 2007 promoting Kamloops (and resulted in Chinese speed skaters using facilities in Kamloops to train for the 2010 Winter Olympics), and to Sri Lanka in January 2008 as part of a volunteer organization re-building homes lost in the 2004 tsunami. Lake would return to Sri Lanka in January 2011 to continue his volunteer work.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, UN geologists also {{discovered}} major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia.

In 1984, the IUREP Orientation Phase Mission to Somalia reported that the country had 5,000 tons of uranium reasonably assured resources (RAR), 11,000 tons of uranium estimated additional resources (EAR) in calcrete deposits, as well as 0–150,000 tons of uranium speculative resources (SR) in sandstone and calcrete deposits.

50|$|During World War II, {{the demand}} for uranium {{exploded}} as the United States and their allies, Britain and Canada, began the Manhattan Project to produce the first atomic weapons. As a result, in 1943 the Government of Canada expropriated the assets of Eldorado and formed a federal crown corporation, Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, to oversee Canadian <b>uranium</b> assets. <b>Exploration</b> for <b>uranium</b> was restricted to Eldorado and the Geological Survey of Canada.|$|R
