40|$|AbstractCells {{respond to}} diverse {{external}} stimuli by polymerizing cytoplasmic actin, and recent {{evidence indicates that}} GTPases can specify where this polymerization takes place. Actin assembly in stimulated blood platelets occurs where sequestered monomers add onto the fast-growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments (F-actin), which are capped in the resting cells. We report that D 3 and D 4 polyphosphoinositides, PI(4) P, PI(4, 5) P 2, PI(3, 4) P 2, and PI(3, 4, 5) P 3, <b>uncap</b> F-actin in resting permeabilized platelets. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), GTP, and GTPγS, but not GDPβS, also <b>uncap</b> F-actin in permeabilized platelets. GDPβS inhibits TRAP-induced F-actin <b>uncapping,</b> and PI(4, 5) P 2 overcomes this inhibition. Constitutively active mutant Rac, but not Rho, activates <b>uncapping</b> of F-actin. PI(4, 5) P 2 -binding peptides derived from gelsolin inhibit F-actin <b>uncapping</b> by TRAP, Rac, and GTPγS. TRAP and Rac induce rapid PI(4, 5) P 2 synthesis in permeabilized platelets. The findings establish a signaling pathway for actin assembly involving Rac in which the final message is phosphoinositide-mediated F-actin <b>uncapping...</b>|$|R

5|$|Booth {{was then}} {{selected}} for the Ashes tour of England in 1961; he and Victorian opening batsmen Bill Lawry, the two <b>uncapped</b> batsmen in the team, were regarded as the last two players chosen. Booth quickly gained a reputation for his attention to physical fitness. He led the Australians in their morning exercises during the sea voyage, which captain Richie Benaud made optional. After scoring 37 and seven against Worcestershire in his first match on English soil, Booth broke through for his first century for Australia, scoring 113 against Cambridge University in his fifth match in England. He made 59 against the Marylebone Cricket Club, but was overlooked {{for the first three}} Tests.|$|E
5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his <b>uncapped</b> appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Loxton's {{record was}} less spectacular despite playing {{in all but}} one of Victoria’s matches. He hit 77 and 35 not out in the opening match of the summer against the Indian tourists, and was rewarded with selection in an Australian XI to play the visitors ahead of the Tests. In what was effectively a Test trial, the <b>uncapped</b> all-rounder failed to impress with the bat, making a duck and six. He bowled extensively, sending down 47 overs and taking a total of 4/113 as the Australians fell to a defeat. Loxton was passed over for Test selection and returned to domestic competition, scoring 53 and taking a total of 4/56 in the next match against New South Wales, which the Victorians won by nine wickets. He then went into an unproductive sequence, failing to pass 31 and taking only three wickets in his next four matches over a two-month period. His seven wickets in the Sheffield Shield games cost almost 49 runs each. Despite this, the Australian captain Don Bradman had been impressed by what he saw of Loxton at domestic level, and the Victorian all-rounder was chosen for the Fifth and final Test against India. With the series already convincingly won 3–0, Australia decided to rest several players in order to trial up and coming cricketers ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Len Johnson, Loxton and fellow Victorian Ring were thus given their Test debuts.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} actin filament barbed end <b>uncapping</b> on Arp 2 / 3 complex function both in vivo and in vitro. Arp 2 / 3 complex redistributes rapidly and uniformly to the lamellar edge of activated wild-type platelets and fibroblasts but clusters in marginal actin filament clumps in gelsolin-null cells. Treatment of gelsolin-null platelets with the negative dominant N-WASp C-terminal CA domain {{has no effect on}} their residual actin nucleation activity, placing gelsolin actin filament severing, capping, and <b>uncapping</b> function upstream of Arp 2 / 3 complex nucleation. Actin filaments capped by gelsolin or the gelsolin homolog CapG fail to enhance Arp 2 / 3 complex nucleation in vitro, but <b>uncapping</b> of the barbed ends of these actin filaments restores their ability to potentiate Arp 2 / 3 complex nucleation. We conclude that Arp 2 / 3 complex contribution to actin filament nucleation in platelets and fibroblasts importantly requires free barbed ends generated by severing and <b>uncapping...</b>|$|R
5|$|When India {{toured the}} West Indies in June–July 2011, they chose a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar and others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missing out due to injuries. Kohli {{was one of}} three <b>uncapped</b> players in the Test squad. Kohli found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80. His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory, and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat. Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at five and was {{dismissed}} for 4 and 15 caught behind by Fidel Edwards in both innings. India {{went on to win the}} Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{simulating}} {{the growth of}} branched actin networks against obstacles has been developed. The method is based on simple stochastic events, including addition or removal of monomers at filament ends, capping of filament ends, nucleation of branches from existing filaments, and detachment of branches; the network structure for several different models of the branching process has also been studied. The models differ {{with regard to their}} inclusion of effects such as preferred branch orientations, filament <b>uncapping</b> at the obstacle, and preferential branching at filament ends. The actin ultrastructure near the membrane in lamellipodia is reasonably well produced if preferential branching {{in the direction of the}} obstacle or barbed-end <b>uncapping</b> effects are included. <b>Uncapping</b> effects cause the structures to have a few very long filaments that are similar to those seen in pathogen-induced "actin tails.
