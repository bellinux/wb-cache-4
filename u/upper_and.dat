5|$|Ice sledge {{hockey is}} open only to male {{competitors}} with a physical disability {{in the lower}} part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower limbs.|$|E

5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower masseteric ridges {{come close}} together below the first molars, {{but do not}} fuse. The {{back end of the}} lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E

5|$|The {{grey reef shark}} has a streamlined, {{moderately}} stout {{body with}} a long, blunt snout and large, round eyes. The <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth (usually 14 in the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> 13 in the lower). The upper teeth are triangular with slanted cusps, while the bottom teeth have narrower, erect cusps. The tooth serrations are larger in the upper jaw than in the lower. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized, {{and there is no}} ridge running between it and the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped).|$|E
5|$|The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than}} the {{connecting}} crests) and brachydont (low-crowned). On the upper first and second molar, the outer and inner valleys between the cusps and crests interpenetrate. Many accessory crests are present, including the mesolophs and mesolophids. The anterocone and anteroconid, the front cusps on the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower first molar, are not divided into smaller outer and inner cusps. Unlike in Nectomys, Oryzomys, and Megalomys, the first <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower molars usually lack accessory roots, so {{that each of the}} three upper molars has two roots on the outer side and one on the inner side and each of the lower molars has one root at the front and one at the back.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark {{is a very}} robust-bodied {{species with}} a short, broad, and rounded snout. The small and {{circular}} eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear medium-sized flaps of skin. The mouth forms a wide arch and has barely noticeable furrows at the corners. There are 11–13 (usually 12) <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> 10–12 (usually 11) lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are single rows of tiny teeth at the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are broad and triangular with serrated edges; those in the lower jaw are slightly narrower, more upright, and more finely serrated {{than those in the}} upper. The five pairs of gill slits are of moderate length.|$|E

5|$|Route 31 was Ace of Spades – {{cutting across}} the city and Midlothian with orange <b>uppers</b> <b>and</b> roofline, and a black spade symbol, which was worn by buses 751–768. However, these buses have been repainted into madder and white with no route branding.|$|R
5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|African Americans {{constitute}} 16% of the city's population, {{with their}} greatest concentrations found in Mount Hope and the <b>Upper</b> <b>and</b> Lower South Providence neighborhoods. Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves {{scattered throughout the}} city. The largest Asian groups are Cambodians (1.7%), Chinese (1.1%), Asian Indians (0.7%), Laotians (0.6%), and Koreans (0.6%). Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. American Indians and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. Liberians compose 0.4% of the population; the city is {{home to one of}} the largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists {{understand that there}} are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E

5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
