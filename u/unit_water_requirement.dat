40|$|This is {{a report}} of field {{research}} on Karezes in Turpan and Hami in 1988. Both districts are in Xinjiang, China. The research was conducted by the Xingjiang Institute of Biology, Pedology and Desert Research Chinese Academy of Sciences (XIBPDR) and an exploratory party from Japan sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Much information was obtained on Karezes. For example, how to excavate them, the equantity of ground-water, how to maintain them, how to use their water for fields and present their troubles in Turpan and Hami. This abstract shows the troubles of Karezes, their vitalization and mentions conservation of water-resources in the future. We appreciate Xinjiang Bureau of Water Conservancy (XBWC) for their important information and suggestions. But this briefing is private and the first author takes the responsibility for mistakes. 1. Lowering of the Ground-water Table The biggest problem of the Karezes in Turpan and Hami is lowering of the ground-water table. The Karezes depend on ground-water but many Karezes excavated when the ground-water table was moderate high. Lowering of the ground-water table can not keep this condition and serves poor water resources. The construction of open channels in 1960 - 1970 s to get snow-melt water from the Tien Shan Mts., was possibly due to lowering the ground-water table. Snow-melt water flow in many rivers infiltrates the desert land from the river beds. This infiltration has enriched the ground-water of Turpan and Hami for a long time. But new open channels convey water to fields directly and do not give the river-flow enough time to infiltrate the desert land. The ground-water has thus decreased considerably. Today, thousands of small pump stations pump ground-water for irrigation in Turpan and Hami but they also lower the ground-water table. The ground-water table is thus not available for many Karezes. The great success of agricultural and industrial development in Turpan and Hami is due to water resources development and conservation by those pumps and open channels. But the Karezes are suffering from little water due to modern water facilities. 2. Breakdown of the inner walls of Karez Most outlets of the Karezes are near villages or vegetable fields, i. e. oasis. The soil around an oasis is silty. Silty soil is good for vegetable growth {{but not for the}} structure of Karezes. When silty soil becomes moisture, it becomes loosely. Flow of a Karez gives moisture to the inner wall and makes erosion continuously along the watered lower part of the wall. After a moderate time, the walls become weak and falls down. This situation has continues for a long time. The diameter of a Karez becomes bigger and bigger under a silty soil area. This is very dangerous for the people of a village, because big diameter thins top soil of a Karez near the outlet. In fact, there are many big hole-rows in some villages caused by dropping of top soil. When soil deposits on the bed of a Karez, flow is dammed up leading to greater depth. This causes water loss through infiltration by high water depth pressure. 3. Possibility of Water Pollution The success of agricultural development in Turpan and Hami depends also on popularization of chemical fertilizer. But this may lead to ground-water pollution, because some Karezes get seepage water from vegetable fields. If water contains excess chemical fertilizer, pollution will eventually result. 4. Vitalization To lessen the decrease in ground-water flow, the bureau and farmers try to extend a Karez toward the up-stream to obtain more water but without success in some cases. The basic problem of Karezes is the lowering of ground-water. So, the bureau has recommended farmers to keep their pump stations away from the under-ground way of a Karez. This is good policy to conserve the ground-water table. But to farmers who want to get much water and produce much food, the pump station is more convenient and reliable. Pumping ground-water will be more popular and facilities larger in next ten years possibly. But this may lead to serious problems for Karezes. XBWC is trying to recharge the ground-water by flood flow every year. When heavy rain falls in the Tien Shan Mts., they forecast the time that the flood water will reach the desert. This will lead to good results provided the farmers work here. Vitalization of Karezes depends on recharging the ground-water over a long period. In a short term, extension of their length and protect work for seepage from inner wall of Karez are good policies. In any case, the vitalization must {{be a part of the}} strategy of water resources development and conservation for the Tien Shan Mts., in the near future. 5. Renovation of the Water Delivery System Farmers in the vicinity of an oasis share water from Karezes very strictly. They have a conventional water delivery system for villages and fields. The system is very good, because all farmers can obtain water easily and equally. Only the quantity of water may be inadequate. To improve the system, field research for <b>unit</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> of crops and vegetables is needed. The results of this research and appropriate improvement of form and dimensions of fields may save water for fallow irrigation. Most delivery channels from Karezes are made by soil. Sometimes a channel breaks and water flows into roads and other places. To prevent spillover and seepage, seal materials for channel beds and walls are needed. Attention should be directed to the fact that when a channel is covered by seal, flow condition change. If the new design discharge for sealed channel is equal to old one, flow velocity will increase causeing water depth to be low. These improvement, research and work have already been started and strongly supported by XIBPDR and XBWC. But the difficulty is not research but money. 6. Observation of Ground-water To vitalize Karezes, we need more precise data on ground-water moving in the desert. LAND-SAT clearly showed the ground-water or soil moisture everywhere on the earth. Unfortunately continuous data are not available on it. We must create an observation system for ground-water and on which the future supply of water for the Karezes will depend. The Tien Shan Mts., await future development of water resources and water power generation. Some Karezes will obtain water from the Tien Shan Mts., as a result. Some inner walls will be sealed to become under-ground reservoirs for excess flood water...|$|E

Total UCRB water consumption can then be found by adding to the energy-related water use all nonenergy-related consumption. On the supply side, aggregate water availability is determined from the results of a steady-state, stochastic hydrologic model which predicts the reliability of flow to the lower basin as a function of total UCRB consumption.

40|$|Can a large (significant in {{national}} terms) energy-recovery industry {{be developed in}} the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB), alongside more traditional water uses, without causing {{a problem in the}} aggregate quantity of water supplied to the Lower Colorado River Basin?. This report answers that question in a "reasonably conservative" manner by slightly overpredicting demand and underpredicting supply. First, aggregate consumption of water in the UCRB due to water intensive energy industries is calculated {{as a function of the}} level of energy production. Reasonably conservative (i. e., on the high side) estimates of <b>unit</b> <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> for coal-electric generation, coal-slurry pipelines, coal gasification (to produce substitute natural gas — SNG), and oil-shale processing are developed from an extensive literature survey. These are combined with various energy-development scenarios, also developed from a literature survey, to give total energy-related water consumption as a function of total energy industry size. Overall total UCRB water consumption can then be found by adding to the energy-related water use all non-energy-related consumption. On the supply side, aggregate UCRB water availability is determined from the results of a steady-state, stochastic hydrologic model which predicts the reliability of flow to the lower basin as a function of total UCRB consumption. Predictions of the model are conservative, in the sense of being on the low side, because: (1) the period of record used to determine tributary flows is a relatively low flow period and (2) because the use of excess stored water above steady-state levels during transition periods to steady state is ignored. Demand and supply are then presented together in a graphical form which allows the reader to determine for him-or-herself the level of energy development which can be allowed in the UCRB, depending on the levels he or she chooses for non-energy-related water consumption in the upper basin and the reliability of water supply to the lower basin. On an aggregate basis, there appears to be enough water available in the Upper Colorado River Basin to produce about 7 quads per year (7 x 10 ^(15) Btu/yr or 7. 4 x 10 ^(18) J/yr, equivalent to well over one-half current liquid fuel imports) from the region's fossil fuel resources by water-intensive energy industries and still allow an increase in other water uses by more than 25...|$|R
40|$|Economic and {{environmental}} sustainability are {{of great importance}} in the planning and development of new irrigation schemes in order to underpin their long-term viability. In San Luis Province, Argentina, a novel approach {{has been used to}} produce irrigation suitability maps for specific crops using the combination of two decision support systems (DSS) with a geographic information system (GIS) in order to select areas suitable for irrigation development using groundwater. This approach has enabled spatial data on soils, groundwater and climate to be integrated with crop agronomic data and economic analysis to produce maps of physical and economic suitability for specific crops. The methodology initially involved land suitability classification based on FAO methodology and hydrogeological mapping of depth to groundwater, potential yield and groundwater quality (salinity and toxic trace elements). These datasets were analysed within the ASSESS (A System for SElecting Suitable Sites) decision support system using both the Law of the Minimum and Addition methodologies to exclude areas and to rank the remainder with potential for irrigation suitability. More detailed investigations were undertaken using the ALES (Automated Land Evaluation System) decision support system that provided the framework for the integration of biophysical data with crop suitability and economics. This facilitated the comparison of alternative crops in terms of biophysical and economic feasibility.

In pot experiments, the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> throughout the growth period ranged from 159. 00 to 278. 90  mm, with a reduction in the range of 241 – 441  mm, as compared with that in field production. Also, the average <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> intensity at the vigorous growing stage was 1. 97  mm/d, and the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> module were 33. 80 – 72. 60  mm and 16. 39 %– 33. 09 %, respectively, at the group stage, almost equal to their values at the vigorous growing stage. The patterns of the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> module in pot experiments were different from those in field production. In pot experiments, the tobacco <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> module ranked the highest at the mature stage, followed by those at the group/vigorous growing and rejuvenation stages, while the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> intensity ranked the highest at the vigorous growing stage, followed by those at the mature, group, and rejuvenation stages.

Ballard (1933) and Williams (1935) defined <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> as the ratio of the amount of water transpired to the amount of dry matter formed during the whole or any part of the life cycle of the plant. Miller (1938) and Kramer (1959) {{postulated}} that the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> is the ratio of water used to the dry matter produced, and therefore could more accurately be termed transpiration ratio because it is largely controlled by transpiration. Regardless of specific definition, the dry matter considered in such ratios is generally the amount harvested, including the entire plant except the roots. The amount of water measured is the amount lost during growth since the amount of water retained within the plant is insignificant when compared with either total water intake or the amount transpired.

40|$|The National Principles for the Provision of Water for Ecosystems {{provide the}} {{opportunity}} to consider ecological <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> {{as part of a}} broader water resource allocation process in Australia (ARMCANZ & ANZECC 1996). These first principles signal a major paradigm shift from the purely consumptive or extractive approach to Australian water resources management that prevailed not all that long ago. Included in these is the premise that scientific assessments of ecological <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> are to be undertaken so that water resource managers and decision makers can prescribe the hydrologic regime(s) to either sustain or restore to some level, the ecological processes of flow-dependent ecosystems in regulated rivers (Arthington & Zalucki 1998). These ecological <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> are then used to determine the provision or allocation, which is the downstream flow that will actually be released after consideration of other social and economic <b>water</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
40|$|The West Liaohe Plain {{is located}} in the eastern Inner Mongolia, known as the golden maize belt in China, where maize acreage has {{continued}} to rise in recent years. Water is the main limiting factor for maize production in the region, therefore, this study calculated the effect of maize sowing area changes on agricultural water consumption in the West Liaohe Plain in 2000, 2005 and 2010, based on remote sensing and meteorological data. Maize remote sensing classification was constructed based on moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer, normalized difference vegatation index (MODIS NDVI) data. Then the maize sown area and <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> and irrigation <b>water</b> resources were investigated. Finally, the effect of the maize sowing area changes on agricultural water consumption in the West Liaohe Plain was systematically analyzed in 2000, 2005, and 2010. The results showed that maize sown areas rose from 2000 to 2010 and were concentrated {{in the center of the}} West Liaohe Plain. Average per <b>unit</b> maize <b>water</b> deficit amount also increased in an uneven distribution, increasing from the south, east and north to the center and west of the West Liaohe Plain. The per <b>unit</b> area maize <b>water</b> deficit increased from 2000 to 2010, and reached 266 mm in 2000, 272 mm in 2005 and 273 mm in 2010, respectively. And the study concluded that water deficit during the whole growth period of maize in the West Liaohe Plain was defined by a single peak curve. The maize <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> increased with maize sowing area changes from 2000 to 2010, and the maize <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> increased from 0. 89 billion m(3) in 2000 to 1. 19 billion m(3) in 2005, and 1. 21 billion m 3 in 2010...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} European {{seasonal}} weather conditions and related crop <b>water</b> <b>requirements,</b> crop <b>water</b> consumption and crop water deficits were studied using the Crop Growth Monitoring System of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission {{for the period}} 1976 – 2005. Soft wheat was selected as a typical winter crop. Sugar beet was selected as a typical spring/summer crop. First we analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of the average seasonal mean temperature and the average seasonal estimated global radiation, subsequently the spatial and temporal variation of the simulated seasonal <b>water</b> <b>requirement,</b> <b>water</b> consumption and water deficit of wheat and sugar beets were studied. We found that the weather pattern changes are not uniformly distributed across Europe. A seasonal dependence was found. The impacts of the changing weather patterns differ per crop and per region. In various European regions the wheat <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> showed a downward trend which {{can be attributed to}} a shorter growing season as a result of higher temperatures in spring. This downward trend can also be attributed to a lower evaporative demand in winter and spring as a result of diminishing global radiation values. Only a limited number of regions showed an upward trend. For sugar beets the Mediterranean regions of France and Spain showed a downward trend in the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> which can be attributed to a lower evaporative demand due to reduced solar radiation in summer and autumn. Large areas with an upward trend in the <b>water</b> <b>requirement</b> are spread across the rest of Europe. These upward trends can be attributed to higher temperatures in summer and autumn. The regional trend patterns in actual crop water consumption and water deficit are less distinct than found for the crop <b>water</b> <b>requirements.</b> Changes in these variables {{can be attributed to the}} combined effect of variations in crop <b>water</b> <b>requirements</b> and rainfall...|$|R
