40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} computational analyses of local {{strength of the}} <b>umbilical</b> <b>mast</b> (UM), which is designed for the prelaunch preparation and launch security of the space rocket (SR) "SOYUZ- 2 " of 1 B stage. Based on the finite elements method, modeling and calculation of local strength for the most loaded UM elements are conducted using Russian program complex «APM WINMACHINE». The paper gives a justification for choosing the program complex «APM WINMACHINE, as a program calculation device. In calculating the principles of a local analysis are used. Physical models of the UM particular constructive units are formed to observe them under certain boundary conditions: forces and movements. Parameters of boundary conditions are determined in terms of stress-strain condition of UM simplified model as a whole. As the research results, the paper presents the finite element models of two UM constructive units, namely a joint of the mast farm branches with strengthening of the mast rotating part and an element in the UM bottom rotating part (“the spine”). Besides, there are also the calculated results of the local strength of abovementioned UM rotating part units: a general pattern of the stress distribution with stress values exceeding the allowable ones. The research results allow us to draw conclusions that the units under consideration have performance capability and require their constructive strengthening. The UM developers have taken in consideration recommendations, based on the UM rotating part local strength calculation, making appropriate correction in the project documentation. The experience gained in using the «APM WINMACHINE» allowed us to support {{the conclusion that it}} is efficient to solve the tasks of defining stress-strain condition of complicated spatial constructions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is devoted to}} the computational analysis of bearing structures of launch system aggregates, which are designed for the prelaunch preparation and launch security of space rocket (SR) "SOYUZ- 2 " of 1 B stage. The bearing structures taken under consideration are the following: supporting trusses (ST), bearing arms (BA), the upper cable girder (UCG), the <b>umbilical</b> <b>mast</b> (UM). The SR “SOYUZ- 2 " of 1 B stage has the characteristics of the propulsion unit (PU) thrust, {{different from those of the}} "Soyuz" family space rockets exploited before. The paper presents basic modeling principles to calculate units and their operating loadings. The body self-weight and the influence of a gas-dynamic jet of "SOYUZ- 2. 1 B" propulsion unit have been considered as a load of units. Parameters of this influence are determined on the basis of impulse stream fields and of deceleration temperatures calculated for various SR positions according to the specified path of its ascent and demolition. Physical models of the aggregates and calculations are based on the finite elements method and super-elements method using “SADAS” software package developed at the chair SM 8 of Bauman Moscow State Technical University. Fields of nodal temperatures distribution in the ST, BA, UCG, UM models, and fields of tension in finite elements as well represent the calculation results. Obtained results revealed the most vulnerable of considered starting system aggregates, namely UM, which was taken for local durability calculation. As an example, this research considers calculation of local durability in the truss branches junction of UM rotary part, for which the constructive strengthening has been offered. For this node a detailed finite-element model built in the model of UM rotary part has been created. Calculation results of local durability testify that the strengthened node meets durability conditions. SR developers used calculation results of launch system aggregates for the space rocket "SOYUZ- 2. 1 B", as well as technical solutions on separate nodes strengthening with appropriate correction of engineering design package. </p...|$|E

Mast cells have been increasingly implicated in inflammatory processes where explosive degranulation is not commonly observed. Here, we show that IL- 1 stimulates secretion of IL- 6 without release of the granule-associated protease tryptase in normal human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood-derived <b>mast</b> cells (hCBMCs).

40|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{involved}} in allergic reactions but also in innate immunity and inflammation. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), the key regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, also has proinflammatory effects, apparently through mast cells. We showed recently that CRH selectively stimulates hu-man leukemic mast cells and human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood-derived <b>mast</b> cells to release newly synthesized vascular endo-thelial growth factor (VEGF) without release of either preformed mediators or cytokines. This effect was mediated through the activation of CRH receptor- 1 and adenylate cyclase with in-creased intracellular cAMP. However, the precise mechanism by which CRH induces VEGF secretion {{has not yet been}} de-fined. Here, we show that CRH-induced VEGF release was dose-dependently inhibited by the specific protein kinase...|$|R
40|$|Mast cells, which {{derive from}} {{a bone marrow}} {{progenitor}} and mature in tissues, are important for allergic reactions, but also in inflammation, autoimmunity, and T-cell-mediated immune responses. The addition of certain cytokines to human umbilical cord blood-derived cultured mast cells {{have been shown to}} augment IgE-induced production of distinct cytokines, without histamine secretion. CCL 2 /MCP- 1 is a beta chemokine capable of attracting and activating lymphocytes, macrophages, memory T cells and basophilic cells, but not neutrophils. CCL 2 /MCP- 1 regulates the recruitment of inflammatory cells into tissue during inflammation and allergy. IL- 33 belongs to the IL- 1 family and binds to the ST 2 receptor which has high homology to IL- 1 receptor and has biological activities. IL- 33, causes allergic inflammation and exerts significant biological effects both in vivo and in vitro. IL- 33 induces expression of several cytokines and chemokines, resulting in severe inflammatory and allergic diseases. However, our knowledge regarding the effects of these cytokines on human mast cell functions is limited. Here, using human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood <b>mast</b> cells (HUCBMCs) as a valid model, we found that IL- 33 induces CCL 2 /MCP- 1 release in HUCBMCs. The release was higher at 24 h incubation compared with 12 h. This study documents the ability of IL- 33 to directly stimulate Human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood <b>mast</b> cells (UCBMCs) to produce CCL 2 /MCP- 1. We show that IL- 33 is a strong activator of human mast cells capable of inducing CCL 2 /MCP- 1 released at translational level. The present data describe an additional biological activity of IL- 33, suggesting that this cytokine may have an important effect on the recruitment of inflammatory cells in allergic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Mast cells play pivotal {{roles in}} {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) E–mediated airway inflammation, expressing interleukin (IL) - 13 and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), {{which in turn}} regulate IgE synthesis and/or inflammatory cell recruitment. The molecular effects of IL- 1 � on cytokine expression by human mast cells (HMC) have not been studied well. In this report, we provide evidence that human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood-derived <b>mast</b> cells (CBDMC) and HMC- 1 cells express the type 1 receptor for IL- 1. We also demonstrate that IL- 1 � and tumor necrosis factor- � are able to induce, individually or additively, dose-dependent expression of IL- 13 and MCP- 1 in these cells. The induction of IL- 13 and MCP- 1 gene expression by IL- 1 � was accompanied by the activation of IL- 1 receptor–associated kinase and translocation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF) �B into the nucleus. Accordingly, Bay- 11 7082, an inhibitor of NF-�B activation, inhibited IL- 1 �–induced IL- 13 and MCP- 1 expression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mast cells hold a key {{position}} in the defensive mechanisms against exogenous intruders. In this study, we investigated whether human mast cells express functional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules that can trans-duce endogenous signals and present staphylococ-cal enterotoxin A (SEA) to T cells. Similar to HMC- 1 human <b>mast</b> cell line, <b>umbilical</b> cord blood-derived <b>mast</b> cells express HLA-DR,-DP and-DQ molecules on their surface. MHC class II molecules expressed on HMC- 1 cells bind significantly the SEA (a natural MHC class II ligand), and their ligation with specific mAbs or with SEA, leads ultrastructural chages, suggesting their degranula-tion. Recognition of SEA-bound MHC class II molecules on HMC- 1 mast cells by the T cell receptor of K 25 cells, an SEA-specific murine T cell hybridoma, triggers significant IL- 2 secretion by these T cell hybridomas. Hence, our data point out the expression of functional MHC class II molecules on human mast cells, reinforcing the implication of these cells in the defense mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Three {{closely related}} human sec 14 p-like {{proteins}} (hTAP 1, 2, and 3, or SEC 14 L 2, 3, and 4, respectively) have been described. These proteins may participate in intracellular lipid transport (phospholipids, squalene, tocopherol analogues and derivatives) or influence regulatory lipid-dependent events. Here, {{we show that}} the three recombinant hTAP proteins associate with the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, and enhance the in vitro transport of radioactively labeled alpha-tocopherol to mitochondria {{in the same order}} of magnitude as the human alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP). hTAP 1 and hTAP 2 are expressed in several cell lines, whereas the expression level of hTAP 3 is low. Expression of hTAP 1 is induced in human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood-derived <b>mast</b> cells upon differentiation by interleukin 4. In tissues, the three hTAPs are detectable ubiquitously at low level; pronounced and localized expression is found for hTAP 2 and hTAP 3 in the perinuclear region in cerebellum, lung, liver and adrenal gland. hTAP 3 is well expressed in the epithelial duct cells of several glands, in ovary in endothelial cells of small arteries as well as in granulosa and thecal cells, and in testis in Leydig cells. Thus, the three hTAPs may mediate lipid uptake, secretion, presentation, and sub-cellular localization in a tissue-specific manner, possibly using organelle- and enzyme-specific docking sites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{asthma and}} other {{allergic}} disorders, the activation of mast cells by IgE and antigen induces the cells to release histamine and other mediators of inflammation, {{as well as}} to produce certain cytokines and chemokines. To search for new mast cell products, we used complementary DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression in human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood-derived <b>mast</b> cells stimulated via the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI). Results One to two hours after FcεRI-dependent stimulation, more than 2, 400 genes (about half of which are of unknown function) exhibited 2 – 200 fold changes in expression. The transcriptional program included changes in the expression of IL- 11 and at least 30 other cytokines and chemokines. Human mast cells secreted 130 – 529 pg of IL- 11 / 10 6 cells by 6 h after stimulation with anti-IgE. Conclusion Our initial analysis of the transcriptional program induced in in vitro-derived human mast cells stimulated via the FcεRI has identified many products that heretofore have not been associated with this cell type, but which may significantly influence mast cell function in IgE-associated host responses. We also have demonstrated that mast cells stimulated via the FcεRI can secrete IL- 11. Based on the previously reported biological effects of IL- 11, our results suggest that production of IL- 11 may represent one link between IgE-dependent mast cell activation in subjects with allergic asthma {{and the development of a}} spectrum of structural changes in the airways of these individuals; such changes, collectively termed "airway remodeling," can constitute an important long term consequence of asthma. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mast cells {{derive from}} the bone marrow and are {{responsible}} for the development of allergic and possibly inflammatory reactions. Mast cells are stimulated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific antigen, but also by a number of neuropeptides such as neurotensin (NT), somatostatin or substance P (SP), to secrete numerous pro-inflammatory molecules that include histamine, cytokines and proteolytic enzymes. Chondroitin sulphate, a major constituent of connective tissues and of mast cell secretory granules, had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on rat peritoneal mast cell release of histamine induced by the mast cell secretagogue compound 48 / 80 (48 / 80). This inhibition was stronger than that of the clinically available mast cell ‘stabilizer' disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn). Inhibition by chondroitin sulphate increased with the length of preincubation and persisted after the drug was washed off, while the effect of cromolyn was limited by rapid tachyphylaxis. Immunologic stimulation of histamine secretion from rat connective tissue mast cells (CTMC) was also inhibited, but this effect was weaker in <b>umbilical</b> cord-derived human <b>mast</b> cells and was absent in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells which are considered homologous to mucosal mast cells (MMC). Oligo- and monosaccharides were not as effective as the polysaccharides. Inhibition, documented by light and electron microscopy, involved a decrease of intracellular calcium ion levels shown by confocal microscopy and image analysis. Autoradiography at the ultrastructural level showed that chondroitin sulphate was mostly associated with plasma and perigranular membranes. Chondroitin sulphate appears to be a potent mast cell inhibitor of allergic and nonimmune stimulation with potential clinical implications...|$|R
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{critical}} for allergic reactions, but also for innate or acquired immunity and inflammatory conditions that worsen by stress. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis under stress, also has proinflammatory peripheral effects possibly through mast cells. We investigated the expression of CRH receptors {{and the effects of}} CRH in the human leukemic mast cell (HMC- 1) line and human <b>umbilical</b> cord blood-derived <b>mast</b> cells. We detected mRNA for CRH-R 1, 1, 1 c, 1 e, 1 f isoforms, as well as CRH-R 1 protein in both cell types. CRH-R 2 (but not R 2 or R 2) mRNA and protein were present only in human cord blood-derived mast cells. CRH increased cAMP and induced secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) without tryptase, histamine, IL- 6, IL- 8, or TNF- release. The effects were blocked by the CRH-R 1 antagonist antalarmin, but not the CRH-R 2 antagonist astressin 2 B. CRH-stimulated VEGF production was mediated through activation of adenylate cyclase and increased cAMP, as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} effect of CRH was mimicked by the direct adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8 -bromo-cAMP, whereas it was abolished by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536. This is the first evidence that mast cells express functional CRH receptors and that CRH can induce VEGF secretion selectively. CRH-induced mast cell-derived VEGF could, therefore, be involved in chronic inflammatory conditions associated with increased VEGF, such as arthritis or psoriasis, both of which worsen by stress.

40|$|Abstract: Mast {{cells are}} the {{derivatives}} of hematopoietic progenitor cells and {{play an important}} role in immediate Type I hypersensitivity and late phase reactions but also in innate immunity (3), allergy and inflammation (4) by secreting a large variety of chemical mediators either from storage sites in their granules, or producing immuno-regulatory proteins upon stimulation (5 - 14). They directly interact with bacteria and appear to play a vital role in host defense against pathogens. The addition of certain cytokines to human umbilical cord blood-derived cultured mast cells shown to augment IgE-induced production of distinct cytokines, without histamine secretion. Mast cells could be recruited in the inflammatory site, by MCP- 1, RANTES and SCF, and selectively secrete proinflammatory molecules; these could include growth factors, histamine, which is mitogenic (H 1) and an immunosuppressant (H 2), neovascularization agents, such as heparin, IL- 8, and VEGF as well as proteases that could permit new blood vessel formation.
