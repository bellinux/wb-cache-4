Following a proposal of Fröhlich and Gaw¸edzki, we describe the noncommutative string spacetime using a detailed algebraic construction of the vertex operator algebra. We show that the spacetime duality and discrete worldsheet symmetries of the string theory are a consequence of the existence of two independent Dirac operators, arising from the chiral structure of the conformal field theory. We demonstrate that these Dirac operators are also responsible for the emergence of ordinary classical spacetime as a low-energy limit of the string spacetime, and from this we establish a relationship between T-duality and changes of spin structure of the target space manifold. We study the automorphism group of the vertex operator algebra and show that spacetime duality is naturally a gauge symmetry in this formalism.

40|$|Conventional {{superstring}} derived E_ 6 {{models can}} accommodate small neutrino masses if a discrete symmetry is imposed which forbids tree level Dirac neutrino masses but allows for radiative mass generation. Since {{the only possible}} symmetries of this kind {{are known to be}} generation dependent, we explore the possibility that the three sets of light states in each generation {{do not have the same}} assignments with respect to the 27 of E_ 6, leading to non <b>universal</b> <b>gauge</b> interactions under the additional U(1) ' factors for the known fermions. We argue that models realising such a scenario are viable, with their structure being constrained mainly by the requirement of the absence of flavor changing neutral currents in the Higgs sector. Moreover, in contrast to the standard case, rank 6 models are not disfavoured with respect to rank 5. By requiring the number of light neutral states to be minimal, these models have an almost unique pattern of neutrino masses and mixings. We construct a model based on the unconventional assignment scenario in which (with a natural choice of the parameters) m_∼ O(10) eV is generated at one loop, m_ is generated at two loops and lies in a range interesting for the solar neutrino problem, and remains massless. In addition, since baryon and lepton number are conserved, there is no proton decay in the model.

40|$|Type-II seesaw is {{a simple}} {{scenario}} in which Majorana neutrino masses are generated by the exchange of a heavy scalar electroweak triplet. When endowed with additional heavy fields, such as right-handed neutrinos or extra triplets, it also provides a compelling framework for baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We derive in this context the full network of Boltzmann equations for studying leptogenesis in the flavored regime. To this end we determine the relations which hold among the chemical potentials of the various particle species in the thermal bath. This {{takes into account the}} SM Yukawa interactions of both leptons and quarks as well as sphaleron processes which, depending on the temperature, may be classified as faster or slower than the Hubble rate. We find that when leptogenesis is enabled by the presence of an extra triplet, lepton flavor effects allow the production of the $B-L$ asymmetry through lepton number conserving CP asymmetries. This scenario becomes dominant as soon as the triplets couple more to leptons than to SM scalar doublets. In this case, the way the $B-L$ asymmetry is created through flavor effects is novel: instead of invoking the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays faster than the Hubble rate, it involves the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays slower than the Hubble rate. We also analyze the more general situation where lepton number violating CP asymmetries are present and actively participate in the generation of the $B-L$ asymmetry, pointing out that as long as $L$-violating triplet decays are still in thermal equilibrium when the triplet gauge scattering processes decouple, flavor effects can be striking, allowing to avoid all washout suppression effects from seesaw interactions. In this case the amount of $B-L$ asymmetry produced is limited only by a <b>universal</b> <b>gauge</b> suppression effect, which nevertheless goes away for large triplet decay rates.
