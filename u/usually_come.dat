5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.|$|E

5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E
25|$|Lucha libre wrestlers {{are known}} as luchadores (singular luchador) ("wrestler(s)"). They <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> from {{extended}} wrestling families who form their own stables. One such line integrated to the United States professional wrestling scene is Los Guerreros.|$|E

25|$|Typically, a {{modifier}} key is {{held down}} while another key is struck. To facilitate this, modifier keys <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> in pairs, one functionally identical key for each hand, so holding a modifier key {{with one hand}} leaves the other hand free to strike another key.|$|E
25|$|It {{is normal}} for many objects to combine several media. Oil paintings, for example, <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> in ornate frames of gilt wood. Among the most sumptuous and {{decorative}} {{objects that are}} to be found within churches are those constructed of mixed media, in which any of the above may be combined.|$|E
25|$|Boxing gloves <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> {{with either}} lace-ups or velcro. In velcro gloves, the velcro {{acts as a}} second handwrap that adds more {{stability}} to the wrist. Lace-up gloves provide a more snug and secure fit, but unlike velcro gloves, require assistance from another person to lace, and are usually wrapped with tape before the match. Lace-up gloves {{can be converted to}} velcro gloves using a hook and loop converter.|$|E

25|$|Mobile docking {{stations}} <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> mated to an armature, laptop desk or standard rack {{in order}} to provide the ability to position the computer in a vehicle in a safe and ergonomic position. As with all docking stations, a mobile docking station will provide the user with a means to quickly and easily dock and un dock the computer. In addition, some mobile docking-stations provide a security-lock to discourage theft.|$|E
25|$|Despite his highly {{impressive}} career record, {{not one of}} Sachin Tendulkar's innings {{appeared in}} the top 100 batting performances. His omission was strongly criticised by fans and many sections {{of the media in}} India. Wisden defended the list stating that performances which majorly contributed to victories received a much larger weighting than those in which the match was drawn or lost. Tendulkar's most important innings had <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> in draws and defeats which received a lower weighting.|$|E

25|$|Each episode also {{amounts to}} a {{confidence}} game played upon the viewers {{through the use of}} misdirection and hidden plot details that are revealed {{at the end of the}} story. Not all cons depicted are successful, and some episodes focus on the characters dealing with the consequences of their actions. However, even if a con does fail, main characters <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> out on top in some way or other...or, at times, nothing is gained but nothing lost, either.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the TCAs {{are still}} {{occasionally}} used for treatment-resistant depression that {{has failed to}} respond to therapy with newer antidepressants. They are not considered addictive and are somewhat preferable to the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The side effects of the TCAs <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> to prominence before the therapeutic benefits against depression and/or anxiety do, and for this reason, they may potentially be somewhat dangerous, as volition can be increased, possibly giving the patient a greater desire to attempt or commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|Particulates {{created from}} gaseous primary {{pollutants}} and compounds in photochemical smog. Smog {{is a kind}} of air pollution. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide. Modern smog does not <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by ultraviolet light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.|$|E

25|$|Some {{universities}} incorporate missions {{into the}} game play to encourage more active participation. These missions <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> with a reward for the winning side. This reward could benefit the winners or it could penalize the losing side, and thus benefit the winning side. Missions can easily be modified in-game to account for how many players are humans and how many are zombies, or to make the mission easier for one side and/or harder for the opposing side. Missions can also be constructed to follow a storyline throughout the game.|$|E
25|$|Parasitoid wasps that parasitize tessaratomids <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> {{from the}} {{families}} Eupelmidae, Scelionidae, and Encyrtidae. Adult female parasitoid wasps will search out eggs laid by tessaratomoids. Upon finding some, they will thrust their ovipositors into them and lay eggs inside. The eggs of parasitoid wasps hatch and develop inside the tessaratomid eggs, feeding on the tessaratomid embryo and eventually killing it. Infested eggs characteristically turn darker in {{color as the}} wasp larva matures. After about a week, one or more adult wasps will then emerge from the now empty egg.|$|E
