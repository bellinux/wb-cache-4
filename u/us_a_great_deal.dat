Because U.S. regulation of occupational road safety is largely limited {{to the safety of}} large trucks and buses, these institutes have focused on providing the evidence base to support changes to the FMCSA safety regulations that cover these larger vehicles. [...] Two research institutes that conduct much of the research on heavy-vehicle safety are the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI).|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} old {{instruments}} and historic performance practice has taught <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal,</b> {{but the main}} point, the impact of harmony, has been ignored. This is proved {{by the fact that}} tempo is described as an independent phenomenon. It is claimed that one of Bach's gavottes must be played fast and another one slowly. But tempo is not independent! … I think that concerning oneself purely with historic performance practice and the attempt to reproduce the sound of older styles of music-making is limiting and no indication of progress. Mendelssohn and Schumann tried to introduce Bach into their own period, as did Liszt with his transcriptions and Busoni with his arrangements. In America Leopold Stokowski also tried to do it with his arrangements for orchestra. This was always the result of [...] "progressive" [...] efforts to bring Bach closer to the particular period. I have no philosophical problem with someone playing Bach and making it sound like Boulez. My problem is more with someone who tries to imitate the sound of that time… ...|$|E
2500|$|Foster the People {{issued its}} first {{commercial}} non-single release in January 2011, a self-titled EP featuring [...] "Pumped Up Kicks", [...] "Houdini", and [...] "Helena Beat" [...] that {{was intended to}} hold fans over until their first studio album, Torches, was completed. Fans who purchased the EP through the iTunes Store were able to apply it towards the purchase of their full-length debut album. The EP drew the attention of organizers of March's South by Southwest festival, as well as executives looking to license music for upcoming season finales of television series. Columbia senior director of creative licensing Jonathan Palmer said, [...] "The plan helped <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> to set up more opportunities rather than chasing the release date. So {{by the time we}} put the record out in May, we had already placed several songs." [...] Half of Torches songs were licensed—among them are: [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] (Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, Friends with Benefits, Entourage), [...] "Houdini" [...] (Gossip Girl); [...] "Helena Beat" [...] (The Vampire Diaries); [...] "Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)" [...] (Suits, Nissan Motors commercial); and [...] "Call It What You Want" [...] (FIFA 12). Palmer commented, [...] "I haven't seen this kind of a range of song licenses from one album since we worked the first Ting Tings record three-and-a-half years ago. That was an album where we licensed nine or [...] 10 songs on the album. We're kind of in a similar situation [...]" ...|$|E

In this paper we draw on the experiences of four technological universities in the US and compare them with four technical universities in Finland.
