40|$|Background  Patients with {{psoriasis}} undergoing {{or about}} to undergo ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>phototherapy</b> and photochemotherapy often have thick scale on their plaques which can prevent the penetration of UV radiation. Emollients {{are used to}} moisturize the skin and to prevent or reduce some of the milder side-effects (‘dryness’, itching) sometimes experienced during UV therapy. However, emollients can alter the UV transmission of skin and thus may alter the clinical effects of phototherapy and photochemotherapy. Objectives  We tested 30 of the topical emollients in the British National Formulary (BNF) using a standard in vitro technique used to test sunscreens. We also surveyed U. K. <b>phototherapy</b> <b>units</b> to establish routine practice for emollient use in phototherapy and photochemotherapy. Methods  We used a standard in vitro technique to measure the monochromatic protection factors (MPFs) of 30 non-bath emollients from the BNF. An application rate of 2 mg cm− 2 was used. For the assessment of effects during narrowband UVB (TL- 01) phototherapy, {{the mean of the}} protection factors at 310 and 315 nm was calculated; for psoralen plus UVA photochemotherapy the mean UVA protection factor was used. A questionnaire survey was used to assess routine practice concerning emollient use prior to <b>phototherapies</b> in <b>phototherapy</b> <b>units</b> throughout the U. K. Results  In the UVA range, 17 of the 30 emollients gave protection factors of 1 · 2 or above. In the UVB range, 23 of 30 had an MPF of 1 · 2 or above. Yellow soft paraffin had the highest protection factor in the UVB range. Of 78 centres surveyed, 57 returned completed questionnaires (73...|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} learn about patients’ {{feelings}} and thoughts regarding phototherapy/photochemotherapy. Methods: Patients treated at our <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> between 2000 - 2006 were asked {{to fill out a}} questionnaire including 20 questions. Fifty-two of 78 patients contacted answered it. Results: Twenty-six were women and 26 were men, aged between 5 and 76 (mean age 42. 1 ± 15. 9). Majority of patients had been treated for psoriasis (55. 8 %) and vitiligo (26. 9 %). Most commonly used modalities were narrow band UVB (65 %), local PUVA (23 %) and PUVA (6 %). Majority of patients (73 %) reported that they “always” experienced a favorable atmosphere and had a fair reception in the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit.</b> The unit was described as “congested”, “crowded”, but also a place which was found to be “promising improvement of skin disease”. Most frequently mentioned difficulties of phototherapy were trips to the unit, use of photosensitizing medication and the relatively high cost of treatment. 76 %stated that they would prefer phototherapy rather than other treatment alternatives. The attending physician of the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> was found to be the factor most in need of improvement. Conclusion: Although unfavorable physical conditions of the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> exist, the first step in improving treatment quality should be geared towards the more human component of treatment, namely the physician patient interaction...|$|R
40|$|Background Although {{phototherapy}} {{has been}} used in clinical practice for 40 years, there is still much debate on how to provide the most efficacious phototherapy. Phototherapy with white reflecting curtains may increase the average spectral irradiance provided, as well as decrease serum bilirubin concentrations at a faster rate in neonates with jaundice. Objective To determine if adding low cost, white, reflecting curtains to a standard <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> can increase the effectiveness of phototherapy for neonatal jaundice. Methods A randomized, controlled, open trial was conducted at H. Adam Malik and Pirngadi Hospitals, Medan, from May to December 2009. The criteria for inclusion in the study were full term newborns with neonatal jaundice presenting in their first week of life. Single phototherapy with white curtains hanging from the sides of the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> (study group, n= 30) was compared to single phototherapy without curtains (control group, n= 30). The primary outcomes measured were the mean difference in total serum bilirubin levels and average spectral irradiation levels measured at baseline, and after 12 hours and 24 hours of phototherapy. Results The sum of average spectral irradiance in the curtained <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> was significantly higher than that of the standard <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> without curtains (P < 0. 05). The decrease of total serum bilirubin levels after 12 and 24 hours of phototherapy was significantly greater in the study group (3. 71 and 9. 7 mg/dl, respectively) than in the control group (0. 1 and 3. 8 mg/dl, respectively), both P < 0. 05.

40|$|Background  The {{most widely}} used method for {{establishing}} the minimal erythema dose (MED) before narrowband ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> B <b>phototherapy</b> is time-consuming, inconvenient and may yield inconsistent results. Objectives  To assess the equivalence of MED assessment using a filtered xenon arc lamp UV source, a semiautomated MED tester, and a UV-opaque template method of MED determination with a panel of TL- 01 311 -nm UVB fluorescent tubes. Secondly, to gauge the current usage of MED testing, and the method used, in a large sample of U. K. <b>phototherapy</b> <b>units.</b> Thirdly, to assess variation in UV output of the semiautomated skin tester immediately after switching on to identify optimum warm-up time. Finally, to assess reproducibility of MED testing by assessing within-patient variability and interobserver variability of MED test results. Methods  Sixty-five patients about to undergo UVB phototherapy had their MED determined using three different methods. Within each patient we compared the values of MED determined by a semiautomated Durham MED tester, a panel of narrowband UVB lamps with a UV-opaque template constructed by a phototherapist, and a 310 -nm filtered xenon arc lamp with a liquid light guide. MED test results were assessed by clinical evaluation using a 6500 K colour temperature examination lamp. The output of the semiautomated MED tester was measured by spectroradiometer {{over a period of}} 20 min in order to identify the time to steady output. Reproducibility of MED testing with the semiautomated MED tester was carried out in 25 normal volunteers. All MEDs were assessed by at least two independent observers. A postal questionnaire was sent to 78 U. K. <b>phototherapy</b> <b>units</b> to assess routine practice concerning MED testing prior to narrowband UVB phototherapy. Results  The semiautomated MED tester showed consistency with the panel method (r = 0 · 92, panel MED = − 0 · 57 + 1 · 14 × Durham MED). The semiautomated MED tester produced a slightly lower MED result than the panel MED. Reproducibility tests showed high interobserver agreement (kappa value = 0 · 79), and high consistency for successive day testing (kappa value = 0 · 79).

The thesis includes three studies: 1. The validation of a semi-automated Minimal Phototoxic Dose (MPD) Tester for topical photochemotherapy Thirty seven psoriasis patients referred to the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> at St. Woolos, Newport were recruited. Patients had two sets of minimal phototoxic dose (MPD) tests performed on symmetrical, contralateral sites on the lower back. MPD test results from a panel of PUVA-lamps with a UV-opaque template and windows were compared to those from the modified hand-held MPD tester. The hand-held MPD results were linearly related to the PUVA-panel MPD results and this was therefore {{shown to be a}} convenient and reliable method of assessing MPD. However, the difference in MPD between the PUVA lamp and the modified handheld MPD tester (CFL TL- 10 lamp) was much less than predicted from the PUVA action spectrum of previously published studies suggesting that formal re-evaluation of the erythema action spectrum for PUVA was now appropriate...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of adding white plastic cover around the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> on hyperbilirubinemia in full term neonates with jaundice. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, over 12 months (October 2009 – September 2010), 182 term neonates with uncomplicated jaundice, admitted to neonatal unit of Imam Reza Hospital (AS) in Kermanshah province of Iran, were selected. They were randomized in two groups. Control group received conventional phototherapy without cover around the apparatus and covered group received conventional phototherapy with plastic cover around the unit. After enrolment, total serum bilirubin was measured every 12 hours. Phototherapy was continued until the total serum bilirubin decreased to or less than 12. 5 mg/dl. Findings: There were no significant differences between the two groups for gestational age, birth weight, postnatal age, weight (at admission), serum level of hemoglobin, hematocrit and reticulocyte count. Total serum bilirubin in covered group, during the first 48 hours of treatment, declined significantly than in control group (P. value= 0. 003). The cover around the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> not only did not increase the side effects of phototherapy, but also had a positive impact in reducing duration of jaundice (P. value < 0. 0001) and duration of hospitalization (P. value < 0. 0001).

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the single most {{prevalent}} form of cancer in the UK today, accounting for around 16 % of all diagnoses, and around 31 % of diagnoses in women. The survival rates are good, however the prognosis is heavily dependent on the stage to which the cancer has progressed at diagnosis. In order to help accurately determine this stage, the sentinel lymph node of patients undergoing tumour resection surgery is removed and examined cytologically for the presence of cancerous cells. This examination of the lymph node is currently the rate-limiting step in the operation as a whole. There is evidence in the literature to suggest that cancerous tissue has a measurably different infrared spectrum from healthy tissue owing to chemical and morphological differences in the tissue. There is further evidence to suggest that in the visible and near infrared region, the spectra of healthy lymph node tissue is different from that of cancerous tissue. This thesis details a project, performed in collaboration with a surgical team at St Mary's Hospital, Newport, Isle of Wight, to analyse spectral images taken in the visible and near infrared, of biopsied lymph node tissue. In the course of the project, an unsupervised classificaton technique, based on an extension to the well establised 'spectral angle', was developed to analyse the spectral images. Psoriasis affects 2 - 3 % of the UK population causing itchy and/or painful plaques on the skin.

40|$|Background: Whereas {{phototherapy}} is a {{safe and}} cost-effective treatment modality for psoriasis, economic disincentives discourage its use, including both direct and indirect costs to the patient. Purpose: To determine when it may be cost-effective for patients to purchase a home light unit versus driving to clinic for outpatient phototherapy sessions. Methods: Estimates of expenses associated with 3 months of outpatient phototherapy were determined and compared {{to the price of}} a home <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit.</b> Factors examined included the cost of gasoline (based on the national average), fuel efficiency of the vehicle, cost of owning and operating a motor vehicle, lost wages, and copayments. Results: The cost for a standard 6 -bulb narrowband UVB home unit is approximately $ 2600. Direct and indirect expenses imposed on patients increase with distance travelled to the dermatologist. If a patient lives 20 or more miles away from the dermatologist, the expenses associated with travel can total more than the out of pocket expense of purchasing a home <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit.</b> Limitations: This small analysis only accounted for the first 3 months of treatment and likely underestimates the total costs that patients would experience over a lifetime of treatment. Conclusions: It may be beneficial for physicians to educate patients on the cost-burden of in-office versus home phototherapy because patients can use these parameters to determine which option would be more cost-effective for them...|$|R
30|$|Although no {{effective}} global treatment for LS exists, {{a variety of}} therapeutic management modalities are available, among which are topical medications, immunosuppressive pharmacological agents, physical therapy, and phototherapy. The medication options include corticosteroids, methotrexate, calcipotriol, D-penicillamine, interferon-gamma, imiquimod, and tacrolimus. Unfortunately however, for some LS types, such treatment is of only limited effectiveness, and for some other LS types, symptoms worsen, or the risk of relapse is even higher, when so treated. The first case of successful ultraviolet radiation (<b>UV)</b> <b>phototherapy</b> for LS was reported in 1994. Since then, {{the literature on the}} entire spectrum of the anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects of psoralen plus UVA (PUVA), UVA- 1, and topical photodynamic therapy has rapidly expanded [18]. In 2006, Lim SH et al. reported that low-dose UVA- 1 was the phototherapy with the greatest efficacy and safety for LS patients [17].|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} {{has been}} used for decades with great success and at a constantly increasing rate in the management of skin diseases, becoming an essential part of modern dermatologic therapy (Krutmann et al, 1999). For phototherapy, irradiation devices emitting either predominantly middlewave UV (UVB, 290 - 315 nm) or long-wave UV (UVA, 315 - 400 nm) radiation are employed. In former years, patients were treated with broad-band UVB, broad-band UVA, or combination regimens. Broad-band <b>UV</b> <b>phototherapy,</b> however, is being replaced more frequently by the use of irradiation devices that allow treatment of patients' skin with selected emission spectra. Two such modalities which have their origin in European Photodermatology are 311 nm UVB phototherapy (which uses long-wave UVB radiation above 300 nm rather than broadband UVB) and high-dose UVA 1 therapy (which selective employs long-wave UVA radiation above 340 nm). In Europe, 311 nm UVB phototherapy has almost replaced classical broad-band UVB phototherapy and has significantly improved therapeutic efficacy and safety of UVB phototherapy (van Welden et al, 1988; Krutmann et al, 1999). The constantly increasing use of UVA- 1 phototherapy has not only improved UVA phototherapy for established indications such as atopic dermatitis (Krutmann et al, 1992 a, 1998; Krutmann, 1996), but has also provided dermatologists with the opportunity to successfully treat previously untractable skin diseases, e. g., connective tissue diseases (Stege et al, 1997; Krutmann, 1997). These clinical developments have stimulated studies about the mechanisms by which UVB and UVA phototherapy work. The knowledge obtained from this work is an indispensable prerequisite to make treatment decisions on a rationale rather than an empirical basis. Modern dermatologic phototherapy has started to profit from this knowledge, and it is very likely that this development will continue and provide dermatologists with improved phototherapeutic modalities and regimens for established and new indications. This review aims to provide an overview about current concepts of the mode of action of dermatologic phototherapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phototherapy {{consists}} {{of exposure to}} ultraviolet radiation for therapeutic reasons. Radiation is already used in dermatological practice, and many studies have already proved the beneficial effect of UV light treatment for chronic inflammatory or lymphoproliferative skin diseases. The Dermatology Service of the Clinics Hospital of Porto Alegre (Hospital de Cl&# 237;nicas de Porto Alegre) has been using phototherapy for a long time, and no official data have been described so far. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of dermatoses referred to the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> at the Clinics Hospital of Porto Alegre and describe {{the total number of}} patients who have already been referred to this sector and their phototype. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were collected through a review of the phototherapy patients' records (secondary data), which are available on a database of the Dermatology Service of the Clinics Hospital of Porto Alegre, from August 1997 to July 2011. RESULTS: A total of 653 records were analyzed. Phototype 3 was the most prevalent (n= 313). Distribution of the prevalence of dermatoses referred to the <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> was as follows: vitiligo (279), psoriasis (255), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides (29), graftversus-host disease (15), scleroderma (11), atopic dermatitis (10), alopecia areata (6), parapsoriasis (5), eczema (4), granuloma annulare (4), and others (35). As vitiligo and psoriasis were the two most prevalent dermatoses, they were analyzed separately, with no statistical difference in prevalence between them (P= 0, 177). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in accordance with the literature, showing that although phototherapy is still mostly indicated to treat psoriasis, it has been used to treat other dermatoses, since the results are promising...|$|R

The use of lamps with Sr 2 PO 7 -Eu+ leads to several important advantages over existing fluorescent lamps; the number of lamps can be reduced, diminishing the danger of hyperthermia, and because the light is a very deep blue, the discomfort encountered is less than with blue lamps.

Methods: Twenty patients (12 female & 8 male) with extensive pityriasis rosea type III & IV were participated in the study. Their ages ranged between 18 and 35 years. The right half of the body of each patient was irradiated with NB-UVB,while left side of each patient is exposed to broadband BB-UVB for 3 times alternatively per week until clearing of lesions or for 6 weeks.

40|$|The {{management}} of neonatal jaundice {{can be made}} much easier using simple methods that increase the radiant energy in the range 420 to 480 nm.

Measurements of irradiance from the four units were compared. An improvement in treatment was noted in the group receiving the higher dose with a decrease in duration of treatment and a greater rate of fall in the level of serum bilirubin. A dose response relationship was thus confirmed. Comparisons between previous studies are hindered by failure to recognise the varying contribution of background irradiance, the use of radiometers with differing spectral responses, and the use of different units for expressing results.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{promotes}} angiogenesis and plays important roles both in physiological and pathological conditions. VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) are high-affinity receptors for VEGF and are originally considered specific to endothelial cells. We previously reported that VEGFRs were also constitutively expressed in normal human keratinocytes and overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis. In addition, UVB can activate VEGFRs in normal keratinocytes, and the activated VEGFR- 2 signaling {{is involved in}} the pro-survival mechanism. Here, we show that VEGFRs were also upregulated and activated by UVA in normal human keratinocytes via PKC, and interestingly, both the activated VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 2 protected against UVA-induced cell death. As VEGFRs were over-expressed in psoriatic epidermis, we further investigated whether narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) phototherapy or topical halomethasone monohydrate 0. 05 % cream could affect their expression. Surprisingly, the over-expressed VEGFRs in psoriatic epidermis were significantly attenuated by both treatments. During NB-UVB therapy, VEGFRs declined first in the basal, and then gradually in the upper psoriatic epidermis. VEGFRs were activated in psoriatic epidermis, their activation was enhanced by NB-UVB, but turned undetectable after whole therapy. This process was quite different from that by halomethasone, in which VEGFRs and phospho-VEGFRs decreased in a gradual, homogeneous manner. Our findings further suggest that UV-induced activation of VEGFRs serves as a pro-survival signal for keratinocytes. In addition, VEGFRs may be involved in the pathological process of psoriasis, and <b>UV</b> <b>phototherapy</b> is effectiv...|$|R

These results imply that attachment styles and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in patients with skin diseases have multiple relations with depression...|$|R
40|$|Background: Patients {{receiving}} phototherapy {{for various}} dermatoses are {{at increased risk}} of eye damage due to ultraviolet (UV) rays. They are prescribed UV protective sunglasses by dermatologists but their exact protecting effects are not known. Aim: To study the ultraviolet protective properties of branded and unbranded UV protective sunglasses available in the Indian market, in <b>UV</b> <b>phototherapy</b> chambers. Methods: Sixteen different branded and unbranded UV protective sunglasses were collected from two opticians in Mumbai. Baseline irradiance of the UV chamber was calculated by exposing the photosensitive probe of UV photometer in the chamber. Then, the photosensitive probe of the UV photometer was covered with the UV protective glass to be studied and irradiance was noted. Such readings were taken for each of the UV protective sunglasses. The percentage reduction in the UV rays&#x 2032; penetration of different UV protective sunglasses was calculated. Results: Thirteen sunglasses provided > 80 &#x 0025; reduction in UVA rays penetration, of which four were branded (out of the four branded studied) and nine were unbranded (out of the 12 unbranded studied). More than 70 &#x 0025; reduction in UVB penetration was provided by 12 sunglasses, which included 10 unbranded and two branded sunglasses. Conclusion: All branded sunglasses provided good protection against UVA penetration, but UVB protection provided by both branded and unbranded sunglasses was not satisfactory. A few unbranded sunglasses had poor efficacy for UVA and UVB spectra; one branded glass had poor efficacy for protection against the UVB spectrum. The efficacy of sunglasses used for phototherapy should be assessed before use...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Clinical studies {{comparing}} intermittent versus continuous phototherapy {{for reducing}} neonatal hyperbilirubinemia have produced conflicting results. This {{study was conducted}} to compare the efficacy of intermittent with continuous phototherapy. Methods: This study was performed on 114 neonates with indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Inclusion criteria were body weight above 2000 grams, absence of other concomitant diseases, and hyperbilirubinemia neither requiring intensive phototherapy nor exceeding the range of exchange transfusion. The neonates were randomly divided into two groups. Continuous phototherapy group received phototherapy on and off for 2 hours and half an hour respectively and the intermittent phototherapy group on and off for one hour. The <b>phototherapy</b> <b>units</b> were identical and serum total bilirubin levels were measured every 12 hours after starting phototherapy. Findings: Two groups were matched regarding weight and risk factors such as ABO and Rh incompatibility. The difference of total serum bilirubin levels between two groups was insignificant at the start of phototherapy and also after 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours (P> 0. 2). Conclusion: Intermittent phototherapy defined as one hour on and one hour off is as effective as continuous phototherapy defined as 2 hours on and half an hour off, in reducing total serum bilirubin level in full term babies...|$|R

This study evaluated the efficacy of a nutritional complement rich in omega- 3 fatty acids in patients with mild or moderate plaque psoriasis. Thirty patients were recruited, 15 of whom were given topical treatment with tacalcitol, forming the control group. The remaining 15 patients were given topical tacalcitol and 2 capsules of Oravex&reg; daily. Three visits, the baseline, intermediate (week 4), and final (week 8), were held over an 8 -week period. The main efficacy endpoints were the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) and Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI). A clear and significant improvement was observed in all the efficacy endpoints in both groups between the baseline visit and the end visit. This improvement was significantly greater in the group treated additionally with Oravex&reg; than in the control group. Supplementary treatment with omega- 3 fatty acids complements topical treatment in psoriasis, and makes {{a significant contribution to}} reducing PASI and NAPSI and improving DLQI; and to reducing scalp lesion and pruritus, erythema, scaling, and infiltration of the treated areas.

40|$|By {{virtue of}} its {{capacity}} {{to serve as a}} counter-receptor for lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) plays a pivotal role in generation and maintenance of immunologic/ inflammatory skin diseases by mediating leukocyte/ keratinocyte adhesion. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may exert both antiinflammatory effects (e. g., <b>UV</b> <b>phototherapy)</b> and proinflammatory effects (e. g., triggering of photosensitive skin diseases) on human skin. Recent evidence indicates that UVR-induced changes of keratinocyte ICAM- 1 expression constitute the molecular basis for these ambivalent properties of UVR, as UVR is able to exert two separate and even opposite effects on ICAM- 1 expression. As an antiinflammatory effect, UVR may inhibit cytokine-induced up-regulation of keratinocyte ICAM- 1 expression, whereas induction of ICAM- 1 expression by UVR represents a proinflammatory activity. This latter effect is mediated by an autocrine mechanism involving interleukin (IL) -lα. In this autocrine system, UVR exposure of human keratinocytes leads to the release of IL- 1 α, which in turn up-regulates the expression of IL- 1 receptor type 1 molecules on the keratinocyte surface, thereby increasing the sensitivity of these cells toward IL-lα. As a consequence, irradiated keratinocytes are capable of responding to endogenously produced IL-lα by increasing ICAM- 1 expression. Modulation of keratinocyte ICAM- 1 expression after UVR exposure may be observed after both short-wave UVR (UVB; 280 – 320 nm) and longwave UVR (UVA 1; 340 – 400 nm). The photobiologic mechanisms underlying UVB versus UVA 1 radiation-induced ICAM- 1 modulation have been found to differ. Although not completely delineated, UVB radiation-induced modulation of ICAM- 1 expression appears to be mediated via the induction of DNA damage, whereas UVA 1 radiation effects involve the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates.

40|$|Objective: Pityriasis lichenoides is a papulosquamous {{inflammatory}} skin disease. Narrowband ultraviolet B, {{a commonly}} used phototherapeutic modality, {{has an important}} place in its treatment. Treatment and follow-up results of pityriasis lichenoides patients treated with narrowband ultraviolet B in our <b>phototherapy</b> <b>unit</b> are presented here. Methods: The treatment records of 25 pityriasis lichenoides patients who completed narrowband ultraviolet B treatment were retrospectively evaluated. Ultraviolet B treatment was performed 3 days a week until complete resolution or minimal residual activity was achieved. Treatment response was determined as complete, marked, moderate or mild improvement or as no response. The appearance of new skin lesions during the follow-up period after treatment {{was defined as a}} relapse. Results: The mean age of the patients was 22 (min-max: 3 - 49) and the mean disease duration was 30. 2 (min-max: 3 - 120) months. After a mean of 24. 6 (min-max: 12 - 45) treatment sessions, 17 patients (68 %) achieved complete, 4 patients (16 %) marked, 1 patient moderate (4 %) and 1 patient (4 %) mild improvement whereas 2 patients (8 %) showed no response. Eight patients (32 %) had mild to moderate erythema at least once during the treatment. None of the patients gave up treatment due to side effects. In all 9 patients who were followed up, relapse was seen after a mean time of 10. 1 months (min-max 1 - 24 months). Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} show that narrowband ultraviolet B is an effective and safe method in the treatment of pityriasis lichenoides...|$|R
