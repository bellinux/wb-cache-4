25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} the Litany, and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} is much better than the Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what he calls the true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve the Litany.|$|E
25|$|Systems of {{government}} are dynamic {{and they are}} bound to change {{in accordance with the}} wishes of and aspirations of the people...During my term of office, I selflessly dedicated myself to the good cause of Mother Malawi in the fight against Poverty, Ignorance and Disease among many other issues; but if within the process, those who worked in my government or through false pretence in my name or indeed unknowingly by me, pain and suffering was caused to anybody in this country in the name of nationhood, I offer my sincere apologies. I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> our past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if we have to move forward at all.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It {{is easy to see}} that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E

500|$|The new {{station was}} opened in stages. It was {{partially}} ready in 1909, {{with the main}} booking hall opening on 11 June 1911. A vehicular roadway to the station opened on 18 December 1911. The connection to Waterloo Junction was removed in March that year, but a siding remained until 3 May 1925. The bridge remained in place and {{was used as a}} walkway between the two stations. Construction of the main station continued sporadically throughout World War I, and the new station finally opened in 1922, with 21 platforms and a [...] long concourse. The roof and platforms were initially designed by J. W. Jacomb-Hood, who travelled to the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> station designs for inspiration. Following Jacomb-Hood's death in 1914, work was taken over by Alfred Weeks Szlumper. It was built in an Imperial Baroque style out of Portland stone. James Robb Scott designed the office range. The new station included a large stained glass window depicting the L's company crest over the main road entrance, surrounded by a frieze listing the counties served by the railway (the latter still survives today). These features were retained in the design, despite the fact that, by the time the station opened, the 1921 Railway Act had been passed, which spelt the end of the L as an independent concern.|$|E

500|$|Other Christian critics {{wrote that}} Avatar has [...] "an {{abhorrent}} New Age, pagan, anti-capitalist worldview that promotes goddess worship {{and the destruction}} of the human race" [...] and suggested that Christian viewers interpret the film as a reminder of Jesus Christ as [...] "the True Avatar". Some of them also suspected Avatar of subversive retelling of the biblical Exodus, by which Cameron [...] "invites <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Bible from the side of Canaanites." [...] Conversely, other commentators concluded that the film promotes theism or panentheism rather than pantheism, arguing that the hero [...] "does not pray to a tree, but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally" [...] and, unlike in pantheism, [...] "the film's deity does indeed—contrary to the native wisdom of the Na'vi—interfere in human affairs." [...] Ann Marlowe of Forbes agreed, saying that [...] "though Avatar has been charged with [...] "pantheism", its mythos is just as deeply Christian." [...] Another author suggested that the film's message [...] "leads to a renewed reverence for the natural world—a very Christian teaching." [...] Saritha Prabhu, an Indian-born columnist for The Tennessean, saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism: [...] "What pantheism is, at least, to me: a silent, spiritual awe when looking (as Einstein said) at the 'beauty and sublimity of the universe', and seeing the divine manifested in different aspects of nature. [...] What pantheism isn't: a touchy-feely, kumbaya vibe as is often depicted. [...] No wonder many Americans are turned off." [...] Prabhu also criticized Hollywood and Western media for what she saw as their generally poor job of portraying Eastern spirituality.|$|E

2500|$|Cunningham began {{teaching}} at the City College of New York (19621965) and the Brooklyn Museum Art School (19621980). His Sunday high school scholarship class at BMAS {{came to be known}} for its nontraditional methods of figurative painting, observing directly from nature using a plumb-line and finder, and putting down on the flat surface of the canvas abstracted color-value notes. Students included Peter Colquhoun, Israel Hershberg, Richard Leto and Ephraim Rubenstein. [...] "Francis Cunningham taught us all how to see," [...] said Rubenstein. [...] "He continually implored <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> nature freshly 'like a new-born babe,' or like 'a man from Mars,' who had never laid eyes before on the things of this earth". Cunningham taught at the Art Students League of New York (19801983). In 1980, he co-founded The New Brooklyn School of Life, Painting, Drawing & Sculpture, Inc., with the sculptor, Barney Hodes. Together they also co-founded with Stuart Pivar The New York Academy of Art (19831985), which continues to operate in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{a widely}} held opinion that {{dyslexia}} is associated with remarkably artistic creativity." [...] This leads to <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> art schools {{to see if there}} are high numbers of people who have dyslexia. The answer is yes, there is an unusually high correlation between people with dyslexia and art students. The question should be why? [...] There are speculations that dyslexics have differing brain structures and functions. There tends to be a lack of objective studies that confirm the art and dyslexia relationship. The Wolff and Lundberg article implies that it isn't that easy to get into art school; that people with dyslexia earn their entrance into the art schools on artistic merit, as an easy way out of conventional academics. Corlu, Özcan, and Korkmazlar suggest that further research is a valid research concern. There are studies that seemingly coincide with the concept that people with dyslexia see the world differently. There seems to be evidence that dyslexics have a superior level of visuospatial skill. Gross and Bornstein think that dyslexia might be due to a difficulty in treating mirror images as the same stimulus, when taking into consideration words that are commonly switched, such as god and dog, no and on, and saw and was.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the normative reason(s) for extending protection to close personal relationships such as cohabitation for the purposes of dealing with property matters when the relationship terminates. There has been an increasing shift from defining cohabitation along the marriage model (and, with it, a sexual nexus) to focusing on the ‘couple’, their commitment and interdependence as the fulcrum for extending protection. This is a trend that can be discerned in recent divorce and constructive trust cases where marriage, and even cohabitation, is acknowledged as a form of partnership. The focus on commitment is to be welcomed as it moves us away from conjugality as the basis for extending recognition to cohabitants. However, there remains a tendency to conflate commitment and interdependence with the issue of economic vulnerability and to make the latter the remedial objective of the law, which limits <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> patterns of dependence rather than more interactive patterns of commitment. The paper will consider the ways in which commitment and interdependence are being currently constructed by the law and what aspects of sharing lives are deemed particularly crucial to warrant the extension of some legal protection. It seeks to argue that the law has to go beyond the economic hardship trajectory and {{that there has to be}} greater interrogation of the nexus between sharing lives (and a home), commitment and interdependence...|$|R
