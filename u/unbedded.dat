50|$|A Waulsortian mudmound is a {{geographical}} feature formed in warm tropical {{waters in the}} Viséan geological age, now transposed to the temperate regions in Europe. It {{is a type of}} bioconstruction, rich in fossils.The rock comprises light grey, <b>unbedded,</b> micritic limestone, heavily jointed with calcite veining. There is some galena and sphalerite mineralisation in the joints. The fossils are mainly Crinoid ossicles together with gastropods and brachiopods.|$|E
50|$|Dolostone or {{dolomite}} rock is a sedimentary carbonate rock {{that contains a}} high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2. In old USGS publications it was referred to as magnesian limestone, a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolostones or magnesium-rich limestones. Technically, dolostone has a stoichiometric ratio of nearly equal amounts of magnesium and calcium. Most dolostones formed as a magnesium replacement of limestone or lime mud prior to lithification. It is resistant to erosion and can either contain bedded layers or be <b>unbedded.</b> It is less soluble than limestone in weakly acidic groundwater, but it can still develop solution features over time. Dolostone can act as an oil and natural gas reservoir.|$|E
50|$|A basal breccia {{is present}} in many areas with large clasts derived from the {{underlying}} Lewisian. There is local evidence of weathering of the gneiss beneath the unconformity. Away from the unconformity the breccia becomes crudely stratified within an overall fining upwards sequence passing up into pebbly sandstones, the deposits of small alluvial fans. This breccia facies passes vertically and laterally in most places into muddy massive sandstones, true greywackes. The lower part of these sandstones are almost <b>unbedded</b> being replaced upwards by half metre thick beds capped by siltstones often with well-preserved desiccation structures. In parts of the outcrop, the muddy sandstones are succeeded by the deposits of a braided river system, trough cross-bedded sandstones and conglomerates.|$|E
60|$|O that <b>unbedding</b> of the lark! The {{world that}} was so still before now all at once had a sound; not a single song and not in one place, but a sound {{composed}} of a thousand individual sounds, {{rising out of the}} dark earth at a distance on my right hand and up into the dusky sky, spreading far and wide even as the light was spreading {{on the opposite side of}} the heavens--a sound as of multitudinous twanging, girding, and clashing instruments, mingled with shrill piercing voices that were not like the voices of earthly beings. They were not human nor angelic, but passionless, and it was as if the whole visible world, the dim grassy plain and the vast pale sky sprinkled with paling stars, moonlit and dawnlit, had found a voice to express the mystery and glory of the morning.|$|R
50|$|The keep is on {{the summit}} of a large {{carboniferous}} rock, which is the highest and most prominent point for miles around. This is now identified as a Waulsortian mudmound. The rock comprises light grey, <b>unbedded,</b> micritic limestone, heavily jointed with calcite veining. There is some galena and sphalerite mineralisation in the joints. It is rich in fossils: mainly Crinoid ossicles together with gastropods and brachiopods. There has been much debate on how these mud mounds were formed. One theory led to them being called reef knolls, knoll reefs, or bioherms but work in 1972 by Miller & Grayson explained their structure.Clitheroe Castle is the most southwesterly of a chain of mudmounds in the Bowland Sub-basin of the Craven Basin, that has been dubbed the Clitheroe 'Reef' Belt. They include important geological sites at Salthill and Bellman quarries, Crow Hill and Worsaw, Gerna and Sykes.|$|E
40|$|Forty {{indurated}} sediment {{samples from}} Site 516 were studied {{to determine the}} cause of acoustic anisotropy in carbonate- bearing deep-sea sediments. Recovered from sub-bottom depths between 388 and 1222 m, the samples have properties exhibiting the following ranges: wet-bulk density, 1. 90 - 2. 49 g/cm 3; fractional porosity, 0. 45 - 0. 14; carbonate content, 33 - 88 %; compressional-wave velocity (at 0. 1 kbar pressure), 1. 87 - 4. 87 km/s; and anisotropy, 1 - 13 %. Velocities were measured in three mutually perpendicular directions through the same specimen in 29 of the 40 samples studied. Calcite fabric has been estimated by X-ray pole figure goniometry. The major findings of this study are: 1) Carbonate-bearing deep-sea sediments may be regarded as transversely isotropic media with symmetry axes normal to bedding. 2) Calcite c-axes are weakly concentrated in a direction perpendicular to bedding, but the preferred orientation of calcite does not contribute significantly to velocity anisotropy. 3) The properties of bedded and <b>unbedded</b> samples are distinctly different. <b>Unbedded</b> sediments exhibit low degrees of acoustic anisotropy (1 - 5 %). By contrast, bedded samples show higher degrees of anisotropy (to 13 %), and anisotropy increases markedly with depth of burial. Thus, bedding must be regarded as the principal cause of acoustic anisotropy in calcareous, deep-sea sediments...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first modern volcanological study of a subglacial-to-emergent {{rhyolite}} tuya, at SE Rauðufossafjöll, Torfajökull, Iceland. A flat-topped edifice with a volume of ~ 1 km 3 was emplaced in Upper Pleistocene time beneath a glacier > 350 m thick. Although it shares morphological characteristics with basaltic tuyas, the lithofacies indicate a very different eruption mechanism. Field observations suggest that the eruption began with vigorous phreatomagmatic explosions within a well-drained ice vault, building a pile of <b>unbedded</b> ash up to 300 m thick. This {{was followed by a}} subaerial effusive phase, in which compound lava flows were emplaced within ice cauldrons. Small-volume effusive eruptions on the volcano flanks created several lava bodies, with a variety of features (columnar-jointed sides, subaerial tops, peperitic bases) that are used to reconstruct spatially-heterogeneous patterns of volcano-ice interaction. Volcaniclastic sediments exposed in a stream section provide evidence for channelised meltwater drainage and fluctuating depositional processes during the eruption. We develop models for the evolution of SE Rauðufossafjöll, and discuss the differences between subglacial rhyolitic and basaltic eruption mechanisms, which are principally caused by contrasting hydrological patterns...|$|E
40|$|With an ever {{increasing}} demand placed on wood fiber supply by industry, {{it has become}} imperative that every feasible means be pursued which will increase the wood fiber production per acre of land on every plantsble site. With this in mind, {{this study was conducted}} in an attempt to determine the effect of bedding in intensive site preparation on the total height and survival of two year old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda, L.) seedlings planted on bottomland and upland sites. Forty row (or lineal) plots 100 feet long were established on machine planted areas on bedded and <b>unbedded,</b> bottomland and upland sites. Plot distribution was ten plots on sheared, raked and bedded on both bottomland and upland sites, and ten plots on sheared, raked, and not bedded (control) on the same two sites. At {{the end of the second}} growing season, mechanical and chemical analyses were conducted on 280 soil samples extracted by a soil tube. Seedling survival and total height was also determined on each plot at the end of the second growing season. Evaluation of the data by analysis of variance revealed that site did have a significant influence on height and that treatment (bedding) had a significant positive effect (at the 1 percent level) on survival...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} advanced by Wagner (1970) and contested by others (Waitt and Davis, 1988) that a long, arcuate ridge in the Miller Brook valley, northwestern Vermont, is the lateral and end moraine of a post-icesheet alpine glacier. To evaluate this hypothesis, we mapped the feature at 1 : 2, 500 scale with 2 m contours and we examined soil profiles for ten soil pits on {{and near the}} feature. Matrix grain size, clast lithology and orientation were quantified for some pits. All pits located on the moraine contain unsorted, <b>unbedded,</b> loose, sandy diamict with subangular clasts, 13 % of which are erratic. We {{found no evidence of}} post-glacial fluvial erosion along the margin of the ridge and conclude that the feature is a moraine. To evaluate the climatic potential for post-icesheet alpine glaciation, we estimated the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) of a hypothetical alpine glacier in the Miller Brook “cirque ” utilizing an accumulation-area ratio of 0. 65. We compared this ELA (480 m) to an estimate of the contemporary July freezing isotherm (3050 m) and estimated the summer temperature depression necessary to support an alpine glacier. Our calculations indicate that summer temperatures must drop about 14 ° C to support an alpine glacier in the Miller Brook valley. Despite several potential sources of inaccuracy, the large discrepancy between our estimates and paleo-climatic evidence from other research suggests that this moraine was deposited by a lobe of the waning continental icesheet; our work does not support Wagner’s assertion that this moraine is the deposit of an independent mountain glacier...|$|E
40|$|Seventy {{pregnant}} {{sows and gilts}} in gestation crates with <b>unbedded</b> concrete-slat {{floors and}} partitions in common (which permitted contact by neighbors) in a closed house with air temperature 10 to 12 degrees C during cold weather were studied for 3 wk. The animals' lower critical temperature and thermoregulatory heat and feed requirements were estimated from measured variables, including ME intake, body weight and its change and body surface temperature, and other calculated values and assumptions. Estimates for a 165 -kg sow or gilt {{in such an environment}} were: lower critical temperature = 15 degrees C; thermoregulatory heat requirement = 126 to 161 kcal/d per 1 C degree of coldness (higher as pregnancy progresses); and thermoregulatory feed requirement = 42 to 54 g/d per 1 C degree of coldness (assuming 3 kcal ME/g of diet). The sow's lower critical temperature was affected by state of pregnancy; in late pregnancy it was 1. 6 to 2. 6 C degrees lower than in early pregnancy. These estimates of the pregnant sow's thermoregulatory heat and feed requirements at effective environmental temperatures below the lower critical temperature accord well with those published before. But this estimate of the pregnant sow's lower critical temperature is approximately 5 C degrees lower than several made in laboratory settings on animals held individually, with no opportunity to huddle. The fact that every sow and gilt in this experiment could make mechanical contact with at least one neighbor at all times, and sometimes two, might account for much of the difference in lower critical temperature estimates...|$|E
40|$|Diatremes in the Navajo {{volcanic}} field were emplaced in steep pipes or dome-shaped “blind” eruptions. Aprons of bedded and stratified deposits envelope some {{of these}} complexes, providing insight into their eruptive histories. The pyroclastic apron at Cathedral Cliff diatreme preserves deposits and bedforms indicative of high energy emplacement of gas-charged magma. Field studies document multiple (18 +) eruptive cycles from distinct, episodic discharges of gas and pyroclastic material at depths of 1500 to 2000 feet. Erupted material in each cycle is 6 to 15 feet thick and contains three main deposit types. Basal deposits in each cycle are <b>unbedded,</b> matrix to clast supported, heterolithic tuff breccia with angular to subrounded fragments of essential, cognate and accidental material up to 30 cm in maximum dimension. This is overlain by thin bedded, crudely-graded tuff breccia with similar types of pebble-sized fragments. Cycles are usually capped by thinly-laminated to thin-bedded ash-rich tuffs that preserve cross stratification, impact structures, and erosional surfaces. Each cycle thus transitioned from highly explosive and chaotic deposition of material to finer ash-rich material dominated by transport bedforms. The tops of most cycles are scoured and truncated by basal deposits of the next cycle. Beds in the pyroclastic apron dip steeply {{toward the center of}} the diatreme. Cross lamination, scour surfaces, "bomb" sags, and graded bedding indicate that the oldest deposits are on the outer margin of the pyroclastic apron with successive deposits inward. The results of this investigation provide evidence for multiple and discrete subterranean eruptions during diatreme formation. This is consistent with models that involve the rise and expansion of gas-rich “bubbles” that ultimately exceed lithostatic pressure and erupt. These “bubbles” expand and release gas upwards, and then collapse in subsurface chambers, depositing subvertical masses of pyroclastic material. Our results, however, indicate a progression in each cycle from clast-laden material to low-density gas-rich and clast-poor material. The data lends support for multiple eruptive pulses during diatreme formation related to magmatic-gas decompression, as opposed to periodic interaction with groundwater reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|The western Caribbean Basin {{is notable}} for its tectonic stability. It has {{experienced}} no historical earthquakes or the tsunami that sometimes accompany them. This paper describes a single, wedge-shaped, boulder-covered, coastal berm on the Yucatán coast of México that stretches unbroken for 50 km across a coastal segment characterized by rocky headlands that alternate with crescent beaches. The {{remainder of the}} 350 km of Yucatán coast consists mostly of mangrove that extends 1 to 30 km inland, often behind long, sandy beaches. On the headlands, {{the surface of the}} berm is densely paved with boulders—large boulders on its seaward face and smaller boulders and cobbles on its gently sloping inland surface. The top of the berm reaches an elevation. 4 m, above the reach of all but the largest modern storm waves. Berm sediments on the headlands consist of two distinct layers of <b>unbedded</b> coarse sand with numerous randomly distributed boulders and cobbles in the lower layer and a crudely textured gravel and sand layer above. At first glance the two layers appear to be separated by 20 cm of white sand above a thin, discontinuous zone of dark, greyish sand that contains isolated balls and smears of black organic material, apparently derived from a soil, or possibly leaf litter. The berm and its associated boulders track the modern coastal morphology in precise detail as it follows the form of modern headlands, bays, and transcoastal channels, indicating that deposition took place after development of the present coast. The berm sediments record two or three large waves, depending on whether the wave that deposited the boulder pavement is regarded as part of the second wave or as a separate wave. Radiocarbon dating indicates that at least one wave struck the coast approximately 1500 years before present. Minimum wave run-up exceeds 4 m above present sea level, and inland inundation reached 400 m along bays and transcoastal channels. The position and elevation of the berm, its lack of well-developed internal bedding, the paving of the berm surface by thousands of boulders, and its 400 -m extent inland along channels and bays are features commonly associated with tsunami. However, some recent studies conclude that all of the features listed also can be produced by mega-hurricanes. Placed in the context of our literature search of the recent history of hurricanes and tsunami in the Caribbean Basin, we conclude that the single berm on the Yucatán coast represents an anomalous event for this area and that the berm sediments bear a strong similarity to descriptions of sediments from some historical tsunami and are unlike sedimentary features associated with historical hurricanes...|$|E
40|$|Guffey Butte is a basaltic maar and tuff cone {{complex that}} was formed about one {{million years ago}} near the southwestern margin of the western Snake River Plain. Its {{evolution}} was characterized by two distinctly similar, yet non-synchronous, sequences of events. The result of these events is a single complex volcanic structure comprised of deposits from two separate vent systems. The stratigraphy in both parts of the volcano reflect one or more 2 ̆ 2 drying out 2 ̆ 2 cycles in which the amount of external water that interacted with the magma was gradually reduced. The two vent complexes differ from {{one another in the}} chemical compositions of their magmas, the nature of their pyroclastic deposits, and the overall morphology of their cones and craters. The earlier of the Guffey Butte vent systems (GBV 1) produced a maar-tuff ring characterized by thick deposits of planar and dune bedded pyroclastic surge deposits. Juvenile ash in GBV 1 deposits is commonly vesicular (Type 2 ash shards of Woheltz, 1983). GBV 1 basalts are slightly more mafic than those in the younger complex; however, they also appear to have assimilated slightly greater amounts of shallow crustal rocks. The average composition of plagioclase phenocrysts in GBV 1 basalts is about AnS 7. The younger Guffey Butte vent system (GBV 2) produced a tuff cone composed largely of massive, <b>unbedded</b> tuffs containing at least two units of welded spatter. Juvenile ash in GBV 2 deposits consists mainly of blocky glass shards (Type 1 shards of Woheltz, 1983). GBV 2 basalts are slightly more differentiated than those of GBV 1 and plagioclase phenocrysts have average compositions of An 47. The relative ages to the two vent systems were determined in part by the fact that GBV 2 pyroclastic deposits contain accidental fragments having the ash morphology characteristics and chemical and mineralogical compositions of GBV 1 basalts. In contrast, no material typical of GBV 2 was found in the deposits produced by the GBV 1 vent. The two vent systems at Guffey Butte may have produced different types of structures and deposits because the physical condition of the stratigraphy through which they erupted was different. The pre-Guffey Butte stratigraphy consists of fluvial-lacustrine sediments and a few basaltic lava flows, at least one of which is up to 33 m thick. The GBV 1 magma may have become stalled beneath one of these flows, resulting in a buildup of pressure and a large highly energetic explosion. The maar-tuff cone morphology, dominance of surge deposits, vesicular shards, and crustal assimilation is consistent with this scenario. The GBV 2 magmas encountered no significant barrier so they erupted less explosively, producing a tuff cone. The Type 1 shards and lower level of contamination associated with these basalts suggests a more rapid rise and greater access to ground water. The evolution of Guffey Butte therefore supports models for hydrovolcanism that emphasize the nature of the stratigraphy through which magmas rise as well as the relative mixing proportions of water and magma...|$|E
40|$|Phreatomagmatic volcanoes {{form when}} {{ascending}} magma explosively interacts with surface or groundwater at shallow depths. Three types of phreatomagmatic activity are recognised- phreaticp phreatomagmatic (s. s.) and surtseyan - {{based on the}} degree of involvement of magma with water and the depth of the interaction. Phreatic maars and phreatomagmatic tuff-rings are underlain by pipe-like diatremes but these structures are poorly developed or absent in surtseyan tuff-rings. Comparisons of phreatomagmatic volcanoes with their eroded diatreme equivalents, which contain subsided subaerially-deposited material, allow a model for activity of this type to be constructed. The Saefell tuff-ring SW Iceland is a surtseyantype structure whose crater remained open to the sea during most of its activity, allowing easy access of water to the magma. Base-surges sourced partly from directed blasts, formed large dunes with internal structures indicating deposition by density currents whose flowpower decreased with time and with distance from the vent. Syndepositional slumping and minor en masse collapse of crater deposits formed a pile of massive tuffs above which subsequent surge and airfall activity deposited a nestedg inner crater rim. The Medano tuff-ring Tenerife, is a phreatomagmatictype structure whose crater contains reworked tuffs deposited during subsidence into the underlying diatreme. Initial activity ejected much country rock material as magma contacted groundwater at depth but with time eruptions became more strombolian, as water was used up or failed {{to gain access to the}} vent. Surges were less common than in the Saefell eruption because the Medano water: magma ratio and explosion depth less often fulfilled the optimum conditions for surge production. The East Lothian diatremes in Scotland are subdivided into two groups on the basis of their infilling. The Red group diatremes contain high proportions of sediment and represent the subsided products of phreatic maars which erupted into a pile of water-rich poorly-consolidated alluvial plain sediments. The later Green group diatremes contain mainly juvenile basalt fragments and formed as phreatomagmatic or sometimes surtseyan tuff-rings, due to magma contacting water at shallow depths or in marginal lakes respectively. The Parade diatreme, Dunbar, contains over 300 m of largely base-surge tuffs thought to represent the subsided inner flank deposits of a large maar. The Heads of Ayr and the East Fife diatremes expose different levels in subsided phreatomagmatic tuff-rings due to collapse-ahd erosion. Deep levels such as that exposed at Lundin Links, contain <b>unbedded</b> tuffs and abundant intrusive material. Shallower levels, such as at Elie Ness contain high proportions of bedded tuffs which are often centroclinally orientated. Base-surge, airfall, slumped and reworked tuffs in the Scottish diatremes are directly comparable to deposits in the modern tuff-rings studied proving their origin. A model for the formation of surtseyan tuff-rings is presented, with phreatomagmatic explosions resulting from steam expansion jets which disrupt an already vesiculating magma as it engulfes subsiding water-laden ash. A base surge model is also presented, involving deposition of tuffs with characteristic bedforms and structures by the head, body and tail of each surge analogous to turbidity currents. Cooling of hot, dry steam to cool moist steam towards the rear of surge pulses leads to lag breccias and progressive dune deposits being succeeded by regressive dunes and plastering structures with time. Juvenile sideromelane fragments erupted by phreatomagmatic volcanoes rapidly alter to palagonite as heated pore-waters circulate through the newly-deposited tuffs. Palagonitization results in cation mobility within unstable glass and precipitation of authigenic minerals in voids. Non-equilibrium growth of such minerals results in variable compositions and crystal forms. Subsequent alteration occurs slowly as a weathering process whose rate is greatly reduced as authigenic precipitation closes pore spaces within the tuffs. On diagenesis, unstable alteration products are commonly replaced by chlorite, calcite and clay. Reddening of some tuffs occurs by in situ breakdown of ironbearing minerals and release of Fe to solution although groundwater exchange with red country rock sediments may also occur. Unless present in diatremes phreatomagmatic products have a low preservation potential due to :- extreme alteration, rapid syn- and post-volcanic reworking, low ejecta volumes and breaching and burial beneath later lavas. In contrast the sedimentary structures petrography, morphology and grain size characteristics of diatreme tuffs are shown to be often sufficiently well preserved to permit the identification of their original surface volcanoes and their eruptive histories. ...|$|E
