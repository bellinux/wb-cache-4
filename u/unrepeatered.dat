For {{the first time}} in <b>unrepeatered</b> transmission, the {{performance of}} two amplification systems is investigated and directly compared in terms of achievable information rates (AIRs) : 1) erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) and 2) second-order bidirectional Raman pumped amplification. The experiment is performed over different span lengths, demonstrating that, for an AIR of 6. 8 bit/s/Hz, the Raman system enables an increase of 93 km (36 %) in span length. Further, at these distances, MC-DBP gives an improvement in AIR of 1 bit/s/Hz (to 7. 8 bit/s/Hz) for both amplification schemes. The theoretical AIR gains for Raman and MC-DBP are shown to be preserved when considering low-density parity-check codes. Additionally, MC-DBP algorithms for both amplification schemes are compared in terms of performance and computational complexity. It is shown that to achieve the maximum MC-DBP gain, the Raman system requires approximately four times the computational complexity due to the distributed impact of fibre nonlinearity...|$|E

Unfortunately, the ultimate performance of URFL amplifiers, where symmetric pumping leads to the lowest SPV along the span, and hence to the best possible balance between ASE noise and nonlinear impairments, is limited by the increased relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer from pump to propagating signal related to high forward pump powers and front-end reflectivities, which may be detrimental for transmission performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analysis of the}} polarization properties of twisted single-mode fibers is presented. It is shown that whereas a conventionally twisted fiber possesses considerable optical rotation, a fiber which has a permanent twist imparted by spinning the preform during fiber drawing exhibits almost no polarization anisotropy. It is thus possible to virtually eliminate the commonly observed fiber linear birefringence. As a consequence, fibers made in this way are ideally suited {{for use in the}} Faraday-effect current transducer. It is further shown that a permanent twist of a few turns/meter effectively eliminates polarization mode-dispersion.

40|$|High {{spectral}} efficiency modulation format based <b>unrepeatered</b> transmission systems using distributed Raman amplifier (DRA) have {{attracted much attention}} recently. To enhance the reach and optimize system performance, careful design of DRA is required based on the analysis of various types of impairments and their balance. In this paper, we study various pump RIN induced distortions on high {{spectral efficiency}} modulation formats. The vector theory of both 1 st and higher-order stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) effect using Jones-matrix formalism is presented. The pump RIN will induce three types of distortion on high spectral efficiency signals: intensity noise stemming from SRS, phase noise stemming from cross phase modulation (XPM), and polarization crosstalk stemming from cross polarization modulation (XPolM). An analytical model for the statistical property of relative phase noise (RPN) in higher order DRA without dealing with complex vector theory is derived. The impact of pump RIN induced impairments are analyzed in polarization-multiplexed (PM) -QPSK and PM- 16 QAM-based <b>unrepeatered</b> systems simulations using 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd-order forward pumped Raman amplifier. It is shown that at realistic RIN levels, negligible impairments will be induced to PM-QPSK signals in 1 st and 2 nd order DRA, while non-negligible impairments will occur in 3 rd order case. PM- 16 QAM signals suffer more penalties compared to PM-QPSK with the same on-off gain where both 2 nd and 3 rd order DRA will cause non-negligible performance degradations. We also investigate the performance of digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms to mitigate such impairments. Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} basic {{principles}} and recent advances of Raman fibre laser (RFL) based amplification techniques in long-haul/unrepeatered coherent transmission systems. Different aspects of RFL based amplification have been characterised, including signal power distributions and relative intensity noise (RIN). Various RFL based amplifier designs have been evaluated in long-haul coherent transmission systems. The results shows the Fabry-Perot fibre laser based amplifier with two fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) gives significant Q factor penalty using symmetrical bidirectional pumping, as the RIN of the signal is increased dramatically. However, random distributed feedback fibre laser based amplifier with a single FBG near the output section can mitigate the RIN of the signal, which {{enables the use of}} bidirectional second order pumping and therefore gives the best transmission performance up to 7915 km.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a {{detailed study of}} different Raman fibre laser (RFL) based amplification techniques and their applications in long-haul/unrepeatered coherent transmission systems. RFL based amplifications techniques were characterised from different aspects, including signal/noise power distributions, relative intensity noise (RIN), mode structures of induced Raman fibre lasers, and so on. It was found {{for the first time}} that RFL based amplification techniques could be divided into three categories in terms of the fibre laser regime, which were Fabry-Perot fibre laser with two FBGs, weak Fabry-Perot fibre laser with one FBG and very low reflection near the input, and random distributed feedback (DFB) fibre laser with one FBG. It was also found that lowering the reflection near the input could mitigate the RIN of the signal significantly, thanks to the reduced efficiency of the Stokes shift from the FW-propagated pump. In order to evaluate the transmission performance, different RFL based amplifiers were evaluated and optimised in long-haul coherent transmission systems. The results showed that Fabry-Perot fibre laser based amplifier with two FBGs gave > 4. 15 dB Q factor penalty using symmetrical bidirectional pumping, as the RIN of the signal was increased significantly. However, random distributed feedback fibre laser based amplifier with one FBG could mitigate the RIN of the signal, which enabled the use of bidirectional second order pumping and consequently give the best transmission performance up to 7915 km. Furthermore, using random DFB fibre laser based amplifier was proved to be effective to combat the nonlinear impairment, and the maximum reach was enhanced by > 28 % in mid-link single/dual band optical phase conjugator (OPC) transmission systems.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of operating a non-simultaneous, bidirectional, <b>unrepeatered</b> communications link over long lengths of optical fibre at a data rate of 1 Mb/s is discussed. The link {{is intended for}} communicating between a stationary local terminal and a mobile remote terminal. A design study of the link {{has shown that the}} optical fibre is the most critical system component and that precise characterisation of the fibre is essential. A 1 Mb/s optical fibre data link has been constructed to test the validity of the design study, and has been successfully operated over a distance of 5 km with an error-rate of < 10 ^- 9. The optical receiver utilizes a silicon PIN photodiode feeding a low-noise preamplifier while the transmitter incorporates either a high-radiance LED or a cw semiconductor injection laser, generating half-width return-to-zero optical pulses at wavelengths of 0. 9 µm and 0. 85 µm respectively. Recently a distance of 10. 5 km has been achieved with a 25 dB signal/noise ratio for the LED source. An analogue system incorporating a PIN detector and LED source has also been demonstrated. The signal/noise ratio is 21 dB over 7 km of low-loss fibre. A new method has been invented, the near-field scanning technique, for providing a simple and rapid method for obtaining reproducible and detailed index-profile measurements. The index profile is determined by observation of the light intensity variation across the output face of a short length of fibre illuminated by an incoherent source. The profile obtained in this way may be suitable for many applications; however for accurate determinations it is necessary {{to take into account the}} presence of tunneling leaky modes which contribute additional power to the inferred refractive-index profile and cause a length-dependent error. A normalised correction factor is developed which may be applied to the measured intensity profile once the fibre length, core diameter and numerical aperture are known. The technique has been extensively investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, and the resolution appears to be good when scanning typical multimode fibres. It has allowed for the first time, observation of imperfections in the index profile right down to individual cvd layers. A novel technique is also reported for the determination of the profile dispersion parameter P, by direct measurement on the fibre itself. The method is based on the fact that measurement of the wavelength dependence of the numerical aperture yields the difference in dispersion between the core and cladding glasses from which P may be calculated. Very little sample preparation is required and accurate experimental data has been obtained over the wavelength range 0. 35 to 1. 9 µm for germanosilicate, phosphosilicate and borosilicate glasses, whilst the range 0. 35 to 1. 2 µm has been covered for fluoro-silicate glass. For germanosilicate glass, P is found to be independent of both dopant concentration and thermal history. The results show that the exploitation of the longer-wavelength region will require either the design of fibres specifically for 1. 3 µm operation, or the development of fibres which exhibit a low pulse dispersion over an extended spectral range...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{state of}} the art {{components}} and subsystems {{to be used in the}} next generation of high speed optical transmission systems at 40 Gb/s. The thesis will provide guidelines for the design and implementation of 40 Gb/s systems, investigating topics that could limit transmission; chromatic dispersion, Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD), Self Phase Modulation (SPM) and linear or non-linear crosstalk among others. Regarding chromatic dispersion, sufficient evidence is presented for the need in 40 Gb/s systems of either modulation formats that allow for higher tolerance than the traditional Non Return to Zero (NRZ) or use of Tunable chromatic Dispersion Compensators (TDC). Two single channel TDCs are experimentally evaluated. The first one, based on temperature changes in a chirped fiber Bragg grating, allows to reduce significantly chromatic dispersion induced penalty in a series of different standard Single Mode Fiber (SMF) spans ranging from 21. 5 km to 41 km. The second one, based on the controlled stretching of a nonlinearly chirped fiber Bragg grating, allows for <b>unrepeatered</b> transmission in standard-SMF spans ranging from 45 km to 103 km minimizing chromatic dispersion induced penalty. An optical duobinary transmitter (Tx) is implemented and its increased tolerance to chromatic dispersion is verified in a direct comparison to an NRZ transmitter. The limitations induced by PMD in 40 Gb/s system design are investigated. It is found that even for a standardized Short haul application (maximum distance of 40 km) the maximum PMD coefficient allowed in the transmission fiber, 0. 4 ps/sqrt(km), is below the values defined by actual standards, 0. 5 ps/sqrt(km). The most promising PMD compensation methods are presented and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. A PMD compensator based on a single fixed birefringent element is evaluated at 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s. It provides an improvement of at least a factor of two in the total PMD allowed in a link. However even when using the PMD compensator it is estimated that the maximum PMD coefficient in the fibers used in a five span link with 80 km per span is 0. 25 ps/sqrt(km), still below the maximum value allowed by standards. Return to Zero (RZ) and Carrier Suppressed RZ (CSRZ) modulation formats are found to provide a significant advantage in multi-span transmission compared to the traditional NRZ or the optical duobinary modulation formats. Using a 9 ps pulsed RZ Tx, transmission is achieved over a 400 km link consisting of 5 spans of 80 km standard-SMF with a Quality (Q) factor of 17. 7 dB, while for NRZ it is reduced to 15 dB. In another experimental verification over 40 km spans of standard-SMF, we could achieve transmission over 6 spans for the aforementioned RZ Tx with a Q of 18 dB, while for NRZ, transmission over 4 spans provided a Q of 17. 5 dB. A simple analytical approach separating the limitations induced by Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) and SPM in multi-span transmission is presented and verified in the comparison of NRZ and RZ for transmission over standard-SMF with 40 km span length. The performance of NRZ, RZ, optical duobinary and CSRZ modulation formats in a 100 GHz channel spaced 40 Gb/s WDM system regarding linear crosstalk is investigated by means of simulations. It is found that RZ is seriously limited in 100 GHz channel spaced systems while NRZ and CSRZ provide enough tolerances to allow for practical system implementation. The optical duobinary format provides the best performance indicating the possibility of even narrower channel spaced systems using this modulation format. Three Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) experimental demonstrations are presented. The first one is a 100 GHz spaced 16 channel WDM system, using 40 Gb/s NRZ modulation over a 200 km link of standard-SMF. The second one is a 100 GHz spaced 32 channel 40 Gb/s WDM system, using CSRZ modulation over a 400 km link of standard-SMF and using Raman amplification. The third one is a 100 GHz spaced 6 channel WDM system, using NRZ as the modulation format, Se ??miconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA) as the in-line amplifiers and in transmission over a 160 km link with span distances of 40 km standard-SMF, traditional target distance of metro WDM systems. Possible practical implementation of 40 Gb/s single channel and WDM systems are proposed and described following the methodology used by international standardization bodies...|$|E
