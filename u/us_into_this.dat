While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; [...] "So we talked about growth, and that led <b>us</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another." [...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E

[...] (This statement from October 1947 has often been incorrectly reported as having been made much later on 15 May 1948.) Pasha told Alec Kirkbride: [...] "We will sweep them [...] into the sea". The Syrian president, Shukri al-Quwatli, told his people: [...] "We shall eradicate Zionism".|$|E

And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage. And we cried to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression. And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders. And He has brought <b>us</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.

[...] When Jake Tapper of ABC News pushed Obama to explain the fact that his administration hasn't prosecuted any Wall Street executives who didn't play by the rules, he replied, [...] "One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman's and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal; it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless." [...] On October 18, when interviewed by ABC news, he said [...] "in some ways, they’re not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party. Both on the left and the right, I think people feel separated from their government. They feel that their institutions aren’t looking out for them." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{a hearing}} before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, [...] "eople are quite unhappy {{with the state of}} the economy and what’s happening. They blame, with some justification, the {{problems}} in the financial sector for getting <b>us</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> mess, and they’re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income. We have a very frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration." ...|$|E
