5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi, {{which cause}} disease in insects, {{include at least}} 14 species that attack aphids. Beauveria bassiana is mass-produced and used to manage {{a wide variety of}} insect pests {{including}} whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are <b>used</b> <b>against</b> pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is <b>used</b> <b>against</b> root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.|$|E

The D-1 was finally withdrawn from service in the mid-seventies.|$|E

I will describe efforts to improve upon this limited arsenal with brief summaries of research to develop biological control and host plant resistance against the soybean aphid...|$|R

The drone was {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be <b>used</b> <b>against</b> an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
