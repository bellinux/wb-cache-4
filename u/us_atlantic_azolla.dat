50|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, the {{organization}} of the United States armed forces was reviewed with a view toward reorganization after the turbulent war years. On December 1, 1947, under a reorganization act of the armed forces approved by Congress, the unified combatant command, United States Atlantic Command, was established with headquarters co-located to those of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet. Admiral William H.P. Blandy was given the dual-hatted command of both <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet and <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command thus becoming the Commander-in-Chief, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet and the first Commander-in-Chief, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command. The two titles remained linked until another reorganization of the armed forces, via the Goldwater-Nichols Act in 1985, separated the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command from the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet.|$|R

25|$|McDonald was {{the last}} United States Navy admiral to command all three {{organizations}} (Allied <b>Atlantic</b> Command, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command, and <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet) at the same time. He relinquished command of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet to Admiral Carlisle A.H.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to {{establish}} a new major command, Allied Command Atlantic, under the command of a U.S. four-star admiral with headquarters in Norfolk, VA. Since this was primarily a naval command responsible for allied defense of the North Atlantic, {{the decision was made to}} co-locate this organization with that of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command and <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet, to form a triple-hatted command. On April 10, 1952, Admiral Lynde D. McCormick, the Commander-in-Chief, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command and <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet, assumed the additional title as the first Supreme Allied Commander <b>Atlantic.</b> Like the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command, the Allied Command Atlantic remained intact and part of a triple-hatted command organization until the Goldwater-Nichols Act occurred in 1985. The Goldwater-Nichols Act separated command of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet from the other two commands giving the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet its own four-star admiral. Admiral Wesley L. McDonald was the last U.S. Navy admiral to command all three organizations at the same time. He relinquished command of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet to Admiral Carlisle A. H. Trost on October 4, 1985.|$|R

50|$|However, {{under the}} Goldwater-Nichols Act, the admiral filling {{the post of}} Commander-in-Chief, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet, would also serve as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command. This role for CINCLANTFLT {{continued}} until 1986 when the Secretary of Defense approved a separate billet for the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, <b>U.S.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Command. On September 16, 1986, Admiral Frank B. Kelso II relinquished the Deputy USCINCLANT post to Major General Thomas G. Darling, USAF.|$|R
25|$|The <b>US</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet {{contained}} 100% of {{the newer}} Sims, Benson and Gleaves destroyer classes. Of the 91 destroyers deployed in <b>US</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet (leaving only 66 in the US Pacific and 13 in the US Asiatic Fleets), 52 <b>US</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet destroyers were deployed either on Atlantic Convoy duty (including a squadron escorting British Troop transports around Cape Town), in Iceland or Newfoundland; only 24 were either in <b>US</b> <b>Atlantic</b> ports (including those be fitted-out, repairs) or serving as capital ship escorts; four were stationed in Bermuda; and the remaining 8 were stationed at the Canal Zone working convoys or in port.
