5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent <b>Uveitis</b> (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. <b>Uveitis</b> in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of <b>uveitis,</b> rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all <b>uveitis</b> cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.|$|E
5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent <b>uveitis</b> and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{eye disease}} can develop {{early in the}} disease course and lead to {{permanent}} vision loss in 20 percent of cases. Ocular involvement {{can be in the}} form of posterior <b>uveitis,</b> anterior <b>uveitis,</b> or retinal vasculitis. Anterior <b>uveitis</b> presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, hypopyon, and decreased visual acuity, while posterior <b>uveitis</b> presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field floaters. A rare form of ocular (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal vasculitis which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of floaters or visual field defects.|$|E
25|$|The chronic {{recurrent}} phase may {{be marked}} by repeated bouts of <b>uveitis,</b> but is more commonly a chronic, low-grade, often subclinical, <b>uveitis</b> {{that may lead}} to granulomatous anterior inflammation, cataracts, glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Full-blown recurrences are, however, rare after the acute stage is over. Dysacusia may occur in this phase.|$|E
25|$|Several reports {{suggest the}} use of {{moxifloxacin}} may lead to <b>uveitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brucellosis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} bacterial disease {{that can cause}} <b>uveitis,</b> abortion, and orchitis in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Corneal ulcers are painful due to nerve exposure, and {{can cause}} tearing, squinting, and pawing at the eye. There may also be signs of {{anterior}} <b>uveitis,</b> such as miosis (small pupil), aqueous flare (protein in the aqueous humour), and redness of the eye. An axon reflex {{may be responsible for}} <b>uveitis</b> formation — stimulation of pain receptors in the cornea results in release inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, and acetylcholine.|$|E
25|$|There {{is almost}} {{invariably}} a secondary <b>uveitis</b> present with corneal ulceration, {{and signs of}} this may also be seen: miosis, corneal oedema, aqueous flare, hypopyon, IOP changes.|$|E
25|$|Protothecosis in dogs {{is caused}} by a mutant form of green algae and is usually disseminated. Symptoms include weight loss, <b>uveitis,</b> retinal detachment, and anal seepage.|$|E
25|$|If {{tested in}} the prodromal phase, CSF pleocytosis is found in more than 80%, mainly lymphocytes. This pleocytosis {{resolves}} in about 8 weeks even if chronic <b>uveitis</b> persists.|$|E
25|$|Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} seen in dogs characterized by <b>uveitis</b> (inflammation of {{the inside of the}} eye), poliosis (whitening of hair), and vitiligo (loss of pigment in the skin).|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin {{has also}} been used to help treat people with acute severe {{ulcerative}} colitis and autoimmune urticaria that {{do not respond to}} treatment with steroids. This drug is also used as a treatment of posterior or intermediate <b>uveitis</b> with noninfective cause.|$|E
25|$|High-dose {{corticosteroid}} {{therapy is}} often used for severe disease manifestations. Anti-TNF therapy such as infliximab has shown promise in treating the <b>uveitis</b> associated with the disease. Another Anti-TNF agent, etanercept, {{may be useful in}} people with mainly skin and mucosal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Uveitis* is {{inflammation}} {{within the}} eye. Anterior <b>uveitis</b> (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body) is {{most common in}} dogs. The disease is usually immune-mediated in dogs, but may also be caused by trauma, cataracts, infectious canine hepatitis, leptospirosis, ehrlichiosis, or systemic fungal infections.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{glaucoma}} is {{an increase}} of pressure within the eye. It is a common condition in dogs. It {{can be caused by}} abnormal development of the drainage angle of the eye, lens luxation, <b>uveitis,</b> or cancer. Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, and Basset Hounds are predisposed.|$|E
25|$|Patients with retinal tears may {{experience}} floaters if {{red blood cells}} are released from leaky blood vessels, and those with <b>uveitis</b> or vitritis, as in toxoplasmosis, {{may experience}} multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the vitreous humour.|$|E
25|$|Huskies are {{energetic}} and athletic. They {{usually have a}} thick double coat that can be gray, black, copper red, or white. Their eyes are typically pale blue, although {{they may also be}} brown, green, blue, yellow, or heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of <b>uveitis</b> than most other breeds.|$|E
25|$|Numerous aphthous ulcers {{could be}} {{indicative}} of an inflammatory autoimmune disease called Behçet's disease. This can later involve skin lesions and <b>uveitis</b> in the eyes. Vitamin C deficiency may lead to scurvy which impairs wound healing, which can contribute to ulcer formation. For a detailed discussion of the pathophysiology of aphthous stomatitis, see Aphthous stomatitis#Causes.|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{involvement}} (mild bilateral conjunctivitis) {{occurs in}} about 50% {{of men with}} urogenital reactive arthritis syndrome and about 75% of men with enteric reactive arthritis syndrome. Conjunctivitis and <b>uveitis</b> can include redness of the eyes, eye pain and irritation, or blurred vision. Eye involvement typically occurs early {{in the course of}} reactive arthritis, and symptoms may come and go.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} due to sarcoidosis {{of other}} organs may be <b>uveitis</b> (inflammation of the uveal layer in the eye), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), arthralgia (joint pains), lupus pernio (a red skin rash, usually of the face), erythema nodosum (red skin lumps, usually on the shins), {{and symptoms of}} liver involvement (jaundice) or heart involvement (heart failure).|$|E
25|$|The acute <b>uveitis</b> {{phase of}} VKH is usually {{responsive}} to high-dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration {{is usually not}} required. However, ocular complications may require an subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine, or tacrolimus, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.|$|E
25|$|The acute uveitic phase occurs a {{few days}} later and {{typically}} lasts for several weeks. This phase is heralded by bilateral panuveitis causing blurring of vision. In 70% of VKH, the onset of visual blurring is bilaterally contemporaneous; if initially unilateral, the other eye is involved within several days. The process can include bilateral granulomatous anterior <b>uveitis,</b> variable degree of vitritis, thickening of the posterior choroid with elevation of the peripapillary retinal choroidal layer, optic nerve hyperemia and papillitis, and multiple exudative bullous serous retinal detachments.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{stage of}} the disease, {{occurring}} most often {{in the spring and}} summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. Clinical signs include a fever, petechiae, bleeding disorders, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior <b>uveitis,</b> and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.|$|E
25|$|Coccidioidomycosis* is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii that affects {{a variety of}} species, {{including}} dogs. In dogs signs of primary pulmonary disease include a cough, fever, weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy. Disseminated disease occurs when the fungus has spread outside of the lungs and may include clinical signs such as lameness, pain, seizures, anterior <b>uveitis,</b> and localized swelling. Diagnosis of Valley Fever may include multiple tests, including serology and radiology. According to a study performed in the Tucson and Phoenix area, 28% of dogs will test positive for exposure to the fungus by two years of age, but only 6% of the dogs will be ill with clinical disease. There is {{an increased risk of}} infection associated with amount of time spent outdoors, a larger roaming space accessed by the dog, and increasing age.|$|E
500|$|Behçet's {{disease is}} a triad of mouth ulcers, genital ulcers and {{anterior}} <b>uveitis.</b> The main feature of Behçet's {{disease is a}}phthous-like ulceration, but this is usually more severe than seen in aphthous stomatitis without a systemic cause, and typically resembles major or herpetiforme ulceration or both. Aphthous-like ulceration is {{the first sign of}} the disease in 25–75% of cases. [...] Behçet's is more common in individuals whose ethnic origin is from regions along the Silk Road (between the Mediterranean and the Far East). It tends to be rare in other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. MAGIC syndrome is a possible variant of Behçet disease, and is associated with aphthous-like ulceration. The name stands for [...] "mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage" [...] (relapsing polychondritis).|$|E
2500|$|Equine Recurrent <b>Uveitis</b> (ERU) is {{also present}} in the breed. Appaloosas have an eightfold greater risk of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent <b>Uveitis</b> (ERU) than all other breeds combined.

2500|$|Uveitic Glaucoma {{is due to}} <b>uveitis,</b> the {{swelling}} and inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. [...] Increased eye pressure in <b>uveitis</b> can result from the inflammation itself or from the steroids used to treat it.|$|E

2500|$|In particular, acrylic-type {{contact lenses}} {{are useful for}} {{cataract}} surgery in patients that have recurrent ocular inflammation (<b>uveitis),</b> as acrylic material induce less inflammation.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the pain}} {{associated}} with corneal ulceration {{is due to the}} secondary <b>uveitis</b> and miosis, and effective relief can often be gained with topical atropine(1%), leading to mydriasis. [...] Dosing is generally q4h initially, and then as required to maintain dilation. [...] Mydriasis is also important to avoid some of the complications associated with <b>uveitis,</b> such as synechiae formation and glaucoma. [...] Pain is also associated with inflammatory response occurring in the adjacent sclera and conjunctiva, and systemic analgesia in the form of NSAIDs is usually indicated, for example, flunixin meglumin 1.1mg/kg, BID. [...] Topical NSAIDs are available (diclofenac, flurbiprofen) and effective, but have been shown to increase corneal healing time.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{factors can}} cause glaucoma, known as [...] "secondary glaucoma", {{including}} prolonged use of steroids (steroid-induced glaucoma); conditions that severely restrict {{blood flow to}} the eye, such as severe diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion (neovascular glaucoma); ocular trauma (angle-recession glaucoma); and inflammation of the middle layer of the pigmented vascular eye structure (<b>uveitis),</b> known as uveitic glaucoma.|$|E
2500|$|Brucellosis in dogs {{is caused}} by Brucella canis. [...] It is a sexually {{transmitted}} disease, but can also be spread through contact with aborted fetuses. [...] The most common sign is abortion during the last trimester or stillbirth. [...] Other symptoms include inflammation of the intervertebral disc and eye (<b>uveitis),</b> and inflammation of the testicle (orchitis) and prostate (prostatitis) in males.|$|E
2500|$|Signs for {{lymphoma}} {{in other}} sites {{depend on the}} location. [...] Central nervous system involvement can cause seizures or paralysis. [...] Eye involvement, seen in 20 to 25 percent of cases, can lead to glaucoma, <b>uveitis,</b> bleeding within the eye, retinal detachment, and blindness. [...] Lymphoma in the bone marrow causes anemia, low platelet count, and low white blood cell count.|$|E
2500|$|Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease (VKH), {{also known}} as Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada {{syndrome}}, uveomeningitis syndrome and uveomeningoencephalitic syndrome, is a multisystem disease of presumed autoimmune [...] cause, that affects pigmented tissues, which have melanin. The most significant manifestation is bilateral, diffuse <b>uveitis,</b> which affects the eye.
