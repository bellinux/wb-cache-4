40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{alteration}} in the sleep EEG in rats due to chronic exposure to low-level non-thermal electromagnetic radiation was investigated. Two types of radiation fields were used; 900 MHz <b>unmodulated</b> <b>wave</b> and 900 MHz modulated at 8 and 16 Hz waves. Animals has exposed to radiation fields for 1 month (1 h/day). EEG power spectral analyses of exposed and control animals during slow wave sleep (SWS) and {{rapid eye movement}} sleep (REM sleep) revealed that the REM sleep is more susceptible to modulated radiofrequency radiation fields (RFR) than the SWS. The latency of REM sleep increased due to radiation exposure indicating a change in the ultradian rhythm of normal sleep cycles. The cumulative and irreversible effect of radiation exposure was proposed and the interaction of the extremely low frequency radiation with the similar EEG frequencies was suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{slotted line}} has, {{for a number}} of years, {{been one of the most}} useful and {{necessary}} tools in RF and microwave measurements. It was therefore felt appropriate to attempt to design an improved version, capable of broad band operation (1 to 18 GHz) with the ability of examining modulated and <b>unmodulated</b> <b>wave</b> forms. Initially, the relevant transmission line theory was reviewed with particular emphasis placed on the concepts that were to influence the actual design. The unique feature of the project, was the use of semi-rigid cable, which greatly contributed to the realisation of the two main objectives, namely low cost and accuracy. The mechanical construction proved as important as the electrical design and for this reason both topics were analysed and discussed in some detail in the text of the thesis. The approach was justified in that on the final examination, the slotted line performed satisfactorily in comparison to more expensively purchased units, over the expected frequency range without exhibiting an anomalous behaviour. Recommendations that would improve the slotted line even further were made in the Conclusions chapter, with specific attention paid to the redesigning of the probe and the tuning mechanism...|$|E

50|$|The mode of {{transmission}} is N0N and A1A (CW). Between 0 and 8 minutes past the hour, RWM transmits a straight <b>unmodulated</b> carrier <b>wave.</b> At 9 minutes past, RWM identifies itself in Morse code. Between 10 and 20 minutes past the hour, RWM transmits a pulse of carrier every second, with the difference between UT1 and UTC in units of one-fiftieth of a second encoded onto the once-per-second pulses. Between 20 and 30 minutes past the hour, RWM transmits 10 carrier pulses each second. This transmission cycle is repeated every half-hour.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, before modern AM or FM radio {{transmission}} was developed, radio transmitters communicated information by radiotelegraphy; the transmitter was switched off and on by the operator with a telegraph key, producing pulses of radio waves, to spell out text messages in Morse code. Around 1905 the first continuous wave radio transmitters began to replace the earlier spark transmitters. The Morse code signal of the spark transmitter consisted of pulses of radio waves called damped waves which repeated at an audio rate, so they were audible as a buzz or tone in a receivers earphones. In contrast the new continuous wave transmitters produced a signal consisting of pulses of continuous <b>waves,</b> <b>unmodulated</b> sinusoidal carrier <b>waves,</b> which were inaudible in the earphones. [...] So to receive this new modulation method, the receiver had to produce a tone during the pulses of carrier.|$|R
5000|$|Dead air {{is defined}} as [...] "a period of silence {{especially}} during a radio broadcast," [...] which has been extended, in some formal definitions, to include both audio and video signals (and so to this extent, to television as well as radio broadcasts). Hence, generalizing, the term can be understood to refer to any unintended period of silence interrupting any media broadcast, during which no signal, audio or video, is transmitted. Technically, the absence of sound in a radio transmission implies that only an <b>unmodulated</b> carrier <b>wave</b> is being transmitted, for modes that send one, or absence of the transmitting signal altogether for modes that do not.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike modern AM radio {{stations}} that transmit a continuous radio frequency, whose amplitude (power) is modulated by an audio signal, the first radio transmitters transmitted information by wireless telegraphy (radiotelegraphy), the transmitter was turned {{on and off}} (on-off keying) to produce different length pulses of <b>unmodulated</b> carrier <b>wave</b> signal, [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes", that spelled out text messages in Morse code. As a result, early radio receiving apparatus merely had to detect {{the presence or absence}} of the radio signal, not convert it to audio. The device that did this was called a detector. The coherer was the most successful of many detector devices that were tried in the early days of radio.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unmodulated</b> {{continuous}} <b>wave</b> radar cannot measure distance, and {{the beam}} is usually broad with side-lobes that {{extend to the}} side and behind the radar antenna. Signal amplitude provides the only way to determine which object corresponds with which speed measurement when {{there is more than one}} moving object near the receiver, but amplitude information is not useful without range measurement to evaluate target size. Moving objects include birds flying near objects in front of the antenna. Reflections from small objects directly in front of the receiver can be overwhelmed by reflections entering antenna side-lobes from large object located to the side, above, or behind the radar, such as trees with wind blowing through the leaves, tall grass, sea surface, freight trains, busses, trucks, and aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In 1901 Reginald Fessenden {{had invented}} a better means of {{accomplishing}} this. [...] In his heterodyne receiver an <b>unmodulated</b> sine <b>wave</b> radio signal at a frequency fO offset from the incoming radio wave carrier fC {{was applied to}} a rectifying detector such as a crystal detector or electrolytic detector, along with the radio signal from the antenna. In the detector the two signals mixed, creating two new heterodyne (beat) frequencies at the sum fC + fO and the difference fC − fO between these frequencies. By choosing fO correctly the lower heterodyne fC − fO was in the audio frequency range, so it was audible as a tone in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. Thus the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of Morse code were audible as musical [...] "beeps". A major attraction of this method during this pre-amplification period was that the heterodyne receiver actually amplified the signal somewhat, the detector had [...] "mixer gain".|$|R
5000|$|The {{continuous}} wave radiotelegraphy signals produced by these transmitters required a different method of reception. [...] The radiotelegraphy signals produced by spark gap transmitters consisted of strings of damped waves repeating at an audio rate, so the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of Morse code were audible as a tone or buzz in the receivers earphones. However the new {{continuous wave}} radiotelegraph signals simply consisted of pulses of <b>unmodulated</b> carrier (sine <b>waves).</b> These were inaudible in the receiver headphones. To receive this new modulation type, the receiver had to produce {{some kind of}} tone during the pulses of carrier.|$|R
40|$|<b>Unmodulated</b> carrier <b>waves</b> at {{frequencies}} of 75. 375, 85. 875, 167. 2 and 441. 025 MHz have been radiated by aerials mounted on tall buildings or prominent terrain {{features in the}} British cities of Birmingham, Bath and Bradford. The spatial distribution of the r. f. signal envelope existing within urban and suburban areas at these frequencies has been recorded using a vehicle-mounted receiver with a aerial fixed to the vehicle's roof. An analysis of these measurements has shown the distance over which the envelope may be anticipated to be Rayleigh distributed {{to be less than}} 75 m. A median signal prediction model is derived from the measured data and its performance is statistically assessed with the experimental values. The measurements and the predictions have been found to be·in close agreement. Comparison of the Okumura model with measured values has demonstrated that the proposed model exhibits similar prediction errors to those obtained by the more widely used Okumura model. The Okumura model is therefore concluded to be more complex, and hence more costly to use, than is necessary for applications in British cities...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{blood samples}} from four healthy volunteers were {{collected}} and aliquots were exposed in vitro for 2 h to either (i) modulated (wideband code division multiple access, WCDMA) or <b>unmodulated</b> continuous <b>wave</b> (CW) 2450 MHz radiofrequency (RF) fields {{at an average}} specific absorption rate of 10. 9 W/kg or (ii) sham-exposed. Aliquots of the same samples that were exposed in vitro to an acute dose of 1. 5 Gy ionizing gamma-radiation (GR) were used as positive controls. Half of the aliquots were treated with melatonin (Mel) to investigate if such treatment offers protection to the cells from the genetic damage, if any, induced by RF and GR. The cells in all samples were cultured for 72 h and the lymphocytes were examined {{to determine the extent}} of genetic damage assessed from the incidence of micronuclei (MN). The results indicated the following: (i) the incidence of MN was similar in incubator controls, and those exposed to RF/sham and Mel alone; (ii) there were no significant differences between WCDMA and CW RF exposures; (iii) positive control cells exposed to GR alone exhibited significantly increased MN; and (iv) Mel treatment had no effect on cells exposed to RF and sham, while such treatment significantly reduced the frequency of MN in GR-exposed cells...|$|R
40|$|The copropagation of two {{waves in}} an ultralong {{semiconductor}} optical amplifier (SOA) is considered {{in theory and}} experiment. One wave is a modulated signal, whereas {{the other one is}} <b>unmodulated</b> (continuous <b>wave).</b> The theory bases on a comprehensive traveling-wave model and predicts an exponential improvement of the signal extinction ratio (ER) of the modulated signal, caused by the presence of the unmodulated signal. Conditions for achieving this two-wave competition (TWC) effect are as follows. The SOA is operated under saturation, both waves are copolarized, they have comparable gain and their spectral correlation is between certain limits. The TWC effect is due to nondegenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in the saturated part of a long SOA and is expected to have a high-speed potential. In order to check the theoretical predictions, 4 -mm-long SOAs are developed and experimentally investigated under the given conditions. The measured ER improves by 1. 3 dB for a 5 -GHz sinusoidal signal, which compares well with the 2 dB theoretically predicted for this configuration. FWM is identified also experimentally as the basic mechanism. Variation of wavelength detuning, pump current, modulation frequency and ER of the injected signal are used to determine optimum conditions for the given device...|$|R
5000|$|He also {{invented a}} {{mechanical}} device, the Goldschmidt tone wheel, used in early radio receivers {{to receive the}} new continuous wave radiotelegraph signals. The first radio transmitter, the spark-gap transmitter, produced a string of damped waves {{that sounded like a}} buzz or tone in a radio receiver, so the pulses of radio waves used to transmit Morse code were audible as [...] "beeps" [...] in the receiver. However, the new transmitters like the Goldschmidt alternator generated <b>unmodulated</b> continuous <b>waves,</b> which were inaudible in receivers. To make them audible, the tone wheel receiver used the heterodyne principle to convert the radio frequency to an audio frequency. The tone wheel was a disk with contacts around the rim, spun by a small electric motor, which interrupted the incoming radio signal at a radio frequency rate. The tone wheel acted as a crude beat frequency oscillator (BFO), introducing a second radio frequency which combined with the received signal to create a [...] "beat" [...] (heterodyne) frequency at the difference of the two frequencies, in the audio range. For example, if the frequency of the received signal was 60,000 Hz, the tone wheel could be adjusted to introduce a frequency of 59,000 Hz, creating a 1,000 Hz tone which could be heard in the earphones as a musical [...] "beep" [...] whenever the carrier was present.|$|R
5000|$|In {{continuous}} wave (CW) radio transmission, also called radiotelegraphy or on-off keying and {{designated by the}} International Telecommunication Union as emission type A1A, information is transmitted by pulses of <b>unmodulated</b> radio carrier <b>wave</b> which spell out text messages in Morse code. The different length pulses of carrier, called [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] or [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs", are produced by the operator switching the transmitter on and off rapidly using a switch called a telegraph key. This was the first type of radio transmission, and during the early 20th century was widely used for both private person-to-person messages and commercial telegram traffic. With the rise {{of other types of}} modulation its use has declined, and CW is now only used for personal hobbyist messages by radio amateurs and is becoming obsolete.|$|R
