40|$|This paper {{consists}} of the report of an option appraisal. It is exactly in the form {{in which it was}} presented to the Management Team and the Authority in the DIstrict to which it relates. The only changes are that ficticious names have been substituted for the originals to maintain anonymity. The purpose in publishing the report is to provide an example of how an appraisal may be conducted and presented. The appraisal is not claimed to be a "model" one in the sense that others should slavishly follow it or {{in the sense that it}} is perfect. However, we do believe it was adequate for its purpose - aiding a decision on a fairly complex service development and that others may find it useful to follow its spirit. At present, services for the mentally ill in the north Midshire area are centralised to a considerable degree in a large institution, High Ridge hospital. This centralisation is consistent with the aims of the Joint Strategy for Mental Illness services in Midshire agreed bwteen Midshire Health Authority and Midshire County Council, and with the objectives of the Midshire Health Authority's Strategic Plan. The thrust of the Strategic Plan is towards better integration of patients with the community, and increased liaison between clinical specialties. The Plan envisages the development of decentralised acute services in the Almhurst sector as forming an early part of the strategy and acting as a pilot scheme for the north Midshire mental health unit. This paper identifies the options available to carry this strategy forward; the criteria by which they should be judged; and makes an appraisal of the alternative. A project team was set up to carry out the option appraisal, consisting of two planners, a nursing officer, a local authority representative, the <b>unit</b> <b>administrator</b> directly affected, two consultant psychiatrists, works and finance officers and two consultant economists. mental health...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} perceived and expected daily task competencies for technical services administrators; that is, the competencies technical services administrators claim to possess (perceived) and those they believe they ought to possess (expected) in the areas of acquisitions, cataloging, and serials. For the purposes of this paper, a technical services administrator is one who oversees, at a minimum, the acquisitions, cataloging, and serials units in her library. The author surveyed 116 technical services administrators via e-mail in Fall 2003, receiving a response rate of fifty-four percent and an acceptable use rate of fifty-three percent. The survey was designed to correlate perceived and expected competencies with (1) an incumbent’s professional background; (2) tenure in current position at present institution; and (3) size of technical services unit as measured in full-time equivalents (FTE). The study concludes that incumbent tenure and size of the technical services unit affect both perceived and expected competencies, with the latter having a greater effect. Professional background affects competency possession, but has only a marginal effect on competency expectation. The findings reveal that administrators with ten or more years in their current positions, who have non-cataloging backgrounds, and who have at least ten FTE in their technical services units are least likely to know the daily procedures of their technical services <b>units.</b> <b>Administrators</b> with ten or more years in their current positions, who have cataloging backgrounds, and who have at least ten FTE in their technical services units are least likely to feel they ought to know the daily procedures of their technical services departments.

40|$|The {{problem in}} this study was to {{formulate}} a model to adapt the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics assessment procedures and materials to allow a local educational <b>unit</b> <b>administrator</b> to assess his or her own mathematics program. An application of the model was performed in an assessment of mathematics achievement at the 9 -, 13 -, and 17 -year-old age levels in the Lincoln, Nebraska Public Schools. ^ The formulation of the model followed the presentation of the problem and the review of the literature. The model contained four phases: (1) Pre-assessment, (2) Assessment, (3) Evaluation, and (4) Review. Spread among the four phases were fourteen steps indicating the tasks to be performed in each phase. The model made extensive use of NAEP materials and procedures and contained steps designed to insure usage of the assessment findings after an assessment was completed. ^ The application of the model was conducted in the Lincoln Public Schools of Lincoln, Nebraska, and assessed the 9 -, 13 -, and 17 -year-old students in the six content areas used by NAEP in its 1972 - 73 mathematics assessment. Those content areas were numbers and numeration, estimation and measurement, geometry, equations and inequalities, probability and statistics, and business and consumer mathematics. ^ The application followed the fourteen steps of the model and was conducted during the 1978 - 79 school year. The goals of the Lincoln Public School 2 ̆ 7 s assessment were (1) to identify strong or weak points of the mathematics curriculum and (2) to gather baseline data for future use. The recommended comparison group for Lincoln was NAEP 2 ̆ 7 s central region reporting group, consisting of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. ^ During the Pre-assessment phase of the application the administrative structure was established, pre-assessment decisions were made, the objectives integration was performed, test development was completed, sampling procedures were concluded, and data utilization choices were chosen. The Assessment phase included preparation for and conducting of the Assessment. The Evaluation phase included scoring and categorizing the responses, performing the data analysis, and evaluating the results. During the final phase, Review, a review of every aspect of the assessment and a setting of a timetable for the next assessment were completed. ^ The results of the model 2 ̆ 7 s application to the Lincoln Public Schools produced findings in general and specific terms. The general findings concluded that Lincoln student achievement met predetermined standards for all three age groups in the content areas of numbers and numeration, estimation and measurement, geometry, and probability and statistics. A comparison of the age groups showed consistency in all content areas. Specific findings dealt with particular test items and are included in this dissertation. ^ Conclusions for the application of the model were: (1) the application demonstrated the operability of the model, (2) more information of past student achievement should have been provided the committee making the data utilization choices, (3) more people via various committees should {{have been involved in the}} assessment, (4) communications during all phases of the assessment should have improved, and (5) NAEP statistical methods, pertinent materials, and staff expertise were of eminent value to the application. ^ Recommendations included: (1) use the model when performing a mathematics assessment at the local level, (2) use NAEP procedures, appropriate materials and staff expertise whenever possible, and (3) involve more people in the assessment in the form of goals committees, assessment decision-making committees, and parent volunteer help. ...|$|E

In relation to nature, it is descriptive and has a qualitative approach. To achieve the goal we designed a questionnaire with 16 questions, sent to students who are studying Accountancy in six federal universities in southern Brazil that offer this course. Altogether 262 students answered the questionnaires. Based on the responses, the majority (225 students) has performed a reading of at least one scientific article and the biggest reason for this reading was the elaboration of an academic work and demand for some discipline. Regarding the preparation of articles, 120 students said they had written at least one scientific article, and most of these articles were drawn up by the requirement of some discipline. Still regarding the preparation, students have pointed out difficulties in performing the lack of time and difficulty in data collection. Finally, regarding the publication, it was found that, of the 120 students who drew up articles, only 50 submitted for any event and / or journal. And of these, 40 students have published at least one of the articles written. We conclude therefore that although the students read scientific papers, it should be more encouraged to composing them and publish them. Thus, besides bringing benefits to students, it also contributes to society through the dissemination of new knowledge through research.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{considerable}} {{evidence about the}} effectiveness of audit coupled with feedback for provider behavior change, although few feedback interventions have been conducted in long-term care settings. The primary purpose of the Data for Improvement and Clinical Excellence-Long-Term Care (DICE-LTC) project was to assess the effects of a feedback intervention delivered to all direct care providers on resident outcomes. Our objective in this report is to assess the effect of feedback reporting on rates of pain assessment, depression screening, and falls over time. Methods The intervention consisted of monthly feedback reports delivered to all direct care providers, facility and <b>unit</b> <b>administrators,</b> and support staff, delivered over 13  months in nine LTC units across four facilities. Data for feedback reports came from the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (RAI) version 2. 0, a standardized instrument mandated in LTC facilities throughout Alberta. The primary evaluation used an interrupted time series design with a comparison group (units not included in the feedback intervention) and a comparison condition (pressure ulcers). We used segmented regression analysis to assess the effect of the feedback intervention. Results The primary outcome of the study, falls, showed little change over the period of the intervention, except for a small increase in the rate of falls during the intervention period. The only outcome that improved during the intervention period was the proportion of residents with high pain scores, which decreased {{at the beginning of the}} intervention. The proportion of residents with high depression scores appeared to worsen during the intervention. Conclusions Maintaining all nine units in the study for its 13 -month duration was a positive outcome. The feedback reports, without any other intervention included, did not achieve the desired reduction in proportion of falls and elevated depression scores. The survey on intention to change pain assessment practice which was conducted shortly after most of the feedback distribution cycles may have acted as a co-intervention supporting a reduction in pain scores. The processing and delivery of feedback reports could be accomplished at relatively low cost because the data are mandated and could be added to other intervention approaches to support implementation of evidence-based practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} {{the relationships of}} potential occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs with cancer incidence and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a historical prospective cohort study of female registered nurses (RNs) from British Columbia, Canada (BC). Methods Female RNs registered with a professional regulatory body {{for at least one}} year between 1974 and 2000 formed the cohort (n = 56, 213). The identifier file was linked to Canadian cancer registries. An RN offspring cohort from 1986 was created by linkages with the BC Birth and Health Status Registries. Exposure was assessed by work history in oncology or cancer agencies (method 1) and by estimating weighted duration of exposure developed from a survey of pharmacists and nursing <b>unit</b> <b>administrators</b> of all provincial hospitals and treatment centers and the work history of the nurses (method 2). Relative risks (RR) were calculated using Poisson regression for cancer incidence and odds ratios (OR) were calculated for congenital anomaly, stillbirth, low birth weight, and prematurity incidence, with 95 % confidence intervals. Results In comparison with other female RNs, method 1 revealed that RNs who ever worked in a cancer center or in an oncology nursing unit had an increased risk of breast cancer (RR = 1. 83; 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 3. 23, 12 cases) and their offspring were at risk for congenital anomalies of the eye (OR = 3. 46, 95 % CI = 1. 08 - 11. 14, 3 cases). Method 2 revealed that RNs classified as having the highest weighted durations of exposure to antineoplastic drugs had an excess risk of cancer of the rectum (RR = 1. 87, 95 % CI = 1. 07 - 3. 29, 14 cases). No statistically significant increased risks of leukemia, other cancers, stillbirth, low birth weight, prematurity, or other congenital anomalies in the RNs' offspring were noted. Conclusions Female RNs having had potential exposure to antineoplastic drugs were not found to have an excess risk of leukemia, stillbirth, or congenital anomalies in their offspring, with the exception of congenital anomalies of the eye, based on only three cases; however, elevated risks of breast and rectal cancer were observed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Institutions {{of higher}} {{education}} need to rethink the ways they recognize, support, evaluate and reward academic work {{in order to make}} their formal systems receptive to change and to ensure equitable treatment of faculty and staff. This should be linked with a return to collaborative governance structures and leadership practices that set priorities and assign work with the active participation of the concerned members of the academic community. Better ways of setting priorities and assigning work are basic to effective evaluation and reward systems. These general propositions can be divided into seven recommendations: 1. Higher education institutions should evaluate and reward all major forms of academic work. In particular, scholarship and creativity should be redefined to be inclusive of more forms of academic work. 2. Each faculty member should have an individualized position description which should include all the major portions of faculty members 2 ̆ 7 assignment. Position descriptions should be flexible and subject to annual revision through negotiations with <b>unit</b> <b>administrators.</b> 3. While all forms of academic work should be recognized, it is appropriate to expect faculty to demonstrate scholarship and creativity as central components in the evaluation of their research, teaching and outreach. 4. Teaching should be seen as an activity with a central scholarly component closely linked with research and as a complex set of activities that promote learning {{to a wide variety of}} audiences. 5. Participation in major service and outreach projects, research and teaching as described in the faculty member 2 ̆ 7 s position description should be evaluated, supported and rewarded in analogous ways. 6. Evaluation and assessment procedures should be objective and equitable but also cost effective in terms of faculty and staff time. 7. The governance structures and leadership practices {{of higher education}} should ensure that work priorities are set wisely through practices that include the full participation of appropriate faculty and staff. In short, the academic work that is important to an institution should be recognized, supported and rewarded in ways that encourage high-quality performance and ensure the fair treatment ofthe faculty and staff asked to perform the work. All projects and, in particular, new initiatives should be undertaken and planned with the active participation of all those who have expertise on the topic and who will have to do the work involved. It is recognized that, to a large extent, improvements are always possible. Every phrase of these general recommendations opens out into a host of problems, particularly in a time when some aspects of academic work are changing rapidly. The remaining chapters of this report represent an exploration of the issues raised by these general recommendations...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} an {{evaluation}} of the Indian Health Service (IHS) in the Pacific Northwest Region. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate the health care planning process of the IHS. This primary goal was expanded through the articulation of three objectives. The first was to assess evidence of real and on-going planning within IHS. The second was to identify the actual or expressed purposes of the plans. The third was to identify the discrepancies between actual IHS plans and a standardized comprehensive model. The methodology used in completing this evaluation comprised three major procedural steps. The first was the formulation of a standardized and comprehensive model for health care planning. The second was an analysis of the existing system of health care planning used at the three administrative units of IHS. The third was a definition and evaluation of the IHS planning process. For the first step, a generic model was developed to provide a baseline for evaluating the wide variety of planning strategies employed by the IHS. The second step required field work and on-site visits at all Portland Area Service Units. The interviews with local Service <b>Unit</b> <b>administrators</b> aided the evaluators in their assessment of the process of defining and implementing specific health care goals and objectives. The third step involved {{an evaluation of}} the actual IHS planning process by comparing the ideal model and the realities of implementation. This report finds that: 1) the IHS planning process is directly linked to predetermined funding levels, which severely limits planing objectivity; 2) the IHS planning process is ill-defined and fails to demonstrate whether or not the health status of the Northwest Indians is being upgraded; 3) IHS planning is oriented to identify symptoms rather that causes, and is based on treatment rather than prevention at the level of the individual or total population; 4) the existing data system is geared to providing top level monitoring and provides little useful data for Tribal long-range planning; and 5) consumer input into the planning process is limited due to a lack of consumer knowledge and ability to fully and actively participate in the process. The study recommendations were presented in five parts: 1) IHS should structure their planning process to reflect a problem solving approach; 2) there should be a concerted effort to establish a standard pattern for demographic enumeration; 3) IHS should develop a system and open lines of communication for active consumer participation in the health care planning process; 4) IHS must begin to address structural flaws in the total organization including manpower levels and expertise, and control over lines of communication; and 5) IHS should initiate a major policy review to address the weaknesses inherent in short-range resource allocations...|$|R
40|$|One of {{government}} effort in reducing various problem {{caused by the}} forest damage was by optimal reforestation program. The program was a concrete step stated by Perum Perhutani involving various level society. Society figures and regional figures hoped that reforestation program could run in optimal way. The program also directed to {{the cooperation of the}} people with Perum Perhutani. The research aimed to find out campaign which was given by Perum Perhutani of Southern Banyuwangi Unit II East Java in doing reforestation program. The research was qualitative descriptive, data collection process was done by observation, interview and relevant secondary data with the existing problem. The subject was 6 people, they were Perum Perhutani South Banyuwangi <b>Unit</b> II <b>Administrator,</b> The Head of Kss PHBM, The chief of public relation department, dores supervisor, plantation technician, and people from around the forest. Data analysis technique used was qualitative Communication technique used in reforestation campaign was through illumination, development through publication which was done in optimal way by Perhutani, tigh supervising by forest officer ao forest police, including people participation and forest socialization. The research showed reforestation campaign concept was done through persuasive communication to the people around the forest the reforestation message was doing socialization, supervision, illumination, or based of letter of forestry department about saving and forest conservation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{responded to}} a {{documented}} need for research focusing on nursing care and quality of hospital care, {{with a focus on}} evaluation of the organization and delivery of care in the hospital setting (IOM, 1996). This research used data from a nationwide sample of 40 inpatient units providing care to people with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) {{to examine the effects of}} nursing unit characteristics and different types of nursing units on clinical integration on the unit level. Secondary data analysis included regression techniques and path modeling to estimate the direct and indirect effects of unit staffing, floating, rotating, years of professional experience, and education on clinical integration. The study examined these effects on units within magnet hospitals and specialized AIDS units, and clinical integration of care. A major finding within the study demonstrated that unit level staffing had a significant influence on clinical integration of nursing care, regardless of whether or not it was an AIDS unit, a magnet hospital unit, or a conventionally organized unit. Clinical integration, which was examined as an element of professional nursing practice, was also influenced by the way nursing care was organized on the unit level. Findings from the study confirmed that, as an organizational type, units within magnet hospitals performed better than conventionally organized <b>units.</b> Hospital <b>administrators,</b> researchers, and clinicians can use these findings to support decisions related to the organization and delivery of professional nursing in hospitals. ...|$|R
40|$|I am {{grateful}} to the leadership of Sally Holewa, State Court Administrator and Rodney Olson, <b>Unit</b> Two Court <b>Administrator</b> for their support of my participation in the Court Executive Development Program at the National Center for State Courts {{as well as their}} encouragement in my completion of this project. The research itself {{would not have been possible}} were it not for the help of Ronda Amann, Bryan Elstad and Sheila Muus, who all assisted at various stages in the gathering of data in the time to disposition report as well as the juvenile court bench, bar and agency stakeholders of the East Central and Southeast Judicial Districts who willingly participated in my survey. I am thankful for the support of juvenile court staff in Fargo and Valley City, North Dakota who tolerated my constant ramblings about the topic and offices full of case delay books, spreadsheets and crinkled sheets of paper full of great ideas whose shelf life expired by the very next working day. These people are a pleasure to work with every day. I also appreciate Dr. Gene Flango of the National Center for State Court...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2009. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 36). The evolution of wireless communication and circuit technology has enabled {{the development of an}} infrastructure which consists of sensing, computation and communication <b>units</b> that makes <b>administrator</b> capable to observe and react to a phenomenon in a particular environment. The building block of such an infrastructure is comprised of hundreds or thousands of small, low cost, multifunctional devices which have the ability to sense compute and communicate using short range transceivers known as sensor nodes. The interconnection of these nodes forming a network called wireless sensor network. Ad hoc networks are characterized by a lack of infrastructure, and by a random and quickly changing network topology. Thus the need is there for a tough dynamic routing protocol that can accommodate such an environment. The report consists of elaborate description of three different Ad Hoc routing protocols– DSDV, DSR and AODV. As there are numerous studies that have already taken place for basic routing protocols we focused on basing our study for random motion. This allows us to obtain a more realistic data as not all nodes stays stationary. A prototype was used to run simulation based on different scenarios under random functions that obtained significant results in order to highlight the strength and weakness of the protocols through analyzing performance indicators, namely throughput and goodput.
