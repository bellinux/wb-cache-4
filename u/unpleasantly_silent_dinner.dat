60|$|Her <b>silent</b> <b>dinner</b> {{was soon}} over; {{she made her}} father's punch, {{and sat down to}} wait for her lover. Larry kept up a continual growl about Thady's absence, {{suggesting}} that Keegan had cozened him off to Carrick, to sign the estate away; accusing him of conspiracy with the attorney, to rob him, his father; wondering why he wouldn't come to dinner, &c.: to all which Feemy made no reply; she never noticed his grumblings; she sat absorbed in her own thoughts, meditating what she would say to Ussher, till she heard his horse's feet {{at the head of the}} avenue, and then she jumped up to meet him at the hall-door.|$|R
6000|$|We all dined together, and I {{could see}} that poor Art {{was trying to make}} the best of things. Van Helsing had been <b>silent</b> all <b>dinner</b> time, but when we had lit our cigars he said, [...] "Lord [...] ." [...] but Arthur {{interrupted}} him.|$|R
60|$|Comyn demanded {{where the}} devil I had been, {{though he knew}} perfectly. He was uncommonly <b>silent</b> during <b>dinner,</b> and then asked me if I had heard the news. I told him I had heard none. He took me by the sleeve, to the quiet {{amusement}} of the company, and led me aside.|$|R
50|$|On {{the actual}} day of Yom Sport, edot cycle around {{to each of}} the {{stations}} where they compete to score points for their team. The stations are sport, track and field, crazy games, agam, and special project (or Peulat-X), with one free perek during the day, during which campers are encouraged to run around camp cheering for their team. The competition part of the day concludes with marathon, a grueling race which includes almost the entire team performing tasks such as canoe portaging, eating, hair-braiding, human-pyramid-building and running. Each team has several cheers, and throughout all of Yom Sport, everyone cheers as loud as they can. Alonim celebrates their success of the day by showing off their, ruach {{while the rest of the}} camp must endure <b>silent</b> <b>dinner,</b> where losing points is a penalty for talking. Finally, at closing ceremonies, a dramatic battle between the captains and the villains ends in the implication (but never an explicit announcement) of the winner.|$|R
60|$|Having {{no further}} pretext for calling upon her, Curtis thought of Elsie as of {{a strain of}} music which had passed. He was rather <b>silent</b> at <b>dinner,</b> but not noticeably so, for Maynard absorbed {{most of the time}} and {{attention}} of those present. At the first opportunity he returned to his papers, and was deep in work when Jennie came in to tell him that Elsie was coming over to stay the night.|$|R
60|$|Geisenheimer's was as {{brilliant}} and noisy {{as it had}} been before when Henry reached it that night, escorting a reluctant Minnie. After a <b>silent</b> <b>dinner</b> and a theatrical performance during which neither had exchanged more than a word between the acts, she had wished to abandon the idea of supper and go home. But a squad of police could not have kept Henry from Geisenheimer's. His hour had come. He had thought of this moment for weeks, and he visualized every detail of his big scene. At first they would sit at their table in silent discomfort. Then Sidney Mercer would come up, as before, to ask Minnie to dance. And then--then--Henry would rise and, abandoning all concealment, exclaim grandly: 'No! I am going to dance with my wife!' Stunned amazement of Minnie, followed by wild joy. Utter rout and discomfiture of that pin-head, Mercer. And then, when they returned to their table, he breathing easily and regularly as a trained dancer in perfect condition should, she tottering a little with the sudden rapture of it all, they would sit with their heads close together and start a new life. That was the scenario which Henry had drafted.|$|R
60|$|He was <b>silent</b> at <b>dinner,</b> unusually {{kindly to}} Ted and Verona, hesitating but not disapproving when Verona stated her opinion of Kenneth Escott's opinion of Dr. John Jennison Drew's {{opinion of the}} {{opinions}} of the evolutionists. Ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation, and he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race, what he had said to the Old Grouch, what he had said to the foreman about the future of wireless telephony.|$|R
5000|$|McAllister {{hosted the}} inaugural Zach McAllister Baseball Camp on January 16, 2017 in Peoria, Illinois. [...] All {{proceeds}} from the camp benefited St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Advocates for Access. [...] He also held a <b>silent</b> auction <b>dinner</b> {{in collaboration with the}} baseball camp. A few items in the auction were Ben Zobrist's autographed and game-worn cleats and batting gloves, a Shaun Livingston autographed jersey, and an autographed baseball bat signed by Jim Thome. [...] McAllister also auctioned off a pair of autographed game-worn cleats as well as one of his World Series jerseys.|$|R
60|$|Elsa did {{not come}} back for dinner. Nor was hers the only vacant place. Mr Barstowe had also vanished. Even Mr Keith's calm was {{momentarily}} ruffled by this discovery. The poet was not a favourite of his--it was only reluctantly that he had consented to his being invited at all; and the presumption being that when two members of a house-party disappear simultaneously {{they are likely to}} be spending the time in each other's society, he was annoyed. Elsa was not the girl to make a fool of herself, of course, but--He was unwontedly <b>silent</b> at <b>dinner.</b>|$|R

The <b>dinner</b> features a keynote speaker and the presentation of [...] "Catalyst Awards" [...] recognizing individuals and organizations for excellence in service to Michigan's LGBT community. The event is attended by several community leaders and elected officials. Past speakers have included: ...|$|R
60|$|Derek {{had been}} scowling, and Derek still scowled. His eyebrows were formidable, {{and his mouth}} smiled no welcome at Jill as she {{approached}} him. The evening, portions of which Jill had found so enjoyable, had contained no pleasant portions for Derek. Looking back over a lifetime whose events had been almost uniformly agreeable, he told himself {{that he could not}} recall another day which had gone so completely awry. It had started with the fog. He hated fog. Then had come that meeting with his mother at Charing Cross, which had been enough to upset him by itself. After that, rising to a crescendo of unpleasantness, the day had provided that appalling situation at the Albany, the recollection of which still made him tingle; and there had followed the <b>silent</b> <b>dinner,</b> the boredom of {{the early part of the}} play, the fire at the theatre, the undignified scramble for the exits, and now this discovery of the girl whom he was engaged to marry supping at the Savoy with a fellow he didn't remember ever having seen in his life. All these things combined to induce in Derek a mood bordering on ferocity. His birth and income combining to make him one of the spoiled children of the world, had fitted him ill for such a series of catastrophes. He received Jill with frozen silence and led her out to the waiting taxi-cab. It was only when the cab had started on its journey that he found relief in speech.|$|R
50|$|The first {{fundraising}} {{effort was}} a celebrity golf tournament in early May 1996 which was well attended {{and became an}} annual event. That success enabled the fund to expand their outreach to families of children with any form of pediatric cancer, not just leukemia. The 19th Annual Celebrity Golf Classic was held May 18-19, 2014. The <b>dinner,</b> <b>silent</b> auction and golf tournament raised over $515,000.|$|R
50|$|Games for Good is a {{non-profit}} charitable organization which raises funds and products {{from within the}} entertainment industry and donates them to child-centric partners. Started in 1998 {{by a group of}} volunteers, GfG was led by industry veteran Lynne Killey. It raises money and requests that game publishers donate video and computer games to them for re-distribution to children's charities. It hosts <b>dinners,</b> <b>silent</b> auctions and parties.|$|R
60|$|This {{was just}} what he liked. He only wanted to forget what was unpleasant, and, giggling Scotch girl as she was, he was {{relieved}} to find {{that she could not}} only show well-bred interest in the surface matters of the time, but put in bright flashes of eagerness and originality, well seconded by Mr. Dutton. Mr. Fane was always a professor of small talk, and Nuttie had learnt to use the current change of society, so that though Mark was somewhat <b>silent,</b> the <b>dinner</b> was exceedingly pleasant and lively; and, as Mr. Fane remarked afterwards, he had been asked to enliven a doleful feast to ruined kindred, he could only say he wished prosperity always made people so agreeable.|$|R
6000|$|Want of favour, {{evident from}} the scrupulous {{formality}} with which she was treated; for {{if she had been}} like a daughter of the house, as she ought to have been, would they have waited dinner for her, and let her find them all looking uncomfortable and expectant in the drawing-room? They went into the dining-room; there was a <b>silent,</b> formal <b>dinner,</b> nothing like a family party. As soon as the servants had left the room. Marian quailing secretly, not from fear of Mr. and Mrs. Lyddell, but lest Lionel should lose his rides, began, [...] "I have a confession to make, Mr. Lyddell," [...] and told the story of the accident, explaining how it was entirely caused by her carelessness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes;--and {{shall be}} most {{happy to see}} you." [...] Then she seated herself,--as did also Lady Chiltern by her side. [...] "I see the poor Duke's iniquities are still under discussion. I hope Lord Chiltern {{recognises}} the great happiness of having a grievance. It would be a pity that so great a blessing should be thrown away upon him." [...] For the moment Madame Max had got through her difficulty, and, indeed, had done so altogether till the moment should come in which she should find herself alone with Phineas. But he slunk back from the gathering before the fire, and stood solitary and <b>silent</b> till <b>dinner</b> was announced. It became his fate to take an old woman into dinner who was not very clearsighted. [...] "Did you know that lady before?" [...] she asked.|$|R
500|$|The Dougy Center is a {{registered}} 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that has various revenue streams. According to Partnership Northwest, the center receives little government financial support and depends on donations from businesses, foundations, and individuals. In 2012, the center received more than $10,000 from Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Portland Rose Festival, via the Regence Grand Floral Walk. Other funding sources have included a concert headlined by a local singer-songwriter. The Dougy Center hosts an annual Reflection Benefit, which includes a <b>silent</b> auction, <b>dinner,</b> and live auction. Porsche Boxsters have been raffled off at the benefit for fifteen years. In April 2010, Oregon Public Broadcasting sponsored a benefit event at Oaks Amusement Park called [...] "Cookies with Cookie Monster", featuring a walkaround plush Cookie Monster. The event raised awareness for a program from the producers of Sesame Street called [...] "When Families Grieve".|$|R
60|$|The sons of Pallas grew pale {{with fear}} and anger, but not one dared to make an insolent answer. They {{knew that they were}} hated by the people of Athens, except some young men of their own sort, and they did not dare to do {{anything}} against the man who had slain Periphetes and Sinis, and Cercyon, and Sciron, and, {{in the midst of his}} paid soldiers, had struck off the head of Procrustes. <b>Silent</b> all through <b>dinner</b> sat the sons of Pallas, and, when they had eaten, they walked out silently, and went to a lonely place, where they could make their plans without being overheard.|$|R

60|$|He waited till evening, {{till after}} their almost <b>silent</b> <b>dinner,</b> till {{his mother had}} played to him and still he waited, feeling that she {{knew what he was}} waiting to say. She kissed him and went up-stairs, and still he lingered, {{watching}} the moonlight and the moths, and that unreality of colouring which steals along and stains a summer night. And he would have given anything to be back again in the past--barely three months back; or away forward, years, in the future. The present with this dark cruelty of a decision, one way or the other, seemed impossible. He realised now so much more keenly what his mother felt than he had at first; as if the story in that letter had been a poisonous germ producing a kind of fever of partisanship, so that he really felt there were two camps, his mother's and his--Fleur's and her father's. It might be a dead thing, that old tragic ownership and enmity, but dead things were poisonous till time had cleaned them away. Even his love felt tainted, less illusioned, more of the earth, and with a treacherous lurking doubt lest Fleur, like her father, might want to own; not articulate, just a stealing haunt, horribly unworthy, which crept in and about the ardour of his memories, touched with its tarnishing breath the vividness and grace of that charmed face and figure--a doubt, not real enough to convince him of its presence, just real enough to deflower a perfect faith. And perfect faith, to Jon, not yet twenty, was essential. He still had Youth's eagerness to give with both hands, to take with neither--to give lovingly to one who had his own impulsive generosity. Surely she had! He got up from the window-seat and roamed in the big grey ghostly room, whose walls were hung with silvered canvas. This house his father said in that death-bed letter--had been built for his mother to live in--with Fleur's father! He put out his hand in the half-dark, as if to grasp the shadowy hand of the dead. He clenched, trying to feel the thin vanished fingers of his father; to squeeze them, and reassure him that he--he was on his father's side. Tears, prisoned within him, made his eyes feel dry and hot. He went back to the window. It was warmer, not so eerie, more comforting outside, where the moon hung golden, three days off full; the freedom of the night was comforting. If only Fleur and he had met on some desert island without a past--and Nature for their house! Jon had still his high regard for desert islands, where breadfruit grew, and the water was blue above the coral. The night was deep, was free--there was enticement in it; a lure, a promise, a refuge from entanglement, and love! Milksop tied to his mother's...! His cheeks burned. He shut the window, drew curtains over it, switched off the lighted sconce, and went up-stairs.|$|R
60|$|My lady's countenance, {{of which}} Harry Esmond was {{accustomed}} to watch the changes, and with a solicitous affection to note and interpret the signs of gladness or care, wore a sad and depressed look for many weeks after her lord's return: during which it seemed as if, by caresses and entreaties, she strove to win him back from some ill humor he had, and {{which he did not}} choose to throw off. In her eagerness to please him she practised a hundred of those arts which had formerly charmed him, but which seemed now to have lost their potency. Her songs did not amuse him; and she hushed them and the children when in his presence. My lord sat <b>silent</b> at his <b>dinner,</b> drinking greatly, his lady opposite to him, looking furtively at his face, though also speechless. Her silence annoyed him as much as her speech; and he would peevishly, and with an oath, ask her why she held her tongue and looked so glum; or he would roughly check her when speaking, and bid her not talk nonsense. It seemed as if, since his return, nothing she could do or say could please him.|$|R
50|$|Several years ago, the SIM NJ Chapter {{formed a}} {{charitable}} 501(c)(3) {{organization called the}} NJ SIM Foundation. The NJ SIM Foundation aims to provide charitable assistance {{in the way of}} funding, resources, and materials for those individuals or organizations in need, or in need of technology capability but cannot afford it. The NJ SIM Foundation raises funds through donations and special events run throughout the year. One of the largest contributors to the NJ SIM Foundation is the annual Charity Golf Event and Technology Exchange. The event is the one event each year where vendors and sponsors can directly market their products and services to SIM NJ members and the event's attendees. The event has a morning component that is the Technology Exchange and features keynote presentations as well as the chance for attendees to visit with the event's sponsors. The afternoon golf tournament is followed by a banquet <b>dinner,</b> <b>silent</b> auction, awards, as well as a presentation by the event's benefactor. The NJ SIM Foundation also provides annual scholarship awards for students in the IT field of study. The NJ SIM Foundation has raised over $1 million since its inception.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing on {{the subject}} was said at dinner. Hetta with {{difficulty}} to herself sat at the table, and did not speak. Lady Carbury and her son were nearly as <b>silent.</b> Soon after <b>dinner</b> Felix slunk away to some music hall or theatre in quest probably of some other Ruby Ruggles. Then Lady Carbury, who had now been told as much as her son knew, again attacked her daughter. Very much of the story Felix had learned from Ruby. Ruby had of course learned that Paul was engaged to Mrs Hurtle. Mrs Hurtle had at once declared the fact to Mrs Pipkin, and Mrs Pipkin had been proud {{of the position of}} her lodger. Ruby had herself seen Paul Montague at the house, and had known that he had taken Mrs Hurtle to Lowestoft. And it had also become known to the two women, the aunt and her niece, that Mrs Hurtle had seen Roger Carbury on the sands at Lowestoft. Thus the whole story with most of its details,--not quite with all,--had come round to Lady Carbury's ears. 'What he has told you, my dear, is true. Much as I disapprove of Mr Montague, you do not suppose that I would deceive you.' ...|$|R
