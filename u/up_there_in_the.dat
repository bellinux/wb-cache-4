25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E

[...] He cited injuries to his foot and ankle, including the third fracture to his left foot sustained near the end of 2010. [...] His retirement sparked over 1.2million comments on the Chinese social-networking site Sina Weibo. [...] Reacting to Yao's retirement, NBA commissioner David Stern said Yao was a [...] "bridge between Chinese and American fans" [...] and that he had [...] "a wonderful mixture of talent, dedication, humanitarian aspirations and a sense of humor." [...] Shaquille O'Neal said Yao [...] "was very agile.

500|$|Tracy Hickman once ran the {{adventure}} as a Dungeon Master. According to him, {{the experience was}} like an old scary movie, with [...] "the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire was <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle. To {{most of the players}} it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." [...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. [...] "He deserved to die better than that," [...] his friend said, to which Hickman replied [...] "Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. How could it be any different?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{brand of}} mugham proved equally popular the {{following}} September, performing a collaboration with experimental classical group the Kronos Quartet. Band leader David Harrington was keen {{to work with}} the Azerbaijani for the Ramadan Nights Festival, saying: [...] "I realised his voice was as unique as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's, or the tenor John McCormack's in Irish ballads, or Bessie Smith's in St Louis Blues. There's a special quality to that voice, a connection between it and his inner life...he is <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top five of all time [...] ". Despite initial problems involving the Kronos Quartet's arrangements and Qasimov's improvisation, the event received positive reviews. Robin Denselow of The Guardian opined that Qasimov [...] "is certainly one of the most thrilling, unashamedly emotional performers on the planet, and the finest exponent of mugham".|$|E
2500|$|These areas, {{especially}} around Puget Sound, {{have a long}} history of political radicalism. The radical labor organizers called Wobblies were particularly strong there in the mines, lumber camps and shipyards. A number of anarchist communes sprung <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20thcentury (see Charles Pierce LeWarne's Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885-1915 for an overview of this popular yet forgotten movement). [...] Seattle is one of a handful of major cities in North America in which the populace engaged in a general strike (in 1919) and was the first major American city to elect a woman mayor, Bertha Knight Landes (in 1926). Socialist beliefs were once widespread (thanks in large part to the area's large numbers of Scandinavian immigrants) and the region has had a number of Socialist elected officials. [...] So great was its influence that the U.S. Postmaster General, James Farley, jokingly toasted the [...] "forty-seven states of the Union, and the Soviet of Washington", at a gala dinner in 1936 (although Farley denied ever saying it).|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Hitchcock {{was once}} again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont British. His first film for the company The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) was a success and his second The 39 Steps (1935) is often {{considered}} one of the best films from his early period, with the British Film Institute ranking it the fourth best British film of the 20th century. The film was acclaimed in the UK, and it made Hitchcock a star in the US, and established the quintessential English [...] "Hitchcock blonde" [...] Madeleine Carroll as the template for his succession of ice cold and elegant leading ladies. Screenwriter Robert Towne remarked, [...] "It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with The 39 Steps." [...] This film {{was one of the first}} to exploit a [...] "MacGuffin", a rather peripheral driver of the narrative. In The 39 Steps, the MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans. In 1966, Hitchcock explained to French director François Truffaut: might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men in a train. One man says, [...] "What's that package <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> baggage rack?" [...] And the other answers, [...] "Oh, that's a Macguffin." [...] The first man asks, [...] "What's a Macguffin?" [...] "Well," [...] the other man says, [...] "It's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands." [...] The first man says, [...] "But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands, and the other one answers, [...] "Well then, that's no Macguffin!" [...] So you see that a Macguffin is actually nothing at all.|$|E
