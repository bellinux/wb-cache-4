5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> total ouster or {{finality}} clause {{which seeks}} to preclude judicial review entirely, a partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available.

5000|$|A silicon {{controlled}} switch (SCS) behaves {{nearly the}} same way as an SCR, aside from <b>a</b> few distinctions. <b>Unlike</b> <b>an</b> SCR, an SCS switches off when a positive voltage/input current is applied to another anode gate lead. <b>Unlike</b> <b>an</b> SCR, an SCS can also be triggered into conduction when a negative voltage/output current is applied to that same lead. [...] SCSs are useful in practically all circuits that need a switch that turns on/off through two distinct control pulses. This includes power-switching circuits, logic circuits, lamp drivers, counters, etc.|$|R

5|$|Stars is a wood {{engraving}} print; that is, it {{was produced by}} carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood (<b>unlike</b> <b>a</b> woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, and pale pink.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. <b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E
5|$|The red-legged running frog (Kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It {{can move}} fast {{by using a}} running gait {{in which the two}} hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion {{photography}} shows, <b>unlike</b> <b>a</b> horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run {{across the surface of the}} water for several metres (yards).|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} African {{territory of}} Rhodesia, officially Southern Rhodesia, {{was a unique}} case in the British Empire and Commonwealth—though a colony in name, it was internally self-governing and constitutionally not <b>unlike</b> <b>a</b> dominion. This situation dated back to 1923, when it was granted responsible government within the Empire as a self-governing colony, following three decades of administration and development by the British South Africa Company. Britain had intended Southern Rhodesia's integration into the Union of South Africa as a new province, but this having been rejected by registered voters in the 1922 government referendum, the territory was moulded into a prospective dominion instead. It was empowered to run its own affairs in almost all respects, including defence.|$|E
5|$|There {{are very}} few Arabians {{registered}} as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. <b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does.|$|E

One incident was reported by the Los Angeles Times in August 1936. The news item reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew went on strike in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.|$|E

5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> legatus legionis (who had {{an officer}} staff of 6 tribuni militum and one praefectus castrorum), an {{auxiliary}} praefectus {{does not appear}} to have enjoyed the support of purely staff officers. The possible exception is an attested beneficiarius ("deputy"), who may have been the praefectus' second-in-command, if this title was a regular rank and not simply an ad hoc appointment for a specific task. Also attached to the praefectus were the regiment's vexillarius (standard-bearer for the whole unit) and cornucen (horn-blower).|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} other Soviet-era {{communist}} leaders, Castro's government did not intentionally construct a cult of personality around him, although his popularity among segments of the Cuban populace nevertheless led to one developing {{in the early years}} of his administration. By 2006, the BBC reported that Castro's image could frequently be found in Cuban stores, classrooms, taxicabs, and on national television. Throughout his administration, large throngs of supporters gathered to cheer at Castro's fiery speeches, which typically lasted for hours and which were delivered without the use of written notes. During speeches Castro regularly cited reports and books he had read on a wide variety of subjects, including military matters, plant cultivation, filmmaking, and chess strategies.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. <b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity.|$|E

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, <b>unlike</b> <b>a</b> slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is {{organised}} as {{a registered}} association. This means that Real Madrid {{is owned by}} its supporters who elect the club president. The club president cannot invest his own money into the club and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through merchandise sales, television rights and ticket sales. <b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> limited company, {{it is not possible}} to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Real Madrid, called socios, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2010, the club has 60,000 socios. At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. <b>Unlike</b> <b>a</b> subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
