50|$|Timeshare and Destination {{clubs are}} {{a form of}} {{property}} ownership {{also referred to as}} a vacation ownership involving the purchase and ownership of an individual <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> for seasonal usage during a specified period of time. Timeshare resorts often offer amenities similar that of a Full service hotel with on-site restaurant(s), swimming pools, recreation grounds, and other leisure-oriented amenities. Destination clubs on the other hand may offer more exclusive private accommodations such as private houses in a neighborhood-style setting. Examples of timeshare brands include Hilton Grand Vacations, Marriott Vacation Club International, Westgate Resorts, Disney Vacation Club, and Holiday Inn Club Vacations.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> was {{a living}} room, about 23 ft by 14 ft, a bedroom and a bathroom. In the corner blocks were some more commodious suites. Notwithstanding the {{prejudice}} against the building, no difficulty was found in letting the flats at high rents to tenants of the 'highest respectability'. A floor containing six rooms, without any grounds, commanded £300 per annum, and two rooms £60 per annum. The principal novelty of the building was the installation of hydraulic passenger lifts, at that time without precedent in domestic buildings in London. Fire control was also provided for by 98 hydrants, supplied from tanks storing 70,000 gallons on the roofs.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{constructs}} {{a dynamic}} {{general equilibrium model}} for a small economy that specializes in tourism to explore the long term effects of environmental and tourism policies. The model assumes that tourists obtain satisfaction from private services provided by tourism firms, goods and services provided by the public sector and environmental quality. Satisfaction from private services depends {{on the quality of}} those services, which is represented by the amount of capital per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> It is also assumed that goods and services provided by the government suffer from congestion. Environmental quality, which is also valued by the residents, is modelled as a renewable resource that is depleted by tourism activity. Tourism firms are price takers in the international tourism market, {{in the sense that the}} amount of tourism services provided by the economy has no direct impact on international prices. The price, however, depends positively on the quality of the supplied tourism bundle and therefore tourism firms in the destination can charge higher or lower prices depending on the quality of private tourism services, congestion of public goods and environmental quality. In this setting, the long term effects of two alternative policy instruments are compared, namely an overnight stay tax and a quality standard that is imposed on tourism firms. Both instruments can be used as accommodation quality and environmental quality policy tools. However, their welfare consequences are different as they have different effects on the incentives to accumulate capital. Specifically, the overnight stay tax acts as an implicit tax on capital, reducing the incentives for investment and capital accumulation. From a long term perspective, the quality standard is always superior to the overnight stay tax, provided that the former does not cause any dynamic inefficiency. 1096 1...|$|E

40|$|Sanitation {{is one of}} the {{essential}} facilities in buildings. The <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> sanitary <b>accommodation</b> required in some public toilets is currently calculated at a failure rate of providing immediate service to meet the user demands. As a user is very likely to feel anxious about the time needed to get to the service desired, the waiting time would probably be a better criterion for specifying the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> sanitary <b>accommodation</b> required in toilets for large spaces. In this study, a procedure of determining the probable user waiting time for an appliance in a public toilet is proposed based on a queuing theory. A simple queuing system for water closets and washbasins was developed by the measured waiting time from experiments. The corresponding probability of queuing for a specific appliance/service was determined. For average waiting times of 1 s and 10 s, the number of appliances required was calculated and compared with the current one in common use. Applied examples with input parameters, including the user arrival rate and appliance service time for the users, derived from the observation of the use of washrooms in a large shopping mall in Hong Kong were illustrated. This procedure offers flexibility for the design <b>of</b> sanitary <b>accommodation</b> to meet various service standards in terms of the probable user waiting time for different appliances.

40|$|The tourism {{sector in}} Zanzibar Tanzania has emerged {{strongly}} in the past 15 years, helping the development of other Industries that support it. As a result, Industries such as telecommunication, IT, transport and hospitality have also emerged recently. It is, however, speculated that organizations in the tourism sector in Zanzibar generally lack the effective performance that is required of them {{to compete in the}} contemporary complex and turbulent market environment. This research thus set out to explore and diagnose the organizational effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>accommodation</b> <b>units</b> <b>of</b> the tourism sector in Zanzibar. The research had specific objectives of diagnosing and finding the gap between the current and the optimal organizational performance in two particular <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> as well as determining the factors affecting organizational performance in these units. The study furthermore set out to recommend implementation of suitable intervention activities to improve organizational performance in the units analyzed. In order to achieve the above objectives the research deployed an action research strategy with the Weisbord’s six box model as a framework to diagnose two five star grade accommodation units in Zanzibar. A qualitative method was used to collect data. Key findings of the research are briefly presented below: - The service output <b>of</b> the <b>accommodation</b> <b>units</b> analyzed was not very consistent and fell short of the expectation of their customers. This showed a gap in terms of the organizations’ performance. - Factors affecting organizational effectiveness were found to be mainly in the Purpose and Rewards functions of the organizations. - The specific areas in the Purpose function that appeared to have substantial problems were: [...] Goals of the organization were not clearly stated [...] Employees did not understand the purpose of the organization [...] Employees were not involved in deciding their work unit goals [...] Employees were not in agreement with the goals <b>of</b> their work <b>units.</b> [...] Employees did not understand priorities of the organization The specific areas in the Reward function that appeared to have substantial problems were: [...] The pay scale and benefits of the organization did not treat employees equitably. [...] Employees felt that the salary they received was not commensurate with the jobs they performed. [...] Not all tasks to be accomplished were associated with incentives. Following the diagnostics findings above, the research suggested the following intervention activities that could possibly help to address the above mentioned problems: - A Management by Objectives (MBO) process was suggested to redress the problems indicated in the Purpose function. This would help to set clearly agreed goals {{at all levels of the}} organizations. Employees and resources would then be directed towards achieving these goals that would enable the organizations to perform more effectively. - Revision of the current reward system was suggested to redress the problems indicated in the Reward function. The reward system should be implemented in a manner that creates a feeling of both internal as well as external (market) equity among employees. Furthermore, rewards should be linked to performance in order to direct behaviour and motivation among employees. The performance based reward system can also help to achieve the MBO process proposed above since rewards will be designated for achievement of individual, departmental and finally organizational objectives, thus increasing organizational effectiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the accommodation-convergence relationship during the incipient phase of presbyopia. The study aimed {{to differentiate between}} the current theories of presbyopia and to explore the mechanisms by which the oculomotor system compensates for {{the change in the}} accommodation-convergence relationship contingent on a declining amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Methods: Using a Canon R- 1 open-view autorefractor and a haploscope device, measurements were made of the stimulus and response accommodative convergence/accommodation ratios and the convergence accommodation/convergence ratio of 28 subjects aged 35 - 45 years at the commencement of the study. Amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> was assessed using a push-down technique. The measurements were repeated at 4 -monthly intervals over a 2 -year period. Results: The results showed that with the decline in the amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> there is an increase in the accommodative convergence response per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> accommodative response and a decrease in the convergence <b>accommodation</b> response per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> convergence. Conclusions: The results of this study fail to support the Hess-Gullstrand theory of presbyopia in that the ciliary muscle effort required to produce a unit change in accommodation increases, rather than stays constant, with age. Data show that the near vision response is limited to the maximum vergence response that can be tolerated and, despite being within the amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> a stimulus may still appear blurred because the vergence component determines the proportion <b>of</b> available <b>accommodation</b> utilised during near vision...|$|R
