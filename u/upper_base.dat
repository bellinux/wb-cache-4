2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} a bronze statue atop a bronze plinth, which stand on a granite base which rests on concrete footings.

The two elements which make up the base are of polished Woodstock granite from Maryland, while the plinth above the base is made of bronze. Prior to laying the foundations, the entire Confederation section was regraded. Roads through the section, built in 1901-1903, were closed and removed and replaced with turf. The road around the site was converted to a cement walk and gutters installed. The cost of these alterations, borne by the UDC, was $1,020.70 ($ in [...] dollars).|$|E

2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{preserved}} {{representation of the}} menorah of the Temple was depicted in a frieze on the Arch of Titus, commemorating his triumphal parade in Rome following the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 CE.

The lower base was identical in design to the <b>upper</b> <b>base,</b> only larger in circumference. Each facet of the octagonal base was made with two vertical stiles and two horizontal rails, a top rail and a bottom rail, resembling a protruding frame set against a sunken panel. These panels have some relief design set or sculpted within them. The panels are depicting the Ziz and the Leviathan from Jewish mythology.|$|E

Layers of shungite rocks interspersed with tuffs, dolomite and siltstone. Within the Zazhoginskoe field are sills and dikes of metadiabases and metagabbro. Thickness of the sills is typically less than 50 m, but at the <b>upper</b> <b>base</b> sills reach thicknesses of over 150 m. In general, igneous rocks make up about 30% of the productive series. Rocks of the <b>upper</b> <b>base</b> felt weak regional metamorphism (initial stage greenschist facies).
