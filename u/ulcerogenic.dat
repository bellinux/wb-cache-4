Before the confirmation of COX-2 existence, the Dupont company had developed a compound, DuP-697, that was potent in many anti-inflammatory assays but did not have the <b>ulcerogenic</b> effects of NSAIDs. Once the COX-2 enzyme was identified, Dup-697 became the building-block for synthesis of COX-2 inhibitors. Celecoxib and rofecoxib, the first COX-2 inhibitors to reach market, were based on DuP-697.

50|$|Almost {{all of the}} gastric mucosal defense {{mechanisms}} are stimulated and/or facilitated by prostaglandins (PGs), especially PGE2. These cytoprotective PGs stimulate mucus, bicarbonate, and phospholipid secretion; increase mucosal blood flow; and accelerate epithelial restitution and mucosal healing. They also inhibit mast cell activation, and leukocyte and platelet adherence to the vascular endothelium. Thus, continuous generation of PGE2 by gastric mucosa is crucial {{for the maintenance of}} mucosal integrity and protection against <b>ulcerogenic</b> and necrotizing agents. Troxipide is known to stimulate the release of PGE2 and PGD2 in experimental as well as clinical studies. Troxipide has been observed to enhance PG-stimulated increase in gastric mucosal output, accelerated epithelial restitution and mucosal healing.|$|E

40|$|Fresh {{rice oil}} protects against gastric {{ulceration}} in rats maintained on an impoverished diet, whereas stored oil is <b>ulcerogenic.</b> Rice oil contains ketoaldehydes which are <b>ulcerogenic</b> but their activity is prevented {{by the presence}} of antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol, which is lost on storage. Protection may also be restored by the addition of cysteine. These results in rats in vivo can be duplicated in a rat liver microsomal system in vitro, in which malondialdehyde production is a measure of toxicity. It is proposed that the <b>ulcerogenic</b> activity of rice oil is the direct consequence of the stimulation of endogenous lipid peroxidation due to the lowering of the GSH content in the endoplasmic reticulum by the ketoaldehydes in stored rice oil.

The objective of this work is to adopt the latest laboratory tests and thresholds for the <b>ulcerogenic</b> risk assessment of diets from experimental reports and verify the class of risk in relation to gastric lesion prevalence in reared finishers. Results: Specificity and accuracy of feed safety tests based on the <b>ulcerogenic</b> risk of feed associated with the particle size distribution of diets were calculated on the occurrence of gastric lesions observed at a slaughterhouse: 41 lard-type hogs, fed with two diets [pelleted (n = 21 pigs) vs. mixed meal (n = 20 pigs) ], analyzed at the laboratory of our Institute, were involved. Gross inspection at the abattoir allowed the identification of the development of macroscopic gastric lesions in the pigs (13 / 21) fed with a pelleted complete diet, ranked in Class 1 (high <b>ulcerogenic</b> risk) on laboratory assessment. Breakdown of gastric lesion severity: hyperkeratosis (13 / 13), mucosal erosions (11 / 13) and bleeding ulcers (2 / 13).

In our previous study (Ali et al., Afr J Pharm Pharmacol 7 : 585 – 596, 2013), both compounds showed anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and antipyretic properties in standard animal models and a greater binding affinity for cyclooxygenase- 2 versus cyclooxygenase- 1 in molecular docking and dynamics analysis.
