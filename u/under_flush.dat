Inspection results for samples with varying length EDM notches are shown, as well as a comparison between the signature from an EDM notch and an actual fatigue crack. Finite Element Modeling is used to investigate the effect of the ferromagnetic fastener on the induced eddy current distribution in order to help explain the detection characteristics of the system. This paper will also introduce a modification to the Rotating Probe System designed specifically for the detection of deeply buried flaws in multilayer conductors. The design change incorporates a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor as the pickup device to improve the low frequency performance of the probe. The flaw detection capabilities of the GMR based Self- Nulling Probe are presented along with the status of the GMR based Rotating Probe System for detection of deeply buried flaws under installed fasteners...|$|E

40|$|Phytoplankton {{and water}} quality of Marathonas drinking-water Reservoir were {{examined}} for the first time. During the study period (July-September 2007), phytoplankton composition was indicative of eutrophic conditions although phytoplankton biovolume was low (max. 2. 7 mm(3) l (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)). Phytoplankton was dominated by cyanobacteria and diatoms, whereas desmids and dinoflagellates contributed with lower biovolume values. Changing flushing rate in the reservoir (up to 0. 7 % of reservoir's water volume per day) driven by water withdrawal and occurring in pulses {{for a period of}} 15 - 25 days was associated with phytoplankton dynamics. <b>Under</b> <b>flushing</b> pulses: (1) biovolume was low and (2) both 'good' quality species and the tolerant to flushing 'nuisance' cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa dominated. According to the Water Framework Directive, the metrics of phytoplankton biovolume and cyanobacterial percentage (%) contribution indicated a moderate ecological water quality. In addition, the total biovolume of cyanobacteria as well as the dominance of the known toxin-producing M. aeruginosa in the reservoir's phytoplankton indicated a potential hazard for human health according to the World Health Organization...|$|R
40|$|Bench-scale {{laboratory}} column {{experiments were}} conducted to determine the desorption characteristics of Hg in the aquifer material from an area of known elevated Hg concentrations in groundwater <b>under</b> <b>flushing</b> conditions. The experimental results showed that columns packed with perched aquifer material (PA) showed flushing of Hg, with the general decline of effluent Hg concentrations over time (from 0. 05 – 0. 1 [*]mg/L in the beginning to 0. 0001 – 0. 003 [*]mg/L {{at the end of}} the experiment). Columns with lower aquifer material (LA) showed nondetectable level of effluent Hg throughout the experiment. Possibility of redissolution/desorption of Hg after static condition (for the duration of 18 days) was tested, showing only slight rebound of Hg concentrations after equilibration. The results suggest that removal of up to 20 % of Hg inventory in the sediment could be achievable for the duration of the experiments (about 10 pore volumes). The results also indicate that the treated water from the water treatment plant was more effective compared to deionized water, probably due to complexing agents contained in the treated water...|$|R

40|$|Following field {{observations}} of increased photosynthesis at increased rates of sediment flushing in sandy sediments, {{we conducted a}} series of laboratory experiments to elucidate the mechanism behind these observations. Column experiments in which water was pumped though sand at rates ranging from 0 to 613 L m 22 d 21 showed that carbon (C) fixation, as measured using carbon- 14 (14 C) incorporation, increased from 6. 4 to 8. 6 mmol m 22 h 21 with increasing rates of flushing. Bottle incubations showed that the addition of inorganic nutrients [ammonium ion (NH þ 4), inorganic phosphate (HPO 2 4), silicic acid Si(OH) 4] did not stimulate C fixation over short-term incubations. Microprofiles of pH showed that the pH within the photic zone increased to 8. 9, reducing free carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations to, 0. 5 mmol L 21. Further bottle incubations, where pH and total inorganic carbon (TCO 2) were manipulated, showed that high pH (9. 6) did not affect photosynthesis if free CO 2 was present at concentrations of 10 mmol L 21, suggesting a direct effect of low free CO 2 concentrations. 14 C fixation profiles at a resolution of 100 mm recorded by b-radiation imaging showed that while the depth specific maximum rates of C fixation were the same under both diffusive and advective (flushed) conditions, the integrated rates of photosynthesis were highest <b>under</b> <b>flushed</b> conditions because of a thickening of the photosynthetic zone. We conclude that advective pore-water transport can enhance benthic photosynthesis in shallow permeable sand sediments by counteracting CO 2 limitation...|$|R
