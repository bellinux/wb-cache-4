Utilizing the developed EMM set-up, the effects of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>frequency</b> on characteristics of localized dissolution and accuracy of micro-hole in EMM are investigated and evaluated. The experiment results demonstrate that the accuracy of micro-hole and characteristics of localized dissolution can become better with the increase of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>frequency.</b> The accuracy of micro-hole machined by 26 KHZ can improve about 30 % than that by 16 KHZ.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{a theoretical}} analysis of elastic wave propagation in multilayered anisotropic composite plates is presented. Reflection and transmission coefficients {{as a function}} of the plane wave incident angle and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>frequency</b> are computed for single layered and multilayered plates. From the minima of the reflection spectra one can obtain the Lamb wave modes. Computation of the displacement and stress components inside the plate show that different Lamb wave modes excite different levels of energy at various depths of the plate. These modes can be effectively used to detect and image defects in different layers of a plate. Theoretical predictions have been qualitatively verified experimentally by imaging internal defects inside different layers of a multilayered composite plate by different Lamb wave modes. Numerical precision problems associated with such analyses have been completed avoided for an unidirectional composite plate by solving the problem by symbolic programming instead of conventional numerical matrix manipulation technique...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{mechanical}} or {{thermal treatment}} of a material can change, among other things, the average grains size. It depends on temperature, holding time, cooling condition or rolling stress. The average grain size, {{as well as its}} influence on the propagation velocity and attenuation coefficient of ultrasonic waves, also affects the wave frequency propagating through the material. Grain size is an indicator of material fatigue. It can therefore be used in monitoring or fatigue damage prevention. In this paper, we study the effect of various heat treatments hence different steel average grain sizes on the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>frequency</b> after crossing the material. We have performed the same experimental study on aluminum samples. The different grain sizes are obtained by rolling. The frequency shift measurement of longitudinal waves is achieved by immersion with two probes of different frequencies 2. 25 and 5 MHz. The experimental results are shown as curves giving the frequencies depending on the grain size. Heat treatments on steel and aluminum rolling performed on the samples have yielded a grain sizes gradient. Our results are consistent with the theory because of the important path in the sample and in this case the down shift frequency is paramount. They show a direct relationship between the frequency shift and the average grain size. It is therefore possible to trace quantitatively to an average grains size from the frequency of an ultrasonic wave that has passed through this material and hence its thermal or mechanical fatigue state...|$|E

Examples of typical methods used to separate azeotropic mixtures are azeotropic distillation and extractive distillation. However, these techniques are quite difficult since it require application of third component to alter the relative volatility of the mixture, Î± and additional separation unit to separate the third component from the product. Therefore, in this study, the effects of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>waves</b> on vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of normal binary and azeotropic mixtures were studied.

Besides that, the experimental studies were also carried out using frequency of 25 kHz and 68 kHz. The results reveal that the use of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>waves</b> altered the Î±, changed the VLE data of binary mixtures and consequently eliminated the azeotropic point. However, the changes were dependent on the intensity and <b>frequency</b> of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>wave</b> applied.
