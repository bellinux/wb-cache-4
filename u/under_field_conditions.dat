In 1992, the wing deployed eight pilots, five F-15 Eagles, and 48 maintenance and security personnel, for five days training at Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. The same year, with the reorganization of the Air Force, the wing was reassigned from the disbanding Tactical Air Command to the newly formed Air Combat Command. In July 1993, the wing deployed 50 personnel from the 102d Civil Engineering Squadron <b>under</b> <b>field</b> <b>conditions,</b> to the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas.

40|$|Present {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the beneficial effect of Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (AM) fungal species Glomus fasciculatum on growth performance of Allium sativum <b>under</b> <b>field</b> <b>condition.</b> In AM inoculated garlic plant showed significant increase in plant growth parameters like plant height, total biomass and bulb diameters, bulb weight, and yield. There was 21. 10 % increment in yield of Allium bulb as compared to non AM inoculated garlic plant. Percentage of AM colonization occurred at all sampling and the colonization was higher during bulb initiation. Mycorrhiza inoculated garlic plant showed more alliin and allinase enzyme activity as compared to non inoculated garlic plant.

25|$|The {{concrete}} slump test measures {{the consistency of}} fresh concrete before it sets. It is performed to check the workability of freshly made concrete, and therefore {{the ease with which}} concrete flows. It can also be used as an indicator of an improperly mixed batch.

The slump test is used to ensure uniformity for different loads of concrete <b>under</b> <b>field</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

In Saltmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated <b>under</b> <b>field</b> <b>conditions.</b> As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1.|$|E
25|$|Although {{physiological}} {{evidence of}} linkage {{is difficult to}} demonstrate, some experiments have been performed where carbon-14 was added to a particular tree and the labeled carbon was later detected in nearby plants and seedlings. A more definitive study by Simard et al. demonstrated a bidirectional carbon transfer between Betula papyrifera and Pseudotsuga menziesii, primarily through the direct hyphal pathway. This study also suggested that a source-sink relationship exists <b>under</b> <b>field</b> <b>conditions</b> to regulate this carbon transfer. However, these networks are largely limited by the vegetative matrix and by whether or not neighboring plants are compatible with existing fungal networks. This becomes important when evaluating the ability of plants to exploit the benefits of established ectomycorrhizal linkages.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding. Even {{if one of the}} steel tubes were damaged, the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield. Damage to a stressed skin structure, as used by the Spitfire, required more specialised equipment to repair. The old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of Hurricanes with relatively basic equipment <b>under</b> <b>field</b> <b>conditions.</b> Crated Hurricanes were assembled at Takoradi in West Africa and flown across the Sahara to the Middle East theatre and, to save space, some Royal Navy aircraft carriers carried their reserve Sea Hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies, which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed.|$|E
25|$|Many {{historians have}} since decried this decision, arguing {{the lack of}} modern arms on the Union side, {{at a time when}} the Confederates were buying them in large numbers from France and the United Kingdom, {{lengthened}} the conflict by as much as two years. Others, however, counter that given the poor logistics of the Union armies at the outbreak of the war, the increased supply train needed to maintain the improved rates of fire would have bogged down the armies and made maneuver impossible (a situation which did indeed later contribute to the development of trench warfare in World War I). It is also argued that fouling due to black powder residue would have made it impossible to maintain such high rates of fire <b>under</b> <b>field</b> <b>conditions</b> with the rifles of the time. Individual units later purchased such weapons privately, and they were used to considerable effect, but did indeed present problems in extended firefights; these units are not known to have had any trouble maintaining their ammunition supplies. Ripley was replaced as head of the Ordnance Department on September 15, 1863 principally because of his continuing opposition to the introduction of breech loading rifles.|$|E
