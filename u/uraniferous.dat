This tectonic uplift occurred in the Late Mississippian to Early Pennsylvanian time and was sufficient to expose and erode the Precambrian granitic and rhyolitic basement complex forming a granitic wash, which was subsequently submerged and buried by marine sediments in the Permian (specifically, the Wolfcampian carbonates). The granitic wash and these marine sediments form the pay zones but the [...] "gas, oil and water cut across formational boundaries". The Wolfcampian marine sediments include an arkosic lime, an arkosic dolomite, the Moore County Limestone, the White Dolomite, and the Brown Dolomite. The Leonardian Panhandle Lime, or Wichita, and Red Cave overlay these Wolfcampian sediments, with the anhydrite and dense-dolomite nature of the Wichita forming the reservoir seal. The source for the oil,gas and helium accumulations are the sedimentary rocks of Pennsylvanian age in the Palo Duro and Anadarko Basins. The helium would have been derived from <b>uraniferous</b> rocks and radiogenic in origin. The Panhandle Field has a pressure which is about 400 psi lower than the surrounding basins, which allows gases to migrate into it. Although low, the pressure is a normal hydrostatic pressure relative to the water table. Charles N. Gould mapped the John Ray Dome, which was drilled by the Amarillo Oil Company in 1918 resulting in the Panhandle Field discovery. Drilled to a depth of 2,395 feet, the well, No. 1 Masterson C, produced 5 million cubic feet of gas per day at a pressure of 420 psi.

40|$|Study of <b>uraniferous</b> silica {{precipitates}} in the Shirley Basin, Wyoming, identified {{areas where}} ancient <b>uraniferous</b> ground water once ponded. Chalcedony collected from and directly beneath thick accunmlations of rhyolite ash contain {{as much as}} 250 ppm uranium in a pre-ash topographic low and lesser concentrations (10 to 160 ppm) elsewhere. Differences in the U concentration of chalcedony collected from approximately the same stratigraphic horizon reflect the enrichment of uranium in ground water as it percolated downward and basinward through the overlying rhyolite ash. Uranium is homoge-neously distributed as a uranyl species within the chalcedony and reflects coprecipitation of dissolved uranium and colloidal silica in a <b>uraniferous</b> silica-gel. Laboratory mea-surements of the partitioning of uranium between various solutions and silica-gel pre-cipitates indicate that, for ranges of pH and dissolved carbonate typical of ground water, dried silica-gel contains about 400 to 1, 000 times the uranium concentration of the solu-tion from which it forms. Uranium is postulated to be incorporated as an adsorbed uranyl-silica-hydroxyl complex. A 20 -m. y. -minimum apparent age for <b>uraniferous</b> chal-cedony was obtained by U-Pb isotope dating.

40|$|The late Variscan (275 - 278 Ma) Pribram uranium deposit {{is one of}} {{the largest}} known accumulations of <b>uraniferous</b> bitumens in {{hydrothermal}} veins. The deposit extends along the northwestern boundary of the Central Bohemian pluton (345 - 335 Ma) with low-grade metamorphosed Late Proterozoic and unmetamorphosed Cambrian rocks. From a net uranium production of 41, 742 metric tons (t), more than 6, 000 t were extracted from bitumen-uraninite ores during 43 years of exploration and mining. Three morphological varieties of solid bitumen are recognized: globular, asphaltlike, and cokelike. While the globular bitumen is uranium free, the other two types are <b>uraniferous.</b> The amount of bitumen in ore veins gradually decreases toward the contact with the plutonic body and increases with depth. Two types of bitumen microtextures are recognized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy: amorphous and microporous, the former being less common in <b>uraniferous</b> samples. A lower Raman peak area ratio (1, 360 / 1, 575 cm(- 1)) in mineralized bitumens (0. 9) compared with uranium-free samples (2. 0) indicates a lower degree of microtextural organization in the latter The H/C and O/C atomic ratios in uranium-free bitumens (0. 9 - 1. 1 and 0. 09, respectively) are higher than those in mineralized samples (H/C = 0. 3 - 0. 8, O/C = 0. 03 - 0. 09). The chloroform extractable matter yield is Very low in uranium-free bitumens (0. 30 - 0. 35 % of the total organic carbon,TOC) and decreases with uranium content increase. The extracted solid <b>uraniferous</b> bitumen infrared spectra show depletion in aliphatic CH 2 and CH 3 groups compared to uranium-free samples. The concentration of oxygen-bearing functional groups relative to aromatic bonds in the IR spectra of uranium-free and mineralized bitumen, however, do not differ significantly. C- 13 NMR confirmed than the aromaticity of a <b>uraniferous</b> sample is higher (F-ar = 0. 61) than in the uranium-free bitumen (F-ar = 0. 51). Pyrolysates from <b>uraniferous</b> and nonuraniferous bitumens do not differ significantly, being predominantly cresol, alkylphenols, alkylbenzenes, and alkylnaphthalenes. The liquid pyrolysate yield decreases significantly with increasing uranium content. The delta(13) C Values of bulk uranium-free bitumens and low-grade <b>uraniferous,</b> asphaltlike bitumens range from - 43. 6 to 52. 3 per mil. High-grade, cokelike, <b>uraniferous</b> bitumens are more C- 13 depleted (54. 5 to - 58. 4 parts per thousand). In contrast to the very light isotopic ratios of the high-grade <b>uraniferous</b> cokelike bitumen bulk carbon, the individual n-alkanes and isoprenoids (pristane and phytane) extracted from the same sample are significantly C- 13 enriched. The isotopic composition of the C 13 - 24 n-alkanes extracted from the high-grade <b>uraniferous</b> sample (delta(13) C = - 28. 0 to 32. 6 parts per thousand) are heavier compared with the same compounds in a uranium-free sample (delta(13) C = 31. 9 to 33. 8 parts per thousand). It is proposed that the bitumen source was the isotopically light (delta(13) C = 35. 8 to 30. 2 parts per thousand) organic matter of the Upper Proterozoic host rocks that were pyrolyzed during intrusion of the Central Bohemian pluton. The C- 13 - depleted pyrolysates were mobilized from the innermost part of the contact-metamorphic aureole, accumulated in structural traps in less thermally influenced parts of the sedimentary complex and were later extracted by hydrothermal fluids. Bitumens at the Pribram deposit are younger than the main part of the uranium mineralization and were formed through water-washing and radiation-induced polymerization of both the gaseous and liquid pyrolysates. Direct evidence for pyrolysate reduction of uranium in the hydrothermal system is difficult to obtain as the chemical composition of the original organic fluid phase was modified during water-washing and radiolytic alteration. However, indirect evidence-e. g., higher O/C atomic ratios in uranium-free bitumens (0. 1) relative to the Upper Proterozoic source rocks (0. 02 - 0. 05), isotopically very light carbon in associated whewellite (delta(13) C = 31. 7 to - 28. 4 parts per thousand), and the striking absence of bitumens in the pre-uranium, hematite stage of the mineralization-indicates that oxidation of organic fluids may have contributed to lowering of aO(2) and uraninite precipitation...|$|E

The isotopic compositions (- 11. 41 to- 29. 36 % PDB) become increasingly heavy with increasing uranium content (0. 001 - 35. 78 wt%). Fractionation is thought to occur by repeated preferred bond breaking between "C-''C atoms with subsequent volatile production and loss, removing '*C atoms. The extent of fractiona-tion may also be controlled {{by the amount of}} stable aromatic material in the organic matter. Petrographic features of these <b>uraniferous</b> hydrocarbons, and others from occurrences in South Africa and Scandinavia, suggest reaction of radiation with organic matter.

40|$|Solid graphitic {{carbonaceous}} matter (CM) {{is closely}} associated with the Oklo uranium ore deposits and several of the natural fission reactors in Gabon, West Africa. This material facilitated the containment of uranium and numerous fissiogenic isotopes in these natural reactors for a period of nearly 2 Ga. Hence it is the subject of detailed studies because it may be useful as an analogue for carbonaceous materials, e. g. technical bitumens, that are currently being considered for the encapsulation and storage of anthropogenic radioactive waste. Chemical and structural analyses of the <b>uraniferous</b> CM associated with the natural fission reactors indicate that it is a polymer-like solid composed mainly of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are randomly oriented (turbostratic) and vary in size from several to several tens of A. Short-chained aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing moieties are attached to the PAH sheets and frequently bridge adjacent sheets. The Oklo <b>uraniferous</b> CM exhibits very high free radical concentrations, which can exceed 1021 free radicals/g organic carbon. The organic free radicals are stable PAH moieties located at or very near the surfaces of these organic solids, mainly on the internal surfaces of pores. Despite their presence, these pores could not have served as effective conduits for the transport of radionuclides by aqueous solutions through and out of the CM matrix. This is because of the very small average size of the pores, together with the CM's non-wettability by aqueous solutions. The Oklo CM has endured oxidation-reduction reactions during uranium mineralization, exposure to ionizing radiation, and alteration associated with the radiolysis products of water during and after natural reactor operation, perhaps up until the present time. Still, the CM acted as an effective barrier to radionuclide migration out of the CM-rich natural fission reactors. Properties, including its aromatic composition, resistance to alteration by ionizing radiation, and its non-wettability to aqueous solutions, make the Oklo <b>uraniferous</b> CM an effective barrier to radionuclide migration.

(3) The uranium dissolved in ground water is fixed in minerals in various ways, the most important being adsorption by carbonaceous matter.

Methods included y-scintillometry,-spectrometry and the mea-surement of the ot and fl activities and uranium content (determined fluorimetrically) of plants and soils. Statistical analysis of the data, coupled with {{a study of the}} work of others in this area, enabled conclusions to be made concerning the relative value of the various prospecting techniques for this area. It was concluded that fluorimetric analysis of plants and soils, gave the most reliable indication of the presence of uranium in the region...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the mineralogical and {{chemical}} study of an Aluminium–phosphate–sulphate (APS) mineralization that occurs in a clastic sequence from the Triassic (Buntsandstein) of the Iberian Range. The deposit is constituted by sandstones, mudstones, and conglomerates with arenaceous matrix, which were deposited in fluvial to shallow-marine environments. In addition to APS minerals, the following diagenetic minerals {{are present in the}} clastic sequence: quartz, K-feldspar, kaolinite group minerals, illite, Fe-oxides-hidroxides, carbonate-sulphate cement-replacements and secondary <b>uraniferous</b> minerals. APS minerals were identified and characterized by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and electron microprobe. Microcrystalline APS crystals occur replacing <b>uraniferous</b> minerals, associated with kaolinite, mica and filling pores, in distal fluvial-to-tidal arkoses-subarkoses. Given their Ca, Sr, and Ba contents, the APS minerals can be defined as a solid solution of crandallite-goyacite-gorceixite (0. 53 Ca, 0. 46 Sr and 0. 01 Ba). The chemical composition, low LREE concentration and Sr > S suggest that the APS mineral were originated during the supergene alteration of the Buntsandstein sandstones due to the presence of the mineralizing fluids which causes the development of Ubearing sandstones in a distal alteration area precipitating from partially dissolved and altered detrital minerals. Besides, the occurrence of dickite associated with APS minerals indicates they were precipitated at diagenetic temperatures (higher than 80 ºC), related to the uplifting occurred during the late Cretaceous post-rift thermal stage...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Several uranium anomalies, with {{concentrations}} of U₃ 0 ₈ that average below 0. 003 percent and reach maximums of 0. 069 percent, {{are associated with}} black, fossiliferous, pyritic parts of the Ordovician Ledbetter Slate in northern Stevens County, Washington. The most <b>uraniferous</b> parts of the slate occur in small (average of 5 by 30 cm), tabular-shaped bodies of black argillite within the crests of several small-scale folds (amplitudes and wavelengths less than 1 m) along the contact between the Ledbetter Slate and Metaline Limestone from within 30 m of the southern border of the Late Cretaceous Spirit pluton. The concentration of uranium in the slate varies {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of reduced organic matter and pyrite contained in the rocks {{as well as with the}} extent of contact metamorphism imposed on the slate during forceful intrusion of the Spirit pluton. Discrete phases of uranium-bearing minerals were not identifiable during the course of petrographic examinations, therefore, the uranium is believed to occur as dispersed ionic disseminations that are physically and(or) chemically bonded to the minute particles of reduced organic matter in the rocks. The uranium anomalies had a multi-stage genesis which may have included: 1) the extraction of uranium from the Ordovician sea by organic matter and the syngenetic accumulation of the <b>uraniferous</b> organics with muds in an euxinic depositional environment; 2) the localized remobilization and corresponding reconcentration of the uranium in the rocks adjacent to the sourthern border of the Spirit pluton in response to contact metamorphism; 3) the minor addition of uranium into the country rock from siliceous volatile-rich fluids may have originated from the late-stage differentiation of the Spirit pluton; and(or) 4) the possible supergene enrichment of uranium that may have been leached by meteoric waters from overlying igneous or metasedimentary rocks. The realtively low-grade and small volume of the <b>uraniferous</b> parts of the Ledbetter Slate in the Bruce Creek study area render the uranium anomalies uneconomic. Nonetheless, an understanding of their distribution, genesis, and petrographic characteristics may lead to the discovery of similar and economically more viable deposits of uranium elsewhere in northeast Washington...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. U-enriched granites {{occur in}} a Precambrian window in the Caledonides of central Sweden and intrude an {{extensive}} supracrustal formation dominated by acid terrestrial volcanics. During the Caledonian orogeny, thrusting, foliation, mylonites, and mesoscopic folds developed in the Precambrian rocks under low-grade metamorphic onditions. Ground and airborne?-spectrometry indicate U-enrichment mainly {{in the northern part}} of the window where two <b>uraniferous</b> granites have been intruded. Several small U vein-type mineralizations are associated with one of the granites. The largest occurrence of the mineralization might be economic, and a Rb-Sr age determination has established a minimum age of 1500 Ma on the associated granite which is highly evolved...|$|E
