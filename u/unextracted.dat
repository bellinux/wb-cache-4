50|$|A fifth view is that, {{in terms}} of the MPRDA, mineral and {{petroleum}} resources are a new category of res publicae, placing mineral and petroleum resources under the custodianship of the state. The underlying property rights of the landowner in <b>unextracted</b> minerals have not been destroyed in theory, but such rights can no longer be of much practical use. The state, in its custodial role, is endowed with the capacity to regulate access to the resources and is obliged to ensure their optimal exploitation.|$|E
50|$|Roslyn's peak {{coal mine}} {{production}} of nearly 2 million tons was reached in 1910. As coal-fired steam trains were {{being replaced by}} diesel power, the mines began to shut down in the 1920s. Although the local coal mines were far from played out (approximately 80% of the coal in the Roslyn mines remains <b>unextracted),</b> the last mine in the area closed in 1963 as business became unprofitable. With the loss of jobs, an exodus of residents ensued.

Some individuals own second homes in Roslyn, while working and living full-time in Seattle or Tacoma, for instance.|$|E
50|$|The {{place name}} Vogtland (formerly {{also known as}} Voigtland, terra advocatorum) {{originates}} in {{the rule of the}} Vogts in this region from the eleventh to the sixteenth century A.D., specifically in reference to the Vogts of Weida, Gera and Plauen. In the 12th century, Kaiser Barbarossa appointed the first Vogts as administrators of his imperial forest areas in the East to facilitate his rule. Their headquarters was the Osterburg at Weida, thus giving it the reputation as the cradle of the Vogtland. Among the privileges of the Vogts were the endowment over minerals still <b>unextracted</b> from the ground (Bergregal) and the entitlement to regulating mint and coinage affairs (Münzregal), which were both handed down to them by Kaiser Frederick II in 1232.|$|E
50|$|The usual {{definition}} of net energy gain compares the energy required to extract energy (that is, to find it, {{remove it from}} the ground, refine it, and ship it to the energy user) {{with the amount of}} energy produced and transmitted to a user from some (typically underground) energy resource. To better understand this, assume an economy has a certain amount of finite oil reserves that are still underground, <b>unextracted.</b> To get to that energy, some of the extracted oil needs to be consumed in the extraction process to run the engines driving the pumps, therefore after extraction the net energy produced will be less than the amount of energy in the ground before extraction, because some had to be used up.|$|E
50|$|However, {{production}} {{not only}} involves labor, but also certain means of labor: tools, materials, {{power plants and}} so on. These means of labor—also known as means of production—are often the product of another labor process as well. So the labor process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process {{with a certain amount}} of value. Labor also requires other means of production that are not produced with labor and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, <b>unextracted</b> minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms of means of production resulting from another labor process, LTV treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labor process. Due to the constancy of their value, these means of production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.|$|E
5000|$|Wet shampoo {{cleaning}} with rotary machines, {{followed by}} thorough wet vacuuming, was widespread until about the 1970s, but industry perception of shampoo cleaning {{changed with the}} advent of encapsulation. Hot-water extraction, also regarded as preferable by all manufacturers, had not been introduced either. Wet shampoos were once formulated from coconut oil soaps; wet shampoo residues can be foamy or sticky, and steam cleaning often reveals dirt <b>unextracted</b> by shampoos. Since no rinse is performed, the powerful residue can continue to collect dirt after cleaning, leading to the misconception that carpet cleaning can lead to the carpet getting [...] "dirtier faster" [...] after the cleaning. The best method is truckmounted hot water extraction.When wet-shampoo chemistry standards converted from coconut oil soaps to synthetic detergents as a base, the shampoos dried to a powder, and loosened dirt would attach to the powder components, requiring vacuuming by the consumer the day after cleaning.|$|E
5000|$|According to one view, {{ownership}} of minerals and petroleum not yet {{extracted from the}} land is vested in the state; another view seeks to distinguish mineral and petroleum resources from minerals and petroleum as such, so that the collective wealth of minerals and petroleum vests in the state, while {{ownership of}} unsevered minerals still vests in {{the owner of the}} land, even though the owner {{may not be able to}} exploit such minerals. A third view holds that the state's [...] "custodianship" [...] of mineral and petroleum resources does not amount to ownership of unsevered minerals and petroleum: Subject to the public-trust doctrine, the landowner remains the owner of <b>unextracted</b> minerals and petroleum. A fourth view is that it is irrelevant where ownership of minerals and petroleum in the soil lies. AgriSA v Minister of Minerals and Energy; Van Rooyen v Minister of Minerals and Energy, however, shows that this is not merely an academic question.|$|E
5000|$|Bear Creek Mining {{contracted}} Ausenco Vector, Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. (IMC), and Resource Development, Inc. {{to conduct}} a feasibility study on mining operations for the project. Their proposed operations were summarized in a technical report issued on October 21, 2010. IMC proposed a [...] "conventional open pit" [...] mining plan based on extracting rock using 63-ton-capacity loading trucks. Prior to production, at least 2.97 million tons of rock would be removed. Each year, about 3.6 million tons of rock would be extracted for 9.5 years; an additional 1.7 years {{would be required to}} finish processing it. During the extraction process, 1.96 tons of rock will be removed from every ton of ore extracted. The ore will then be crushed to a size of 3/4 inch and sent to a heap leach, where a sodium cyanide solution would be used to extract a silver-zinc precipitate from the rock; this will be smelted on site into mostly silver Dore bars; lead and most zinc will remain <b>unextracted.</b> Mining operations would be contracted to a local company. The feasibility study proposes to supply the water used by the mine from water wells in [...] "a very large alluvial aquifer" [...] connected by a 12-km pipeline and from a river 10 km north of the project.|$|E
5000|$|The Jesuits {{were the}} first to bring cinchona to Europe. The Spanish were aware of the {{medicinal}} properties of cinchona bark by the 1570s or earlier: Nicolás Monardes (1571) and Juan Fragoso (1572) both described a tree that was subsequently identified as the cinchona tree and whose bark was used to produce a drink to treat diarrhea. [...] Quinine has been used in <b>unextracted</b> form by Europeans since at least the early 17th century. It was first used to treat malaria in Rome in 1631. During the 17th century, malaria was endemic to the swamps and marshes surrounding the city of Rome. Malaria was {{responsible for the deaths of}} several popes, many cardinals and countless common Roman citizens. Most of the priests trained in Rome had seen malaria victims and were familiar with the shivering brought on by the febrile phase of the disease. The Jesuit brother Agostino Salumbrino (1564-1642), an apothecary by training who lived in Lima, observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from rigors, it was still a successful medicine for malaria. At the first opportunity, Salumbrino sent a small quantity to Rome to test as a malaria treatment. In the years that followed, cinchona bark, known as Jesuit's bark or Peruvian bark, became one of the most valuable commodities shipped from Peru to Europe. When King Charles II was cured of malaria at the end of the 17th Century with quinine, it became popular in London. It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs took over.|$|E
5000|$|Interest in the {{application}} of algae for biofuels was rekindled during the oil embargo and oil price surges of the 1970s, leading the US Department of Energy to initiate the Aquatic Species Program in 1978. The Aquatic Species Program spent $25 million over 18 years with the goal of developing liquid transportation fuel from algae that would be price competitive with petroleum-derived fuels. The research program focused on the cultivation of microalgae in open outdoor ponds, systems which are low in cost but vulnerable to environmental disturbances like temperature swings and biological invasions. 3,000 algal strains were collected from around the country and screened for desirable properties such as high productivity, lipid content, and thermal tolerance, and the most promising strains were included in the SERI microalgae collection at the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) in Golden, Colorado and used for further research. Among the program's most significant findings were that rapid growth and high lipid production were [...] "mutually exclusive", since the former required high nutrients and the latter required low nutrients. The final report suggested that genetic engineering may be necessary to be able to overcome this and other natural limitations of algal strains, and that the ideal species might vary with place and season. Although it was successfully demonstrated that large-scale production of algae for fuel in outdoor ponds was feasible, the program failed to do so at a cost that would be competitive with petroleum, especially as oil prices sank in the 1990s. Even in the best case scenario, it was estimated that <b>unextracted</b> algal oil would cost $59-186 per barrel, while petroleum cost less than $20 per barrel in 1995. Therefore, under budget pressure in 1996, the Aquatic Species Program was abandoned.|$|E
40|$|Summary: In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} the nature of somatoliberin-like immunoreactivity in human seminal plasma. In <b>unextracted</b> seminal plasma, somatoliberin-like immuno reactivity represented 3. 8 §/ 1 somatoliberiii, with a dilution curve that ran almost completely parallel to that of synthetic somatoliberin standard. After extraction by adsorption on hydrophobic CIS Sep-pak cartridges or immunoaffmity chro-matography, no somatoliberin-like immunoreactivity in seminal plasma could be detected. After gel permeation chromatography on a Sephadex G- 50 fine column, all somatoliberin-like immunoreactivity of <b>unextracted</b> seminal plasma was recovered at the void volume of the column. When equal volumes of <b>unextracted</b> seminal plasma and radioiodinated somatoliberin were coincubated for two days at 4 °C, gel chromatography revealed {{the disappearance of the}} normal [J? 5 I]somatoliberin peak, replaced by a new peak eluting shortly after the total volume of the column. When <b>unextracted</b> seminal plasma was heated at 90 °C for 10 min or submitted to ultrafiltration, the interfering factor was no longer detectable. Our data show that enzymic degradation of radioiodinated somatoliberin led to misleadingly high concentrations of somatoliberin-like immunoreactivity in seminal plasma. These phenomena should therefore be considered when performing radioimmunoassays of short chain peptides in biological fluids...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{our study}} was to compare the {{clinical}} usefulness of plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (with and without binding protein extraction) and IGF binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) measurements in the diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) disorders in adults. IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 concentrations were measured in 25 acromegalic and 25 GH-deficient adult (GHDA) subjects (20 - 76 years) by comparison to a control population (n = 81) after age and sex stratification. In untreated acromegaly, IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were clearly increased (10 times the mean of controls for <b>unextracted</b> IGF-I, 4 times for extracted IGF-I and 2 times for IGFBP- 3). Using the mean + 2 SD of the control population as the cut-off point, the sensitivity of IGF-I for the diagnosis of acromegaly was {{higher than that of}} IGFBP- 3 (<b>unextracted</b> IGF-I: 96 % and extracted IGF-I: 100 % vs IGFBP- 3 : 76 %). In GHDAs, IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were decreased (34 % of the mean of controls for <b>unextracted</b> IGF-I, 37 % for extracted IGF-I and 70 % for IGFBP- 3). Using the mean - 2 SD of the control population as the cut-off point, the sensitivity of IGF-I measurement for the diagnosis of GHDA was relatively low, but better for <b>unextracted</b> (68 %) than for extracted IGF-I (52 %). The sensitivity of IGFBP- 3 was much lower (36 %), thus invalidating this parameter for the diagnosis of GHDA. Our observations demonstrate that IGF-I measurement is a more powerful tool than IGFBP- 3 measurement for the diagnosis of GH disorders in adults. Both IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 are very useful for the diagnosis of acromegaly, but they are less reliable for diagnosing GHDA, as normal IGF-I or IGFBP- 3 values do not rule out GH deficiency...|$|E

The extracts produced in this way have properties {{similar to those of}} humic substances, but the yield was not too big and the amount of <b>unextracted</b> dung remained high. By solid-state 13 C-NMR, we showed the dominance in the residue of O-alkyl C forms, usually attributed to polysaccharides. It is reasonable to assume that they are mostly cellulose and other cell wall polysaccharides. These forms, barely extractable by hot KOH, are prone to be hydrolyzed by acid. Therefore, an obvious strategy to drop the amount of <b>unextracted</b> residue is to perform an acid attack before the alkaline extraction.|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} discovered pancreatic peptide amylin is postulated {{to be involved}} in the pathogenesis of feline diabetes mellitus. However, plasma amylin concentrations in normal and diabetic cats have not yet been published. The aim of the present study was to validate a commercial amylin radioimmunoassay kit for the measurement of feline amylin in <b>unextracted</b> plasma, and to measure plasma amylin concentrations in normal and diabetic cats. The kit had satisfactory specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision, and can be recommended for measurement of feline amylin in <b>unextracted</b> EDTA plasma, when nonspecific binding of plasma samples is used in the calculation of measured amylin concentration. Fasting amylin concentration in cats with normal glucose tolerance was 97 +/- 4 pmol/L. Plasma amylin increased in parallel with insulin after glucose administration in cats with normal and impaired glucose tolerance. In contrast to cats with normal glucose tolerance, cats with impaired glucose tolerance had markedly delayed amylin and insulin secretion. Diabetic cats had basal hypoinsulinemia combined with hyperamylinemia. Hyperamylinemia may lead to reduced insulin secretion and insulin resistance, and contribute to the development of feline diabetes. In conclusion, feline amylin can be measured in <b>unextracted</b> EDTA plasma. Fasting amylin concentrations are approximately 100 pmol/L, and amylin and insulin are cosecreted in cats with normal and impaired glucose tolerance.
