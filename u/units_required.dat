5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the <b>units</b> <b>required</b> to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and {{had been sent to}} the Naktong Bulge area. However it {{would be the end of}} the month before the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea.|$|E
25|$|One-off engine test bed, {{converted}} from former No. 616 Squadron RAF operational F.1 serial number EE227, for the Rolls-Royce Trent turboprop engine {{making it the}} world's first turboprop-powered aircraft. The undercarriage was lengthened to give ground clearance for the initial 7 ft 7 inch Rotol airscrews. First flying in September 1945, it was not shown publicly until June 1946. It was found that separate controls for thrust and constant speed <b>units</b> <b>required</b> a lot of skill to manage. It was then flown with higher engine thrust and smaller propellers to enable development of a combined control system. The development programme was complete by 1948.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, 120th LAA Rgt moved to Southend-on-Sea, where in late March it received nine Crusader AA Mark I tracked self-propelled (SP) Bofors guns, which would have a special role in the assault landing on D-Day. In addition, 76th AA Brigade assigned 1618 LAA Rgt Platoon of 323rd Company, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), to the regiment to provide mobility. In March the regiment moved back to Southampton for exercises, where it remained until May, when the <b>units</b> <b>required</b> for the assault phase of Overlord began to gather in southern England. 120th LAA Rgt was already at Southampton {{while the rest of}} the brigade (including the rear echelons of 120th LAA Rgt) concentrated at Southend.|$|E

2500|$|The {{units were}} slowly {{returned}} to WAGN from 1999, {{with the introduction}} of the new [...] "Electrostar" [...] units. The last examples were returned by 2000. However, unreliability of the [...] "Electrostars" [...] meant that four units were still hired on a daily basis until 2002. These units were maintained as part of the main WAGN fleet, and therefore the specific units involved changed when <b>units</b> <b>required</b> maintenance at WAGN's Hornsey TMD depot.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, several 4 Big <b>units</b> <b>required</b> {{extensive}} refurbishment. To {{cover their}} workings, four temporary 4 Tep units were created, formed of three carriages from a refurbished CEP unit, with an unrefurbished buffet car from a BEP unit. The units were renumbered {{in the range}} 2701–2704. They were based at Brighton depot and operated mostly on the London to [...] line. The units were disbanded by 1986, once the refurbishment programme was complete, and were reformed as standard 4 CEP units. The unrefurbished buffet carriages were scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|The chief umpire, then-Captain William S. Sims, and the Navy {{observers}} (mostly {{from the}} Naval War College) offered {{recommendations to the}} Marine artillery crews in different naval gunfire techniques. They thought that the Marines shouldn't engage the [...] "enemy" [...] warships in an artillery duel, risking exposure; they agreed instead that high-angle artillery and flat-trajectory naval gunfire would make the fixed defenses the absolute choice in engagements. CAPT Sims concluded that the Marines, making up the [...] "mock" [...] landing force of 1,200 sailors and Marines, could not breach the island's defenses. However, amidst the smoke and the barrage of blanks, {{and an array of}} searchlights scanning the beaches, the Advanced Base Force successfully defended Culebra.
