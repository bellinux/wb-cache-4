Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be <b>uncoupled</b> from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the mitochondria. Uncoupling then increases oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria is <b>uncoupled.</b> Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{population}} growth in southern Buckinghamshire caused by the railway, Chesham remained relatively unaffected by development. Although there was extensive development in Chesham Bois, roughly halfway between Chesham and Amersham, between 1889 and 1925 the population of Chesham itself grew by less than 2,000, and between 1925 and 1935—the peak of the Metro-land boom—by only 225. Between 1921 and 1928 the season ticket revenue from Amersham and Chalfont& Latimer stations rose by 134%; that from Chesham by only 6.7%. Although the MR owned large tracts of land around Chesham, bought {{in anticipation of a}} revival of the LNWR connection scheme, Selbie chose not to build a housing estate on the site, instead selling much of it to the local council. By this time, service on the Chesham branch was of a relatively poor quality. Improvements to the central London section and the prioritisation of the Aylesbury line had led to ageing surplus stock often being used on the Chesham branch, and the partial electrification caused delays at Rickmansworth as steam locomotives were coupled and <b>uncoupled.</b> As the branch was mainly operated as a shuttle service passengers to and from Chesham were obliged to wait at Chalfont& Latimer station. This had been built to serve a lightly populated area, but the Metro-land development had caused a much larger number of users than it had been designed for, and it had few waiting facilities, poor lighting, inadequate shelter, and dirty toilets. As Amersham grew, {{more and more of the}} trains which had previously run direct from London to Chesham instead ran to Amersham, causing further crowding as passengers waited for the shuttle service at Chalfont& Latimer. Improving road transport caused an increasing number of commuters to abandon the Chesham line, which in turn prompted the MR to further reduce passenger services.|$|E

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 is {{a member}} of the mitochondrial carrier protein family. As a homologue of the thermogenic brown fat <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 1, it possesses a mitochondrial <b>uncoupling</b> activity and thus can influence cell energy metabolism but its exact biological function remains unclear. In the present study, <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 was expressed in 293 cells using the tetracycline-inducible system and its impact on cell bioenergetics and responsiveness to the apoptotic stimulus was determined. The induction of <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 expression in mitochondria did not lead to uncontrolled respiratory <b>uncoupling</b> in intact cells. However, it caused a GDP-inhibition of state 4 respiration and a GDP-induced re-polarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the presence of fatty acids, in agreement with its expected physiological behavior as an <b>uncoupling</b> protein (UCP). <b>Uncoupling</b> protein- 3 expression did not cause apoptosis per se but increased the responsiveness of the cells to a mitochondrial apoptotic stimulus (i. e., addition of staurosporine in the culture medium). It enhanced caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation and favored cytochrome c release. Moreover, cells in which <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 expression had been induced showed a higher mitochondrial Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio essentially due to enhanced translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria. Finally, the induction of <b>uncoupling</b> protein- 3 also increased the sensitivity of mitochondria to open the permeability transition pore in response to calcium.

Diabetes resulted in increased UCP- 2 protein expression and UCP- 2 -mediated <b>uncoupling,</b> but normal mitochondria membrane potential.

In addition to this difference, <b>uncoupling</b> and beta-arrestin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis were mediated through distinct mechanisms. Neither <b>uncoupling</b> nor beta-arrestin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis required the serine and threonine residues localized within the specific C-terminal domains of the 5 -HT 4 R splice variants.

In marked contrast with classical uncouplers such as CCCP (m-chlorophenylhydrazone) or substituted phenols, the N,N'-bis-(4 - trifluoromethylphenyl) -urea cannot be classified among the protonophoric class of uncouplers, due to its inability to exchange protons at pHs between 2 and 9.

We studied electrical <b>uncoupling</b> during ischemia in normal and failing myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue resistance, intracellular Ca 2 + concentration (Indo- 1 fluorescence ratio), and mechanical activity were simultaneously determined in arterially perfused right ventricular papillary muscles from 11 normal and 15 failing rabbits. Heart failure was induced by combined volume and pressure overload. Before sustained ischemia, muscles were subjected to control perfusion (non-PC) or ischemic preconditioning (PC). The onset of <b>uncoupling</b> during ischemia was equal in non-PC normal (13. 6 +/- 0. 9 minutes of ischemia) and non-PC failing hearts (13. 3 +/- 0. 7 minutes of ischemia). PC postponed <b>uncoupling</b> in normal hearts by 10 minutes. In failing hearts, however, PC caused a large variability in the onset of <b>uncoupling</b> during ischemia (mean, 12. 2 +/- 2. 1; range, 5 to 22 minutes of ischemia). The duration of <b>uncoupling</b> process was prolonged in failing hearts (12. 9 +/- 0. 9 minutes) compared with normal hearts (7. 8 +/- 0. 4 minutes). The degree of heart failure and relative heart weight of the failing hearts significantly correlated with the earlier <b>uncoupling</b> after PC and the duration of <b>uncoupling.</b> In every experiment, the start of Ca 2 + rise and contracture preceded <b>uncoupling</b> during ischemia.
