40|$|The most {{important}} area {{of sustainable development}} of agricultural production {{is the development of}} agro-industrial integration, which is the economic, informational, organizational and technological association of the enterprises of agriculture with the processing, transportation, servicing and other entities. Complex multi-level management system, diversified operations, the wide geography of markets, territorial fragmentation of integrated agroformations’ participants demand higher information capacity of accounting and reporting, and the formation of discrete and relevant information on the separate components (segments) activities of agricultural holdings. Segments of agrostructure activity often include a plurality of interconnected companies that are legally independent entities, that makes it necessary to aggregate the registration information in the whole group of economic entities forming segment presented in the accounting and reporting as a single economic unit. In order to solve this problem, we developed a method of forming the consolidated information by segment feature based on a set of procedures for the four interrelated steps: 1) preparation – definition of reportable segments in accordance with the criteria of segmentation, development of <b>uniform</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> for segmental reporting purposes, indicators and the format of segmental reporting; 2) basic – specification of parameters and format worksheets, tables and transformational forms of reporting, collecting the individual statements of the segments, the transformation of the individual reporting data from the analytical forms of the participants segment, followed by elimination of intergroups turnovers; 3) consolidation – the formation of summary reports and correction tables, consolidated statements, transfer of data from the consolidated statements to the form of segmental reporting; 4) analysis – verification of compliance with the principle of consistency and formulation of text explanations to the consolidated segmental information. The proposed method allows to form aggregated data on financial and economic activities of each segment, as a single entity managing the agricultural holding for the search of economic reserves, profitability, growth prospects for the business units, assessment of the level of competitiveness and attractiveness of the segments in the markets...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve comparability, {{which is one of}} the {{fundamental}} principles of accounting, companies should be consistent concerning the <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> they use. Only under certain circumstances changes in <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> are allowed, and when there is a change in <b>accounting</b> <b>policies,</b> it is important that the change is reported in a way that assures that the financial reports still achieve comparability. The purpose of this thesis is to establish which rules and recommendations about changes in <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> that exist in Swedish and German law and what their meaning is. Further, the purpose is to compare these rules and recommendations and discuss their differences and similarities, advantages and disadvantages.

30|$|Several studies {{focus on}} {{accounting}} identification, accounting measurement, and <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> The basis of accounting identification is accrual accounting, butliterature raises {{the concept of}} cash flow based accounting, adjusted from cash based accounting, that could provide more useful information for decision making and solve the limitations of accrual based accounting. For accounting measurement, Lin (1997) investigates the relationship between uncertainty and accounting which argues that accounting has a time-lag and that uncertainty comes from monetary measurement. Xie (1997) presents two non-monetary asset measure models on the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory of value which {{are different from the}} capital preservation concept of accounting. Meanwhile, with the development of financial derivatives, Huang (1997 a) believes that historical cost accounting will be replaced by fair value accounting in the twenty-first century and briefly introduces the concept of fair value accounting in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). With respect to <b>accounting</b> <b>policy,</b> Huang and Yang (1995) explore questions such as what is <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> and why there is <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> They regard <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> as the principle, procedure and method by which a certain accounting unit is used to make financial statements, including macro-level <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> such as <b>accounting</b> standards, and firm-level <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> issued by the firms themselves according to their particular situations. Consistent with Huang and Yang (1995), Li and Zhu (1996) argue that accounting environment and firm operation should be taken into consideration for the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> As well, Huang and Yang (1996) investigate <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> in details, that is the separation between financial accounting and tax <b>accounting</b> in <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> Financial <b>accounting</b> and tax accounting are separated due to different objectives, legislative authority and calculation principles. Compared with accounting development internationally, Tang and Lu (1997) put forward the challenge for financial accounting in China, including accounting identification, accounting measurement, financial reporting, accounting theory, the release and diffusion of accounting information, and the combination of financial accounting and managerial accounting.|$|R
