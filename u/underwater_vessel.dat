5000|$|October 17-24, 2014: A large {{military}} operation is launched {{to search for}} an allegedly damaged submarine in Kanholmsfjärden in the Stockholm archipelago. Encrypted transmissions sent on an emergency radio frequency used by Russian units were recorded. The sources of the transmissions were identified as a submarine and a military site in the Kaliningrad region. On October 19 the military {{said there had been}} three separate sightings and released a picture of the unidentified submarine to the public. There were also suggestions that the Russian Oil-tanker NS Concord was involved as a mother-ship for smaller underwater vehicles as it maintained a pattern of criss-crossing outside Stockholm during the investigation. A Russian research ship equipped with a submarine holding bay, R/V Professor Logachev, was also in the area and turned off its location transponder. Several days later, the hunt was still on as officials were certain that foreign underwater operations were still ongoing. More than 100 sightings were now reported, said Supreme Commander Göransson. Paul Schwartz at Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, said the photograph could be a Russian Lada-class submarine. Sources later said it was certainly at least one mini-submarine and that advanced image analysis [...] "reveales part of a submarine superstructure with two masts behind it".

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>underwater</b> <b>vessel</b> noise {{over the past}} sixty years has {{predominantly}} focused upon the increase in ambient noise caused by the propulsion mechanisms of large commercial vessels. Studies have identified that the continuous rise of ambient noise levels in open waters {{is linked to the}} increase in size and strength of anthropogenic sound sources. Few studies have investigated the noise contribution of smaller vessels or ambient noise levels present in coastal and in-shore waters. This study aimed to identify the level of noise common to non-commercial harbors by studying the noise emissions of a diesel generator on board a 70 m long sailing vessel. Propagation patterns revealed an unconventional shape (specific to the precise location of the noise source on board the vessel), unlike those of standard geometric spreading models, as typically assumed when predicting vessel noise emission. Harbor attributes (including water depth, ground sediment and structural material components) caused for altered level and frequency characteristics of the recorded underwater noise, and were correlated to the sound measurements made. The measurements (taken in eight harbors around Northern Europe) were statistically analyzed to identify the primary factors influencing near-field sound propagation around a stationary vessel...|$|E

40|$|VideoRay is a {{miniature}} <b>underwater</b> <b>vessel</b> especially designed for search- and inspection operations. The vessel is remarkably small, low-weight (~ 5 kg) and considerably mobile {{in areas with}} low accessibility. A disadvantage associated with the unit's size is its susceptibility to external forces and cable pull. When combined with poor water visibility the task of underwater navigation becomes increasingly difficult. There is also cost- and space related limitations to the accessory equipment that can be mounted on the ROV. However, recent development within MEMS-technology {{has resulted in a}} rich selection of small and relatively low-cost accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses which can serve as components in low-end inertial navigation systems. This project aims to explore the possibilities as well as limitations associated with this type of technology as a basis for time-limited inertial navigation for the VideoRay. The project involves the development of a small embedded system including sensors for inertial measurements (IMU), heading (compass), depth (pressure) together with a suitable communication interface that allows easy installation in the vessel and that will transmit real-time motion data to the surface. A control scheme should be developed that assists the ROV in e. g. executing pre-programmed search patterns from a known location on the sea bed. Testing should be performed to document system properties and the results should be discussed with respect to the technology's feasibility in the present application...|$|E
40|$|The European unfired {{pressure}} vessel code EN 13445 - 3 [1] {{has been used}} to design a preliminary prototype of a towfish. The towfish is essentially an <b>underwater</b> <b>vessel</b> equipped with various sensors, cameras, hydroplanes and control systems that are used to capture data on the levels of pollutants in the sea {{and at the same time}} monitor plankton and jellyfish levels. The towfish is towed behind a surface ship and is designed to dive to a depth of 50 m below sea level. The depth of dive can be controlled by means of hydroplanes. Data, signals and electrical power are transferred from the towfish to the surface ship and vice versa via the towing line. From a structural point of view the towfish is a vessel acted upon by external pressure and local loads. Design by rule (DBR) was first used to calculate some of the various dimensions and thicknesses of the towfish components. The various components were designed mainly to prevent failure due to buckling. Design by analysis (DBA) based on Annex B of the {{pressure vessel}} code EN 13445 - 3 [1] was then used to carry out further buckling checks that were not possible to do using design by rule.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) methodology is presented to predict density stratified flows in the near-field of ships and submarines. The density is solved using a higher-order transport equation coupled with mass and momentum conservation. Turbulence is implemented with a k-ε/k-ω based Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) approach, enabling explicit solution of larger energy-containing vortices in the wake. Validation tests are performed for a two-dimensional square cavity and the three-dimensional stratified flow past a sphere, showing good agreement with available data. The near-field flow of the self-propelled Research Vessel Athena advancing in a stably stratified fluid is studied, {{as well as the}} operation in stratified flow of the notional submarine Joubert BB 2 also in self-propelled condition. The resulting density, velocity, pressure and turbulent quantities at the exit plane of the near-field computation contain a description of the relevant scales of the flow and can be used to compute the far-field stratified flow, including internal waves. The generation of internal waves is shown {{in the case of the}} submarine for two different conditions, one with the pycnocline located at the propeller centerline, and the second with the pycnocline located slightly below the submarine, concluding that distance to the pycnocline strongly affects the internal wave generation due to the presence of the vessel. It is also shown that, as in the case of surface waves, the generation of internal waves requires energy that results in an increase in resistance. For the case of the surface ship the near field wakes are mostly affected by the separation at the wet transom and propeller mixing. However, in the case of the <b>underwater</b> <b>vessel,</b> the disturbance of the background density profile by the presence of the submarine affects the near-field wakes. Finally, the dead-water phenomenon, which occurs at very low Froude numbers, is studied for R/V Athena. Though the dead water problem has been studied in the literature using potential flow methods, this thesis presents the first attempt at using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) to analyze the flow. Results show that, while CFD can reproduce trends observed in potential flow studies, viscous effects are significant in the wake and the friction coefficient...|$|E

We have presented a probabilistic approach to state estimation and fault diagnosis in complex industrial processes. In particular, we adapted a Jump Markov Linear Gaussian (JMLG) model to describe a continuous stirred tank reactor. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm identifies the parameters of this process. After identification, real-time particle filtering algorithms were adapted to diagnosis of the state of operation of continuous stirred tank reactor. For this application, we compared two particle-filtering variants: standard particle filtering and Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering. The particle filtering estimates were then used to drive an automatic control system...|$|R
40|$|Supercavitating {{vehicles}} (SV) are a {{class of}} high-speed autonomous <b>underwater</b> <b>vessels.</b> They present a great challenge in designing the guidance law {{in comparison with the}} traditional autonomous underwater vehicles. This {{is due to the fact}} that their constraints and working environment are much more complex. To tackle the above challenge, an optimal nonlinear midcourse guidance logic is proposed by considering the wake terminal guidance and the remote target attack tasks. The proposed guidance logic is optimized by using an efficient genetic algorithm to obtain its optimal parameters. The results from our simulation case study suggest that the proposed guidance logic can meet both the motion requirements and navigation constraints while effectively cooperating with the wake terminal guidance. Moreover, it has potential in reducing the energy consumption to significantly improve the overall vehicle energy efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Four {{students}} of InHolland University Delft have started the mechanical design of an autonomous portable observational unmanned lightweight airship (POULA). Their main objectives where {{to make the}} airship as light and simple as possible. This has resulted in an airship with only two propellers which can be independently rotated around their common axis. Little or no attention is paid regarding the dynamics and controllability of the airship. Because it was questionable if the strongly nonlinear and underactuated airship would be controllable {{this had to be}} investigated first. This investigation is the main subject of the research presented in this report. Because no mathematical model was available {{the first part of the}} report concerns the derivation of the kinematic and dynamic model. Initially it was the intention to design a three dimensional nonlinear control system and therefore the model obtained is three dimensional as well. However, this appeared to be a bridge too far for this research. Instead the model is simplified to two dimensions. The purpose of the airship will be to monitor a certain indoor area like a gym with an onboard camera. After the airship has been released in the air the first task of the control system is to let the airship ascent to a desired altitude. After this task is accomplished the airship is ready to track a certain (time-varying) trajectory to surveil the area. A constant altitude is desired during this operation. First the model has been simplified to a two dimensional model in the longitudinal plane. A controller is designed to let the airship ascent to a certain starting position. Because the model is still underactuated it is linearized. Linear state feedback controllers are obtained using the pole placement method. Simulations show that the system can be stabilized and that the controller is able to let the errors converge to zero. When the airship has reached its desired height it is ready to start his surveilling task. Because the desired altitude is constant the model is considered in the horizontal plane. The main assumption is that the airship is neutrally buoyant, i. e. the altitude remains constant during the operation without providing a propeller force upwards. Because of the underactuated design and the non-negligible nonlinear terms it is a very hard control problem. A lot of literature is available how to deal with this problem. Different strategies with different constraints have been proposed. Considering these different constraints and the objectives for the airship there has been chosen to follow the strategy used for controlling an <b>underwater</b> <b>vessel.</b> The method presented in the paper has been adjusted and modified to make it suitable for the airship. First a trajectory planning algorithm is proposed specifying all the necessary reference states. These states are used as an input for the nonlinear controller which is based on Lyapunov techniques. Practical exponential stability is proven. Simulations show that the airship can be stabilized and is able to track a time-varying sinusoidal trajectory with and without model errors and time-varying disturbances. In future research the three dimensional model will have to be used to obtain a three dimensional control system. Literature is available which describe strategies to design this control system. Based on the two dimensional results presented in this report and the available literature it does seem possible to control the airship POULA. It will be possible to surveil indoor areas using the onboard camera...|$|E
