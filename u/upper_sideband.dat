25|$|When single-sideband {{is used in}} amateur radio voice communications, it {{is common}} {{practice}} that for frequencies below 10MHz, lower sideband (LSB) is used and for frequencies of 10MHz and above, <b>upper</b> <b>sideband</b> (USB) is used. For example, on the 40 m band, voice communications often take place around 7.100MHz using LSB mode. On the 20 m band at 14.200MHz, USB mode would be used.|$|E
25|$|If we {{just look}} at the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an <b>upper</b> <b>sideband</b> generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full <b>upper</b> <b>sideband</b> of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E

40|$|Twenty {{years of}} {{progress}} in 200 GHz receivers for spaceborne remote sensing has yielded a 180 - 220 GHz technology with maturing characteristics, as evident by increasing availability of relevant hardware, paralleled by further refinement in receiver performance requirements at this spectrum band. The 177 - 207 GHz superheterodyne receiver, for the Earth observing system (EOS) microwave limb sounder (MLS), effectively illustrates such technology developments. This MLS receiver simultaneously detects six different signals, located at sidebands below and above its 191. 95 GHZ local-oscillator (LO). The paper describes the MLS 177 - 207 GHz receiver front-end (RFE), and provides measured data for its lower and <b>upper</b> <b>sidebands.</b> Sideband ratio data is provided {{as a function of}} IF frequency, at different LO power drive, and for variation in the ambient temperature...|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} amateur radio frequencies {{are commonly}} used for transmitting and receiving PSK31 signals. They normally occupy the lower edge of each band's digital modes section. PSK31 operators generally use <b>upper</b> <b>sideband</b> (USB), even on frequencies below 10MHz where the convention normally calls for lower sideband. This is because (a) signals then spread upwards into the digimode section from the [...] "base" [...] frequency, and (b) using QPSK requires both stations {{to use the same}} sideband.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} generation {{known as a}} Hartley modulator, named after R. V. L. Hartley, uses phasing to suppress the unwanted sideband. [...] To generate an SSB signal with this method, {{two versions of the}} original signal are generated, mutually 90° out of phase for any single frequency within the operating bandwidth. Each one of these signals then modulates carrier waves (of one frequency) that are also 90° out of phase with each other. By either adding or subtracting the resulting signals, a lower or <b>upper</b> <b>sideband</b> signal results. A benefit of this approach is to allow an analytical expression for SSB signals, which can be used to understand effects such as synchronous detection of SSB.|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that there}} are two choices for : 43000Hz and 47000Hz, called [...] {{low-side}} and high-side injection. With high-side injection, the spectral components that were distributed around 45000Hz will be distributed around 2000Hz in the reverse order, also known as an inverted spectrum. That is in fact desirable when the IF spectrum is also inverted, because the BFO inversion restores the proper relationships. One reason for that is when the IF spectrum is the output of an inverting stage in the receiver. Another reason is when the SSB signal is actually a lower sideband, instead of an <b>upper</b> <b>sideband.</b> But if both reasons are true, then the IF spectrum is not inverted, and the non-inverting BFO (43000Hz) should be used.|$|E

2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the <b>upper</b> <b>sideband</b> (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{course a}} useful {{modulation}} signal m(t) will generally not {{consist of a}} single sine wave, as treated above. However, by the principle of Fourier decomposition, m(t) can be expressed as the sum {{of a number of}} sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of [...] 1+m(t) with c(t) as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier c(t) is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of m at fi there are two sidebands at frequencies fc + fi and [...] fc - fi. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the <b>upper</b> <b>sideband,</b> and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation m(t) to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal Fourier transform of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation m(t) having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).|$|E
50|$|For a {{radio signal}} like SSB with wider {{bandwidth}} than Morse code, low-side injection preserves the relative {{order of the}} frequency components. High-side injection reverses their order, which is often desirable to counteract a previous reversal in the radio receiver. For radio amateurs it is conventional practice to use lower sideband below 10 MHz and <b>upper</b> <b>sideband</b> above 10 MHz, however the 60 metre band is different, using <b>upper</b> <b>sideband.</b> Amateurs have the band as secondary users and that practice retains compatibility with the primary users.|$|E
40|$|RX 51914. 4 + 2456 is a {{candidate}} double-degenerate binary with a putative 1. 756 mHz orbital frequency. In a previous timing study using archival ROSAT and ASCA data we reported evidence for an increase of the putative orbital frequency at a rate consistent with expectations for gravitational radiation from the system. Here we report the results of new Chandra timing observations which confirm the previous indications of spin-up of the X-ray frequency, and provide much tighter constraints on the frequency derivative, u. We obtained with Chandra a total of 75 ksec of exposure in two epochs separated in time by 10. 3 months. The total time span of the archival ROSAT, ASCA and new Chandra data is now 10. 2 years. This more than doubles the interval spanned by the ROSAT and ASCA data alone, providing much greater sensitivity to a frequency derivative. With {{the addition of the}} Chandra data an increasing frequency is unavoidable, and the mean i/ is 5. 9 f 0. 9 x 10 -l' Hz s-'. Interestingly, power spectra of the longest Chandra pointing show evidence for a sideband structure to the 1. 756 mHz frequency. The fundamental and first harmonic show evidence for <b>upper</b> <b>sidebands</b> with a frequency separation of E 0. 5 mHz from their parent peaks. Additionally, the first and second harmonics show evidence for lower sidebands with approximately half the frequency separation of the <b>upper</b> <b>sidebands.</b> Similar sideband structure is a common feature of Intermediate Polars (Ips) -although it is usually observed in the optical-and suggests the presence of a longer period in the system, perhaps the previously unseen orbital period. If this is correct the sideband structure indicates an orbital period close to 1 hr, and the observed u likely represents the accretion-induced spin-up of a white dwarf.

50|$|Another {{complication}} is {{that the}} phase of the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>sideband</b> signals have to be locked to each other. The composite signal is detected by the receiver. The electronic operation of detection effectively shifts the carrier down to 0 Hz, folding the signals with frequencies below the Carrier, {{on top of the}} frequencies above the carrier. Thus the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>sidebands</b> are summed. If there is a phase shift between these two, then the combination will have a relative amplitude of (1 + cos φ). If φ was 180°, then the aircraft's receiver would not detect any sub-carrier (signal A3).|$|R
40|$|GaAs Schottky mixers {{with state}} of the art planar {{submicron}} diodes are used for THz-detection up to 3 THz today [1]. GaAs Schottky diodes can operate in room temperature which makes them good candidates for space applications and an interesting low cost alternative to low noise cryogenic SIS and HEB technologies.

Differ-ential memory {{effects can be}} revealed in two-tone experiment by the divergence for increasing tone-spacing of the vector Volterra coeffi-cients associated with the lower and upper intermodulations tones. Using large-signal vector measurement with a large-singal network analyzer, a class-AB LDMOS RF PA is demonstrated to exhibit a strong differential memory effect for modulation bandwidth above 0. 3 MHz. New frequency-selective RF and baseband predistortion linearization algorithms are proposed to separately address the lin-earization requirements of the interband and inband intermodula-tion products of both the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>sidebands.</b> Theoretical verification of the algorithms are demonstrated with MATLAB simu-lations using a Volterra/Wiener PA model with memory effects.
