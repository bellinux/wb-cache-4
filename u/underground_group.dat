5|$|Although the C {{was well}} used, low ticket {{prices and the}} {{construction}} cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company's finances. In 1913, the C {{became part of the}} <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group's railways, the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway, forming a single London Underground line called the Morden-Edgware line. In 1933, the C {{and the rest of the}} <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> was taken into public ownership. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.|$|E

5|$|At Stalag Luft III Marcinkus {{became an}} active member of an <b>underground</b> <b>group</b> of prisoners who {{organized}} and executed the Great Escape. Marcinkus was responsible for analyzing the German railway schedules– {{a vital part of the}} plan. On the night of 25 March 1944, Marcinkus became one of 76 servicemen who escaped the prison camp. After several days he was recaptured by the Gestapo and executed.|$|E
5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight {{services}} and concentrate on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 1 June 1935 the LPTB gave the required six months' notice to the O that it intended to terminate operations on the Brill Tramway.|$|E
5|$|Further {{coordination}} in {{the form}} of a General Managers' Conference faltered after Selbie withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without any reference to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. Suggestions of merger with the <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> were rejected by Selbie, a press release of November 1912 noting the Met's interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main-line railways and its freight business.|$|E

5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight services, and to {{concentrate}} on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. In particular, he saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 30 November 1935 the last train ran on the Brill Tramway between Brill and Quainton Road, and at the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed. The former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway between Quainton Road and Verney Junction was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936, and London Transport services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, Mazurkiewicz was {{assigned}} to the Diversionary Operations (Grupa Operacyjnej Dywersji) of the Polish General Staff, which was involved in counter-intelligence against Nazi Germany particularly in the Free City of Danzig. After the German Invasion of Poland and the imminent collapse of Polish defenses in mid-September, following plans made before the outbreak of the war, he organized Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa (Secret Military Organization, TOW), an <b>underground</b> <b>group</b> dedicated to sabotaging and resisting the German occupation. He journeyed to Paris, where he met with General Władysław Sikorski, the Polish prime minister in exile, who officially sanctioned the formation of TOW. In Hungary, Mazurkiewicz subsequently organized a cell whose purpose was to serve as a transit point for soldiers and couriers traveling between occupied Poland and France. He returned to Poland in June 1940.|$|E
5|$|As {{managing}} director of the UERL from 1910, Stanley led further transport consolidation with the UERL's take-over of London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) in 1912 and the CLR and the C on 1 January 1913. The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (it paid dividends of 18 per cent compared with <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> companies' dividends of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the rest of the group. Through the UERL's shareholding in the London and Suburban Traction Company (LSTC), which it owned jointly with British Electric Traction, the UERL took control in 1913 of the London United Tramways, the Metropolitan Electric Tramways and the South Metropolitan Electric Tramways. The UERL also took control of bus builder AEC. The much enlarged group became known as the Combine. Only the MR (and its subsidiaries the Great Northern & City Railway and the East London Railway) and the W (by then fully owned by the London and South Western Railway) remained outside of the Underground Group's control.|$|E
50|$|Note: Many of the <b>underground</b> <b>groups</b> were commercially successful; the {{dichotomy}} between underground and commercial NDW-groups {{has more to}} do with differences in sound, presentation and attitude.|$|R

500|$|To {{make the}} <b>Underground</b> <b>Group's</b> posters and signage more {{distinctive}} he commissioned calligrapher and typographer Edward Johnston {{to design a}} clear new typeface. Pick specified to Johnston in 1913 that he wanted a typeface that would ensure that the <b>Underground</b> <b>Group's</b> posters would not be mistaken for advertisements; it should have [...] "the bold simplicity of the authentic lettering of the finest periods" [...] and belong [...] "unmistakably to the twentieth century". Johnston's sans serif [...] "Underground" [...] typeface, (now known as Johnston) was first used in 1916 and was so successful that, with minor modifications in recent years, it is still in use today.|$|R
5|$|Following her {{resignation}} from Vector in {{the wake}} of her discoveries and the Gnosis Terrorism, Shion allies with <b>underground</b> <b>group</b> Scientia to investigate. Her former co-worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS-MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, and sees the demonstration of two new weapons for fighting the Gnosis—T-elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS-MOS; and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T-elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS-MOS will be scrapped so development can focus on T-elos. As KOS-MOS's weaponry {{is the only way to}} break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS-MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent visions of the girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U-DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, with vehicle numbers depleted by wartime service in France and Belgium, the Underground Group's bus operations began to experience a surge in competition from a large number of new independent bus operators. These small operators were unregulated and preyed on the group's most profitable routes taking away a large number of its passengers and a large amount of its income. Albert Stanley (ennobled as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick fought back by calling on parliament to regulate bus operations in the capital. The London Traffic Act 1924 granted their request by establishing the London Traffic Area to regulate road passenger traffic within London and the surrounding districts. Throughout the 1920s, Pick led the Underground Group's efforts to coordinate its services with the municipal tram operators, the Metropolitan Railway and the suburban mainline rail services. The aim was to achieve a pooling of income between all of the operators and remove wasteful competition. At the end of 1930, a solution was announced in a bill for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation which was {{to take control of the}} <b>Underground</b> <b>Group,</b> the Metropolitan Railway and the majority of the bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the County of London and Middlesex and parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 the <b>Underground</b> <b>Group,</b> {{which at}} that time owned most of the London Underground, bought the LGOC. In 1933 the LGOC, {{along with the rest}} of the <b>Underground</b> <b>Group,</b> became part of the new London Passenger Transport Board. The name London General was {{replaced}} by London Transport, which became synonymous with the red London bus.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the CCE, {{now part}} of the London Electric Railway (<b>Underground</b> <b>Group),</b> was using plans dating back to 1901 for the Edgware and Hampstead Railway to {{construct}} an extension of its line from Golders Green through Hendon to a new station at Edgware where it would be in direct competition with the LNER line. The <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> had also bought up the rights of the W and published proposals to further extend the line to Bushey and Watford although nothing was done immediately.|$|E
25|$|Pro-Communist POW {{who could}} not endure the torture also formed an <b>underground</b> <b>group</b> to fight the Pro-Nationalist POW {{secretly}} by assassination {{which led to the}} Geoje Uprising in the end.

50|$|Most US {{contacts}} with the <b>underground</b> <b>groups</b> were combat rather than intelligence specialists. Most of the links established by U.S. authorities to the Japanese <b>underground</b> <b>groups,</b> were to high ranking officers with operational and combat experience. Another significant intelligence specialist, with an extensive network of contacts among officers, was Lieutenant General Kawabe Torashiro. Kawabe joined with Arisue in providing the services of former Japanese Army personnel to occupation authorities, particularly G-2. Kawabe’s last headquarters assignment gave him informal authority over many groups and individuals within the army. His network was made up primarily of former high-ranking army general staff members and their subordinates. These individuals were in networks of subordinate organizations, called kikan, that would carry out actual operations.|$|R
50|$|Military graves at Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery {{include a}} mass grave for Haganah {{soldiers}} killed between 1934 and 1936, graves and memorials for members of Jewish <b>underground</b> <b>groups</b> (Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi), and several tracts of graves for soldiers killed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.|$|R
25|$|The British {{authorities}} began {{applying the}} death penalty against captured Jewish militants. While {{the first member of}} a Jewish <b>underground</b> <b>group,</b> Shlomo Ben-Yosef, was executed in 1938 for his part in an unsuccessful shooting attack on Arab civilians who were traveling on a bus, no further executions of Jews for politically motivated violence were held in Palestine until the late 1940s.|$|E
25|$|In July 1907, {{the fare}} was {{increased}} to 3d for journeys {{of more than}} seven or eight stations. The line was extended westwards with a loop serving a single platform at Wood Lane for the 1908 Franco-British Exhibition. A reduced fare of 1d, for a journey of three or fewer stations, was introduced in 1909, and season tickets became available from 1911. The extension to Liverpool Street opened the following year, providing access to the Great Eastern station and the adjacent Broad Street station by escalators. The Central London Railway was absorbed into the <b>Underground</b> <b>Group</b> on 1 January 1913.|$|E
25|$|Major Roy Alexander Farran DSO, MC & Two Bars (2 January 1921 – 2 June 2006) was a British soldier, politician, farmer, {{author and}} journalist. He was highly {{decorated}} for his exploits with the Special Air Service (SAS) during World War II. Farran became widely known after being court martialled {{on a charge}} of murdering an unarmed 16-year-old member of the Jewish <b>underground</b> <b>group</b> Lehi during his command of an undercover Palestine Police unit. After his brother was killed in a revenge attack, Farran emigrated to Canada where he forged a successful business and political career, holding a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1971 to 1979 sitting with the Progressive Conservative caucus. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Peter Lougheed during that period.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{re-opening}} {{of schools}} in late October 1987, <b>underground</b> <b>groups</b> in Rangoon and Mandalay produced dissident leaflets which culminated in bombs exploding in November. Police later received threatening letters from <b>underground</b> <b>groups,</b> who organised small protests around the university campus. After securing Least Developed Country status from the United Nations Economic and Social Council in December 1987, government policy requiring farmers to sell produce below market rates to create greater revenue for the government sparked several, violent rural protests. The protests were fanned by public letters to Ne Win by former second in command General Brigadier Aung Gyi from July 1987, reminding him of the 1967 rice riots and condemning lack of economic reform, describing Burma as [...] "almost a joke" [...] compared to other Southeast Asian nations. He was later arrested.|$|R
