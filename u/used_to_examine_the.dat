The most recent such design also incorporates protection against red fault locating lasers.|$|E
25|$|For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with {{intravascular}} contrast {{may be able}} {{to identify}} abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause.

25|$|Beginning in {{theoretical}} physics, {{the method}} of MD gained popularity in materials science and since the 1970s also in biochemistry and biophysics. MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of proteins and other macromolecules based on experimental constraints from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. In physics, MD is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion-subplantation, and also to examine the physical properties of nanotechnological devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and structural biology, the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in ligand docking. In principle MD {{can be used for}} ab initio prediction of protein structure by simulating folding of the polypeptide chain from random coil.|$|E

The study finds that a 100% renewable electricity system is possible, albeit with occasional imports from abutting countries, and that biomass {{plays a key role}} in system stability.
