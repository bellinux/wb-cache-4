40|$|The {{problem of}} {{possible}} application of an <b>ultracold</b> <b>neutron</b> (UCN) trap as a detector {{of dark matter}} particles with long-range radius of forces has been considered. Transmission of small recoil energy in scattering is a characteristic of long-range forces. The main advantage of the <b>ultracold</b> <b>neutron</b> technique lies in possibility of detecting recoil energy as small as 10 ^- 7 eV. Here are presented constraints on the interaction potential parameters: U(r) =a r^- 1 e^-r/λ for dark matter particles and neutrons, {{as well as on}} the density value of long-range dark matter on the Earth. The possible mechanism of accumulation of long-range dark matter on the Earth surface is considered and the factor of density increase on the Earth surface is evaluated.

40|$|AbstractGravity {{experiments}} with very slow, so-called ultracold neutrons connect quantum mechanics with tests of Newton's inverse square law at short distances. These experiments face a low count rate and hence need highly optimized detector concepts. In {{the frame of}} this paper, we present low-background <b>ultracold</b> <b>neutron</b> counters and track detectors with micron resolution based on a 10 B converter. We discuss the optimization of 10 B converter layers, detector design and concepts for read-out electronics focusing on high-efficiency and low-background. We describe modifications of the counters that allow one to detect ultracold neutrons selectively on their spin-orientation. This is required for searches of hypothetical forces with spin–mass couplings. The mentioned experiments utilize a beam-monitoring concept which accounts for variations in the neutron flux that are typical for nuclear research facilities. The converter {{can also be used}} for detectors, which feature high efficiencies paired with high spatial resolution of 1 – 2 μm.
