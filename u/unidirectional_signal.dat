Light induction overcomes frq negative autoregulation so that frq expression can remain high in constant light. These data explain how a simple <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signal</b> (light and the induction of frq) may be turned into a bidirectional clock response (time of day-specific advances and delays).

We found that IL- 22 −/- mice displayed major defects in the skin’s dermal compartment after full-thickness wounding. We also found that IL- 22 signaling is active in fibroblasts, using in vitro assays with primary fibroblasts, and that IL- 22 directs extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression and myofibroblast differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|SummaryLateral {{inhibition}} {{mediated by}} Delta/Notch (Dl/N) signaling is used throughout development {{to limit the}} number of initially equivalent cells that adopt a particular fate [1 – 3]. Although adjacent cells express both Dl ligand and N receptor, signaling between them ultimately occurs in only one direction. Classically, this has been explained entirely by feedback: activated N can downregulate Dl, amplifying even slight asymmetries in the Dl or N activities of adjacent cells [1 – 5]. Here, however, we present an example of lateral inhibition in which <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signaling</b> depends instead on Dl's ability to inhibit N within the same cell, a phenomenon known as cis-inhibition [6 – 11]. By genetically manipulating individual R 1 /R 6 /R 7 photoreceptor precursors in the Drosophila eye, we show that loss of Dl-mediated cis-inhibition reverses the direction of lateral signaling. Based on our finding that Dl in R 1 /R 6 s requires endocytosis to trans-activate but not to cis-inhibit N, we reexamine previously published data from other examples of lateral inhibition. We conclude that cis-inhibition generally influences the direction of Dl/N signaling and should therefore be included in standard models of lateral inhibition...|$|R

The existence of a third SIRP protein has been suggested by cDNA sequence only. We show that this third SIRP is a separate gene that is expressed as a protein with unique characteristics from both alpha and beta genes and suggest that this gene should be termed SIRPgamma. We have expressed the extracellular region of SIRPgamma as a soluble protein and have shown that, like SIRPalpha, it binds CD 47, but with a lower affinity (K(d), approximately 23 microM) compared with SIRPalpha (K(d), approximately 2 microM). mAbs specific to SIRPgamma show {{that it was not}} expressed on myeloid cells, in contrast to SIRPalpha and -beta, being expressed instead on the majority of T cells and a proportion of B cells. The short cytoplasmic tail of SIRPgamma does not contain any known signaling motifs, nor does it contain a characteristic lysine, as with SIRPbeta, that is required for DAP 12 interaction. DAP 12 coexpression is a requirement for SIRPbeta surface expression, whereas SIRPgamma is expressed in its absence. The SIRPgamma-CD 47 interaction may therefore not be capable of bidirectional signaling as with the SIRPalpha-CD 47, but, instead, use <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signaling</b> via CD 47 only...|$|R

40|$|As {{agricultural}} productivity {{and the success}} or failure of crops are influenced by weather conditions and the local availability of water, great benefits could potentially be accrued by an ability to closely match the germination of crops against weather predictions, particularly as weather prediction models are becoming more powerful. A way to do this is to genetically modify seeds that will germinate in response to a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signal</b> transmitted to them (a ‘radio-controlled seed’). The transmission, most likely in the microwave region because of the unidirectional nature of these waves, could either come from a satellite or from a ground unit. Many fields would be seeded at the beginning of the season and selectively ‘switched on’ in response to weather conditions most favourable for given crop types. Hand held devices used by farmers could trigger seeds at a more local level (down to individual plots). Although seeds left in fields for too long without germinating will eventually rot, the radio-controlled seed would provide a considerable degree of leeway between the sowing of seeds and their germination that could be directly controlled by farmers in response to weather conditions and/or local water and equipment availability. This could reduce waste and improve {{agricultural productivity}}...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Using {{biochemical}} assays {{to determine}} the activation state of Rho-like GTPases, we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam 1 functions as a specific activator of Rac but not Cdc 42 or Rho in NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Activation of Rac by Tiam 1 induces an epithelial-like morphology with functional cadherin-based adhesions and inhibits migration of fibroblasts. This epithelial phenotype is characterized by Rac-mediated effects on Rho activity. Transient PDGFinduced as well as sustained Rac activation by Tiam 1 or V 12 Rac downregulate Rho activity. We found that Cdc 42 also downregulates Rho activity. Neither V 14 Rho or N 19 Rho affects Rac activity, suggesting <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signaling</b> from Rac towards Rho. Downregulation of Rho activity occurs independently of Racinduced cytoskeletal changes and cell spreading. Moreover, Rac effector mutants that are defective in mediating cytoskeleton changes or Jun kinase activation both downregulate Rho activity, suggesting that neither of these Rac signaling pathways {{are involved in the}} regulation of Rho. Restoration of Rho activity in Tiam 1 -expressing cells by expression of V 14 Rho results in reversion of the epithelioid phenotype towards a migratory, fibroblastoid morphology. We conclude that Rac signaling is able to antagonize Rho activity directly at the GTPase level, and that the reciprocal balance between Rac and Rho activity determines cellular morphology and migratory behavior in NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} here a novel inductive {{action that}} operates during somitic segmentation in chicken embryos. We previously {{reported that the}} posterior border cells located at a next-forming boundary in the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) exhibit an inductive activity that acts on the anterior cells to cause {{the formation of a}} somitic fissure (Sato, Y., Yasuda, K., Takahashi, Y., 2002. Morphological boundary forms by a novel inductive event mediated by Lunatic fringe and Notch during somitic segmentation. Development 129, 3633 – 3644). In this study, we have found a second inductive action along the dorso-ventral (D–V) axis during fissure formation. When relocated into a non-segmenting region of PSM, the ventral-most cells taken from the presumptive boundary are sufficient to induce an ectopic fissure in host cells. The ventrally derived signal acts in a ventral-to-dorsal direction but not ventrally, regardless of where the ventral cells are placed. This directional signaling is governed, at least in part, by the signal-receiving cells of the PSM, which we found to be polarized along the D–V axis, and also by intimate cell–cell interactions. Finally, we have observed that morphological segmentation is able to rearrange the anterior and posterior regionalization of individual somites. These findings suggest that discrete <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signals</b> along both the antero-posterior and the D–V axes act coordinately to achieve the formation of the intersomitic fissure, and also that fissure formation is important for the fine-tuning of A–P regionalization in individual somites...|$|R

From September 2003 to September 2004, a consecutive series of 14 patients with St Jude aortic valve visited in the cardiology clinic were referred to neurosonology unit, Valie Asr Hospital, Khorasan. TCD monitoring of MES was performed with an ultrasound device and a 2 MHz probe.

40|$|A {{signaling}} pathway transmits information from an upstream system to downstream systems, ideally unidirectionally. A key bottleneck to unidirectional transmission is retroactivity, {{which is the}} additional reaction flux that affects a system once its species interact with those of downstream systems. This {{raises the question of}} whether {{signaling pathway}}s have developed specialized architectures that overcome retroactivity and transmit unidirectional signals. Here, we propose a general mathematical framework that provides an answer to this question. Using this framework, we analyze the ability of a variety of signaling architectures to transmit signals unidirectionally as key biological parameters are tuned. In particular, we find that single stage phosphorylation and phosphotransfer systems that transmit signals from a kinase show the following trade-off: either they impart a large retroactivity to their upstream system or they are significantly impacted by the retroactivity due to their downstream system. However, cascades of these architectures, which are highly represented in nature, can overcome this trade-off and thus enable unidirectional information transmission. By contrast, single and double phosphorylation cycles that transmit signals from a substrate impart a large retroactivity to their upstream system and are also unable to attenuate retroactivity due to their downstream system. Our findings identify signaling architectures that ensure <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signal</b> transmission and minimize crosstalk among multiple targets. Our results thus establish a way to decompose a signal transduction network into architectures that transmit information unidirectionally, while also providing a library of devices that can be used in synthetic biology to facilitate modular circuit design.

40|$|The {{generation}} of purposive movement by mammals involves coordinated {{activity in the}} corticospinal and corticostriatal systems, which are involved in different aspects of motor control. In the motor cortex, corticospinal and corticostriatal neurons are closely intermingled, raising {{the question of whether}} and how information flows intracortically within and across these two channels. To explore this, we developed an optogenetic technique based on retrograde transfection of neurons with deletion-mutant rabies virus encoding channelrhodopsin- 2, and used this in conjunction with retrograde anatomical labeling to stimulate and record from identified projection neurons in mouse motor cortex. We also used paired recordings to measure unitary connections. Both corticospinal and callosally projecting corticostriatal neurons in layer 5 B formed within-class (recurrent) connections, with higher connection probability among corticostriatal than among corticospinal neurons. In contrast, across-class connectivity was extraordinarily asymmetric, essentially unidirectional from corticostriatal to corticospinal. Corticostriatal neurons in layer 5 A and corticocortical neurons (callosal projection neurons similar to corticostriatal neurons) similarly received a paucity of corticospinal input. Connections involving presynaptic corticostriatal neurons had greater synaptic depression, and those involving postsynaptic corticospinal neurons had faster decaying EPSPs. Consequently, the three connections displayed a diversity of dynamic properties reflecting the different combinations of presynaptic and postsynaptic projection neurons. Collectively, these findings delineate a four-way specialized excitatory microcircuit formed by corticospinal and corticostriatal neurons. The “rectifying” corticostriatal-to-corticospinal connectivity implies a hierarchical organization and functional compartmentalization of corticospinal activity via <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signaling</b> from higher-order (corticostriatal) to lower-order (corticospinal) output neurons...|$|R

40|$|Guiding {{neuronal}} polarity, axonal outgrowth, and synapse formation {{are crucial}} factors in neuronal differentiation {{and organization of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). This guidance allows the CNS to form functional circuits to process information or generate new circuits in case of injured nervous tissue. Unscrambling the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuronal growth could thus provide new methods of neural regeneration. Our aim is to achieve extrinsic control of functional polarity in neuronal networks. To investigate how the neuronal polarity of individual primary cortical neurons can be affected we used a previously established in vitro model system. One-dimensional protein gradients (poly-l-Lysin and laminin) were transferred onto a glass surface by microcontact-printing, and then populated with embryonic (E 18) rat cortical neurons. Two growth directions can be obtained, one along the increasing gradient (+) and one {{in the direction of the}} decreasing gradient (-). A circular node was integrated in the middle of the gradient structure to control the position of the neuronal soma. After 13 to 15 days in vitro we performed double patch-clamp experiments on neighboring cells on the gradient. Due to the aligned printing of the gradients, we were able to discriminate whether the signal transmits in the (+) or (-) direction. Double patch clamp recording and the position of the pre- and post-synaptic cell with respect to each other, has shown that the signals are propagated toward the (+) direction of the underlying gradient structure (n= 14, 78 %). Furthermore, all synapses measured showed <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signal</b> transmission.

40|$|Neurons {{are highly}} {{polarized}} cells with two structurally and functionally distinct compartments, axons and dendrites. This dichotomy {{is the basis}} for <b>unidirectional</b> <b>signal</b> propagation, the quintessential function of neurons. During neuronal development, the formation of the axon is the initial step in breaking cellular symmetry and the establishment of neuronal polarity. Although a number of polarity regulators involved in this process have been identified, our understanding of the intracellular mechanisms underlying neuronal polarization still remains fragmentary. In my studies, I addressed the role of microtubule dynamics in initial neuronal polarization. To this end I aimed to investigate the following issues: 1) How do microtubule dynamics and stability change during initial neuronal development? 2) Do microtubules play an instructive role in axon formation? 3) What are possible regulators mediating changes in microtubule dynamics during axon formation? Using hippocampal neurons in culture as a model system for neuronal polarization I first addressed the dynamics of microtubules in early developmental stages of neurons. Assessing posttranslational modifications of tubulin which serve as markers of microtubule turnover I found that microtubule stability is increased in a single neurite already before axon formation and in the axon of morphologically polarized cells. This polarized distribution of microtubule stability was confirmed by testing the resistance of neuronal microtubules to pharmacologically induced depolymerization. The axon of polarized neurons and a single neurite in morphologically unpolarized cells showed increased microtubule stability. Thus, I established a correlation between the identity of a process and its microtubule stability. By manipulating specific regulators of neuronal polarity, SAD kinases and GSK- 3 beta, I analyzed a possible relation between a polarization of microtubule stability and neuronal polarity. I found that a loss of polarity correlated with a loss of polarized microtubule stability in neurons defective for SAD A and SAD B kinases. In marked contrast, the formation of multiple axons, induced by the inhibition of GSK- 3 beta, was associated with increased microtubule stability in these supernumerary axons. These results suggested that SAD kinases and GSK- 3 beta regulate neuronal polarization –at least in part– by modulating microtubule dynamics. To establish a possible causal relation between microtubule dynamics and axon formation I assessed the effects of specific pharmacological alterations of microtubule dynamics on neuronal polarization. I found that application of low doses of the microtubule destabilizing drug nocodazole selectively reduced the formation of future dendrites. Conversely, low doses of the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol {{led to the formation of}} multiple axons. I also studied microtubule dynamics in living neurons transfected with GFP-tagged EB 3, a protein binding specifically to polymerizing microtubule plus ends. In line with my previous observations I found that microtubules are stabilized along the shaft of the growing axons while dynamic microtubules enrich at the tip of the growing process, suggesting that a well- balanced shift of microtubule dynamics towards more stable microtubules is necessary to induce axon formation. By uncaging a photoactivatable analog of taxol I induced a local stabilization of microtubules at the neurite tip of an unpolarized neuron which was sufficient to favor the site of axon formation. This indicates that a transient stabilization of microtubules is sufficient to trigger axon formation. In summary, my data allow the following conclusions: 1) Microtubule stability correlates with the identity of a neuronal process. 2) Microtubule stabilization causes axon formation. 3) Microtubule stabilization precedes axon formation. I therefore deduce that microtubules are actively involved in the process of axon formation and that local microtubule stabilization in one neuronal process is a physiological signal specifying neuronal polarization...|$|E

This hypothesis is explored in {{two sets of}} computational experiments, one studying the effects on learning of long-range <b>unidirectional</b> contextual <b>signals</b> mediated by intervening processors, and the other showing contextually supervised discovery of a high-order variable in a multi-layer network. 1 Supervision and biological plausibility Supervised models represent a successful paradigm of learning for artificial neural networks. Not only such models have been applied {{to a wide range}} of engineering problems, but they have also been used to infer computational properties of living brains (e. g., [4]). However, the requirement of desired values for output neurons (provided by an "external teacher"), often coupled with back-propagation of error signals along the same synaptic connections [3], raises serious doubts about the b [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a two-dimensional (range and depth) formulation for small-angle propagation of nonlinear acoustic pulses and weak shocks in a refracting medium {{which can be}} range dependent. The formulation readily extends to three dimensions. The nonlinearity is most efficiently treated in the time domain, so the signal is not Fourier decomposed into component frequencies. Beginning with a second-order wave equation which includes the lowest-order nonlinearity, an approximate first-order nonlinear progressive wave equation (NPE) is derived. The NPE is the nonlinear time-domain counterpart of the linear frequency-domain parabolic equation (PE). The derivation is accomplished by transforming the wave equation to a pulse-following frame and perturbing about a <b>unidirectional</b> plane-wave <b>signal.</b> The NPE manifests a natural separation of terms governing refraction, diffraction, spreading and nonlinear steepening. Numerical methods are outlined for {{the solution of the}} time-domain problem. Calculations using the formulation developed here successfully follow the development of initially smooth pulses into N waves and the reflection of weak shocks from a caustic...|$|R
40|$|SummarySensory receptors are the {{functional}} {{link between the}} environment and the brain [1 – 3]. The repair of sensory organs enables animals to continuously detect environmental stimuli [4]. However, receptor cell turnover can affect sensory acuity by changing neural connectivity patterns [5, 6]. In zebrafish, two to four postsynaptic lateralis afferent axons converge into individual peripheral mechanosensory organs called neuromasts, which contain hair cell receptors of opposing planar polarity [7]. Yet, each axon exclusively synapses with hair cells of identical polarity during development and regeneration to transmit <b>unidirectional</b> mechanical <b>signals</b> to the brain [8, 9]. The mechanism that governs this exceptionally accurate and resilient synaptic selectivity remains unknown. We show here that converging axons are mutually dependent for polarity-selective connectivity. If rendered solitary, these axons establish simultaneous functional synapses with hair cells of opposing polarities to transmit bidirectional mechanical signals. Remarkably, nonselectivity by solitary axons can be corrected upon the reintroduction of additional axons. Collectively, our results suggest that lateralis synaptogenesis is intrinsically nonselective and that interaxonal interactions continuously rectify mismatched synapses. This dynamic organization of neural connectivity may represent a general solution to maintain coherent synaptic transmission from sensory organs undergoing frequent variations in the number and spatial distribution of receptor cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} seven level {{inverter}} with photovoltaic system, for stand-alone applications with hybrid PWM control scheme. Three carrier signals that are identical {{to each other}} which are compared with <b>unidirectional</b> sinusoidal reference <b>signal</b> were used to generate the PWM signals. In this paper, a new topology {{with a combination of}} low frequency and high frequency switches is proposed to improve the performance of a multilevel inverter. This topology requires fewer components compared to existing inverters and requires fewer carrier signals and gate drives. Therefore, the overall cost and complexity are greatly reduced. The performance of proposed multilevel inverter with equal dc sources is simulated by using MATLAB platform. Harmonic analysis is done on H-Bridge seven level inverter and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system...|$|R
