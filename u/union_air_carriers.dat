25|$|Brussels Airlines began {{trying to}} set up a {{regional}} airline in DR Congo in 2007. DR Congo used to be Belgian Congo and has strong business and political ties with Belgium. In that year, airDC was founded as a joint venture with Hewa Bora Airways, and the launch of commercial regional flights from Kinshasa-N'djili Airport using a fleet of BAe 146-200s handed over by Brussels Airlines was planned for early 2008. Concerns about the success of the project were voiced in 2008, when the disaster of Hewa Bora Airways Flight 122 revealed serious aviation safety flaws in the DR Congo. As a consequence, Hewa Bora was banned from operating within the European <b>Union</b> (any <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> from the DR Congo had already been included in the EU blacklist since 2006 due to a lack or regulatory oversight in the country, but there had been an exception for Hewa Bora's Brussels service). The airDC project was postponed indefinitely and eventually abandoned.|$|R

For this review, GAO evaluated the results of foreign airport and <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> evaluations; actions taken and assistance provided by TSA when security deficiencies were identified; TSA's oversight of its foreign airport and <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> evaluation programs; and TSA's efforts to address challenges in conducting foreign airport and <b>air</b> <b>carrier</b> evaluations.

To impose the ASIF, TSA issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR) and required <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> to report their passenger and property screening costs incurred in 2000 on an attachment to the IFR referred to as Appendix A. The 2000 screening costs reported by <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> were going to be used to establish the ASIF. Based on industry estimates of $ 1 billion, TSA had estimated that the costs incurred by <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> in 2000 were $ 750 million, but the amounts reported by <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> totaled $ 319 million, significantly less than expected.

This testimony discusses (1) TSA's requirements for domestic <b>air</b> <b>carriers</b> to conduct watch-list matching, (2) {{the extent to which}} TSA has assessed compliance with watch-list matching requirements, and (3) TSA's progress in developing Secure Flight.
