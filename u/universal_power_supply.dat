However, most of the current literature {{on the subject of}} energy scavenging is focused on micropower and other small-scale applications. Several high-power energy scavenging methods are investigated here with an emphasis on relating physical sensor dimensions with output power. A novel power scavenging mechanism is introduced that shows excellent correlation between theoretical and experimental performance. In addition, a <b>universal</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is proposed which may be interfaced with an overhead distribution line of 4. 16 - 34. 5 kVAC to create a temporary source of high-quality regulated power for portable device electronics and battery charging...|$|E
40|$|Electro-spark {{deposition}} (ESD) is a micro {{welding process}} characterized by short duration high current pulses, often generated by capacitors, arcing between a conductive electrode and substrate. The high intensity, low net power process results in metallurgical bonded coatings or alloyed layers with practically no heat affected zone. The unique characteristics {{of this process}} facilitate the bonding of high ceramic content cermet materials, as well as heat sensitive high value materials. The process is used to repair components where low heat input, low distortion depositions are required, as well as apply coatings {{for the improvement of}} corrosion resistance, tribological properties and local alloy content. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of ESD power supply designs on the control of ESD process parameters. Electrical power supply parameters such as voltage, capacitance and voltage were examined, along with physical parameters including; application force, movement speed, movement pattern and shielding gas were explored. Three different custom power supplies were developed to encompass performance improvements reported in previous studies and compare advanced circuit and parameter behavior against the traditional ESD machine. This was done by analyzing the possible voltage and current signals recorded from the power supply with a data acquisition system. The electrical signals were used to compare advances in voltage, capacitance, frequency and pulse sequence control. Key parameters were identified and implemented in a <b>universal</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> as a simplified user interface. A wider range of electrical parameters were tested in order to meet the needs of a wider variety of material pairings. The new universal ESD power supply was tested to determine the parameter effects on the coating quality of titanium carbide nickel sintered electrodes deposited on copper substrates. Pulse voltage and frequency were identified as having the most significant effect on the coating thickness and defect formation. The deposition experiments for relating the electrical parameters to coating quality revealed errors in the coating measurements caused by variations in the ESD physical parameters. A computer numerical controlled machine was developed with a force feedback system to control the physical parameters. Using this system the effect of controlled deposition patterns, movement speed, application force, and argon shielding gas was tested against the effects of the ESD voltage and frequency. The experimental data concluded that the physical controls paired with the management of electrical parameters improved the coating thickness, and lack of defects. Implementation of a physical control system including movement and force control would be beneficial for future experiments and for some industrial applications. The combined electrical power effects of varying the voltage, frequency with the use of shielding gas resulted in improved coating thickness and quality. This demonstrated that testing to determine the effective parameter ranges for new applications and material pairings is integral to the deposition of thicker coatings with reductions in the typical pore, crack and oxidation defects...|$|E
40|$|Introduction 2 ̆ 2 Tamasomam Jyotirgamayah 2 ̆ 2 (O Mother! Lead us from {{darkness}} to light) - {{has always been}} the essence of Indian spiritual being. Ethereally speaking, it has also been the wish of the modern man to escape from {{darkness to}} light- both metaphysically and metaphorically. The means that man has invented to meet this end is nothing else than the electricity. Today, it would be as much naïve to imagine the modern man without electricity as nihilistic to imagine the fish out of water (Razdan, 2003). Electricity {{is not a matter of}} life and death. It is a lot more important than that. Light is life. No nation can become a developed country without proper and efficient system of electricity. <b>Universal</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is the primary responsibility of a welfare state. Hence, it is one of the critical infrastructure on which sustainable economic growth of any country depends. Hydroelectric Power The term 2 ̆ 2 Hydro 2 ̆ 2 is derived from the Greek word for wate. The force of gravity causes water to flow downwards. The downward motion of water contains kinetic energy which is converted into mechanical energy and consequently into electrical energy in hydroelectric power station. Electric power generated with the help of falling water – propelled Turbines, is called Hydroelectric Power (Prasad, 2000). In general, falling water is channeled through a turbine, which converts the water 2 ̆ 7 s energy into the mechanical power. Hydropower is one such resource, which is renewable, non-polluting, environmentally friendly and cheapest source of energy. The hydro power plants contribute significantly to the development of the area surrounded within and outside the project area since a network of roads and bridges are laid for the project, which connects the local area to the outside world and opens large number of avenues for the development of the area (Verma, 1996). India 2 ̆ 7 s first hydro station was commissioned in 1897 at Darjeeling. Since then many mega projects have come up and many more are in the pipeline. Although hydropower is considered a renewable and economical source of energy, yet its share has decreased in post independent India. Due to the imminent oil price rise and depleting resources of natural fuel, the priorities of power sector are focused on the development of hydropower for capacity addition in forthcoming years. At present, the Ministry of Power (MOP) is the nodal agency and is concerned with the perspective planning and policy formulation in the power sector. The CEA (Central Electricity Authority), constituted under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 assists the Ministry of Power (MoP) in all its technical and economic matters and is responsible for developing a sound, adequate, uniform policy for the control and utilization of the national power resources. All the power sector industries, i. e., Thermal, Hydro, Nuclear, Renewable, Wind and such other organizations/ research institutions are available under one roof of Ministry of Power. Key Players in the Hydroelectric Power Sector The following corporations are engaged in generation and transmission of hydropower in India (Mathur, 2003). National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited (NHPC). North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited (NEEPCO). Tehri Hydro Development Corporation (THDC). Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVN).

40|$|Power {{electronics}} convert {{and control}} power and are {{an essential part}} of many electronic devices and systems. Increasingly, power converters need to operate over widely varying operating conditions (voltage, current and power level), which can degrade their performance. In many applications, power converters are also being interconnected to form power systems. This is challenging as the converters may have to operate in various configurations. In order to ensure best performance, power converters and systems need to adapt to the operating conditions by adjusting topology, component values or control characteristics. In this thesis, two applications are considered: <b>universal</b> input <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and off-grid electrification. More than 3 billion <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> were sold worldwide in 2014 [1], with efficiencies ranging from 50 - 90 % [2], which results in significant energy loss. A major portion of these are <b>universal</b> input <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> (designed to operate at AC line voltages found globally). In this thesis, a control technique, Variable Frequency Multiplier (VFX), is developed which compresses the effective operating range required of a resonant converter by switching the inverter and/or rectifier operation between processing energy at a fundamental frequency and one or more harmonic frequencies. This technique was applied to the inverter stage of a stacked-bridge LLC converter for a <b>universal</b> input <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> An efficiency of 94. 9 % to 96. 6 % was achieved for a 50 W converter operating across the entire (4 : 1) input voltage range. Even though centralized grid infrastructure is widespread, access to electricity is still limited {{in many parts of the}} developing world. More than 1. 2 billion people globally do not have access to electricity [3]. In this thesis, an ad hoc modular microgrid architecture is developed and field-tested. Contrary to how conventional power systems are designed, these microgrids do not require pre-planning and can operate in any network configuration. Smart power management units have been designed to arbitrarily connect power sources and loads, forming an autonomous microgrid. Accurate power sharing of multiple power sources is demonstrated. A methodology to attain the lowest system cost by designing power converters that reduce lifetime energy loss has also been developed. This enables affordable and reliable electricity to be provided in off-grid areas. Improvements in these applications will have a significant impact on power utilization from the existing grid infrastructure, and will help define the future of power utilization where this infrastructure does not exist. Moreover, the techniques and designs developed, in this thesis, for adaptable and efficient operation of power converters and systems can be easily extended to other applications. by Wardah Inam.
