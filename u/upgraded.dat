5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD <b>upgraded</b> {{the system to}} a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD <b>upgraded</b> the system to a cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development of}} rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC <b>upgraded</b> the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD <b>upgraded</b> Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E

50|$|HPM.1 is Hardware Platform Management IPM Controller Firmware <b>Upgrade</b> Specification of PICMG. This {{specification}} describes firmware <b>upgrade</b> procedure into PICMG IPM Controllers (Not PICMG 3.0 Shelf Management Controller (ShMC)), as {{specified in}} thespecifications AdvancedTCA, AdvancedMC and MicroTCA specifications. An <b>Upgrade</b> Agent (Ex:ipmitool) <b>upgrades</b> firmware via any IPMI interfaces (IPMB-0 or IPMB-L, LAN, UART or any Shelf-Carrier Manager).The specification also describes format of <b>upgrade</b> image. The <b>upgrade</b> image can contain {{one or more}} than one component's firmware. The <b>upgrade</b> agent <b>upgrades</b> the component's firmware one by one. The IPM controller can {{have more than one}} component (U-Boot, Linux, rfs, FPGA, etc.). The firmware <b>upgrade</b> procedure contains three stages (Preparation Stage, <b>Upgrade</b> Stage, and Activation Stage). In preparation stage <b>Upgrade</b> Agent gets target capabilities and all component properties. Then it compares this information with <b>Upgrade</b> image. If there is a mismatch, <b>Upgrade</b> Agent abandons the firmware <b>upgrade.</b> Otherwise it moves into <b>Upgrade</b> stage. In <b>Upgrade</b> stage <b>upgrade</b> agent sends all components firmware one by one. After successfully receiving the firmware, IPM controller waits for activation. In Activation stage <b>Upgrade</b> Agent activates newly uploaded firmware. If self-test is supported by IPM controller, then it is invoked. If self-test fails, IPM controller automatically rolls back to previous firmware. If IPM controller does not support automatic roll back, operator or <b>Upgrade</b> Agent has to initiate the manual roll back.|$|R

Firstly, this paper explains the conception of informal city and points out the spacial and social character of informal city. Secondly, at the view of time sequence and <b>upgrading</b> motivity, three <b>upgrading</b> models of informal cities in developing countries are put forward and analyzed, which include the <b>upgrading</b> model of government-initiated interventions, the <b>upgrading</b> model of self-help approach, and the <b>upgrading</b> model of multiple participations. Thirdly, the enlightenment of informal urban <b>upgrading</b> in developing countries upon Chinese urban <b>upgrading</b> is put forward. At last, based on the analysis of the three <b>upgrading</b> models, a conclusion is drawn that the sustainable urban <b>upgrading</b> can’t be achieved by any single objective and sector.

40|$|The {{computer}} software industry {{is an extreme}} example of rapid new product introduction. However, many consumers are sophisticated enough to anticipate the availability of <b>upgrades</b> in the future. This creates the possibility that consumers might either postpone purchase or buy early on and never <b>upgrade.</b> In response, many software producers offer special <b>upgrade</b> pricing to old customers in order to mitigate the effects of strategic consumer behavior. We analyze the optimality of <b>upgrade</b> pricing by characterizing the relationship between magnitude of product improvement and the equilibrium pricing structure, particularly {{in the context of}} user <b>upgrade</b> costs. This <b>upgrade</b> cost (such as the cost of <b>upgrading</b> complementary hardware or drivers) is incurred by the user when she buys the new version but is not captured by the <b>upgrade</b> price for the software. Our approach is to formulate a game theoretic model where consumers can look ahead and anticipate prices and product qualities while the firm can offer special <b>upgrade</b> pricing. We classify <b>upgrades</b> as minor, moderate or large based on the primitive parameters. We find that at sufficiently large user costs, <b>upgrade</b> pricing is an effective tool for minor and large <b>upgrades</b> but not moderate <b>upgrades.</b> Thus, <b>upgrade</b> pricing is suboptimal for the firm for a middle range of product improvement. User <b>upgrade</b> costs have both direct and indirect effects on the pricing decision. The indirect effect arises because the <b>upgrade</b> cost is a critical factor in determining whether all old consumers would <b>upgrade</b> to a new product or not and this further alters the product improvement threshold at which special <b>upgrade</b> pricing becomes optimal. Finally, we also analyze the impact of <b>upgrade</b> pricing on the total coverage of the market...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Enterprise systems (ES) <b>upgrade</b> is {{a complex}} phenomenon, yet it is {{possible}} to reduce the complexity through understanding of the <b>upgrade</b> drivers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the various <b>upgrade</b> drivers, in order to provide a detailed understanding of the factors driving <b>upgrade</b> decisions. Design/methodology/approach This research is grounded in a qualitative survey design. It utilises a web-based survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to collect data from 41 respondents representing 23 large organisations. The data were qualitatively analysed and coded to identify the various drivers and their influence on ES <b>upgrade</b> decisions. Findings The findings suggest that the <b>upgrade</b> decisions are dependent on establishing the need to <b>upgrade,</b> which is influenced by various drivers and stakeholders interests. In addition, the findings suggest that organisations would only opt to <b>upgrade</b> when benefits are aligned with the <b>upgrade</b> and when the decision makes business sense. Research limitations/implications In this paper, the authors propose that there is a relationship between the <b>upgrade</b> drivers and the <b>upgrade</b> strategy. However, qualitative studies can only formulate logical generalisations. Hence, future research could explore these associations through a quantitative study in order to provide probabilistic generalisation that offers either similar or conflicting arguments applicable to ES <b>upgrade</b> phenomenon. Originality/value This paper provides an alternative classification of <b>upgrade</b> drivers, and conceptualises an association between <b>upgrade</b> drivers and the <b>upgrade</b> strategy, which in turn facilitates minimising disruptions and <b>upgrade</b> risks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Persistent object stores {{require a}} way to {{automatically}} <b>upgrade</b> persistent objects, to change their code and storage representation. Automatic <b>upgrades</b> are a challenge for such systems. <b>Upgrades</b> must be performed {{in a way that}} is efficient both in space and time, and that does not stop application access to the store. In addition, however, the approach must be modular: it must allow programmers to reason locally about the correctness of their <b>upgrades</b> similar to the way they would reason about regular code. This paper provides solutions to both problems. The paper first defines <b>upgrade</b> modularity conditions that any <b>upgrade</b> system must satisfy to support local reasoning about <b>upgrades.</b> The paper then describes a new approach for executing <b>upgrades</b> efficiently while satisfying the <b>upgrade</b> modularity conditions. The approach exploits object encapsulation properties in a novel way.

50|$|For {{all four}} {{categories}} of <b>upgrades,</b> {{there are three}} different levels of <b>upgrade</b> you can purchase, known as A, B, and C (C being {{the most powerful and}} expensive). Every category has different prices for their <b>upgrades,</b> and the <b>upgrades</b> offer a higher percentage of power increase. The most inexpensive <b>upgrade</b> is fielding A (12%) for $1,000, and the most expensive is robot C (80%) for $30,000. Keep in mind when using the robot <b>upgrade</b> that it powers up all attributes of a character an equal amount corresponding to the <b>upgrade</b> level. The power received from a non-robot <b>upgrade</b> for a human character adds on to the character's already existing powers.
