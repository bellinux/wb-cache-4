This method of detection requires the resin to be chemically labelled, and several possible chemicals are proposed. The merits {{of each of these}} chemicals are discussed and thiourea and chloral are selected as the best potential labels. It is necessary to ensure that adding these chemicals to a resin will not alter the resin's properties. For this reason the thiourea and chloral labelled resins' physical properties are compared with those of an unlabelled resin. The effect of cyclic soaking (in water) and drying on the physical behaviour and tensile strengths of labelled and unlabelled resin films is also assessed. As a result of these, and later experiments, chloral is rejected as a suitable label. All subsequent investigations of resin microdistribution are carried out using a thiourea/urea <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> These studies reveal several important characteristics of particleboard ''glue lines''. The majority of resin is concentrated close to the ''glue line'' and is rarely found more than two cells away from the chip junction. Little or no resin is observed in the cell lumen, but there is evidence of cell wall penetration and possible within cell wall distributions are identified. Finally the implications of the cycling, tensile strength and resin distribution data are discussed with reference to the problems of particleboard failure in moist environments.

The resins were prepared by placing all formaldehyde {{and water in}} reaction kettle and pH was adjusted with sulfnric acid and sodium hydroxide, respectively. Urea was added in 1. 5 equal parts at 1 - minute intervals. The proportion of high molecular weight products in the rosin increased substantially as the reaction pH decreased. The formation of {{a high percentage of}} uron derivatives under strong acidic conditions indicated these resins differed considerable from conventional UF resins formulated in the past. Bagasse panels bonded with UF resins formulated with acidic pH resulted in higher IF 3 than with those formulated with the conventional alkaline- acidic pH system. Similar results were also shown with PMDIAJF bonded Bagasse panels. The apparently higher IB strength of PMDI/UF resin systems indicate that these resin systems would be expected to provide the greatest potential for further improvement in terms of IB/cost basis. It is noted that mixed catalyst systerfLof sodium hydroxide/ammonium and triethanohunine yielded a higher average IB, while sodium hydroxide catalyst resulted in a lower IB than commercial UF resin used as control. Since the cost of UF is substantially lower than that of PMDI, economic gains of PMDI/UF resin could be significant by using UF resin as the major component in the system...|$|R
