5|$|An {{ideal is}} by {{definition}} <b>unattainable</b> in a given time and space. However, by persistently and dynamically approaching it, the process results in a sustainable system.|$|E
5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of Great Naktong Offensive were <b>unattainable</b> from the beginning. The Americans, who had been better {{equipped}} than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they {{had the chance to}} form a continuous line, according to historian T. R. Fehrenbach. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Demos {{of the new}} {{material}} were sent to British producer Ken Nelson (Coldplay, Gomez). The band members considered him to be an <b>unattainable</b> candidate as a producer, but he responded favourably. Upon learning that {{he was interested in}} working with them, they moved to London. At the time, Nelson was occupied working with Coldplay. For eight to ten months, the band lived in adverse conditions in one room in a house in London. During this period, the members took up menial employment opportunities. Picchio sold double-glazing over the telephone. Moule worked in a pub and in a car workshop, and Joel worked on a farm.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is <b>unattainable,</b> such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama set {{the goal}} of {{bringing}} 1 million plug-in electric vehicles on the road by 2015. However, considering the actual slow rate of PEV sales, as of mid-2012 several industry observers have concluded that this goal is <b>unattainable.</b> In September 2014 Governor of California Jerry Brown signed a bill, the Charge Ahead California Initiative, that sets a goal of placing at least 1 million zero-emission vehicles and near-zero-emission vehicles {{on the road in}} California by January 1, 2023.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet, {{and it has the}} characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects the rhetorical tradition of an Italian or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love and beauty of a beloved, often an <b>unattainable</b> love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E
5|$|The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) {{is a form}} {{of poetry}} common in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Urdu and Bengali poetry. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a refrain {{at the end of the}} second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an {{identical}} meter. The ghazal often reflects on a theme of <b>unattainable</b> love or divinity.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed <b>unattainable</b> to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but <b>unattainable</b> Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be <b>unattainable</b> because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing <b>unattainable</b> objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting <b>unattainable</b> universal laws.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise <b>unattainable.</b> Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historian}}s contend {{the goals}} of the North Koreans at the Pusan Perimeter were <b>unattainable</b> from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the North Koreans could not keep up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt went on {{to chair}} a conference of welfare {{providers}} to military personnel {{in order to show}} that the Army understood the issues affecting its soldiers and to organise a series of smaller conferences, hosted by himself and Sir Freddie Viggers—then Adjutant-General to the Forces—to discuss welfare issues with commanding officers across the UK. In 2007, Dannatt and his wife, Pippa, visited Headley Court, an MoD rehabilitation centre for wounded personnel, where the commanding officer informed the Dannatts of his desire for a swimming pool, but accepted that it was unlikely to receive government funding. Some time later, the Dannatts were introduced to Bryn and Emma Parry by Sarah-Jane Shirreff—the wife of Sir Richard Shirreff—and the Dannatts assisted the Parrys with the formation of Help for Heroes, set up with the specific aim of funding the swimming pool at Headley Court. Dannatt initially worried that the charity's ₤2 million goal might be <b>unattainable,</b> but it eventually raised enough money to build both the pool and a gymnasium, which were opened in 2010. He and Pippa later assisted both Help For Heroes and SSAFA Forces Help in efforts to build houses to accommodate the families of wounded servicemen at Headley Court and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham, inspired by the difficulties faced by the family of George Cross recipient Peter Norton.|$|E
5|$|Loeb, driving an all new Citroën C4 WRC car {{which had}} been in {{development}} throughout 2006, {{took control of the}} race from the outset, winning the two stages on the first day and four more stages over the following three days. His teammate Sordo kept the pressure on, winning three stages, but on Stage 6, Loeb extended his lead from 6.6 seconds to nearly 24 seconds, and from thereon became <b>unattainable.</b> Each stage on the first two Legs were won by either Loeb or Sordo, and it wasn't until Saturday afternoon on the second run of the day's stages, that other drivers could effectively challenge them. The last two days of the race consisted of a duel between Mikko Hirvonen, who drove a factory 2006 model Ford Focus RS WRC, and Chris Atkinson in a factory Subaru Impreza WRC 2006. After Hirvonen completed Stage 2 in fourth place, Atkinson took the position on Stage 3 and held onto it throughout Friday and into Saturday morning's stages. On Stage 12 on Saturday afternoon, Hirvonen retook fourth, Atkinson regained it on Stage 13 but then lost it to Hirvonen again following Stage 14. Atkinson won the final stage on Sunday morning, and finished the race back in fourth position.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{had proven}} {{himself to be}} an {{energetic}} emperor who saw possibilities everywhere, and whose optimistic outlook had shaped his approach to foreign policy. However, {{in spite of his}} military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire. Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel's aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions he sent to Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an <b>unattainable</b> scale. His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish Sultanate of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Peace of Venice. Historian Mark C. Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried to rebuild a national army, but his reforms were adequate for neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies. According to Edward Gibbon, Manuel's victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest.|$|E
25|$|Around 1880, the 'glucose process' was developed. It finally {{enabled the}} direct {{printing}} of indigo onto fabric and could produce inexpensive dark indigo prints <b>unattainable</b> with the China blue method.|$|E
25|$|Soap {{has been}} <b>unattainable</b> and none {{given in the}} rations. With much persuasion, and weeks after requisitioning, soap is now given {{occasionally}} in very minute quantities–certainly not enough for clothes and personal washing.|$|E
25|$|Something of {{a parody}} of The Maltese Falcon, Beat the Devil (1953), was Bogart's last film with his close friend and {{favorite}} director John Huston. Co-written by Truman Capote, the eccentrically filmed tale follows an amoral group of rogues chasing an <b>unattainable</b> treasure.|$|E
25|$|Louise Brooks as an <b>unattainable</b> {{film image}} {{served as an}} {{inspiration}} for Adolfo Bioy Casares when he wrote his science fiction novel The Invention of Morel (1940) about a man attracted to Faustine, {{a woman who is}} only a projected 3-D image.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} interest are DNA ligases. These molecules have demonstrated remarkable chemoselectivity in RNA branching reactions. Although each repeating unit in a RNA strand owns a free hydroxyl group, the DNA ligase takes {{just one of}} them as a branching starting point. An accomplishment <b>unattainable</b> with traditional organic chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Ancient {{texts and}} archaeological {{excavations}} show {{the use of}} perfumes {{in some of the}} earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously <b>unattainable</b> solely from natural aromatics alone.|$|E
25|$|Synchrotron X-ray tomographic {{analysis}} of early Cambrian bilaterian embryonic microfossils yielded new insights of metazoan evolution at its earliest stages. The tomography technique provides previously <b>unattainable</b> three-dimensional resolution at {{the limits of}} fossilization. Fossils of two enigmatic bilaterians, the worm-like Markuelia and a putative, primitive protostome, Pseudooides, provide a peek at germ layer embryonic development. These 543-million-year-old embryos support the emergence of some aspects of arthropod development earlier than previously thought in the late Proterozoic. The preserved embryos from China and Siberia underwent rapid diagenetic phosphatization resulting in exquisite preservation, including cell structures. This research is a notable example of how knowledge encoded by the fossil record continues to contribute otherwise <b>unattainable</b> information on the emergence and development of life on Earth. For example, the research suggests Markuelia has closest affinity to priapulid worms, and is adjacent to the evolutionary branching of Priapulida, Nematoda and Arthropoda.|$|E
25|$|In 1942 Chiang Kai-shek {{insisted that}} at least 7,500 tons per month were needed to keep his field {{divisions}} in operation, but this figure proved <b>unattainable</b> for the first fifteen months of the India-China airlift. The 7,500 total was first exceeded in August 1943, by which time objectives had been increased to 10,000 tons a month. Ultimately monthly requirements surpassed 50,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{a kidney}} {{transplant}} operation runs for around $70,000, liver for $160,000, and heart for $120,000. Although these prices are still <b>unattainable</b> to the poor, {{compared to the}} fees of the United States, where a kidney transplant may demand $100,000, a liver $250,000, and a heart $860,000, Chinese prices have made China a major provider of organs and transplantation surgeries to other countries.|$|E
25|$|Thus far, the {{required}} velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been <b>unattainable</b> by any single rocket because the propellant, tankage, structure, guidance, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass {{that is too}} great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v. Since Single-stage-to-orbit has {{so far not been}} achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the racing}} circuit {{occupied}} much of Short's {{time during the}} late {{spring and early summer}} of 1890. The presence of the Shorts at Saratoga Springs, New York, was reported in the local press. While he had enormous success at racetracks across the country, boxing promotion remained an <b>unattainable</b> goal for Short. He was destined to be remembered for gunfights rather than prize fights.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Stirling {{cycle is}} <b>unattainable</b> {{in the real}} world (as with any heat engine); {{efficiencies}} of 50% have been reached, similar to the maximum figure for Diesel cycle engines. The efficiency of Stirling machines is also linked to the environmental temperature; higher efficiency is obtained when the weather is cooler, thus making this type of engine less interesting in places with warmer climates. As with other external combustion engines, Stirling engines can use heat sources other than from combustion of fuels.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, a quorum of 500 {{members was}} {{required}} to make any changes to the Student Society's bylaws and constitution at the Society's Annual General Meeting (AGM). As the university has approximately 28,000 students, this means that only 2% of student population is needed to make wide reaching changes {{with regards to the}} SFSS. Despite the seemingly low requirement, quorum has been <b>unattainable</b> most years. In 2005, this lead the Society to propose a change to the bylaw for quorum from 500 to 100 which ultimately failed.|$|E
25|$|Cornell was wary of strangers. This led him {{to isolate}} himself and become a self-taught artist. Although he {{expressed}} attraction to <b>unattainable</b> women like Lauren Bacall, his shyness made romantic relationships almost impossible. In later life his bashfulness verged toward reclusiveness, and he rarely left the state of New York. However, he preferred talking with women, and often made their husbands wait {{in the next room}} when he discussed business with them. He also had numerous friendships with ballerinas, who found him unique, but too eccentric to be a romantic partner.|$|E
25|$|In his 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population, the British scholar Thomas Malthus {{incorrectly}} {{predicted that}} continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. Malthus wrote the essay to refute {{what he considered}} the <b>unattainable</b> utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet, as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind. In 1968, Paul R. Ehrlich reprised Malthus' argument in The Population Bomb, predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of natural hair has waxed and waned. In the early 21st century, {{a significant percentage}} of African-American women still straighten their hair with relaxers of some kind (either heat- or chemical-based). This is done despite the fact that prolonged application of such chemicals (or heat) can result in overprocessing, breakage and thinning of the hair. Rooks (1996) argues that hair-care products designed to straighten hair, which have been marketed by white-owned companies in African American publications since the 1830s, represent unrealistic and <b>unattainable</b> standards of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Development was resumed in {{all areas}} of the country, {{including}} the hitherto neglected and largely undeveloped semi-arid or arid north. Many sectors of the economy recovered from total collapse pre-2003. Numerous state corporations that had collapsed during the Moi years were revived and have begun performing profitably. The telecommunications sector boomed. Rebuilding, modernisation and expansion of infrastructure began in earnest, with several ambitious infrastructural and other projects, such as the Thika Superhighway, which would have been seen as <b>unattainable</b> pipe dreams during the bland and largely stagnant Moi years, completed. The country's cities and towns also began being positively renewed and transformed.|$|E
25|$|The Asia Fair Trade Forum aims to {{increase}} the competency of fair trade organizations in Asia {{so they can be}} more competitive in the global market. Garment factories in Asian countries including China, Burma, and Bangladesh consistently receive charges of human rights violations, including the use of child labour. These violations conflict with the principles outlined by fair trade certifiers. In India, Trade Alternative Reform Action (Tara) Projects formed in the 1970s have worked {{to increase}} production capacity, quality standards, and entrance into markets for home-based craftsmen that were previously <b>unattainable</b> due to their lower caste identity.|$|E
25|$|Summary {{statistics}} {{may be used}} {{to increase}} the acceptance rate of ABC for high-dimensional data. Low-dimensional sufficient statistics are optimal for this purpose, as they capture all relevant information present in the data in the simplest possible form. However, low-dimensional sufficient statistics are typically <b>unattainable</b> for statistical models where ABC-based inference is most relevant, and consequently, some heuristic is usually necessary to identify useful low-dimensional summary statistics. The use of a set of poorly chosen summary statistics will often lead to inflated credible intervals due to the implied loss of information, which can also bias the discrimination between models. A review of methods for choosing summary statistics is available, which may provide valuable guidance in practice.|$|E
