40|$|The {{definition}} of a nonequilibrium temperature through generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations relies on {{the independence of the}} fluctuation-dissipation temperature from the observable considered. We argue that this observable independence is deeply related to the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the phase-space probability distribution on the hypersurfaces of constant energy. This property is shown explicitly on three different stochastic models, where observable-dependence of the fluctuation-dissipation temperature arises only when the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the phase-space <b>distribution</b> is broken. The first model is an energy transport model on a ring, with biased local transfer rules. In the second model, defined on a fully connected geometry, energy is exchanged with two heat baths at different temperatures, breaking the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the phase-space <b>distribution.</b> Finally, in the last model, the system is connected to a zero temperature reservoir, and preserves the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the phase-space <b>distribution</b> in the relaxation regime, leading to an observable-independent temperature.

For effective vaccination, the coccidial oocysts must be uniformly suspended before exposure to birds.

Both the appearance and colony counts of chicken gut flora from the gel were uniform.

The irrigation and fertigation are determined by two methods the KELLER & KARMELI and DENÍCULI. The two experiments were subjected to varying pressures: 12, 14, 16 and 18 kPa, in a completely randomized design of twenty samples composed of flows with three replications. Urea, potassium chloride (KCl) and ammonium phosphate (MAP) were the elements used for fertigation. The system consisted of a 200 L tank, which supplied another container of 30 L, it was moved vertically to control the pressure. The data was statistically compared between treatments for each methodology. In fertigation the best pressure was 16 kPa and was classified as "excellent" for UDC (91. 03 %) and "marginal" for C. V.
