The coals were unloaded from the boats in the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> into the wagons, run down the {{inclined plane}}, and again loaded into boats in the lower reach, which was a tedious operation, and hurtful to the coals.|$|E
25|$|Ashford has one river, the River Ash, {{one of the}} six {{distributaries}} of the River Colne, Hertfordshire {{which runs}} in line with the Staines bypass under the Fordbridge roundabout {{at the far end of}} Fordbridge Road, its <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> being the traditional border with Staines and then entering Laleham, passing close to the other side of the Queen Mary Reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Headwaters rise on {{the west}} facing slopes of the inner coast {{southern}} Mayacamas Mountains, where the highest peaks are Hood Mountain, elevation 2750feet (833m) and Bald Mountain, elevation 2729feet (826 m), {{each of which has}} views of the Pacific Ocean and the Sierra Nevada range. The headwaters cut through gorge and meadow of Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, which boasts 25miles (40kilometers) of self-guided trails and the Robert Ferguson Observatory. There is also a 25foot (eight meter) high waterfall, present only when fed by the winter rains but can persist until late May for high rainfall years such as 2006. In the 100 foot (30m) deep gorge into which the waterfall spills is a moist mixed forest habitat including California bay laurel, coast redwood, Douglas fir, big leaf maple, cherry holly, coffeeberry, and even tanbark oak. The understory features abundant ferns and boulder laden mosses. A prominent landform in this <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> created by Sonoma Creek is Adobe Canyon. Locally part of this <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> flow is sometimes called Adobe Creek. Tributaries near the headwaters include Mount Hood Creek and Graywood Creek.|$|E

25|$|The {{source of}} the Carbon River is the Carbon Glacier {{on the north side}} of Mount Rainier in the Cascade Range. The river's <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> is {{contained}} within Mount Rainier National Park. Some of the river's headwater tributary streams include Cataract Creek and Spukwush Creek. The Carbon River quickly enters a broad glacial valley in which it deposits thick layers of glacial sediment. This causes the river to meander and become braided.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} [...] of Darby Creek is navigable by canoe. The {{difficulty}} {{rating of the}} creek ranges from A to 2-. Edward Gertler's book Keystone Canoeing describes the scenery as being [...] "poor to fair" [...] in its <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> and [...] "poor to [...] "good in its lower reach". However, it is only canoeable within a single day of heavy rain in from river mile 18 to river mile 7.2. It is canoeable {{at any time in}} its lower 7.2 miles.|$|E
500|$|After Portland was {{incorporated}} in 1851, quickly growing into Oregon's largest city, Oregon City gradually lost its importance {{as the economic}} and political center of the Willamette Valley. Beginning in the 1850s, steamboats began to ply the Willamette, {{despite the fact that they}} could not pass Willamette Falls. As a result, navigation on the Willamette River was divided into two stretches: the [...] lower stretch from Portland to Oregon City—which allowed connection with the rest of the Columbia River system—and the <b>upper</b> <b>reach,</b> which encompassed most of the Willamette's length. Any boats whose owners found it absolutely necessary to get past the falls had to be portaged. This led to competition for business among steam portage companies. In 1873, the construction of the Willamette Falls Locks bypassed the falls and allowed easy navigation between the upper and lower river. Each lock chamber measured [...] long and [...] wide, and the canal was originally operated manually before it switched to electrical power. Today, the lock system is little used.|$|E

2500|$|Sun Creek is a {{tributary}} of Annie Creek. [...] Its source is also inside the boundary of Crater Lake National Park where it supports a population of bull trout. After leaving the park, it flows {{through the middle of}} Sun Pass State Forest for three miles (5km). [...] It flows into Annie Creek about one mile (1.6km) beyond the forest border. [...] Once it leaves the forest, Sun Creek is tapped for agricultural irrigation; however, the Department of Forestry protects the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> with a “Protective Conservancy — Critical Wildlife Habitat” land use classification.|$|E

2500|$|As {{recently}} as the Miocene period, twelve million years ago, the entire watershed of Piner Creek {{was on the floor}} of the Pacific Ocean. [...] After significant volcanic uplift and tectonic movement, the headwaters region of the Mayacmas Mountains emerged above the ocean. [...] Piner Creek was one of the drainages that began to drain the new landmass, in formation of the eventual Santa Rosa Plain, through which the middle and lower reaches of Piner Creek flow. [...] Occasional basaltic outcrops are seen in the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> of Piner Creek, betraying the volcanic origin of the Mayacmas Mountains.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{quality of}} Piner Creek is {{characterized}} by pH levels that are mildly basic, with <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> pH levels about 8.5, declining to lower reach levels at 7.8 just above the discharge to Santa Rosa Creek. [...] It {{is interesting to note}} that the headwaters soils are typically of pH about 6.9. [...] Water quality of Piner Creek is generally low in turbidity, except for highest flow periods resulting from heavy rains; [...] the water is free from odor. [...] Springtime water temperatures are typically in the range of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 18 degrees Celsius).|$|E
2500|$|In October 1901 Captain Armstrong {{bought out}} the {{minority}} interest that Captain James D. Miller (1830-1914) had held in North Star.

[...] With steamboat {{business on the}} upper Kootenay essentially nonexistent, in 1902, Armstrong decided to bring North Star through the Baillie-Grohman Canal at Canal Flats, BC to the <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> of the Columbia River that began at Columbia Lake {{and ran down the}} Columbia Valley to Golden, BC. [...] North Star left Fort Steele on June 4, 1902. North Star was the last steamboat to depart that community, which was in rapid decline because of being bypassed by recent railway construction.|$|E
