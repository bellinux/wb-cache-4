40|$|This paper {{provides}} evidence {{based on}} French macroeconomic data, that shocks {{on the cost}} of oil inputs are transmitted asymmetrically to the prices of fuel. We use an error correction model to estimate the dynamics of the transmission of the cost of crude oil expressed in French currency, to the production and before taxes retail prices of several kinds of fuel. We simulate the responses of the production and retail prices to positive as well as negative shocks affecting the cost of crude oil for three kinds of fuel: premium, diesel oil and domestic fuel oil. We also test for the presence of asymmetries in the transmission of crude oil to retail prices for two kinds of <b>unleaded</b> <b>premium.</b> The results for all five products robustly point to the existence of an asymmetry in the overall transmission of positive and negative cost shocks to prices, in the sense that crude oil cost increases are added to retail fuel prices faster than decreases are substracted. In the case of diesel oil, the asymmetry turns out to be significant at the production as well as the distribution stages. For domestic fuel oil, however, only firststage (production) asymmetries are significant, whereas for premium only secondstage (distribution) asymmetries may be robustly pointed out. Finally, measured asymmetry lengths range from one month to one quarter. prices, oil, asymmetry, error correction models, bootstrap...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of fossil}} fuels for {{transportation}} purposes has increased significantly over the last 60 years, and the environmental effects of the use {{of fossil fuels}} have become a matter of concern in recent years. This has lead {{to the development of a}} number of fuels which are intended to reduce the environmental impact of the ever-growing use of motor vehicles. There are a number of views on the advantages and disadvantages of these fuels, such as dispute as to the life-cycle emissions and the impact on performance. It is the aim of this paper to present independent findings into the performance and emissions pros and cons for some alternative fuels, Regular <b>Unleaded</b> (91 octane), <b>Premium</b> <b>Unleaded</b> (95 octane) and <b>Premium</b> <b>Unleaded,</b> Ultimate (98 octane). In a full scale laboratory testing undertaken at Central Queensland University, it is found that <b>Premium</b> <b>Unleaded</b> and the Ultimate offer better power and torque efficiency with a grater [sic] percentage of specific fuel consumption compared to regular unleaded petrol.

However sales have waned {{from a high of}} 56,225 units sold in North America in 2006 to less than 15,000 units by 2010 partly from the increased competition in the mid-size SUV segment and poor fuel economy amidst rising gasoline prices and environmental concerns.

50|$|The {{need for}} more power comes from {{necessity}} and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 horse power) Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on <b>premium</b> <b>unleaded</b> gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives.

5000|$|Tax on {{petroleum}} productsThe taxe intérieure de consommation sur les produits énergétiques (TICPE) {{applies to}} petroleum products and biofuels according to fixed rates {{provided by the}} legislation. It applies only in metropolitan France - in the overseas territories, {{there is a special}} consumption tax (TSC) on <b>premium</b> <b>unleaded</b> and diesel.

In the face of the rise in oil prices, a reduction in the rate of the TIPP for fuel sold to consumers was adopted by the Parliament in 2006. The TIPP is collected by the services de la direction générale des douanes et des droits indirects (DGDDI) when fuel products are consumed on the domestic market. The revenue from the TICPE amounted to €13.7 bn in 2013. Energy products are subject to both the tax on energy products (TICPE) and the value added tax (VAT).

5000|$|The first {{generation}} {{was designed by}} Mitsubishi Motors, who had their own version called the Proudia. It was jointly manufactured by both companies. The first-generation model was introduced in 1999 as a front-wheel-drive car measuring 5.1 m long and 1.9 m wide. A long-wheelbase limousine model was available exclusively for the Korean domestic market, and at ₩92,510,000 South Korean won for the 2008 model with a V8 and no options, was the most expensive model in the company's lineup. The first-generation Equus extended-length limousine was also mechanically related to the Mitsubishi Dignity limousine for the Japanese market. The first-generation Equus were sold in South Korea, China, and the Middle East. A very limited number, badged as the Centennial, were made available for some western European markets in the early and mid-2000s. At first, there were two engine types: a 3.5 Sigma V6 and 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine. After a few months, the 3.0 Sigma V6 engine type was added. Two versions were available: a sedan (3.0, 3.5 and 4.5) and a limousine (3.5 and 4.5). In Japan, {{under the name of}} Mitsubishi Dignity (limousine version) and Mitsubishi Proudia (sedan version), about 2,000 units were sold. Specifically, the 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine was a GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection) type engine, which was designed and developed by Mitsubishi Motors. This engine was optimized for <b>premium</b> <b>unleaded</b> gasoline fuel, but there was little opportunity to get this type of fuel in Korea at that time. So, most of these engines used normal unleaded gasoline fuel and then had significant performance issues, resulting in complaints from drivers. Finally, Hyundai Motors modified this engine from a GDI Type to a MPI (Multi Point Injection) type to solve the issue. It added curtain airbags in 2001 and active head restraints in 2002.|$|R
