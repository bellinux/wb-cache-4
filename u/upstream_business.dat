40|$|This master thesis explores {{purchasing}} synergies, {{the creation}} of competitive advantage in purchasing. More specifically, it seeks to explain {{the existence of such}} synergies and their corresponding synergy potentials, through the answering of four research questions: (1) what purchasing synergy is and why it is important; (2) what framework may best be suited to identify and realize purchasing synergies; (3) which of and why purchasing synergies are realized or unrealized in the <b>upstream</b> <b>businesses</b> of A/S Norske Shell, and managerial implications; and (4) to what extent theory and practice correspond, and the implications for further research. The objective of the thesis is to confront theory with the empirical world. This is done by way of a qualitative and deductive research strategy, along with an analytical-conceptual research design. The thesis starts off by building logical relationships through correlation of existing literature. An empirical study is then conducted using a single, holistic case study, in which the purpose is to explain how and why theoretical phenomena occur. Based on prior research from literature on purchasing and strategic management, the thesis defines purchasing synergy as an increase in purchasing performance realized in one of three forms: economies of scale, economies of information and learning, and economies of process. It further argues that realization of a purchasing synergy occurs when two or more business units, or relationships within one business unit, join their forces and/or share functional resources, information and knowledge. Purchasing synergies are realized through purchasing synergy management, meaning the use of approaches, processes and organizational changes to identify and realize potentials for the three forms of purchasing synergy in activities and relationships between and within business units. By reinventing the Strategic Supply Wheel by Cousins et al. (2008), a framework is developed, named the Purchasing Synergy Management Wheel. This new conceptual framework has been developed for the thesis by correlating the existing model against literature on purchasing synergy (management) and other related fields. The framework is subsequently deployed on a case company, the <b>upstream</b> <b>businesses</b> of A/S Norske Shell, in order to diagnose the company's current purchasing situation. The resulting analysis reveals that all three forms of purchasing synergies, in both their realized and unrealized forms, may be explained using the individual perspectives of the different wheel elements. However, a complete understanding of the inherent complexities of why certain purchasing synergies exist or remain unrealized is possible only if the links between the elements are taken into account. Managerial recommendations are given to overcome the challenges identified in the analysis. The thesis finds that theory and practice correspond to a considerable extent, and that central aspects of related literature and the framework of analysis are supported by the findings of the analysis. It concludes with a set of implications for further research. The thesis recommends a continued focus on and study of all three forms of purchasing synergy, and a further development of the Purchasing Synergy Management Wheel. </p...|$|R

In 1989 AOG embarked on an ambitious expansion programme with the aim of becoming a vertically integrated oil company focused on the African continent. This {{led to the creation of}} Addax Petroleum in 1994 by Marc Lorenceau, a partner from the AOG trading group. Addax's initial steps in the <b>upstream</b> <b>business</b> was the acquisition of the Espoir field offshore Ivory Coast that had been relinquished by Phillips in 1988. Four years later, Addax Petroleum sold its remaining equity in the Espoir field to CNR (Canadian Natural Resources). In 1998, as oil prices were dropping, Ashland Oil Nigeria was for sale as the company wanted to leave the country's upstream sector. Perenco appeared to be the best bidder for Ashland's assets. However, the bidding process was overturned and these assets were eventually awarded to Addax Petroleum for the official amount of twenty million US dollars.

40|$|This {{empirical}} paper {{sheds light}} on a significant element of the debate of whether infrastructure services have a strong impact on economic development by exploring the impact of innovative road freight services on downstream business users. The paper uses a new and purpose-specific survey of 165 logistics service providers and 493 user enterprises in food processing, food distribution, and the automotive industry in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. The main findings are that there are substantial downstream benefits from innovations in road freight services, both dampening cost increases and raising sales revenues of business users. The additional finding that increased intensity of competition in road freight services is significantly associated with the provision of innovative services suggests that easing any remaining barriers to competition in <b>upstream</b> <b>business</b> sectors should be a priority.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to clarify the <b>upstream</b> <b>business,</b> namely {{exploration}} and production of crude oil and natural gas, executed by Exxon Mobil Corporation in new areas since the early 1990 s. The main conclusions are the following: (1) The company has included three of the toughest areas in its production spheres: the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in the United Sates, the former Soviet Union, and the deepwater areas of West Africa. (2) The development and application of leading-edge technologies, such as three dimensional seismic prospecting and subsea completion wells, have enabled the company to discover and to produce oil and gas in both deepwater areas. (3) In the former Soviet Union, the company has recovered oil and gas which the Union had already discovered before the company started its operation there. The company has succeeded in reducing the investment risk of discovering oil and gas in unexplored fields. (4) The acquisition of Mobil Corporation finished in the late 1999, known as Exxon Mobil Merger, has helped Exxon Corporation, now Exxon Mobil Corporation, to obtain the dominant position in the West Africa fields and to make itself {{one of the major}} foreign oil companies in the former Soviet Union...|$|E
