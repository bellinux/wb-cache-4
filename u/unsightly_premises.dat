50|$|The <b>Unsightly</b> <b>Premises</b> Act {{establishes}} guidelines {{surrounding the}} up keep of property. It prohibits individuals from allowing their property to overcome by garbage and appear unsightly {{to the general}} public. It outlines how the property owner should be notified the approved methods for enforcing the Act.|$|E
50|$|The legal {{dilemma for}} the York Street Railway Station {{has left the}} station {{building}} to deteriorate further {{and led to the}} creation of a lobby group named Fredericton Friends of the Railway Inc. which is attempting to coordinate public and private sector support for restoring the structure. A public lobby in local newspapers has been ongoing for several years, however municipal authorities claim to have no ability to enforce <b>unsightly</b> <b>premises</b> legislation on the station, since it is governed under federal railways legislation (despite the railway station now being physically cut off from any potential restoration of rail service as a result of the Sobeys development to the east).|$|E
5000|$|The Smurfit-Stone {{paper mill}} (formerly {{part of the}} Power Corporation of Canada empire) ceased {{operations}} in 2009, and the plant is in process of being demolished. The 225ac of industrial wasteland was sold on in January 2010 to the Green Investment Group partners. Their {{goal is to create}} innovative, alternative energy projects that enhance the Bathurst region and Northern New Brunswick. The plan anticipates attracting companies that utilize technologies focusing on energy generation, alternative fuels and waste-to-energy conversion. The property was as of July 2015 in violation of the city's dangerous and <b>unsightly</b> <b>premises</b> bylaw, but the owner is located outside the country, and was unwilling to deal with the property despite being given final notice by the city. [...] There were almost $1 million in back taxes and environmental reclamation costs associated with the former mill site as of July 2015. The provincial Department of Environment and Local Government Minister, Brian Kenny, issued a ministerial order, which required the company to clean up the site within 120 days, but the deadline passed on 14 August, so the file was passed on to the Attorney-General in order to determine whether charges would be laid.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the changes}} {{mentioned}} above have created a class of employees, who previously just handled one task or assignment, such as animal control, who are now engaged {{in a variety of}} quasi-police activities, especially enforcement roles that for lack of staffing are not handled by police officers. Although some work conducted by bylaw enforcement officers can be very minor in gravity, such as issuing tickets for expired meters, the investigation and enforcement duties conducted by bylaw officers are extremely important and necessary for the well-being of society. Dog attacks, for example, can be very serious events, where people or other animals can be gravely hurt. In most jurisdictions with bylaw officers, investigation work concerning dog attacks is conducted solely by the bylaw officers, without any police involvement. Such work can prevent future attacks, protect society from harm and/or cause an animal to be euthanized and its owners to face severe fines. Bylaw Enforcement Officers care for and protect animals, help mediate neighbourhood disputes, assure public safety by investigating illegal garbage/waste dumping and enforce regulations, the absence of which can severely impact a person's well-being, such as late-night noise from frequent parties that prevents a neighbourhood from sleeping. Bylaw enforcement officers are {{the first line of defense}} against a physical degradation of a neighbourhood or area, which can start with a broken window, lead to <b>unsightly</b> <b>premises,</b> and soon be littered with garbage, illegal signs, uninsured vehicles and lower real estate values. Bylaw enforcement is instrumental in preserving well-functioning neighbourhoods and fixing problematic ones.|$|E
