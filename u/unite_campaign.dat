The campaign was established to raise awareness and fight gender based violence inflicted on women and girls. The color orange is essential to the campaign, reflecting the optimism and hopeful attitude for a world without violence for women and girls; participants in Sister Namibia wear orange on the 25th day of each month as well as on International Day, November 25 of each calendar year. Sister Namibia acts in solidarity with the U.N., along with other governments, NGOs, and private corporations to engage with celebrities, athletes, and others with powerful voices in communities across the globe. Sister Namibia promotes the goals of the Orange Day Campaign by connecting women with legal resources to fight violence.|$|E
50|$|UNICEF {{launched}} the Blue Teddy campaign at the Sub-Regional Meeting for Follow-up to the UN Study on Violence Against Children in the Caribbean in Kingston, Jamaica, in May 2012, {{and at the}} Sub-Regional Conference on Child Sexual Abuse to Advance the <b>UNiTE</b> <b>Campaign</b> in November 2012, in Barbados. The Break the Silence Initiative is a multi-pronged approach to protect children against sexual abuse. On the one hand it aims to reach {{victims and their families}} with a message to speak out and denounce, to break the stigma and shame that surrounds this issue as a first step to seek help. At the same time, the initiative is an advocacy platform directed at policy makers, health workers and police authorities to create the protection and treatment services needed to support and care for the victims available. First launched in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010 by the Institute for Gender and Development Studies at the University of West Indies, the Break the Silence Initiative will be rolled-out by UNICEF and partners in several countries and territories across the region. For more information on the Break the Silence Initiative, please visit the UNICEF website.|$|E
50|$|Recommendation 117Experts further {{recommend}} that UN agencies mirror what is recognised as good practice for Governments above, and adopt a coordinated, interagency approach to prevent (and respond to) {{violence against women}} and girls, {{with support from the}} highest political level (i.e. the Secretary General). As part of the Global Implementation Plan, UN agencies should develop a system-wide workplan building on related system-wide initiatives (e.g. the Secretary Generals’ <b>UNiTE</b> <b>Campaign)</b> and through existing coordination mechanisms, to support and promote national implementation of, monitor progress against, and advance the international normative framework. Regional institutions should similarly develop and implement coordinated workplans to support Member States implement regional normative frameworks for prevention of violence against women and girls, monitor progress against these frameworks, and advance the frameworks themselves. Such workplans might include strategies to:Expand normative interpretations and understandings of prevention activity - beyond awareness-raising, education and sensitisation of the media - to make linkages with and encompass positive obligations on States to promote gender equality and change social norms contributing to gender stereotyping, discrimination and violence against women and girls, across all levels, jurisdictions, sectors and settings.Provide policy guidance, technical advice and knowledge management to support States develop, implement and monitor holistic, systemic and sustained approaches to prevention.Ensure coordinated and sustained national and regional programming for prevention across different agencies and funding streams, and in different settings, such as conflict-affected contexts, natural disasters, low, middle and high-income countries (e.g. through UNDAFs, humanitarian funding streams, and in cooperation with regional bodies).Ensure outcomes and targets for prevention of violence against women and girls are a key component of the post-2015 development agenda.|$|E
