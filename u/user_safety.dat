25|$|A {{report by}} TfL in early 2007 {{indicated}} that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 before {{the introduction of the}} congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km, or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road <b>user</b> <b>safety</b> schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works {{in the latter half of}} 2006. Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.|$|E

40|$|Starting from {{previous}} studies {{carried out by the}} same Authors, this research is focused on the definition of the optimal mix design of a road pavement made of new draining porous concrete. An accurate experimental investigation performed on different real-scale laying allowed the Authors to assess a series of structural and superficial characteristics of the road pavement above mentioned, so as to appreciate all its positive aspects, the perfectible ones being, in any case, highlighted. In particular, apart from dealing with the mechanical strength of the structural elements against the passage of heavy vehicles and from assessing such parameters as superficial texture, permeability and porosity, the measurements were concentrated on the behavior of the elements themselves in case of very severe winter environmental conditions, with a special interest for freeze and thaw cycles {{as well as for the}} use of de-icing salts. Furthermore, a special care was dedicated to the analysis of noise emissions connected with these new pavements, the measurements being taken by means of appropriate apparatus. In addition, the research assessed the advantages from the standpoint of <b>users</b> <b>safety</b> belonging to the utilization of this structural elements: not only the spray, splash, aquaplaning and light reflection phenomena are dramatically reduced, but a significant decrease in the braking distance is observed for both dray and wet conditions. Therefore, thanks to these remarks, the Authors believe that this innovative road pavements, if the perfectible aspects were faced, could be regularly used with positive implications for both <b>users</b> <b>safety</b> and environment protection...|$|R
