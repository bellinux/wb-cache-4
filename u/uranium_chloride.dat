5000|$|In 1804 the German chemist Adolph Ferdinand Gehlen (1775-1815) {{had noticed}} that when a {{solution}} of <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride</b> in ether was exposed to sunlight, it quickly changed color (from bright yellow to green) and precipitated. [...] In the 1850s, Niépce de Saint-Victor was trying to develop color photography, using light-sensitive metal salts. Beginning in 1857, long before Henri Becquerel's famous serendipitous discovery of radioactivity in 1896, Niépce de Saint-Victor observed that, even in complete darkness, certain salts could expose photographic emulsions. [...] He soon realized that uranium salts were responsible for this anomalous phenomenon. [...] Niépce recognized that the “light” that was exposing his photographic plates was neither conventional phosphorescence nor fluorescence: the salts could expose photographic plates long after the salts had last been exposed to sunlight. Niépce's superior, Michel Eugène Chevreul, recognized the phenomenon as a fundamental discovery ("une découverte capitale"), pointing out that uranium salts retained their power to expose photographic plates even after six months in the dark ("encore actif six mois après son insolation"). [...] By 1861, Niépce stated frankly that uranium salts emitted some sort of radiation that was invisible to the human eye: Original : [...] " [...] … cette activité persistante … ne peut mème pas être de la phosphorescence, car elle ne durerait pas si longtemps, d'après les expériences de M. Edmond Becquerel; il est donc plus probable que c'est un rayonnement invisible à nos yeux, comme le croit M. Léon Foucault, … [...]" [...] Translation : [...] " [...] … this persistent activity … cannot be due to phosphorescence, for it phosphorescence would not last so long, according to the experiments of Mr. Edmond Becquerel; it is thus more likely {{that it is a}} radiation that is invisible to our eyes, as Mr. Léon Foucault believes, … [...]" [...] Note especially that Niépce mentions [...] "Edmond Becquerel", the father of Henri Becquerel, who would later be credited with the discovery of radioactivity. Indeed, in 1868, Edmond Becquerel published a book, La lumière: ses causes et ses effets (Light: its causes and its effects), in which he mentioned Niépce's findings; specifically, that objects that were coated with uranium nitrate could expose photographic plates in the dark.|$|E

40|$|The electrorefiner (ER) is {{the heart}} of pyroprocessing {{technology}} operating at a high-temperature (723 K – 773 K) to separate uranium from Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) used metallic fuel. One of the most common electroanalytical methods for determining the thermodynamic and electrochemical behavior of elemental species in the eutectic molten salt LiCl-KCl inside ER is cyclic voltammetry (CV). Information from CV can possibly be used to estimate diffusion coefficients, apparent standard potentials, transfer coefficients, and numbers of electron transferred. Therefore, predicting the trace of each species from the CV method in an absence of experimental data is important for safeguarding this technology. This work focused on the development an interactive computational design for the CV method by analyzing available <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride</b> data sets (1 to 10 wt%) in a LiCl-KCl molten salt at 773 K under different scan rates to help elucidating, improving, and providing robustness in detection analysis. A principle method and a computational code have been developed by using electrochemical fundamentals and coupling various variables such as: the diffusion coefficients, formal potentials, and process time duration. Although this developed computational model works moderately well with reported uranium data sets, it experiences difficulty in tracing zirconium data sets due to their complex CV structures. Therefore, an artificial neural intelligent (ANI) data analysis has been proposed to resolve this issue and to provide comparative study to the precursor computational modeling development. For this purpose, ANI has been applied on 0. 5 to 5 wt% of zirconium chloride in LiCl-KCl eutectic molten salt at 773 K under different scan rates to mimic the system and provide current and potential simulated data sets for the unseen data. In addition, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) through the commercial software Matlab was created to provide a controllable environment for different users. The computational code shows a limitation in high concentration CV prediction, capturing the adsorption peaks, and provides a dissimilarity. However, the model is able to capture the important anodic and cathodic peaks of <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride</b> CV which is the main focus of this study. Furthermore, the developed code is able to calculate the concentration of each species as a function of time. Due to the complexity of the CV of zirconium chloride, the computational model is used to predict the probability reactions occurring at each peak. The resulting study reveals that the reaction at the highest anodic peak is related to the combination of 70 % Zr/Zr+ 4 and 30 % Zr/Zr+ 2 for the 1. 07 wt% and 2. 49 wt% zirconium chloride and 30 % Zr/Zr+ 4 and 70 % Zr/Zr+ 2 combination for 4. 98 wt% ZrCl 4. The proposed alternative ANI method has demonstrated its capability in predicting the trend of species in a new situation with a high accuracy on predictions without any dissimilarity. Two final structures from zirconium chloride study which high accuracy (that is, a low error) are related to [9, 15, 10]- 18 and [10, 11, 25]- 19. These two final structures have been applied on <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride</b> salt experimental data sets to further validate the ANI’s ability and concept. Three different fixed data combinations were considered. The result indicates that by increasing the number of training data sets it does not necessarily help improving the prediction process. ANI implementation outcome on <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride</b> data set illustrates a good prediction with a specific fixed data combination and [9, 15, 10]- 18 structure. Thus, it can be concluded that ANI is a promising method for safeguarding pyroprocessing technology due to its robustness in predicting the CV plots with high accuracy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} operational and criticality safety experience {{associated with}} the Idaho National Laboratory Fuel Conditioning Facility which uses a pyrometallurgical process to treat spent fast reactor metallic fuel. The process is conducted in an inert atmosphere hot cell. The process starts with chopping metallic fuel elements into a basket. The basket is lowered into molten salt (LiCl-KCl) along with a steel mandrel. Active metal fission products, transuranic metals and sodium metal in the spent fuel undergo chemical oxidation and form chlorides. Voltage is applied between the basket, {{which serves as a}}n anode, and the mandrel, which serves as a cathode, causing metallic uranium in the spent fuel to undergo electro-chemical oxidation thereby forming <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Simultaneously at the cathode, <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride</b> undergoes electro-chemical reduction and deposits uranium metal onto the mandrel. The uranium metal and accompanying entrained salt are placed in a distillation furnace where the uranium melts forming an ingot and the entrained salt boils and subsequently condenses in a separate crucible. The uranium ingots are placed in long term storage. During the ten year operating history, over one hundred criticality safety evaluations were prepared. All criticality safety related limits and controls for the entire process are contained in a single document which required over thirty revisions to accommodate the process changes. Operational implementation of the limits and controls includes use of a near real-time computerized tracking system. The tracking system uses an Oracle database coupled with numerous software applications. The computerized tracking system includes direct fuel handler interaction with every movement of material. Improvements to this system during the ten year history include introduction of web based operator interaction, tracking of moderator materials {{and the development of a}} plethora database queries to assist in day to day operations as well as obtaining historical information. Over 12, 000 driver fuel elements have been processed resulting in the production of 2500 kg of 20 % enriched uranium. Also, over one thousand blanket fuel elements have been processed resulting in the production of 2400 kg of depleted uranium. These operations required over 35, 000 fissile material transfers between zones and over 6000 transfers between containers. Throughout all of these movements, no mass limit violations occurred. Numerous lessons were learned over the ten year operating history. From a criticality safety perspective, the most important lesson learned was the involvement of a criticality safety practitioner in daily operations. A criticality safety engineer was assigned directly to facility operations, and was responsible for implementation of limits and controls including upkeep of the associated computerized tracking files. The criticality safety engineer was also responsible for conducting fuel handler training activities including serving on fuel handler qualification oral boards, and continually assessing operations from a criticality control perspective. The criticality safety engineer also attended bimonthly project planning meetings to identify upcoming process changes that would require criticality safety evaluation.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to the handling of metallic nuclear fuel, which can offer a safe and more secure fuel cycle. To ensure this, it is essential to gain a thorough understanding of the related fundamental processes to scientifically assess the safety aspects. To this aim, a pyrochemical process for the recycling of actinides is being investigated in ITU. It is consisting of anodic dissolution of all actinides to a molten salt bath and electrochemical reduction on solid aluminium cathodes forming actinide-aluminium alloys. For the recovery of the Actinides a chlorination route is proposed consisting of the distillation of the adhered salt, the chlorination of the actinide-aluminium alloys by HCl(g) or Cl 2 (g) and possibly the sublimation of remaining AlCl 3. In this work the chlorination step was studied by chlorinating UAl 3 alloys using HCl(g) under conditions providing a complete chlorination without volatilisation of uranium as UCl 4 (g), UCl 5 (g) or UCl 6 (g). The optimal reaction conditions were initially evaluated by thermodynamic calculations for various chlorination temperatures and HCl/UAl 3 molar ratios using the software HSC-Chemistry 6. 0. The calculations showed that to ensure no volatilisation of <b>uranium</b> <b>chloride</b> species, the temperature range to be tested experimentally has to be limited to around 300 - 400 °C. The experiments were realised out in a glove box kept under nitrogen atmosphere. The box is equipped with an Argon / HCl-gas line and a vertical oven in which a quartz reactor with a volume of 1 liter could be placed. Experiments were carried out at temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 °C using approximately 300 mg starting material, resulting in a constant HCl/UAl 3 molar ratio of 25 / 1.

The speciation of U(VI) in chloride aqueous solutions is studied here along the vapor saturation curve using Raman spectroscopy. Chemical composition of solutions is the following: UO 2 Cl 2 (0. 01 M), HCl (0. 1 M), and LiCl concentrations (0. 3 up to 12 M). These solutions have been loaded in silica glass capillary and heated from 21 degrees C up to 350 degrees C at saturated vapor pressure. Raman spectra show an evolution of the band profile of the symmetric stretching (nu(1)) of UO 22 + with increasing temperature and chlorinity. This band profile evolution results from the variation of the contribution of each chloride complex UO 2 Cln 2 -n (n = 0 to 5) and an unidentified complex at 841 cm(- 1) which could be a polyuranyl chloride complex.
