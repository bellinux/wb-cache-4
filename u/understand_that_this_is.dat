2500|$|In {{certain parts}} of Latin America, the usage of negro to {{directly}} address black people can be colloquial. It is important to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not similar {{to the use of}} the word nigga in English in urban hip hop subculture in the United States, given that [...] "negro" [...] is not a racist term. For example, one might say to a friend, [...] " [...] (literally 'Hey, black-one, how are you doing?'). In such a case, the diminutive [...] can also be used, as a term of endearment meaning 'pal'/'buddy'/'friend'. [...] has thus also come to be used to refer to a person of any ethnicity or color, and also can have a sentimental or romantic connotation similar to 'sweetheart' or 'dear' in English. (However, in the Philippines negrito was used for a local dark-skinned, short population native to Luzon and the Visayas islands among other places; this is the meaning of Negrito in English.) In other Spanish-speaking South American countries, the word [...] can also be employed in a roughly equivalent term-of-endearment form, though it is not usually considered to be as widespread as in Argentina or Uruguay (except perhaps in a limited regional and/or social context). [...] It is consequently occasionally encountered, due to the influence of nigga, in Chicano English in the United States.|$|E
