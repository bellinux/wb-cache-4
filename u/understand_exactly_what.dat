The Rebbe would read the blank page and <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the person wanted.|$|E
500|$|Other {{analysts were}} troubled that the {{decision}} would leave [...] "a murky landscape for law enforcement". John Charles Thomas, representing the National District Attorneys Association, concluded [...] "The pressure is basically {{to err on the}} side of caution, to give the Miranda warning almost every time." [...] Professor Stephen Saltzburg of George Washington University agreed that the ruling would pressure police to adopt a strategy of [...] "When in doubt, give Miranda warnings", but also opined that it would make little practical difference to young people facing police questioning. [...] "The reality is that even with Miranda warnings, it's doubtful that young people <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it all means and understand their choices, and so in the long run, I doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this opinion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Based on his {{writings}} {{it is supposed}} Somananda attained the highest spiritual realization. From such a position of deep understanding and insight he compiled his texts based on logic. He had minute attention for detail and a great capacity to express in clear terms even the most difficult points. When debating opposing views, he makes [...] an effort to <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> they are and present them in his work, then refute them by subtle logic.|$|E

60|$|Laura fancied she <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he meant. Most {{of her own}} {{male friends}} in England were {{accustomed}} to both horses and guns, and this man certainly did not bear the unmistakable stamp that was upon his nephew.|$|R
60|$|But, as you know, Jumper wasn't there then. Shadow ran in {{a circle}} and {{presently}} he found where Jumper had landed on the snow {{at the end of that}} first bound. Shadow snarled. He <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's simple enough. I <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you mean. Well, if ever {{it becomes}} less difficult, {{remember}} that I should {{always like to}} know. It seemed a little--personal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try the easy-chair, Sir Richard," [...] Ruff continued, pleasantly. [...] "Leave {{your hat}} and cane {{on the table}} there, and make {{yourself}} comfortable. I should like to <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you have come to me for." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was at a}} loss to <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she meant, nor did I try very hard, for {{the look}} of pain was gone from her face, and I wanted to repeat the good news to Paul.|$|E

30|$|Especially {{for large}} companies, this {{top-down}} approach to agility {{has affected the}} actual transition to agile, which should be rooted on establishing the core agile values and principles. This can be noticed in the statement, “Not everyone <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it was, thus, after a while, many people were doing it just because {{they were told to}} do it”.|$|R
60|$|Laura said nothing, {{though she}} <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he meant. She was {{becoming}} more sure that she liked the man, but {{she realized that she}} might not have done so had she met him before she came out to Canada, where she had learned to recognize the essential points in character. There were certainly respects in which his manner would once have jarred upon her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Annerly, [...] "I saw Q as plainly {{as if he}} were {{standing}} here. But perhaps I had better tell you something of my past relationship with Q, and you will <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the present situation is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sunset Boulevard was {{the last}} {{collaboration}} between Wilder and Brackett. They parted amicably and respected their long-term partnership by not airing any grievance publicly. Their mutual respect and courteous integrity remained in force {{throughout the rest of}} their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter/director Garson Kanin that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened or why. He described it as [...] "an unexpected blow" [...] from which he never recovered fully. When asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth {{never learned}} what {{grievance}} against Waynefleet or his daughter had prompted this virulence, {{nor did it}} appear to matter. There was just sufficient foundation for the man's insinuation to render it perilous if it was once permitted to pass unchallenged, and Nasmyth realized that any attempt to handle the affair delicately was {{not likely to be}} successful. He was afterwards greatly astonished that he could think clearly and impose a certain command upon himself; but he <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it was most advisable for him to do, and he set about it with a curious cold quietness which served his purpose well.|$|R
5000|$|Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania {{to produce}} Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, {{following}} {{the success of}} Girls Aloud's debut album Sound of the Underground. Xenomania produced {{all four of the}} album's singles. [...] "When the second album came round, the label said, 'Listen, we're {{not going to do this}} group any more if you don't do it.'" [...] Higgins explained. [...] "I think my initial reaction was to do a few tracks and he said, 'No, you have to do this because I think you're the only person who <b>understands</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it is'. So, that's how we took it on." ...|$|R
60|$|As she read, {{her eyes}} were cast down on the pages which she held in her hand; but {{frequently}} when I made a correction they were raised to mine, as she endeavored to <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I wanted her to do. I made a good many alterations which I think improved the work very much.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{impossible}} that the Duke {{should be made}} to <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> had occurred. That Silverbridge had taken Mary he did understand, and that they had together gone to Lord Grex's house. He understood also that the meeting had taken place in the presence of Silverbridge and of Lady Mabel. [...] "No doubt it was all an accident," [...] Lady Cantrip wrote. How could it be an accident? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Jimmy had {{a glimpse of}} a wet, white face, and a hand, {{apparently}} clinging to a cranny, and then the flicker of firelight sank and left him in black darkness. He did not <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> had taken place, but it was unpleasantly evident that the fuses would soon reach the powder, while his comrade, whom he could no longer see, was apparently unable to ascend the gully.|$|E
60|$|She had {{straightened}} {{herself a}} little, and sat {{looking at him}} with a certain quiet and half-scornful imperiousness which she knew became her, and yet was not altogether affected. Sewell, the democrat, <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she meant, and knew that it was not the loneliness or physical discomfort the blockade entailed that she was thinking of. It was the humbling of the pride of the ruling caste to which she belonged, and the bold denial of its prerogative of authority, that she felt the most. It was curious that he could understand this and sympathize with her as Ingleby, who only saw and did the obvious thing, could not have done.|$|R
50|$|As {{was often}} the case with women artists who were {{associated}} with better known male artists, there were claims made that she did not produce all the work attributed to her and because of her long relationship with Prud'hon, it is still not well <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he did and what she did. This confusion is in large part {{due to the fact that}} the two artists collaborated on several works: he sketched the design and she made the paintings. Many were exhibited under her name, but when the works became part of public collections they were attributed to Prud'hon. For instance, Venus and Cupid sleeping now attributed to Mayer was initially attributed in the Wallace Collection to Prud'hon.|$|R

6000|$|She got to {{her feet}} trembling, and moved quickly from under the yew-trees. She tried to think--tried to <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> this portended for her, for him, for her lover. But she could not.

Ah! but to the night had been given that pale-gold moon-ray, to herself nothing, no faintest gleam; as well try to pierce below the dark surface of that water! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You flatter me, M. Graillot," [...] she said. [...] "It {{is simply}} that I feel the force of your {{beautiful}} words. Thérèse is a wonderful conception! As to those disputed passages--well, I feel myself {{in a very difficult}} position. Artistically, I am entirely in accord with you, and yet I <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Faraday means from the commercial point of view. Let us submit the matter to the prince. He knows something of both sides of the question." ...|$|E
5000|$|Florence detectives tapped phones {{belonging}} to several individuals {{related to the}} Narducci side-trackings case suspects, including journalist Mario Spezi. From some phone conversations - some of which between Spezi and American author Douglas Preston - it appeared that Spezi and others were preparing thmselves to do [...] "something worrying", while {{it could not be}} <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the plot was about. On February 23. 2006, Mignini summoned Douglas Preston for questioning as a person informed about facts related to Spezi's activities. Mignini made Preston listen to one of the phone recordings with his own voice. Mignini stopped the questioning as he suspected Preston of perjury, given a manifest contradiction between his answer and the content of the phone recordings.|$|R
60|$|Spike {{was only}} great in a crisis, and then {{merely as a}} seaman. He {{understood}} his calling to its minuti, and he understood the Molly Swash better than he understood any other craft that floated. For {{more than twenty years}} had he sailed her, and the careful parent does not better understand the humours of the child, than he <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> might be expected from his brig. His satisfaction sensibly increased, therefore, as she stole along the land, toward the angle mentioned, without a sound audible but the gentle gurgling of the water, stirred by the stem, and which sounded like the ripple of the gentlest wave, as it washes the shingle of some placid beach.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} hairdresser <b>understood</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Ralph wanted, {{he entered}} heartily into his plans; {{and several of the}} short flat bands of black hair, used for chignons, were sewn on to a band. This was {{fastened}} on to Ralph's head, in the way he had suggested; the long tresses were cut to the required length; the tongs were used on them, and on the natural hair; and plenty of oil put on and, in an hour, his headdress was perfect--an immense bush of frizzly hair. The cloth was taken from round his neck and, as he looked at himself in the glass, he joined heartily in Percy's shout of laughter.|$|R
