40|$|A {{prototype}} {{centreless grinding}} machine was modified extensively to operate satisfactorily at high grinding wheel speeds and in the high rate centreless grinding regime. The principal modifications included the provision of a 75 k. W. d. c., variable speed, main drive motor which enables grinding wheel speeds up to 120 m/s to be employed and a coolant supply manifold was designed and manufactured-which was capable of delivering a high velocity coolant stream to the grinding zone. In addition, a measurement system was developed-which-allowed the grinding forces to be monitored and recorded in process. Two solutions for the accepted kinematic model of plunge feed cylindrical grinding are proposed. The general and more accurate solution takes account of the variable grit height and separation of the grinding wheel, whilst the particular and approximate analytical solution makes provision for variable grit separation only. The particular solution enabled parametric studies to be undertaken and allowed comparisons with the solutions proposed by other workers. The trends of theoretical grinding forces were predicted from analysis of the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The trends indicated two methods of achieving high stock removal rates, firstly, for a constant force value, higher stock removal rates are possible by increasing the grinding wheel speed and infeed-rate. Secondly, at a constant grinding wheel speed, and force level, reducing the workpiece speed and increasing the infeed-rate will yield higher stock removal rates. Experimental results were in agreement with these predictions. An extensive experimental programme investigating plunge feed centreless grinding of ferrous components was undertaken. Results from approximately 300 grinding experiments were used to establish a data bank of grinding parameters {{for a range of}} grinding conditions. High-rate centreless grinding {{has been shown to be}} a feasible first machining process. It has also been shown that the choice of kinematic conditions is important in achieving high stock removal rate grinding. Incorrect choice of kinematic conditions can cause problems of, workpiece burn, grinding vibrations and excessive power demands. Limit charts have been constructed which outline the boundaries to the process in terms of burn, grinding vibration and power limit. Operation between the boundaries is best achieved if the ratio of grinding wheel to workpiece speeds is in the range 90 - 200. The results enable a data based control strategy to be formulated and it is proposed that in process variable kinematics will allow a single cycle roughing and finishing operation on a suitably adapted {{centreless grinding machine}}...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of brittle-ductile cutting mode transition has received much attention {{over the past}} two decades. Due to the difficulties in directly observing the cutting zone during the brittle-ductile cutting mode transition by experimental techniques, many molecular dynamics (MD) studies have been conducted to investigate the atomicscale details of the phenomena, e. g. phase transformation, stress distribution and crack initiation, mostly under nanoscale <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thicknesses. A research gap is that direct MD modelling of the transition under practical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thicknesses was not achieved in previous studies, due to the limitations in both computation capability and interaction potential. Important details of the transition under practical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thicknesses thereby remain unclear, e. g. the location of crack formation and the stress distribution. In this study, parallel MD codes based on graphics processing units (GPU) are developed to enable large-scale MD simulations with multi-million atoms. In addition, an advanced interaction potential which reproduces brittle fracture much more accurately is adopted. As a result, the direct MD simulation of brittle-ductile cutting mode transition is realised for the first time under practical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thicknesses. The MD-modelled critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness is verified by a plunge cutting experiment. The MD modelling shows that tensile stress exists around the cutting zone and increases with <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness, which finally induces brittle fractures. The location of crack formation and direction of propagation varies with <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness in the MD simulations, which agrees with the surface morphologies of the taper groove produced by the plunge cutting experiment.

40|$|The actual {{grinding}} {{result of}} ceramics {{has not been}} well predicted by the present mechanical models. No allowance is made for direct effects of materials microstructure and almost all the mechanical models were obtained based on crystalline ceramics. In order to improve the mechanical models of ceramics, surface grinding experiments on crystalline ceramics and non-crystalline ceramics were conducted in this research. The normal and tangential grinding forces were measured to calculate single grit force and specific grinding energy. Grinding surfaces were observed. For crystalline alumina ceramics, the predictive modeling of normal force per grit fits well with the experimental result, when the maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness {{is less than a}} critical depth, which turns out to be close to the grain size of alumina. Meanwhile, there is a negative correlation between the specific grinding energy and the maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness. With the decreasing maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness, the proportions of ductile removal and transgranular fracture increase.

For ultra-precision machining of brittle glass materials, critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness (CUCT) commonly plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining the transition point from ductile cutting to brittle cutting. In this research, cutting characteristics in nanometric cutting of BK 7 and fused silica glasses, including machined surface morphology, surface roughness, cutting force and specific cutting energy, were investigated with nanometric plunge-cutting experiments. The same cutting speed of 300 mm/min was used in the experiments with single-crystal diamond tool. CUCT was determined according to the mentioned cutting characteristics. The results revealed that 320 nm was found as the CUCT in BK 7 cutting and 50 nm was determined as the size effect of <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness. A high-quality machined surface could be obtained with the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness between 50 and 320 nm at ductile cutting stage.

They {{are used as}} veneer-core bilayer all-ceramic or metal-fused ceramic restorations or monolithic inlays/onlays/crowns to replace missing or damaged tooth structures for aesthetic and functional purposes. However, glass ceramic materials, such as feldspar and leucite glass ceramics, which are subject to this investigation, are brittle and easily induced microfractures in abrasive cutting using dental handpieces and coarse burs. In this paper, we investigated the dental abrasive cutting characteristics of feldspar and leucite glass ceramics using a high-speed electric handpiece and coarse diamond burs. Cutting forces, specific removal energy, surface roughness and morphology were investigated as functions of specific material removal rate and maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness. The results indicate that increasing the specific material removal rate or the maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness resulted in increases in both tangential and normal forces, but a decrease in specific removal energy for both ceramics. Tangential, normal forces and specific removal energy were significantly larger in up cutting than those in down cutting. Surface roughness for the two ceramics was not affected by the specific removal rate or the maximum <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness. Both microfrature and ductile microcutting morphology were observed in the machined surfaces for both ceramics.

40|$|Machining along {{continuous}} circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool stoppage {{and even}} feed rate variation. This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular end milling is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper, chip formation during circular end milling is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for end milling along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness in circular end milling is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular end milling and also compared to the linear end milling. The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness in circular end milling suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in circular end milling are calculated based on the derived chip thickness formulations and an existing mechanistic model. The calculation results reiterate the need of taking into account adjusted feed per tooth and valid chip thickness formulations in circular end milling, especially for small tool-path radii, for more realistic process modeling.

40|$|Brittle {{materials}} such as silicon, germanium, glass and ceramics are widely used in semiconductor, optical, micro-electronics and various other fields. Traditionally, grinding, polishing and lapping have been employed to achieve high tolerance in surface texture of silicon wafers in semiconductor applications, lenses for optical instruments etc. The conventional machining processes such as single point turning and milling are not conducive to brittle materials as they produce discontinuous chips owing to brittle failure at the shear plane before any tangible plastic flow occurs. In order to improve surface finish on machined brittle materials, ductile regime machining is being extensively studied lately. The process of machining brittle materials where the material is removed by plastic flow, thus leaving a crack free surface is known as ductile-regime machining. Ductile machining of brittle materials can produce surfaces of very high quality comparable with processes such as polishing, lapping etc. The objective of this project {{is to develop a}} comprehensive predictive model for ductile machining of brittle materials. The model would predict the critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness required to achieve ductile-regime machining. The input to the model includes tool geometry, workpiece material properties and machining process parameters. The fact that the scale of ductile regime machining is very small leads to a number of factors assuming significance which would otherwise be neglected. The effects of tool edge radius, grain size, grain boundaries, crystal orientation etc. are studied so as to make better predictions of forces and hence the critical <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness. The model is validated using a series of experiments with varying materials and cutting conditions. This research would aid in predicting forces and <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness values for micro-machining brittle materials given their material properties and process conditions. The output could be used to machine brittle materials without fracture and hence preserve their surface texture quality. The need for resorting to experimental trial and error is greatly reduced as the critical parameter, namely <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness, is predicted using this approach. This can in turn pave way for brittle materials to be utilized in a variety of applications. Ph. D.

For non-regenerative chatter, {{it was found that the}} limiting width of cut: increases with a decrease in the structure’s cross-receptance between the directions normal and tangential to the cut surface; increases with:a decrease in cutting speed, but in a manner depending on the structural characteristics; is substantially in-dependent of the mean <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness; increases by at least 25 per cent if contact is restricted to a length approximately equal to the <b>undeformed</b> <b>chip</b> thickness.

Theoretical predictions of non-regenerative chatter with a conventional tool, based on independent measure-ments of machining force oscillations during tool vibration, agree well with experimental results.

During nanometric cutting, both phase transformation from diamond cubic structure to β-Sn phase and direct amorphization of germanium occur. The machined surface presents amorphous structure.|$|R
