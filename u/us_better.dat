500|$|Hazlitt for {{the most}} part agreed with his {{contemporary}} Romantics that poetry can make <b>us</b> <b>better</b> human beings. The following year, in his Lectures on the English Poets, referring to tragic poetry especially, he would observe how [...] "in proportion as it sharpens the edge of calamity and disappointment, it strengthens the desire of good." [...] Yet, he remained alert to ways in which poetry can also express and reinforce our less admirable tendencies. Following an observation of Burke he notes that [...] "people flock to see a tragedy; but if there were a public execution in the next street, the theatre would very soon be empty. [...] We are [...] fond of indulging our violent passions [...] We cannot help it. The sense of power is as strong a principle in the mind as the love of pleasure." ...|$|E
500|$|Lobengula {{was alarmed}} by how some were perceiving his {{dealings}} with Grobler, and so was reluctant to sign any more agreements with foreigners. Despite his familiarity with Moffat, the king did not consider him above suspicion, and he was dubious about placing himself firmly in the British camp; as Moffat said of the Matabele leadership in general, [...] "they may like <b>us</b> <b>better,</b> but they fear the Boers more". Moffat's negotiations with the king and izinDuna were therefore very long and uneasy. The missionary presented the proposed British treaty as an offer to renew that enacted by d'Urban and Mzilikazi in 1836. He told the Matabele that the Boers were misleading them, that Pretoria's interpretation of the Grobler treaty differed greatly from their own, and that the British proposal served Matabele interests better in any case. On 11 February 1888, Lobengula agreed and placed his mark and seal {{at the foot of}} the agreement. The document proclaimed that the Matabele and British were now at peace, that Lobengula would not enter any kind of diplomatic correspondence with any country apart from Britain, and that the king would not [...] "sell, alienate or cede" [...] any part of Matabeleland or Mashonaland to anybody.|$|E
