5|$|A dam on Nescopeck Creek was {{destroyed}} during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, {{there was a}} steam-electric power station {{at the mouth of}} Nescopeck Creek. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck Creek. After World War II, there was a large increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, which was in <b>use</b> <b>from</b> 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in <b>use</b> <b>from</b> 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in <b>use</b> <b>from</b> good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages.

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public <b>use</b> <b>from</b> April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E

During the 1909 season IFK Göteborg also used Örgryte IS' home ground of the time, Balders Hage, due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen. The third official stadium was Walhalla Idrottsplats, used {{for a number of}} home matches {{at the same time as}} Idrottsplatsen.

5|$|The Kowalewko {{cemetery}} in Greater Poland {{is one of}} the largest in Poland and is distinguished by a great number of beautiful relics, made locally or imported from the Empire. The total number of burials is estimated at over 500, most of which have been excavated. 60 percent of the bodies were not cremated and typically placed in wooden coffins constructed of board or plank pieces. The burial ground was in <b>use</b> <b>from</b> the mid-1st century AD to about 220, which gives approximately 80 area inhabitants per generation. Remnants of settlements in the region have also been investigated. At Rogowo near Chełmno a Wielbark settlement, an industrial production site and a 2nd to 3rd century bi-ritual cemetery with very richly furnished graves have been discovered. In the area of Ulkowy, Gdańsk County a settlement consisting of both sunken floor and post construction dwellings, as well as a burial ground in <b>use</b> <b>from</b> the mid-1st century to the second half of the 3rd century were found. Only a part of the cemetery was excavated on the occasion of a motorway construction, but it yielded 110 inhumations (11 in hollowed-out log coffins) and 15 cremations (8 of them in urns) and a rich collection of decorative objects, mostly from the graves of women. Those include fancy jewelry and accessories made of gold, silver, bronze, amber, glass and enameled plates.
