5|$|Northern Ireland itself was, {{for many}} years, {{the site of}} a violent and bitter ethno-sectarian conflict—The Troubles—between those {{claiming}} to represent Irish nationalism, who are predominantly Roman Catholic, and those claiming to represent British <b>unionism,</b> who are predominantly Protestant. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, while nationalists desire a united Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, <b>unionism,</b> and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{was born}} in Crosshouse, Ayrshire, Scotland. He began working in the local coal mines {{at the age of}} 10, {{attending}} night school in his spare time, and at the age of 17 became secretary of the local branch of the Ayrshire Miners' Union. Fisher emigrated to Australia in 1885, where he continued his involvement with trade <b>unionism.</b> He settled in Gympie, and in 1893 was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly {{as a representative of the}} Labor Party. Fisher lost his seat in 1896, but returned in 1899 and later that year briefly served as a minister in the government of Anderson Dawson.|$|E
5|$|Haywood was an {{advocate}} of industrial <b>unionism,</b> a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level; this was {{in contrast to the}} craft unions that were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL. His belief that workers of all ethnicities should be united also clashed with many unions. His preference for direct action over political tactics alienated him from the Socialist Party leadership and contributed to his recall from the party's executive committee in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory <b>unionism,</b> budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form of multiculturalism and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear {{of labor}} unrest {{and the possible}} radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public anxiety of the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining union membership in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police <b>unionism</b> in the U.S. for two decades, as police would not try to organize until World War II.|$|E
5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, {{he was convinced that}} the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described the execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical <b>unionism</b> and welcomed it.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the consequent exile of political dissidents from the Russian Empire, Russian-language journalism in New York City enjoyed a revival. Among the fledgling publications were a number of political newspapers and labor union periodicals, including Golos Truda, which the Union of Russian Workers in the United States and Canada began publishing in the city in 1911, initially on a monthly basis. The newspaper adopted the ideology of anarcho-syndicalism, a fusion of trade <b>unionism</b> and anarchist philosophy which had emerged from the 1907 International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam and along similar lines in America through the influential Industrial Workers of the World. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected state-oriented political struggle and intellectualism, instead proposing labor unions as the revolutionary agents that would bring about an anarchist society characterised primarily by worker collectives.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} the strike, and other strikes in Africa during the period, changed the urban and {{migration}} policies of the British government in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of labour migration in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved little at the time, it is seen a key moment {{in the emergence of}} African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade <b>unionism</b> and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and were rewarded. In 1940, there were several mine strikes in the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been {{controlled}} by many groups, from the Brigantes, the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain, to the Romans, to Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Danes. After the Norman conquest in 1066, the Harrying of the North brought destruction. The area experienced Anglo-Scottish border fighting until {{the unification of}} Britain under the Stuarts, with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the Industrial Revolution began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles {{of many of the}} political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from trade <b>unionism</b> to Manchester Capitalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving, shipbuilding, steelmaking and mining. The deindustrialisation that followed {{in the second half of}} the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in Southern England.|$|E
5|$|Billy Boys {{originated}} in the 1920s as the signature tune of the Brigton Boys, also called The Billy Boys of Brigton Cross, who were a Protestant street gang in the Bridgeton area of Glasgow, led by Billy Fullerton. The gang often clashed with Roman Catholic gangs such as the Norman Conks. Fullerton was {{a former member of}} the British Fascists who was awarded a medal for strike-breaking during the 1926 General Strike and formed a Glasgow branch of the British Union of Fascists with the onset of World War II. The song's geographic roots relate to Bridgeton Cross in Bridgeton, an area of Glasgow historically associated with the city's Protestant population, and with Scottish <b>unionism.</b> Brigton is the Scots form of Bridgeton. The Billy Boys song was often sung loudly when the gang performed it. They regularly sang it when they marched through primarily Catholic areas of Glasgow on Catholic holy days. This often led to the Brigton Boys being attacked by members of the Norman Conks as a result. Despite being primarily based in Glasgow, in the 1930s the Brigton Boys were invited to march in Belfast and sang Billy Boys while they were there as part of The Twelfth celebrations.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam {{gathered}} {{delegates from}} 14 different countries, among which important {{figures of the}} anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade <b>unionism).</b> Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Heffrons {{moved to}} Melbourne, Victoria. That same year in Victoria, Heffron was {{appointed}} an organiser for the Federated Clothing Trades of the Commonwealth of Australia and also joined the leftist Victorian Socialist Party. Later in 1921 {{he moved to}} Sydney, becoming {{the secretary of the}} New South Wales branch of the Federated Marine Stewards' and Pantrymen's Association of Australasia. As the union's state secretary, a role he would hold for ten years, he took a prominent role in maritime trade <b>unionism</b> in Sydney. In February 1924, when the Commonwealth and Dominion Line steamer Port Lyttelton was declared 'Black' by the Labor Council of New South Wales owing to various worker's disputes and the ship having been declared unseaworthy, Heffron and six other union representatives acted to advise members of the Seamen's Union to refuse to work on the Port Lyttelton. For this, in April the government of Sir George Fuller had Heffron and the six other unionists arrested on the charge of conspiracy to strike action. Although controversially refused bail by the trial judge, Heffron and his fellow defendants, represented by Richard Windeyer KC and H. V. Evatt, were found not guilty and released in July 1924 by the court, a verdict that had been returned by the direction of the judge. Later joining the Australian Labor Party, at the time he showed himself to be a supporter of party leader Jack Lang, supporting Lang's successful motion at the 1923 state conference to readmit James Dooley to the party.|$|E

25|$|<b>Unionism</b> in Ireland is a {{political}} ideology that favours the continuation of some form of political union between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. Since the partition of Ireland, <b>unionism</b> in Ireland has focused on maintaining and preserving the place of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. In this context, a distinction may be made between the <b>unionism</b> {{in the province of}} Ulster and <b>unionism</b> elsewhere in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|To join a {{traditional}} labor union, workers must either be given voluntary recognition from their employer {{or have a}} majority of workers in a bargaining unit vote for union representation. In either case, the government must then certify the newly formed union. Other forms of <b>unionism</b> include minority <b>unionism,</b> solidarity <b>unionism,</b> and the practices of {{organizations such as the}} Industrial Workers of the World, which do not always follow traditional organizational models.|$|E
25|$|The Orange Order is {{strongly}} linked to British <b>unionism.</b> This {{is a political}} ideology that supports the continued unity of the United Kingdom. <b>Unionism</b> is thus opposed to, for example, the unification of Ireland and Scottish independence.|$|E
25|$|Boyce quickly {{moved to}} abandon the {{conservative}} approaches practiced by most nascent mine unions at the time. He {{came to believe that}} class warfare made trade <b>unionism</b> obsolete and came out in favor of militant industrial <b>unionism.</b>|$|E

25|$|Woll was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of craft <b>unionism.</b> During the debates over the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Woll portrayed himself as a conciliator and mediator, but worked behind the scenes to undercut Mine Workers president John L.

25|$|The {{story of}} Tolpuddle has enriched {{the history of}} trade <b>unionism,</b> but the {{significance}} of the Tolpuddle Martyrs continues to be debated since Sidney and Beatrice Webb wrote the History of Trade <b>Unionism</b> (1894) and continues with such works as Bob James's Craft Trade or Mystery (2001).|$|E
25|$|Unions may {{organize}} a particular section of skilled workers (craft <b>unionism),</b> {{a cross-section of}} workers from various trades (general <b>unionism),</b> or attempt to {{organize a}}ll workers within a particular industry (industrial <b>unionism).</b> The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on {{the rank and file}} members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.|$|E

25|$|Industrial <b>unionism</b> {{contrasts}} with craft <b>unionism,</b> which organizes workers along lines of their specific trades, i.e., workers {{using the same}} kind of tools, or doing {{the same kind of}} work with approximately the same level of skill, even if this leads to multiple union locals (with different contracts, and different expiration dates) in the same workplace.|$|E

25|$|Although Tobin {{supported}} {{the principle of}} craft <b>unionism,</b> he was tolerant of unions which advocated industrial <b>unionism</b> under certain limitations. In many ways, the Teamsters were already an industrial union, with wide diversity in membership, and Tobin advocated a moderate line toward industrial <b>unionism</b> in part to defend his own union. When the AFL Executive Council proposed in July 1935 suspending the unions which had formed the Committee for Industrial Organization, Tobin argued that the Executive Council lacked the authority to do so. But once the Executive Council's decision was made, Tobin enforced it and ordered Teamster local unions to cut off relations with CIO unions.|$|E
