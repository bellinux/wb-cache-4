In announcing his decision, Holder blasted Congress for imposing restrictions on the Justice Department's ability to bring the men to New York City for civilian trials. [...] "After thoroughly studying the case, {{it became clear to}} me that the best venue for prosecution was in federal court. I stand by that decision today," [...] Holder said. [...] "As the president has said, those unwise and <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restrictions</b> (imposed by Congress) undermine our counterterrorism efforts and could harm our national security. Decisions about who, where and how to prosecute have always been - and must remain - the responsibility of the executive branch." [...] Holder insisted, [...] "We were prepared to bring a powerful case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his four co-conspirators - one of the most well-researched and documented cases I have ever seen in my decades of experience as a prosecutor." [...] He added, [...] "Had this case proceeded in Manhattan or in an alternative venue in the United States, as I seriously explored in the past year, I am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years." [...] Holder had promised to seek the death penalty for each of the five men and on 4 April he warned that it is an [...] "open question" [...] if such a penalty can be imposed by a military commission if the defendants plead guilty.|$|E

5000|$|But of all Justice Stevens' {{criticisms of}} the death penalty, the hardest to take is his bemoaning of [...] "the {{enormous}} costs that death penalty litigation imposes on society," [...] including the [...] "burden on {{the courts and the}} lack of finality for victim's families." [...] Those costs, those burdens, and that lack of finality are in large measure the creation of Justice Stevens and other Justices opposed to the death penalty, who have [...] "encumbered it … with <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restrictions</b> neither contained in the text of the Constitution nor reflected in two centuries of practice under it"—the product of their policy views [...] "not shared by {{the vast majority of the}} American people." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Church of Scientology {{contended that}} the common law of {{defamation}} in Canada failed to evolve with Canadian society. Too much emphasis in the common law had {{been placed on the}} need to protect the reputation of plaintiffs at the expense of freedom of expression. This, they argued, was an <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restriction</b> imposed in a manner that cannot be justified in a free and democratic society that could survive a limitations clause challenge. The appellants added that if the element of government action was insufficient to attract Charter scrutiny, the principles of the common law ought to be interpreted, even in a purely private law action, {{in a manner consistent with}} the Charter. This, they argued, could be achieved only by the adoption of the [...] "actual malice" [...] standard of liability found in the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.|$|R
50|$|In August 1924, Stewart {{resigned}} {{his portfolio}} in protest at a deal between Bruce and Page that protected sitting members from opposition from coalition party candidates at elections, which he {{regarded as an}} <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restriction</b> on voters' choice. He and Albert Dunstan then established the Victorian Country Progressive Party, which held {{the balance of power}} in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the late 1920s and sought to establish compulsory nationwide pools and guaranteed prices for wheat. This idea eventually led to the establishment of the Australian Wheat Board. Bruce campaigned against his re-election at the 1928 election and 1929 election, without success. In September 1929, he voted against Bruce's bill to abolish the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, helping to bring down his government. After the election of the Scullin government in 1929, he worked closely with it and sought reduced tariffs and a range of government interventions to raise rural incomes.|$|R

In November 1866, {{addressing}} the Literary and Debating Society on the question [...] "Was the character of Warren Hastings as Governor-General of India praiseworthy?", O'Donnell caused uproar by denouncing [...] "the principle and the system which have lain {{at the root of the}} international and intercolonial policy of England, from the days when Elizabeth, the Infamous, chartered for profit two of the first ships which opened the African slave trade...". His remarks caused the chairman of the meeting, Professor Thomas Moffett, to prevent O'Donnell from continuing his speech, stating that [...] "such an epithet ought not to be applied to any predecessor of our present gracious Queen." [...] O'Donnell regarded such action as an <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restriction</b> on his freedom of speech, and in a letter published in the local press gave an early example of his high-flown literary style: ...|$|R

But how will the Trump administration respond to these likely protests and dissent? Using data on protests and repression in US cities over the past four decades, Emily Hencken Ritter finds that greater dissent leads to repressive responses from authorities. She also warns that, judging by Donald Trump’s rhetoric, we may also see an increase in preventive repression such as registries, <b>unwarranted</b> deportations, and <b>restrictions</b> on civil liberties, but well-resourced activist organizations will be a solid defense against these policies...|$|R
40|$|In {{reasoning}} {{about events}} and change, we confront {{a variety of}} problems which make the inference of even seemingly obvious conclusions very difficult. A key problem {{is the need to}} assume that you have sufficient information to make reliable inferences, Amsterdam's "You Are There Convention". This has led to a proliferation of non-monotonic logics where the sufficient information assumption is embedded in the semantics. However, these approaches have some serious shortcomings. Avoiding these problems, Schubert's Explanation Closure approach states the sufficient information assumption axiomatically, allowing standard monotonic semantics. These axioms state the assumption indirectly and are stronger than needed, so they result in otherwise <b>unwarranted</b> inferences and <b>restrictions</b> on interpretations. In this paper we describe a monotonic formalism with a rich language of events in which the sufficient information assumption can be stated directly. As a result, it avoids the ontological re [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order that}} the owners of a fishery or any other natural {{resource}} may derive the greatest benefit from that resource, it must be utilized to the fullest possible extent. A policy of <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restriction</b> or miserly hoarding does not give the maximum benefit to the owners, since they then are deprived of their legitimate profits. Nor does a program of wasteful extravagance produce the greatest possible good from a fishery. Indeed of the two courses the latter is the more unwise and harmful, since the resource may be reduced {{to such an extent}} that it is either obliterated or brought to a level so low that it can no longer produce profitable returns. Therefore, the persons administering a fishery are confronted with the problem of getting the greatest possible returns from the resource, without harming the supply or breeding stock. There appears to be no method by which it is possible to determine how large a catch a fishery can produce without injury to itself, until depletion becomes apparent at least to a small extent. It would seem then that the only course remaining is to proceed to utilize cautiously the fishery, endeavoring to keep on the safe side so that depletion will not occur. Then if it is evident that the resource is being injured by over-production, either the supply must be increased artificially or the total take reduced. Evidently then in conjunction with this method of trial and error, it is necessary to have some means of judging the point at which a state of injurious over-production is reached, in order that some remedy or regulation may be applied before the breeding stock of the fishery is depleted seriously. Probably the most common method in the past of judging the condition of a fishery has been to accept the opinions of people working or interested in the resource as evidence in the case. These opinions are usually of doubtful value, since depletion must proceed to an advanced stage before it becomes apparent to the casual observer, and it is then often too late to save the fishery. Also people deriving their sport or living from a fishery are apt to be prejudiced and their opinions biased or founded on a few observations of outstanding instances. Figures showing the annual total catch of a species of fish are also often used as a basis for judging the relative abundance of a fish. When such data are used without careful analysis and other supplementary information, as is often the case, they are usually without value and often misleading. This is necessarily so, because the abundance of a fish is only one of many factors which ordinarily cause fluctuations in the total take of that species. The total catch may remain constant or even increase while the species of fish is being depleted. Such a situation can be readily brought about by the effort expended on the fishery, number of men and boats, being increased, new and more productive fishing grounds being opened up, or a more effective type of gear coming into use. An increase in fishing effort may be caused by higher prices, failure of another fishery making it necessary for fishermen to change over to the one in question, or a greater demand offering opportunities for more men and boats. Likewise a drop in total catch might occur when the supply of the species is holding its own or increasing. This may be caused by a decrease in fishing effort, legislation preventing use of effective gear or good fishing areas or fixing closed seasons, which diminish the available fishing time. Unfavorable weather or strikes of fishermen also may pull down the total catch for a brief time. Therefore, since the total amount of any species taken in a calendar year is dependent on several factors other than the relative abundance of the species, namely: fishing effort, legislation, shifts in fishing grounds, weather, changes in another fishery, labor and economic conditions, some method of treating the catch figures, which will eliminate as nearly as possible factors other than abundance must be resorted to in order to secure any dependable index of abundance from the catch data. By expressing catch returns in some definite unit which is subject as little as possible to influence by factors other than abundance, such a desired result may be accomplished. The catch return per a constant amount of fishing effort, gear and time, is such a unit. In other words the catch resulting from a constant amount of fishing gear and effort used for a constant period of time should be indicative of the relative abundance of a species of fish, or at least the availability of the species to the fishermen, providing the data used are representative samples of the catch results from the entire fishery. It is reasonable to assume that as a species of fish becomes less abundant, the same amount of gear employed in the same manner and for the same length of time will catch a lesser quantity of the fish as the supply decreases, or more fish as the supply increases...|$|R
30|$|The limited {{explanatory}} {{power of the}} fiscal exposure measure could reflect the possibility that changes in AGI and tax burdens by income level, reflecting both income and consumption taxes, do not adequately capture the transmission mechanism from recessionary shocks to revenue outcomes. Alternatively, the summary measure of revenue exposure may impose <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{on the effects of}} its individual components. Given the change in AGI in a particular slice of the income distribution, model (1) of Table  5 implies that a ten percent difference across states in the effective tax rate on that slice (e.g., from 5 to 5.5 percent) must result in a ten percent difference in the change in tax revenues generated from that slice (e.g., from -$ 100 to -$ 110 per return).|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce their workloads, Brazilian Courts have been landing many {{precedents}} that lead to <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{to the right to}} appeal, thereby belittling the fundamental constitutional right to access to justice. Despite the existence of studies on this "defensive jurisprudence", there are still few who analyze it {{in the light of the}} new Civil Procedure Code (Law 13. 105 / 2015), which is about to enter into force. This article aims to evaluate the suitability of the new CPC to remedy this adjudicative problem or at least minimize it. We demonstrated, based on literature and through a deductive argumentative reasoning, that the new procedural law contains a number of specific and general legal clauses which may be used as instruments able to curb the adjudicate "defensiveness. Nonetheless, the achievement of this goal will depend largely on how this legal clauses are to be interpreted and applied...|$|E

Until recently, copyright law in Australia had limited the uses to which members of the public could put patent specifications in that country. Those impediments have been removed {{as a result of an}} important legislative change to the way in which copyright in patent specifications can be enforced. The change gives the public a greater freedom to make use of patent specifications than it enjoyed before, and removes <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restrictions</b> upon the ways in which the public can reuse valuable information. However, what the amendment does not address is the impediments copyright imposes on using non-patent prior art documents in ways that advance the public interes...|$|E
40|$|From {{its very}} beginnings, the {{jurisprudence}} of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{on the free}} movement of goods had to integrate intellectual property rights. 1 By and large, {{it can be said}} that the Court has been very successful in eliminating <b>unwarranted</b> <b>restrictions</b> to the free movement of goods on grounds of such rights. In several recent judgments, the Court refined its jurisprudence concerning the doctrine of exhaustion. This doctrine is the Court's formula for balancing two competing concerns: 2 on the one hand, the fundamental principle of free movement of goods, guaranteed by Art. 28 EC. This is relevant, in the present context, for parallel traders, who "play an important role in preventing the compartmentalisation of national markets". 3 On the other hand, there are the legitimate interests of the holders of intellectual property rights (recognised by Arts. 295 and 30 EC). The analysis of the case law can, thus, be subdivided into three aspects: the rights conferred on owners of intellectual property, the conditions for exhaustion of intellectual property rights to occur, and the consequences of exhaustion...|$|E
