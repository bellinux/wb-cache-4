In his own words: [...] "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> [...] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor {{do we need to}} be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about." ...|$|E

If I'm against abortion and I don't find a way to love the woman who got the abortion and even her doctor, then I don't understand the gospel." [...] Yancey recounts Jesus's Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, concluding that God is only willing to forgive <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are willing to forgive those who have wronged us. In a similar vein, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice: [...] "How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?" ...|$|E

Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E

500|$|Among the prisoners, Seaman First Class Joseph Randolph [...] "Joe" [...] Small, a winch {{operator}} in Division Four and a natural leader who called cadence when his division marched, {{was asked by}} officers to assemble a handful of reliable men as a team of acting petty officers {{and to keep the}} other prisoners on good behavior. On August 10, there had been conflicts between the prisoners and their guards as the prisoners were marched to the mess hall for meals. There was also a brief fight in the mess hall, and some prisoners were seen sharpening spoons into makeshift knives. Small sensed a general air of rebelliousness among the prisoners. To counteract the rising tension and offset the disaster he saw coming, Small convened a short meeting that evening aboard the crowded barge and told the prisoners to [...] "knock off the horseplay", stay out of trouble and obey the shore patrol guards (who were black) and the officers, because the alternative (white Marines as guards) would be worse. He said to the men, [...] "We've got the officers by the ballsthey can do nothing to <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't do anything to them. If we stick together, they can't do anything to us." ...|$|E

[...] Narendra said, [...] "We will appeal in High Court for death penalty to the main accused, Ganga Raj. We respect the court's decision but he should be punished so that the instigators of the crime get the punishment. Also it is important that it is a very clear message so that no khap gives such directions, ever." [...] Seema seconded Narendra's concerns, [...] "We would have been happier if the main accused was also given the death sentence. The decision of the panchayat was not justified and people should not to be allowed to misuse their power. We have fought this battle alone when no one was supporting us." [...] She requested more security for her family, [...] "They tried to bribe us to withdraw the case then they threatened that they would kill <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> didn't withdraw the FIR.

500|$|The company's vast American empire {{included}} 20,000 domestic wells, 4,000 {{miles of}} pipeline, 5,000 tank cars, and over 100,000 employees. Its share of world oil refining topped out above 90% but slowly dropped to about 80% {{for the rest}} of the century. Despite the formation of the trust and its perceived immunity from all competition, by the 1880s Standard Oil had passed its peak of power over the world oil market. Rockefeller finally gave up his dream of controlling all the world's oil refining, he admitted later, [...] "We realized that public sentiment would be against <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> actually refined all the oil." [...] Over time foreign competition and new finds abroad eroded his dominance. In the early 1880s, Rockefeller created one of his most important innovations. Rather than try to influence the price of crude oil directly, Standard Oil had been exercising indirect control by altering oil storage charges to suit market conditions. Rockefeller then ordered the issuance of certificates against oil stored in its pipelines. These certificates became traded by speculators, thus creating the first oil-futures market which effectively set spot market prices from then on. The National Petroleum Exchange opened in Manhattan in late 1882 to facilitate the trading of oil futures.|$|E

500|$|Citing Watchmen as {{the point}} where the comic book medium [...] "came of age", Iain Thomson wrote in his essay [...] "Deconstructing the Hero" [...] that the story {{accomplished}} this by [...] "developing its heroes precisely in order to deconstruct the very idea of the hero and so encouraging us to reflect upon its significance from the many different angles of the shards left lying on the ground". Thomson stated that the heroes in Watchmen almost all share a nihilistic outlook, and that Moore presents this outlook [...] "as the simple, unvarnished truth" [...] to [...] "deconstruct the would-be hero's ultimate motivation, namely, to provide a secular salvation and so attain a mortal immortality". He wrote that the story [...] "develops its heroes precisely in order to ask <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> would not in fact be better off without heroes". Thomson added that the story's deconstruction of the hero concept [...] "suggests that perhaps the time for heroes has passed", which he feels distinguishes [...] "this postmodern work" [...] from the deconstructions of the hero in the existentialism movement. Richard Reynolds states that without any supervillains in the story, the superheroes of Watchmen are forced to confront [...] "more intangible social and moral concerns", adding that this removes the superhero concept from the normal narrative expectations of the genre. Reynolds concludes that the series' ironic self-awareness of the genre [...] "all mark out Watchmen either as the last key superhero text, or the first in a new maturity of the genre".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught us anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks <b>us</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at {{the wrong place at the}} wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera seems to take a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E
