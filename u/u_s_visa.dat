40|$|This study uses {{a unique}} natural {{experiment}} {{to test a}} simple model of international differences in workers’ wages and productivity. Large differences in wages across countries could arise from several sources. These include barriers to trade in outputs, differences in technology, differences in workers, or differences in the other factors of production accessible in different countries. To measure {{the relative importance of}} these sources in one setting, this study exploits the randomized processing of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>visas</b> for a group of Indian workers who produce software within a single multinational firm. In this setting, international barriers to trade in outputs, barriers to technology transfer, and all observable or unobservable differences between workers are extremely low. The results indicate that location outside of India causes a sixfold increase in the wages of the same worker using the same technology to produce a highly tradable good. Under plausible assumptions about competition in the industry, this suggests that country-of-work by itself is responsible—in this industry—for roughly three-quarters of the gap in productivity between workers in India and workers in the richest countries.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a history}} of the illegal immigration of Eastern European Jews to the United States that burgeoned after the passage of highly restrictive, nation-based immigration quotas in 1921 and 1924. I argue that the history of this illicit flow of people forces us to re-examine a central narrative of twentieth-century <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> history, namely that 1924 saw the "closing of the gates" to European immigrants, and thus {{the end of an era}} in which European immigration was a matter of national urgency. I contend that the quota legislation escalated rather than settled struggles over questions of national inclusion and exclusion, and created new gray areas between alienness and belonging. The history of illegal immigration illuminates how the laws actually functioned on the ground, something we have as yet learned little about. The laws did reorder the rules governing the nation's literal and metaphorical borders, but this reordering happened unevenly, confusedly, and with much contention. Strategies Jewish migrants employed to enter the United States despite the quotas [...] -forgeries, disguise, and surreptitious entry [...] -challenged the laws' premise that it was possible to secure national borders against "undesirables," or to sort desirable immigrants from undesirable ones, and aliens from citizens. Jewish migrants, as a heterogeneous group coming from many countries and speaking many languages, particularly confounded the categories of ethnicity and nationality upon which the quota laws were based. Chapter One examines the genesis of the quota laws, focusing on the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> government's interest in counting and classifying, as well as the challenges Jews posed to such a project. Chapter Two considers <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Jewish leaders' responses to the illegal immigration of Jews over the Mexico-Texas border and to the plight of Jews stranded abroad with <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>visas</b> rendered defunct by the 1924 law. Chapter Three investigates Jewish alien smuggling and the criminalization of migration during the era. Chapter Four examines individual migrants' experiences of illegal immigration, especially their uses of disguises and forged documents. Chapter Five explores controversies over proposals for "alien registration," arguing that Jews escaped the specter of "illegal alienness" in part through their own political efforts. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of business and}} social networks in generating trade is becoming increasingly recognized in the international economics literature. An important way in which people build and maintain networks is through face-to-face meetings. I propose an empirical model in which business travel helps to overcome informational asymmetries in international trade, generating international sales {{in the form of}} new export relationships. The empirical evidence, using a unique survey of all outbound travelers from the U. S. on international flights, which differentiates between business and leisure travel and U. S. resident and non-resident travel, and exploits relative changes in <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>visa</b> policy towards non-Visa Waiver Program countries in the aftermath of September 11 to instrument for international travel, supports the model. Business travel to the United States by non-resident, non-citizens has a positive impact on the extensive export margin. The effect is driven by travel from non-English speaking countries, for which communication with the U. S. by other means may be less effective. Moreover, the effect is stronger for differentiated products and for higher-skilled travelers, reflecting the information-intensive nature of differentiated products and that higher-skilled travelers are better able to transfer information about trading opportunities. Together, the evidence provides support for the many U. S. Department of Commerce export promotion programs designed to bring prospective importers to the U. S. to facilitate trade matchmaking...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by the {{difficulty}} of biometric systems to correctly match fingerprints with poor image quality, we formulate and solve a game-theoretic formulation of the identification problem in two settings: <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>visa</b> applicants are checked against a list of visa holders to detect visa fraud, and visitors entering the U. S. are checked against a watchlist of criminals and suspected terrorists. For three types of biometric strategies, we solve the game in which the U. S. Government chooses the strategy's optimal parameter values to maximize the detection probability subject to a constraint on the mean biometric processing time per legal visitor, and then the terrorist chooses the image quality to minimize the detection probability. At current inspector staffing levels at ports of entry, our model predicts that a quality-dependent two-finger strategy achieves a detection probability of 0. 733, compared to 0. 526 under the quality-independent two-finger strategy that is currently implemented at the U. S. border. Increasing the staffing level of inspectors offers only minor increases in the detection probability for these two strategies. Using more than two fingers to match visitors with poor image quality allows a detection probability of 0. 949 under current staffing levels, but may require major changes to the current U.

40|$|Although the 2 ̆ 2 tragic choice 2 ̆ 2 {{framework}} has {{not been}} applied {{in the context of}} <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> immigration law, current immigration policy is rife with tragic choices, defined as a commitment by policy elites to maintaining certain illusions which shield from public view tough policy choices that offend deeply held values. Take, for example, the issue of commodification of visas. Policy makers remain committed to maintaining the historical illusion that <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>visas</b> are open to well-deserving migrants, and are not being 2 ̆ 2 sold 2 ̆ 2 Yet <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> immigration practice has long made concessions to commodification at the margins. Indeed, some migrants “pay” very high prices to obtain the right to enter the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> For example, certain elite visa applicants must invest significant sums in the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> economy as a condition of both obtaining and maintaining their visas. While in other countries, the poor migrant, like the rich migrant, may pledge something of value as a condition of receiving her <b>visa,</b> in the <b>U.</b> <b>S.,</b> the poor migrant has no such option. Rather, the poor migrant faces another kind of 2 ̆ 2 tragic choice. 2 ̆ 2 She may pay a coyote an astronomical fee to transport her across the border illegally, or she simply cannot come. Why this tragic choice? A primary challenge of immigration law is that it is notoriously difficult to screen poor visa applicants. In a quintessential problem of informational asymmetry, the typical applicant knows much more about her likely behavior in the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> than the government; the government typically has no way of evaluating the sincerity of her promise to be law-abiding. Reflecting the long-time recognition in the common law that a contracting party is more likely to abide by her commitment if she pledges something of value, this Article recommends that the applicant should have to post a bond as a condition of receiving her visa. In the event that the applicant later fails to keep her promises, including an assurance not to overstay her visa, she would forfeit this bond. However, there are problems with bonding regimes in the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> context. Bonding regimes appear to offend deeply held public values. For example, bonding systems may reinforce perceptions that market-based mechanisms are being utilized to determine who receives visas, thus potentially excluding the poor. Yet, ironically, bonding systems may actually improve the opportunity sets of the poor. For example, a bonding system should raise the costs of non-compliance with visas and in so doing, make it more likely that a poor applicant will receive a visa. Thus, bonding systems may also improve access for the poor migrant to the <b>U.</b> <b>S.,</b> where she typically significantly improves her earnings. Herein lies the crux of the matter. The real issue is not the bonding requirement. After all, immigration law already routinely uses market-based mechanisms to screen rich migrants. The question becomes why poor migrants should not have similar opportunities. The real issue is the absence of opportunities in developing countries for poor people to access transparent credit facilities from formal financial institutions to finance bonds, leaving poor migrants at the mercy of black-market money lenders. This Article seeks to make labor mobility bankable by advocating a re-conceptualization of guest worker visas as a type of property, namely, licenses for temporary admission to the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> If appropriately designed, these visa-licenses could be collateral-like devices, which allow poor migrants to access transparent law-bound credit markets...|$|R

We used SmaI-digested genomic DNA separated by {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE) to characterize 957 S. aureus isolates and establish a database of PFGE patterns. In addition to PFGE patterns of U. S. strains, the database contains patterns of representative epidemic-type strains from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia; previously described ORSA clonal-type isolates; 13 vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) isolates, and two high-level vancomycin-resistant, vanA-positive strains (VRSA). Among the isolates from the United States, we identified eight lineages, designated as pulsed-field types (PFTs) USA 100 through USA 800, seven of which included both ORSA and oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. With {{the exception of the}} PFT pairs USA 100 and USA 800, and USA 300 and USA 500, each of the PFTs had a unique multilocus sequence type and spa type motif. The USA 100 PFT, previously designated as the New York/Tokyo clone, was the most common PFT in the database, representing 44 % of the ORSA isolates. USA 100 isolates were typically multiresistant and included {{all but one of the}} <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>VISA</b> strains and both VRSA isolates. Multiresistant ORSA isolates from the USA 200, - 500, and - 600 PFTs have PFGE patterns similar to those of previously described epidemic strains from Europe and Australia. The USA 300 and - 400 PFTs contained community isolates resistant only to β-lactam drugs and erythromycin. Noticeably absent from the U. S. database were isolates with the previously described Brazilian and EMRSA 15 PFGE patterns. These data suggest that there are a limited number of ORSA genotypes present in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The {{conventional}} wisdom is that {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, prompted a substantive change in U. S. immigration policy on visa issuances and the grounds for excluding foreign nationals from the United States. A series of laws enacted in the 1990 s, however, may have done as much or more to set current <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>visa</b> policy and the legal grounds for exclusion. This report’s review of the legislative developments in visa policy over the past 20 years and analysis of the statistical trends in visa issuances and denials provide a nuanced study of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>visa</b> policy and the grounds for exclusion. Foreign nationals not already legally residing in the United States who wish to come to the United States generally must obtain a visa to be admitted. Those admitted on a permanent basis are known as immigrants or legal permanent residents (LPRs), while those admitted on a temporary basis are known as nonimmigrants (such as tourists, foreign students, diplomats, temporary agricultural workers, and exchange visitors). They must first meet a set of criteria specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that determine whether they are eligible for admission. The burden of proof is on the foreign national to establish eligibility for a visa. Conversely, foreign nationals also must not be deemed inadmissible according to other specified grounds in § 212 (a) of the INA. These § 212 (a) inadmissibility criteria are health-related grounds; criminal history; security and terrorist concerns; public charge (e. g., indigence); seeking to work without proper labor certification; illegal entrants and immigration law violations; ineligible for citizenship; and aliens illegally present or previously removed. The number of aliens excluded on the basis of § 212 (a) of the INA has fluctuated over the years. In FY 2008, § 212 (a) exclusions of prospective nonimmigrants hit 35, 403 and surpassed the prior high point of 34, 750 in FY 1998. For prospective LPRs, § 212 (a) exclusions peaked in FY 1998 and FY 1999, reaching over 89, 000 in both years. The § 212 (a) exclusions of prospective LPRs fell from FY 2000 through FY 2003, then began climbing to reach 77, 080 in FY 2008. Most LPR petitioners who were excluded on § 212 (a) grounds from FY 1994 through FY 2004 were rejected because the Department of State (DOS) determined that the aliens were inadmissible as likely public charges. By FY 2004, the proportion of public charge exclusions had fallen but remained the top basis for denial. The lack of proper labor certification was another leading ground for exclusion from FY 1994 through FY 2004. By FY 2008, however, illegal presence and previous orders of removal from the United States was the leading ground. Exclusions of nonimmigrant petitions have a somewhat different pattern than that of immigrant petitions. Violations of immigration law were the leading category from FY 1994 through FY 2006, but fell to the second ranking by FY 2008. Illegal presence and prior removal became the leading ground in FY 2008. Over time, criminal activity has become a more common ground for refusal, and has represented a larger portion of exclusions among nonimmigrant petitioners than it was for immigrant petitioners. Legislation aimed at comprehensive immigration reform may take a fresh look at the grounds for excluding foreign nationals enacted over the past two decades. Expanding the grounds for inadmissibility, conversely, might be part of the legislative agenda among those who support more restrictive immigration reform policies. More specifically, the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who allegedly attempted to ignite an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, has heightened scrutiny of the visa process and grounds for exclusion.

This study, a product of that effort, focuses on the selection of people admitted under work-related categories of the U:S. immigration system. Chapter 1, "The Role of Immigration in a Changing <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Economy, " shows the ways in which economic-stream newcomers have a positive influence on <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> economic, social, and cultural institutions.

" However, the current employment-based immigration system described in Chapter 2, "Current <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Employment- Related <b>Visa</b> Categories, " no longer guarantees that the United States will attract the kind of permanent and temporary workers the country needs.

40|$|The {{collection}} contains documents, diaries and personal correspondence of Ernst Scheuer and Rosi Moses Scheuer. They document their life in Paris and their inprisonment in French detention centers in 1939 - 40 and in Spanish prisons 1940 - 41. The documents illustrate {{the struggle for}} <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Visas</b> and the subsequent emigration to the United States, {{as well as the}} efforts to establish themselves in New York. The collection also contains numerous manuscripts written by Ernst and Rosi Scheuer, a large number of them being autobiographical. Ernst Scheuer was born July 22, 1906 in Frankfurt/Main. He studied arts in Frankfurt and worked as an editor in Berlin. In 1933 (?) he emigrated to Paris where he worked as a writer. - Rosi Moses was born November 16, 1914 in the small German town Zehdenick/Havel; she emigrated to Paris in 1933 where she worked as a German language teacher and secretary. When Ernst Scheuer was brought to a detention center in Sourioux near Vierzon in September 1939, Rosi, who had a US-Visa since 1935, tried to rescue Ernst by getting married and to travel together to the USA. Instead, Rosi was arrested in May 1940 and sent to a detention center in Southern France. After her release in the summer of 1940, Ernst and Rosi met in Marseille and got married on August 1, 1940. When they attempted to cross the Spanish border on their way to Portugal, the Spanish police arrested Ernst and Rosi Scheuer. They stayed in prison for ca. seven months before being forced to return to France. In July 1941, Ernst and Rosi Scheuer were finally allowed to cross Spain. On August 6, 1941, they took the ill-fated ship 'Navemar' in Seville and sailed via Lisbon to New York, where they arrived on September 12, 1941. Ernst’s mother and sister who already lived in New York helped them to settle down. Rosi worked as a secretary, and Ernst tried to establish himself as a writer. Later, Ernst Scheuer acquired a bookstore in Manhattan. In 1946, their daughter Irene was born. Ernst Scheuer died of cancer in 1976, Rosi Scheuer died in 2000 in New York. digitize...|$|R
