2500|$|The U.S. Coast Guard {{described}} the Bradleys {{design and construction}} as: ... typical arrangement for self-unloading type vessels with a forepeak and large cargo area, and hawing propulsion machinery aft. [...] These areas were separated by two transverse watertight bulkheads, the collision bulkhead at frame 12, and the engine room forward bulkhead at frame 173. [...] The cargo hold space was divided into five compartments by screen bulkheads above the tunnel and the <b>unloading</b> <b>machinery</b> was located in the conveyor room just forward the cargo spaces. [...] The entire 475 foot length of the cargo space was open longitudinally through the tunnel and conveyor room.|$|E
50|$|Lakers are {{generally}} bulk carriers; that is, they carry cargoes of rock, ore, salt or grain in large contiguous holds, not packed in containers. The earlier ships required rail cars unloading on ore docks and <b>unloading</b> <b>machinery</b> at the receiving docks, but modern lakers are self unloaders, {{allowing them to}} unload faster and in more ports.|$|E

50|$|Its {{dry dock}} is 640m length and 65m breadth, It can {{accommodate}} ships up to 400,000 tonnes DWT. Two cranes with {{a span of}} 140 meters & height of 85 meters together capable of handling up to 1200 Ton block and two Level Luffing cranes are erected to service this dry dock. To facilitate afloat fit-out and commissioning of ships, including afloat repairs, a 300-meter long quay, with the capacity for berthing on both sides, has been constructed with adequate draft and serviced by a Level Luffing crane. The entrance of the dry dock also has a 100-meter extension track for the Goliath cranes for <b>unloading</b> heavy <b>machinery</b> and equipment weighing up to 1200 Tons directly from ships and heavy lift barges.|$|R

In this paper, {{all work}} {{are on the}} basic of fork truck frame system pivot-jointed {{optimization}} design job. 3 D solid model of fork truck frame system was built by using Pro/E software based on optimized data, which was guided into ADAMS and the fork truck frame system virtual prototype model was generated, dynamics simulation about working process of truck’s frame was proceeded, load and displacement curve of major component were obtained. FEM analysis was done under ANSYS, the above dynamic analysis data were taken as boundary condition, thus completing the CAE analysis of fork truck frame system. Forewords Fork truck {{is a kind of}} load and <b>unload</b> transporting <b>machinery</b> widely applied to various worksite such as dock, workshop, building filed, etc. Fork truck frame system is an important mechanism that realize loading and unloading. Force bearing on components is comparatively complicated, and dead weight is comparatively big, the working pose varys with time. Accurate force bearing analyses is very difficult to carry out strenuously aiming at each component if using the graphic method or traditional analytic method [1]. The paper takes CPCD series fork truck frame structure as an example(shown in Fig. 1), dynamic...|$|R
500|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across the Channel on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by British forces, the other at Omaha by American forces. A severe storm on 19 June destroyed the Omaha harbour. The Arromanches harbour was repaired and remained in use {{for the next ten}} months, with a maximum capacity of [...] of stores per day. Of the British supplies landed in Normandy by the end of August, [...] via the Mulberry harbour and [...] in via the small harbours at Port-en-Bessin and Courseulles-sur-Mer. Most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July. The most important use of the Mulberry harbour was the <b>unloading</b> of heavy <b>machinery</b> that could not be brought across the beaches. Artificial breakwaters (Gooseberries) sheltered hundreds of ships during the storm of 17–23 June, and provided shelter for craft unloading stores at Juno and Sword. A joint Anglo-American oil depot was constructed at Port-en-Bessin, fed via buoyed pipes known as [...] "Tombola" [...] from oil tankers moored offshore. Using this method, [...] of petrol (half for the Second Army) was delivered by the end of August, by which time the underwater pipelines constructed in Operation Pluto were ready.|$|R
5000|$|Algoma Central {{asserts that}} new design and new {{technology}} {{will make the}} new vessels 45 percent more energy efficient than their earlier vessels.The Equinox is a [...] "gearless bulker" [...] meaning {{she will have to}} use shore facilities to load and unload. The first four of the [...] "Equinox" [...] class of vessels will be like this while the second four will have self-unloading machinery, allowing them to use ports without cranes. The self-loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>machinery</b> consists of a conveyor belt below the holds, and a long boom with a converyer belt on deck. The boom can be swung outboard to Port or Starboard.|$|E
5000|$|Also of note is {{the steamer}} Edward L. Ryerson, widely {{known for her}} artistic design and being the only {{remaining}} straight-decked (without self <b>unloading</b> <b>machinery)</b> freighter still in active service on the US side of the Great Lakes (the only other US straight decker still listed is John Sherwin, has not sailed since 1981 and is currently docked in Detour, Michigan after conversion to a self-unloader and repowering was halted in November 2008). In the summer of 2006, Edward L. Ryerson was fitted out and put into service following a long-term lay-up that began in 1998. Edward L. Ryerson was often used as a museum boat for tours. She was put back into service {{due to a lack}} of reliable hulls on the Lakes, and a need for more tonnage. (The Canadian fleet retains a number of active straight-deckers for use in transporting grain, which is not well suited for self-unloading equipment. Most US grain is currently transported by rail.) ...|$|E
