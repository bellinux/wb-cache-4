5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes flared <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of BhimaI, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The Falcons lost Super Bowl XXXIII by a {{score of}} 34–19, which earned the Broncos their second {{consecutive}} Super Bowl victory. The game was anticipated as a match <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Vikings and the Broncos, and the Falcons' presence in the game was noted as an anticlimax. The night before the game, safety Eugene Robinson was arrested for soliciting a prostitute. Although Robinson played in the game, the distraction contributed to a poor performance by the Falcons team, who managed only six points in six drives deep into Denver territory and surrendered a season-high point total.|$|E

5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and point to a way of transcending them.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{a debate}} on the {{national}} question in Europe opened <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> majority of the SWP and a movement led by Van Heijenoort, Albert Goldman and Felix Morrow. This minority anticipated that the Nazi dictatorship would be replaced with capitalism rather than by a socialist revolution, leading to the revival of Stalinism and social democracy. In December 1943, they criticised the SWP's view as underestimating the rising prestige of Stalinism and the opportunities for the capitalists to use democratic concessions. The SWP's central committee argued that democratic capitalism could not revive, resulting in either military dictatorship by the capitalists or a workers' revolution. It held that this would reinforce the need for building the Fourth International, and adhered rigidly to their interpretation of Trotsky's works.|$|E

In the process, a gap opened <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, threatening both with encirclement. For this failure, Kesselring relieved von Mackensen of his command, replacing him with General der Panzertruppe Joachim Lemelsen. Fortunately for the Germans, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, obsessed with the capture of Rome, failed {{to take advantage of}} the situation and the Tenth Army was able to withdraw to the next line of defence, the Trasimene Line, where it was able to link up with the Fourteenth Army and then conduct a fighting withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|SaGa is {{a series}} of science fiction {{role-playing}} video games produced by Square, now Square Enix. The series originated on the Game Boy in 1989 as the creation of Akitoshi Kawazu. It has since continued across multiple platforms, from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the PlayStation 2, and like the Final Fantasy series, the story in each SaGa game is independent of its counterparts. The music of the SaGa series consists of musical scores and arranged albums from various composers. Some of these composers have created soundtracks and pieces for other Square Enix franchises including the Final Fantasy series and Mana series. The SaGa series is divided <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> original series, released as the Final Fantasy Legend series in North America, the Romancing SaGa series, the SaGa Frontier series, and Unlimited SaGa.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{has some}} special {{considerations}} that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains {{to the west}} act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, {{which can lead to}} flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two or three days in advance of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar {{defended the}} WWE Championship against Eddie Guerrero at No Way Out on February 15. Goldberg {{attacked}} Lesnar with a spear while the referee was unconscious, allowing Guerrero to pin Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar then attempted an F-5 on Guerrero but Guerrero reversed {{it into a}} DDT on the title belt and executed a frog splash to win the WWE Championship. An angry Lesnar then began feuding with Goldberg, blaming him for losing his title, and a match was set <b>up</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two at WrestleMania XX on March 14. During the feud with Goldberg, Lesnar was also at odds with Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was shown suggesting to Goldberg that he attack Lesnar at No Way Out. After Lesnar attacked Austin on Raw and stole his four-wheeler, Austin was inserted as the special guest referee for the WrestleMania match. On the March 4 episode of SmackDown!, Lesnar defeated Hardcore Holly in his last match on a weekly WWE televised show. Behind the scenes, it was widely known that the match was Goldberg's last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, rumors surfaced that Lesnar too was leaving {{to pursue a career}} in the National Football League (NFL). As a result, Lesnar's match with Goldberg became a fiasco as the fans at Madison Square Garden jeered and heckled both professional wrestlers vociferously. Goldberg won after a Jackhammer and both men subsequently received Stone Cold Stunners from Austin.|$|E
