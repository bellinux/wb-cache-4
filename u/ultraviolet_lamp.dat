25|$|Mushrooms {{can be a}} good dietary {{source of}} vitamin D2 if exposed to {{ultraviolet}} light. Mushrooms contain high concentrations of ergosterol (provitamin D2). Sunlight or ultraviolet radiation (UV) triggers conversion to viosterol (previtamin D2), which then turns into vitamin D2. Low values in mushrooms occur if there is little to no exposure to sunlight or UV light. When fresh mushrooms or dried powders are purposely exposed to artificial sunlight by use of an industrial <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamp,</b> vitamin D2 levels can be concentrated to much higher levels.|$|E
25|$|Reasonable {{exposure}} to ultraviolet {{radiation from the}} sun {{can be a good}} source of vitamin D. One minimal erythemal dose of sunlight UV radiation provides the equivalent of about 20,000 IU of vitamin D2, taken as an oral supplement. If an adult's arms and legs are exposed to a half minimal erythemal UV radiation, it is the same as taking 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 through an oral supplement. This exposure of 10–15 minutes, on a frequency of two to three times per week will cause the adult's skin to produce enough vitamin D. It is not necessary to expose the face to the UV, as facial skin provides little vitamin D3. Individuals whose metabolism makes taking oral vitamin D ineffective are able, through {{exposure to}} an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamp</b> that emits UV-B radiation, to achieve a 25 (OH) D blood level.|$|E

2500|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} is {{invisible to the}} human eye, but illuminating certain materials with UV radiation causes the emission of visible light, causing these substances to glow with various colors. [...] This is called fluorescence, and has many practical uses. [...] Black lights are required to observe fluorescence, since other types of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps</b> emit visible light which drowns out the dim fluorescent glow.|$|R
40|$|Exposure to solar {{radiation}} is increasingly {{being associated with}} a risk of cutaneous melanoma, and some risk has also been attributed to exposure to fluorescent lights. The risk of cutaneous melanoma associated with exposure to some sources of artificial ultraviolet radiation was examined in a case-control study in a Scottish population with fairly low exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation. The risk was not significantly or consistently raised for exposure to fluorescent lights at home or at work. The use of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps</b> and sunbeds, however, {{was associated with a}} significantly increased risk (relative risk = 2. 9; 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 6. 4), and the risk was significantly related to duration of use. The risk was particularly raised among people who have first used [corrected] <b>ultraviolet</b> beds or <b>lamps</b> more than [corrected] five years before presentation (relative risk = 9. 1; 95 % confidence intervals 2. 0 - 40. 6), in whom it was significantly related to cumulative hours of exposure.

50|$|Sperti {{graduated}} from the University of Cincinnati in 1923. Shortly afterwards he was named Director of the Research Laboratory. His invention of an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamp</b> to irradiate milk to add Vitamin D without changing the flavor was sold to General Foods for US$300,000.

5000|$|While {{this process}} {{may not have}} the {{permanence}} of other processes such as platinum or palladium printing, it is much less expensive and more user friendly. The core resource used is silver sulphamate (NH2SO3Ag) which can be prepared on site from sulphamic acid. The sensitizer used is very slow, so printing must be by contact with a large format negative, using an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamp</b> or sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|Typically a short {{duration}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamp</b> or laser source {{illuminates the}} phosphor coating {{which in turn}} luminesces visibly.

50|$|Color {{is usually}} {{indicated}} by WW for warm white, EW for enhanced (neutral) white, CW for cool white (the most common), and DW for the bluish daylight white. BL {{is used for}} <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps</b> commonly used in bug zappers. BLB is used for blacklight-blue lamps employing a woods glass envelope to filter out most visible light, commonly used in nightclubs. Other non-standard designations apply for plant lights or grow lights.|$|R
50|$|DBDs {{can be used}} to {{generate}} optical radiation by the relaxation of excited species in the plasma. The main application here is the generation of UV-radiation. Those excimer <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps</b> can produce light with short wavelengths which {{can be used to}} produce ozone in industrial scales.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry uses {{large amounts of}} Ultrapure Water (UPW) in the wafer fabrication process. Producing UPW involves energy-intensive operations, such as membrane separations, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps,</b> and continuous pumping and recirculation systems. Indirect energy costs can also be allocated to steps in the UPW process. Motorola recognizes that by reducing UPW consumption, energy savings will result. Energy conservation can also be achieved by improving the UPW generation process itself and by recycling or reclaiming UPW and other water streams...|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} bath {{consisted of}} a wooden stand which contained an electrical power supply. Above the wooden stand was a green sheet-metal cabinet lid which contained many <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps,</b> and four additional lamps which could be set into the lid and hooked in with metallic clamps.

50|$|Gel polish is a {{long-lasting}} {{variety of}} nail polish {{made up of}} a type of methacrylate polymer. It is painted on the nail similar to traditional nail polish, but does not dry. Instead it is cured under an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>lamp</b> or ultraviolet LED. While regular nail polish formulas typically last two to seven days without chipping, gel polish can last as long as two weeks with proper application and home care. Gel polish can be more difficult to remove than regular nail polish. It is usually gently pushed off (often with a wooden stick) after soaking the nails in pure acetone (the solvent used in most nail polish removers) for eight to fifteen minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are used}} to {{sterilize}} workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. Commercially available low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps emit about 86% of their radiation at 254 nanometers (nm), with 265nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve. UV at these germicidal wavelengths damage a microorganism's DNA so that it cannot reproduce, making it harmless, (even though the organism may not be killed). Since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet rays in small cracks and other shaded areas, these lamps are used only {{as a supplement to}} other sterilization techniques.|$|R
500|$|The BOT then ordered ten new {{prototype}} subway cars made {{of stainless}} steel from the Budd Company.
