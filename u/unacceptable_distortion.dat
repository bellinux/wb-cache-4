In this paper we propose a novel mode selection method for offline compression of depth maps by selecting modes collaboratively considering an entire row of macroblocks together. For selecting these modes while encoding, we propose a novel distortion criteria that incorporates rendering distortions instead of distortion of depth map itself. A genetic algorithm based optimization technique is used for the mode selection.

Modern focal-plane {{shutters}} are dual curtain traveling slit shutters. They provide faster shutter speeds by timing the second shutter curtain to close sooner {{after the first}} curtain opens and narrowing the slit [...] "wiping" [...] the exposure on the film, instead of moving the curtains faster across film gate, because they are too fragile to survive the necessary accelerative shocks. Long wipe times can cause cartoonish distortion of very fast moving objects instead of truly freezing their motion. (The use of leaning in illustration {{to give the impression}} of speed is a caricature of the distortion caused by the slow wiping FP shutters of Graflex large format SLRs from {{the first half of the}} 20th century.) <b>Unacceptable</b> <b>distortion</b> (as well as difficulties in precisely timing very narrow slits) had stalled traditional cloth horizontal-travel FP shutters for 35 mm cameras at 1/1000 sec. and 1/60 sec. X-sync for decades. The F's Hi-Synchro shutter provided faster speeds by having its metal blades travel vertically, i.e. along the shorter side of the 24×36 mm frame. In 1982, the Nikon FM2 (Japan) reached 1/4000 sec. (and 1/200 sec. flash X-sync) with a vertical-travel FP shutter using honeycomb pattern etched titanium foil blades, stronger and lighter than plain stainless steel. This allowed quicker shutter-curtain travel time (3.6 milliseconds, about half of earlier vertical, metal bladed shutters) and thereby truly faster shutter speeds. The Nikon FE2 (Japan), with an improved version of this shutter, boosted X-sync speed to 1/250 sec. (3.3 ms curtain travel time) in 1983. The fastest FP shutter ever used in a film camera was the 1/12,000 sec. (1/300 sec.

Quenching not only dictates the mechanical characteristics of the product but also induces residual stresses that can cause <b>unacceptable</b> <b>distortions</b> during machining and unfavourable stresses in service. Predicting and controlling stress generation during quenching of large AA 2618 forgings is therefore of great interest. Since possible precipitation during quenching may affect the local yield strength of the material and thus impact the level of macro-scale residual stresses, consideration of this phenomenon is required. A phenomenological material model accounting for precipitation in a simple way is used instead of modelling in detail precipitation that occurs during quenching. The required model parameters are identified using {{a limited number of}} tensile tests achieved after representative interrupted cooling paths in a Gleeble machine. This model is used in FE computations of stress generation during quenching of large massive AA 2618 forgings for compressor impellers. The residual strain and stress profiles are compared with neutron diffraction measurements carried out at SALSA and STRESS-SPEC diffractometers in as-quenched and in T 6 conditions.

40|$|The International X-ray Project {{seeks to}} build an x-ray {{telescope}} using thousands of pieces of thin and flexible glass mirror segments. Each mirror segment must be bonded into a housing in nearly perfect optical alignment without distortion. Forces greater than 0. 001 Newton, or displacements greater than 0. 5 m of the glass, cause <b>unacceptable</b> optical <b>distortion.</b> All known epoxies shrink as they cure. Even the epoxies with {{the least amount of}} shrinkage (< 0. 01 %) cause <b>unacceptable</b> optical <b>distortion</b> and misalignment by pulling the mirror segments towards the housing as it cures. A related problem is that the shrinkage is not consistent or predictable so that it cannot be accounted for in the setup (i. e., if all of the bonds shrunk an equal amount, there would be no problem). A method has been developed that allows two components to be joined with epoxy {{in such a way that}} reduces the displacement caused by epoxy shrinking as it cures to less than 200 nm. The method involves using ultraviolet-cured epoxy with a displacement sensor and a nanoactuator in a control loop. The epoxy is cured by short-duration exposures to UV light. In between each exposure, the nano-actuator zeroes out the displacement caused by epoxy shrinkage and thermal expansion. After a few exposures, the epoxy has cured sufficiently to prevent further displacement of the two components. Bonding of optical elements has been done for many years, but most optics are thick and rigid elements that resist micro-Newton-level forces without causing distortion. When bonding thin glass optics such as the 0. 40 -mm thick IXO X-ray mirrors, forces in the micro- and milli-Newton levels cause unacceptable optical figure error. This innovation can now repeatedly and reliably bond a thin glass mirror to a metal housing with less than 0. 2 m of displacement (< 200 nm).

Silicon wafers will be used for mask substrates for an alpha-class EUVL exposure tool due to their low-defect levels and high quality surface finish.

40|$|A high-energy (0. 5 - 3. 0 TeV {{centre of}} mass) electron-positron Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is being studied at CERN {{as a new}} physics facility. The design study has been {{optimized}} for 3 TeV centre-of-mass energy. Intense bunches injected into the main linac must have unprecedentedly small emittances to achieve the design luminosity 1035 cm- 2 s- 1 required for the physics experiments. The positron and electron bunch trains will be provided by the CLIC injection complex. This thesis describes an optics design and performance of a positron damping ring developed for producing such ultra-low emittance beam. The linear optics of the CLIC damping ring is optimized by {{taking into account the}} combined action of radiation damping, quantum excitation and intrabeam scattering. The required beam emittance is obtained by using a TME (Theoretical Minimum Emittance) lattice with compact arcs and short period wiggler magnets located in dispersionfree regions. The damping ring beam energy is chosen as 2. 42 GeV. The lattice features small values of the optical functions, a large number of compact TME cells, and a large number of wiggler magnets. Strong sextupole magnets are needed for the chromatic correction which introduces significant nonlinearities, decreasing the dynamic aperture. The nonlinear optimization of the lattice is described. An appropriate scheme of chromaticity correction is determined that gives reasonable dynamic aperture and zero chromaticity. The nonlinearities induced by the short period wiggler magnets and their influence on the beam dynamics are also studied. In addition, approaches for absorption of synchrotron radiation power produced by the wigglers are discussed. Realistic misalignments of magnets and monitors increase the equilibrium emittance. The sensitivity of the CLIC damping ring to various kinds of alignment errors is studied. Without any correction, fairly small vertical misalignments of the quadrupoles and, in particular, the sextupoles, introduce <b>unacceptable</b> <b>distortions</b> of the closed orbit as well as intolerable spurious vertical dispersion and coupling due to the strong focusing optics of the damping ring. A sophisticated beam-based correction scheme has been developed in order to bring the design target emittances and the dynamic aperture back to the ideal value. The correction using dipolar correctors and several skew quadrupole correctors allows a minimization of the closed-orbit distortion, the cross-talk between vertical and horizontal closed orbits, the residual vertical dispersion and the betatron tune coupling. The small emittance, short bunch length, and high current in the CLIC damping ring could give rise to collective effects which degrade the quality of the extracted beam. A number of possible instabilities and an estimate of their impact on the ring performance are briefly surveyed.

Similarity measure between images is an important portion of image analysis, broadly used for image retrieval, quality assessment, and visual tracking. For image summarization, Simakov et al.

In view of this and the growing awareness {{of the quality of the}} electricity supply, the theory of harmonics in power systems is reviewed. The sources and the effects of harmonics are investigated. The algorithms that are used for the frequency analysis of power systems are investigated and compared. These algorithms comprise the companion circuit method, the Gauss-Seidel method, the Newton-Raphson method and the current injection method. In addition various freely and commercially available software packages for the harmonic analysis of power systems are studied and compared. For this purpose a questionnaire was sent out to software developers and suppliers. This questionnaire as well as the results of the comparative investigation are presented. A power system has many configurations due to the switching of power capacitors on to and off the power grid. Some of these configurations can result in <b>unacceptable</b> <b>distortion</b> levels. An existing state space method is investigated to analyse these configurations and an example is worked through, to illustrate how this method works. However, this state space model is only applicable to radial power systems and there have to be power capacitors at the end of every feeder amongst others. Because of these significant disadvantages of this method, a new analytical approach or theoretical foundation for the analysis of power capacitors in radial as well as meshed power systems is developed in this thesis. For this purpose the branch current and nodal voltage equations are determined. Redundant nodal voltages are eliminated from the set of branch current equations. The remaining equations and the nodal voltage equations are then combined to form a system realisation. This system realisation is still overspecified and a further reduction is done to obtain a minimal realisation of the power system. This approach is demonstrated analytically and numerically by way of five case studies. This approach is also verified by comparing it with the current injection method. Identical results are obtained with the state space approach and with the current injection method, demonstrating that the state space approach is indeed valid...|$|E
40|$|Large {{diameter}} piles {{have increasingly}} been used, especially for offshore foundations. Most of the piles {{that have been}} used offshore have been open-ended. There is evidence from previous work that closed-ended piles have merits over open-ended piles; they have a greater ultimate axial capacity and are easier to drive than open-ended piles of the same outer diameter. However, because a greater volume of soil is displaced, closed-ended piles give rise to much greater ground heave. This additional heave may cause <b>unacceptable</b> <b>distortion</b> to the structure as each leg is fixed to the sea-bed in turn. For this reason, this research was commissioned. Laboratory studies of ground heave around driven open- and closed-ended piles (16 mm o. d.) were carried out. Two different types of specimen reconstituted from Speswhite Kaolin were prepared; semi-cylindrical and full cylindrical specimens each 450 mm in diameter and about 450 mm in height. The semi-cylindrical specimens were used to obtain qualitative data about the movements of soil around the driven pile. The full cylindrical specimens were used to take accurate measurements of the ground heave during pile driving and to study the influence of the ground heave on a small surcharged collar through which a pile was driven. A further series of tests investigated the effect of ground heave when a group of piles was driven through a larger surcharged collar which was used to represent the mudmat of an offshore structure. The lateral movement of soil at around the mid-depth of a driven pile agreed with the cavity expansion model (plane strain analysis) assuming undrained conditions and no vertical movement. Closed-ended piles were found to generate about four times the magnitude of ground heave compared to open-ended piles with an area ratio of 34 %. Ground heave appeared to be unaffected by overconsolidation ratio and rate of pile driving (22 to 150 blows/min.). However, maximum vertical consolidation pressure seemed to have a small effect. A remarkably good agreement was obtained between the field data and the results of this investigation when both were made dimensionless. The surcharged collar and model mudmat generally settled during pile driving. However, when very low surcharge pressures were used, the collar and mudmat were lifted up. For pile groups, the surcharged mudmat tilted towards the pile being driven. The magnitude of this tilt for the mudmat was greater when closed-ended piles were used...|$|E

To improve their performance, a ferromagnetic core surrounded by permanent magnets whose like poles face the core is proposed as the bias magnetic field source; this configuration can outperform a single magnet by an order of magnitude. Coil configurations that result in linear and radial polarisations of the ultrasonic waves are also compared; the linear polarisation was found to yield higher mode purity and penetration depths. Furthermore, the optimal impedance of the EMAT coil is discussed. Although improvements in EMAT sensitivity of up to 20 dB were achieved, {{this is not enough}} to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (> 30 dB) without averaging {{over a long period of}} time. Therefore, efficient encoding techniques to achieve a greater SNR over shorter periods of time were investigated. The maximum length of conventional coded sequences and hence the maximum SNR increase is limited by the location of the closest reflectors. In this thesis, coded sequences that have receive intervals are introduced so that their overall length and therefore the SNR increase is not affected by the location of the reflectors; the proposed sequences can produce a given SNR increase an order of magnitude faster than averaging. These sequences are then used to drive EMATs using less than 0. 5 W and a repetition rate of 10 Hz; this rate can be perceived by a human inspector as quasi-real-time. Moreover, a set of pseudo-orthogonal sequences that have common receive intervals can simultaneously be transmitted through several transducers. This makes it possible to increase the number of active elements in an array, which combined with synthetic focusing, can increase the resolution and contrast of the resulting image without affecting the frame rate. Binary quantisation is also investigated in this thesis. It can be used with low-SNR systems resulting in minimal loss of information while reducing the data throughput and the complexity of the electronics, especially in arrays with many elements. The theory behind binary quantisation is reviewed and the maximum input SNR range that does not cause <b>unacceptable</b> <b>distortions</b> is investigated. Finally, the first low-power, pulse-echo EMAT phased array system is proposed. This array can perform similarly to conventional piezoelectric arrays mounted on a wedge to excite angled shear wave in the sample. Racetrack coils are used as the array elements laid out in an overlapping pattern that minimises inter-element crosstalk and results in an array element width and pitch equivalent to 1 and 2 / 3 of the wavelength respectively. Coded sequences that have receive intervals are used to reduce the drive power to just a few watts (24 Vpp). The performance of an 8 -channel, 1 -MHz prototype in the detection of surface cracks which have a length of less than 1 mm is reported. Open Acces...|$|R
