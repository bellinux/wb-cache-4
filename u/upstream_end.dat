25|$|The Volga, widened for {{navigation}} purposes {{with construction}} of huge dams {{during the years}} of Joseph Stalin's industrialization, is of great importance to inland shipping and transport in Russia: all the dams in the river have been equipped with large (double) ship locks, so that vessels of considerable dimensions can travel from the Caspian Sea almost to the <b>upstream</b> <b>end</b> of the river.|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} here concerns {{the effect of}} grain structure on electromigration failure in pure A 1 and A 1 - 2 wt. % Cu- 1 wt. % Si lines. The grain structure of fine lines were controlled by annealing after pattering to promote the formation of ``bamboo`` structures. Significant improvements in the median time to failure (MTF) and the deviation of the time to failure (DTF) were observed {{with the development of}} near-bamboo structures with polygranular-segment lengths shorter than {approximately} 5 {mu}m. The most common failure sites are voids or slits across bamboo grains at the <b>upstream</b> <b>ends</b> of polygranular segments. The time-to-failure decreases with the polygranular segment length, and can be significantly enhanced by controlling the grain structure...|$|R
40|$|Ribosomal RNA genes {{interrupted}} by type 1 insertions of 1 kb and 0. 5 kb have been sequenced through the insertion region and {{compared with an}} uninterrupted gene. The 0. 5 kb insertion is flanked by a duplication of a 14 bp segment that is present once in the uninterrupted gene; the 1 kb insertion is flanked by a duplication of 11 of these 14 bp. Short insertions are identical in their entire length to downstream regions of long insertions. No internal repeats occur in the insertion. The presence of target site duplications suggests that type 1 insertions arose {{by the introduction of}} transposable elements into rDNA. Short sequence homologies between the <b>upstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the insertions and the 28 S′ boundaries of the rRNA coding region suggest that short type 1 insertions may have arisen by recombination from longer insertions...|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} way of {{reaching}} the falls is through the Shooting the rapids boat ride, which originates {{from any of the}} resorts along Bumbungan and Balanac Rivers. Two skilled and licensed boatmen takes one to three passengers on wooden or fiberglass, long, narrow canoes to the falls, which could take more than an hour of paddling upstream depending on traffic and water level. The journey takes passengers through the narrow and verdant Pagsanjan Gorge lined with huge boulders, rocks and small waterfalls. The ride <b>upstream</b> <b>ends</b> in a natural pool below the falls where an optional raft ride takes visitors through a curtain of cascading water to the Devil's cave behind the falls. The return trip called Shooting the rapids is a thrill ride through fourteen rapids as the skilled boatmen maneuvers the boat through the narrow rocks as it head downstream.|$|R
25|$|Recklessness {{among the}} boatmen was common. Many {{accidents}} {{were due to}} excessive speed. Aqueduct #3 (Catoctin) had a sharp bend at the <b>upstream</b> <b>end,</b> had been {{the site of a}} number of collisions from boatmen going too fast. In July 1855, a freight boat collided with a packet boat which sank. One of the most frequent problems was careless boatmen in their rush to lock through, hitting lock gates.|$|E
25|$|The New Course started just {{downstream}} of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire {{side and}} finished opposite the <b>upstream</b> <b>end</b> of Phyllis Court, {{very close to}} the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate the unfairness of the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.|$|E
25|$|Athlone is {{a popular}} stop for {{pleasure}} craft along the River Shannon. Lough Ree, the largest lake on the Shannon, is a short distance upstream from Athlone, and many boat companies are based out of the town. For craft to pass through Athlone, {{it is necessary to}} use a lock in the river, which beside the weir and downstream of the current road bridge. The lock, weir, and bridge were all constructed by the Shannon navigation commissioners in the 1840s. Before then, boats used a canal, about {{a mile and a half}} long, to the west of the river. The canal was built by Thomas Omer for the Commissioners of Inland Navigation. Work started in 1757 and involved the work of over 300 men. Omer built a single lock, 120′ X 19′ with a rise of 4.5′, but there was also a guard lock, further upstream, with a single set of gates to protect the canal against floods. There were also two lay-bys, or harbours, one above the lock and another at the <b>upstream</b> <b>end.</b> The old canal is no longer navigable.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} experimental {{investigations of}} local heat transfer and detailed flow measurements in ribbed rectangular ducts and impinging jets. The advanced measurement methods, Liquid Crystal Thermography (LCT) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) are adopted to provide full field characteristics. The work {{consists of two}} parts, regarding rib-roughened rectangular ducts and impinging slot jets, respectively. Previous results have shown that rib-roughened ducts have good performance providing heat transfer enhancement by setting up large-scale secondary flows. Experiments in rectangular ducts of aspect ratio 1 to 8, roughened by ribs are carried out, to understand the fundamental mechanisms and enable further improvements. The rib arrangements of parallel and V-shaped ribs are considered in the heat transfer measurements. The flow separation zones behind the ribs {{are responsible for the}} streamwise sawtooth distribution of the heat transfer coefficient. Significant spanwise variations of the heat transfer coefficients are observed. Along the parallel rib-roughened wall, the heat transfer coefficients exhibit the highest values at the <b>upstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the ribs, decrease continuously along the spanwise direction, and reach the lowest values at the downstream ends of the ribs. For the V-shaped ribs, the distribution fashion is the same as parallel ribs for each half rib. The PIV investigation is then carried out to study how different secondary flows are generated, and how they interact with the original base flow and temperature field. More rib arrangements are included in the flow field experiments to study different effects. It is found that the main flow field is strongly altered by the inclined ribs. The parallel ribs cause the streamwise velocity component to decrease continuously along the spanwise direction from the <b>upstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the ribs to the downstream ends, coinciding with the spanwise heat transfer distribution. The expected secondary flows over the entire cross section are deduced from the measurements in different planes. The high momentum fluid carried by the downwash flow leads to high heat transfer coefficients at the <b>upstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the ribs, while the low momentum carried away from the ribbed walls by the upwash flow causes low heat transfer coefficients at the downstream ends of the ribs. In the second part of this work, LCT is applied on a flat surface on which confined impinging slot jets impinge to show the local heat transfer characteristics. The effects of the Reynolds number, the cross flow, the nozzle-to-plate spacing and the slot width are investigated. The heat transfer is proved to be enhanced by exhausting the spent air through symmetric exhaust ports, compared to those with cross flow effects. The multiple jets interact with each other at certain circumstances when their independent flow cell structure cannot be sustained. The slot width has a definite effect on the heat transfer coefficients and the narrow slot is found to give a larger average heat transfer coefficient at the same jet exit velocity...|$|R

500|$|An {{island in}} the Mississippi River near Minnehaha Creek once existed; the {{receding}} St. Anthony Falls divided into two as it passed around the island. The falls in the channel farthest from Minnehaha Creek reached the <b>upstream</b> <b>end</b> of the island first, cutting off water to the west channel and resulting in an [...] "abandoned waterfall" [...] {{at the north end}} of the channel. The abandoned west channel is now a grassy cul-de-sac known as the [...] "Deer Pen". Locating the abandoned waterfall was made difficult in recent years since the Deer Pen was partially filled with tons of fill dirt from nearby construction projects. Today, the mouth of Minnehaha Creek where it joins the Mississippi River is the lowest surface point in the city of Minneapolis at 686ft (209 m) above sea level.|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} has {{a number}} of structures which, because of their age, have historic value and are listed on the Listed Building register. At Vale Royal, the lock built in 1860 was retained as a sluice channel when a new lock was built in the 1890s. A swing bridge crosses the chamber. [...] The sluice at the <b>upstream</b> <b>end</b> is supported by two cast iron arches on rusticated piers. A swing bridge, made of wood and iron, crosses the small lock, which was the large lock until the construction of the new large lock in the 1890s. This has three sets of gates, and could accommodate a train of four barges when the outer gates were used. Again, a swing bridge crosses the lock. The gates are opened by a Pelton water turbine mechanism, and other features include a water levelling mechanism and a system for removing rubbish from behind the gates using jets of water which are controlled mechanically. [...] The lock keeper's cottage is also grade II listed. It was built in the 1850s, but was moved northwards by [...] during the 1890 reconstruction.|$|E

40|$|A {{large-scale}} pipeline {{test rig}} at Deltares, Delft, The Netherlands {{has been used}} for filling and emptying experiments. Tests have been conducted in a horizontal 250 mm diameter PVC pipe of 258 m length with control valves at the downstream and <b>upstream</b> <b>ends.</b> This paper investigates the accidental simultaneous closure of two automatic control valves during initial testing of the test rig. The simultaneous closure of both valves has induced upsurge and downsurge at the same time. Large water hammer and column separation have caused failure of pipe supports and leakage at pipe joints. The incident was caused by a fault in an electronic conversion box due to power failure. Afterwards the downstream end automatic valve has been modified to a manually operated valve to avoid the accidental simultaneous closure of the valves. The accidental transient event has been fully recorded with pressures, flow rates and water levels. The measurements of the accident are presented, analyzed and discussed in detail. Photographs show the damages to the system...|$|R

40|$|Tall alpine herb {{field is}} largely {{absent from the}} Tasmanian alpine zone. This absence has been {{attributed}} to marsupial grazing. Small islands in the upper Ouse River valley are partly dominated by Craspedia paludicola, a showy tall alpine herb. The herbs dominate on the <b>upstream</b> <b>ends</b> of the islands. The surrounding vegetation on the banks is mainly grassland. The tall herbs are a very minor element of the shore vegetation, occurring on the undercut banks. Grassy islands close to the river banks are grazed and few tall herbs are found there. Craspedia paludicola also occurs in small numbers in damp areas on grassy heaths at other grazed locations, largely within bushes with pungent leaves. The distribution of Craspedia paludicola suggests that it is highly palatable and can thus only survive in larger numbers away from the influence of vertebrate grazers (rabbits and marsupials). It appears that this species requires both disturbance and a lack of grazing to dominate an area...|$|R

The Straight Course has generally addressed the problems of unfairness: for example, between 1975 and 1984, 50.52% of races were won on Bucks and 49.31% on Berks (with the remainder dead heats). However, when a strong stream is flowing, the Berks station enjoys considerable shelter from the stream, particularly in the last ¼ mile. Conversely, {{when there is a}} strong south-westerly wind it is better to be on the Bucks station because it is more sheltered from the wind. The course is now piled and boomed along its entire length, except for crossing points. The booms can present a hazard for the inexperienced coxswain or steersman.|$|E

Complex patterns of interstitial water movement and related physicochemical complexity combined with differences in plant requirements, in part, may determine observed local distributions...|$|R

There is also little evidence of finer scale channels or valleys at the tips of the channels, which some authors have interpreted as showing the flow appeared suddenly from the subsurface with appreciable discharge, rather than accumulating gradually across the surface. Others have disputed the strong link between amphitheater heads of valleys and formation by groundwater for terrestrial examples, and have argued that the lack of fine scale heads to valley networks is due to their removal by weathering or impact gardening. Most authors accept that most valley networks are at least partly influenced and shaped by groundwater seep processes.|$|R
