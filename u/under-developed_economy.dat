40|$|The Iranian economy {{during the}} 1953 - 77 period {{is the subject}} of this thesis where the {{implications}} of oil revenue allocation for the country’s economy is examined in detail. The development of the all-important oil sector is studied in-depth and its inter-action with the newly-established modern industrial sector and the rest of the economy is assessed. The relationship between investment in industry and agriculture and oil revenue is examined. The overall economic development of the country is reviewed, especially the progress of the strong traditional sector and the relatively new modern sector. Having analysed these various aspects of the economy it was possible to establish whether any linkages existed between the oil industry and other sectors of the economy. Iran was an excellent case to study as it displayed many of the characteristics of an <b>under-developed</b> <b>economy,</b> yet it had its financial constraints suddenly removed as a result of increased oil revenue. However, due to its inadequate infrastructure the Iranian economy faced considerable problems and the level of economic development that had been hoped for did not materialise...|$|E
40|$|Kriesler {{describes}} the Fel’dman approach as ignoring “short run problems {{to concentrate on}} long run growth”, predominantly by abstracting “from short run {{problems associated with the}} realization of the surplus”. There are, however, two reasons for arguing that the Fel’dman model is in fact a short-term model masquerading as a long term one. Firstly, while it is generally valid in a long term growth model to ignore some short-run issues, it is not valid to assume that long term growth does not alter the environment of the model. Specifically, the Fel’dman model assumes an <b>under-developed</b> <b>economy</b> where (using Kaldor’s and Dobb’s definitions, as Kriesler has done) under-development is characterised by an insufficient stock of capital relative to labor. However, if Fel’dman policies succeed, then the capital stock will rapidly increase until it is sufficient to employ all available labor. Secondly, the Fel’dman model ignores the impact of technological change on the rate of growth. This is a quintessentially short-run assumption: it has no place in a long run theory, where the available techniques of production cannot be realistically “held constant”. Properly taking account of the first point, the transformational nature of growth, would alter the expected time paths of investment and consumption goods output from exponential and near-exponential respectively to logistic in shape. The degree to which resources are devoted to the investment sector would no longer affect the equilibrium rate of growth, but would instead determines how quickly the capacity-constrained rate of growth is reached. The following figure (which assumes a fixed labor supply and constant labor productivity) illus-trates the argument: This insight might suggest that it would be worthwhile to modify the Fel’dman schema t...|$|E
30|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{observational study}} showed that the prevalence rate of asthma in Henan Province, China was 0.73 %, whereas a prevalence rate of 1.05 % was reported in 2000 by Wang et al. [9]. The prevalence of asthma in other areas in China varied widely, with only 0.38 % in Qinghai Province [14] and 0.94 % in Guangdong Province [15]. Compared with previous studies, our research focused more on the differences in asthma prevalence between {{urban and rural areas}} and prevalence in areas with different economic levels. We determined the relationship between socioeconomic status and asthma prevalence. As reported previously, asthma comprises a range of heterogeneous phenotypes that differ in presentation, etiology, and pathophysiology. The risk factors for each recognized phenotype of asthma are complex and include genetic, environmental, and host factors. In terms of social environment and lifestyle, the increase in the prevalence of asthma was suggested to be related to modern Western culture [16, 17]. Chinese lifestyle is transitioning from traditional to modern more quickly and at a shorter period than in many other countries [18]. Compared with the data (prevalence rate[*]=[*] 1.05 %) obtained 10  years ago, the trend in the prevalence of asthma in Henan Province did not increase. This result {{may be related to the}} <b>under-developed</b> <b>economy</b> of Henan province. The province has a rural population of nearly 60 % [11], and this population retains the traditional lifestyle. The role of outdoor air pollution in causing asthma remains unclear [3]. Previous studies have shown that the prevalence rate of asthma among city residents was 1.1 %, which was significantly higher than that in rural areas (0.48 %). Outdoor environmental pollution may be the main reason for this phenomenon. A higher concentration of harmful gas and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is present in outdoor air in cities than in rural areas. PM 2.5 is not only associated with increasing asthma prevalence among children with related emergency and hospitalization [19], but also with adult-onset asthma [20].|$|E

40|$|Creating {{customer}} value and building stockholder value are the cornerstones {{for excellence in}} any business endeavour. In an <b>under-developed</b> <b>economy,</b> financial institutions may accomplish these objectives through a customer focus strategy and implementation of some quality management principles. However, with the increasing accessibility to new technologies and intensified competition, managers have been alerted and {{become more aware of}} the fact that achieving excellence is made even more difficult - financial institutions must now do much more to excel in the competitive retail banking environment of the new millennium. It is believed, and the findings of the present work support, that the formulation of a robust improvement model capable of guiding through the whole excellence pursuant process will provide a solid foundation for successfully meeting the challenge. The burning desire to enhance competitiveness and drive for achieving business excellence have nurtured the development of a new Business Excellence Model for successful implementation of TQM in retail banking. It was found that existing TQM and business excellence models provide only prescriptive and indicative roadmaps for companies to follow but fail to provide a complete coverage of TQM concepts, holistic measure of business excellence and validated links between TQM elements and business excellence. Hence, some financial institutions may cast doubts on their applicability of TQM because the relationships between TQM principles and the results of business excellence are not assessed. As such, it should be valuable to develop and provide a model, which is capable of covering the TQM essence in a structured way to drive total quality improvement efforts. The present research aims to develop a theory-driven as well as practical model for retail banks and the retail banking sector to achieve business excellence. In the process, Hong Kong retail banks and the Hong Kong retail banking sector were chosen as the context for the present research to obtain valuable data on how successful implementation of TQM essence could contribute to business excellence in a Chinese society. Both employees and customers inputs, being the important sources of stakeholder information, have been the basis for analysis. Top performing bank's executives were interviewed to identify the core activities and factors that determine their bank's success. Further, data were collected from executives of 47 retail banks in Hong Kong. Structural equation modelling was employed to develop the new Business Excellence Model (BEM). SEM's software programme was employed to analyse the goodness of fit of the new BEM. The forces of excellence indices and business excellence indices of the sampled retail banks were computed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique. The same procedure was also applied to the data collected ll from retail customers in the survey to measure the level of customer satisfaction of the retail banking sector. The indices of the BEM were then matched to the customer satisfaction indices of retail banks and retail banking sector for higher level of analysis. Findings of the present work indicate that the new BEM fits the data of the 47 retail banks very well. The BEM is a valid and reliable model for enabling retail banks to review the current level of practice in relation to their critical success factors continuously. With the new BEM, they can now measure and drive improvement in their critical activities and finally achieving business excellence. Similar results obtained for customer focus dimension of the BEM and the customer satisfaction measurement have further substantiated the robustness and usefulness of the new BEM. Hence, the new Business Excellence Model should be a valuable means for retail banks and the retail banking sector to pursue business excellence and to gain a competitive edge in the new millennium. </p...|$|E

We also show that, conditionally on temperatures, the impact of floods on TFP is statistically significant while the impact of droughts is not. We consider these results as a useful benchmark to measure the impact of global warming and/or measures intended to contain it on developing economies.

The ability of the attending medical personnel to access a patient’s medical history is critical for the quality of the treatment rendered. Unfortunately, today many lives are lost in low income economies during medical emergencies due to lack or inaccessibility of a patient’s medical information. One of the major contributing factors of this paucity in records is attributable to the absence of reliable and cost-efficient healthcare delivery systems that support patient identification and verification. Due to the current ubiquity of mobile devices with their concomitant digital cameras, this paper explores the feasibility and practicability of using mobile platform and facial recognition technology as a means to deploying a cost-efficient system for reliable patient identification and verification...|$|R

Though Asia's population is still younger than the West's, dramatic declines in childbearing and significant improvements in life expectancy are causing it to age faster.

40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to examine the place {{and the role of the}} {{informal}} sector in the macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms of <b>under-developed</b> <b>economies</b> where the Market can henceforth be considered as the major way of resource allocation. Starting from one theoretical and empirical though about we provide a conceptual framework to adopt a macroeconomic approach of the informal sector. Then, we choose one specific tool allowing to explain the market mechanisms: the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. Two conceptions of the informal sector havebeen developed. The first shows one sector formed by microenterprises of less than five workers,well integrated in the whole economy and acting with competitive considerations. The other showsthe informal sector formed by self-employed workers, barely integrated, and acting withtraditional logic. Ecuador is the general framework of our analysis. Two Social AcountingMatrixs are built, integrating the Ecuadorian informal sector in each alternative way for 1994. They serve as the database for large CGE models destinated to show the macroeconomics role ofthe informal sector such as its effect on the macro-adjustment process or the impact of macro-shocks on these activities.

But what about the developing economy counterparts of high-growth businesses in the U. S. ? In what way do differences in technological, institutional and cultural factors matter? Do they make high-growth businesses more or less numerous in <b>under-developed</b> <b>economies</b> than in the U. S? How, if at all, do they lead to differences in characteristics, growth rates and economic role of high growth businesses? This paper focuses on businesses operating in the city of Bangalore, India. Data compiled from statutory regulatory filings suggest that the number and proportion of businesses that expand rapidly are much lower than in the U. S. In-depth interviews with over a hundred entrepreneurs in Bangalore suggest that deficiencies in the performance of basic governmental functions (such as in collecting taxes and the maintaining land records) {{play a significant role in}} discouraging businesses from starting at or expanding to an economically efficient scale of operation. ______________________________________________ This paper is based on a research project conducted by a team based at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, funded by the Wadhwani Foundation.

Per Korstanje´s viewpoint, structuralism {{is limited to}} explain {{the difference between the}} myth and structure which resulted in the belief that Europe is an evolved civilization situated at the upper of the pyramid while others aboriginal organizations are at the bottom. This conception, which is enrooted in the founding parents of anthropology not only paved the ways for European ethnocentrism but also remains open today through the theory of development, where developed nations believe they are morally obliged to assist others non-aligned <b>under-developed</b> <b>economies.</b> Methodologically speaking, Levi Strauss´ thought structuralism to be applied only to aboriginal cultures, not to capitalist societies, as Maccannell insisted. Korstanje stresses that the chief goal of Claude Levi Strauss was the articulation of a periodic table with all cultures showing the commonalities between urban and primitive minds. Unlike Levi Strauss, MacCannell adamantly emphasizes on the divergence of totem and tourism which leads to a great misunderstanding. Last but not least, he ignores other forms of ancient tourism as practiced by Romans, Sumerians and Babylonians among many others. This happens because Maccannell trivializes tourism as a post-industrial form of alienation instead of focusing into its nature as cross-cultural rite of passage.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to better {{understand}} cross-national variations in the informalisation of employment by evaluating critically three contrasting explanations which variously represent informal employment as more prevalent in: poorer <b>under-developed</b> <b>economies</b> (modernisation thesis); societies with high taxes, corruption and state interference in the free market (neo-liberal thesis) and societies with inadequate levels of state intervention to protect workers (political economy thesis). To evaluate these rival explanations, the relationship between the variable informalisation of employment in 10 Central and East European countries, measured using data from a 2007 Eurobarometer cross-national survey involving 5769 face-to-face interviews, and their broader work and welfare regimes are analysed. The finding is that wealthier, less corrupt and more equal societies and those possessing higher levels of taxation, social protection and effective redistribution via social transfers are significantly more likely to have lower levels of informalisation. No evidence is thus found to support the neo-liberal tenets that the informalisation of employment results from high taxes and too much state interference in the free market but evidence is found to positively confirm the modernisation and political economy theses as explanations for the cross-national variations in the informalisation of employment. The paper concludes by discussing the tentative theoretical and policy implications of these findings and calling for further evaluation of their wider validity both longitudinally and across other global regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{policy evaluation}} approach mainly focuses on one specific policy parameter, typically the treatment status, while less {{attention has been}} given to the mechanisms through which development program operates. On other hand, in recent econometric literature there have been some significant developments in untangling the mechanisms of economic agents behavior, they shed light on preferences and technology parameters that are invariant to policy changes. The core of the thesis is to unlock the policy parameters in a unique World Bank programs in the challenging context of rural African economies, through acquiring knowledge about the causal mechanisms driving the change induced by the economic development policy. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, using a very unique setting of the World Bank infrastructure development program, I propose a strategy for the construction of building blocks that can be used as the ingredients of a structural system that explains the interconnection between the roads construction, access to markets and households' well being. I exploit the results from the innovative structural literature and apply them in <b>under-developed</b> <b>economies</b> setting, where standard economic theory often fails to explain the agents's behavior. The goal is to understand better the underlying developing economy principles, and to perform an ex-ante evaluation of the road construction on complex mechanisms of market exchange and welfare production function. This is interesting from both methodological and empirical point of view, as there are very few studies that apply newly developed structural econometric tools on real data. Moreover, in contrast to the carefully designed evaluations of many health and education initiatives in developing countries, our knowledge about the impacts of infrastructure projects has remained under-developed. In the second part of this thesis, I use the setting of The Gambia Community Driven Development Program, to explore the endogenous social network formation, that defines the dimensions of the informal economic exchange. The objective of the research is twofold: conduct an empirical research on a very rich dataset on social networks in rural Gambia, using the setting of the Community Driven Program Evaluation (CDDP) and focus on the endogenous link formation. The second goal is to disentangle the effect of the program that operates indirectly on the probability of forming a link, through modifying the existing network attributes or modifying exchange preferences of individuals; thus find convincing way to identify the program effect on preferences. ...|$|R

This includes {{the populations of}} not just the world’s only two billion-people economies—China and India—but also tiny nation states like Singapore, Bhutan, and Mongolia. Because Asia is large and diverse, integrated thinking on its economic development is difficult and thus relatively scarce. But, at the same time, Asia faces both risks and opportunities that are common across its constituent nation states. Many of these challenges can be effectively addressed only through joint effort, open discussion, and coordinated diplomacy—and so require a shared understanding of the forces driving those risks and opportunities. It is Asia {{that in the last}} thirty years forced the world’s economic centre of gravity to arc 5, 000 km east across the surface of our planet (Figure 1). It is Asia that accounted for 100 % of the poverty reduction on Earth in the last three decades. It is Asia’s developing economies that, {{over the course of the}} global financial crisis, accounted for 42 % of the world’s economic growth, six and a half times that contributed by the Transatlantic Axis (the US and the EU).

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{employer}} branding has recently gained prominence {{due to its}} involvement in talent management, reputation and the engagement agendas of organizations. This has {{been the result of}} emerging factors in the global economy, including rapid globalization, a growing skills gap (ageing population and baby boomers), global recession, intense global competition, skills shortages and the resulting talent wars. It is also believed that employer branding is an important ‘tool in the box’ for addressing the dual International Strategic Human Resource Management (ISHRM) problems of global integration and local responsiveness in complex organizations that operate globally but have to simultaneously respond to local needs. However, it is argued that employer branding’s ability to deal with the integration-responsiveness problem depends upon its authenticity; the reflection of the authentic voice of local employees in the employer brands through involving them in strategizing. In this thesis, I draw on signaling theory to help understand these problems and the limitations of current employer branding research, which has to date focused on signals transmitted from employers in the corporate headquarters to employees in the local subsidiaries (mainly top management level) but has significantly ignored the voice of employees at the local level by ignoring the ‘counter-signals’ flowing back from local employees. This provides a significant gap in the extant literature on employer branding, which I attempt to fill. In doing so, my study contributes to signaling theory in three directions: by examining how negative signals impact the signaling environment; how feedback-seeking behaviour improves the signaling process; and how signal precedence impacts receiver’s interpretation. Exploring these gaps shall help in developing new insights in signaling theory research. Since most of the employer branding literature has been developed in the West, it is relatively context-bound. Much has been written about employer branding in the SHRM literature but there is little empirical evidence concerning its relevance to global companies for dealing with the integration-responsiveness problem or its need and importance for the <b>under-developed</b> <b>economies,</b> outside of the Anglo-Saxon world. This also leaves an important gap that this study seeks to fill. To do this, the study explores the influences of different context levels upon employer branding change programs in the context of Pakistani economy, which is currently passing through its developing phase. Therefore, conducting this study in the Pakistani context has aided in examining the issue {{from the perspective of a}} developing country, which has been stressed by scholars of Strategic and International HRM as a gap that needs to be filled. In this way, the study has made several important contributions at both, theoretical and contextual levels. A case study research design was adopted comprising of qualitative semi-structured and focus group interviews and analysis of relevant company documents. These were conducted in subsidiaries of three foreign multinationals with senior managers and employees at different hierarchical levels in order to gain rich insight into the application and practice of employer branding and to explore its potential role in addressing the integration-responsiveness problem. The signaling process within each firm was also deeply examined in order to further explore the significance of signaling theory in employer branding research. My findings have significant implications for theory and practice of employer branding. They suggest that ‘authentic’ employer brands that respond to the local needs can play a crucial role in addressing the integration-responsiveness problem through adopting strategy-as-practice approach. It was also revealed that the success of this process largely depends upon the influences of different contextual factors and the efficiency and effectiveness of the signaling process; the more effective and efficient the signaling process is, the more authentic is the resulting employer brand. The study also finds that there is little possibility of designing a ‘one size fits all’ approach to employer branding, which is able to address the integration-responsiveness problem. Multinationals operate in different environments possessing their own unique characteristics and fundamental differences from others. Thus, as in most studies, context matters, and in a Muslim country such as Pakistan, context matters more due to factors such as strict religion and unique culture, which is not widely prevalent in the Western developed economies...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} between 1965 and 1973 of {{a crisis}} of over-accumulation and over-capacity, rooted in international manufacturing yet affecting the overall private business economies of the advanced capitalist countries, inaugurated a developmental context whose profound contradictions were brought home by the Great Recession of 2008 - 9 and the continuing Long Depression. The intervening period has seen profound economic, political and social crisis in the advanced capitalist world and has simultaneously been treacherous for <b>under-developed</b> <b>economies</b> forced to navigate rocketing energy costs and international commodity price and currency exchange rate turbulence under the continual threat of debt-levered expropriation. The struggle to locate the causes – proximate and ultimate – of the present crisis {{is at the same}} time a battle to map the basic economic and political coordinates of the continuing long downturn. In this connection it is contended that efforts have been undermined by the epistemological underdevelopment conditioned by a crisis of knowledge-formation which has unfolded in parallel with the long downturn. The dominance of neoclassical economics (‘unworldly’ since the marginal revolution) on the right and the displacement of Marxism on a structurally weakened and autodidactic left in the context of the ascent of postmodernism as an intellectual and cultural dominant has opened a space between the material and discursive realities of global capitalist development. This work is an attempt to deploy the method developed by the classical Marxist tradition to approach the significance of the state and law in the historically-conditioned reproduction of capitalist social relations. It is contended in the first place that the dualism which obtains between national and global spheres in much theorisation of neoliberal ‘globalisation’ obscures the dialectical interrerelation of state and world market – the institutional and regulatory environment of international trade, money and finance being both the creation of states and the developing context which frames their – necessarily path-dependent and reflexive – projects of domestic economy making. As against popular notions of state decline, following Gowan the state-political content of the centring of private financial markets in the mediation of international monetary relations is recalled, while the embeddedness of the state in circuits of capital accumulation is emphasised (Tony Smith), the concept of ‘regime of accumulation’ being deployed to capture the nexus of monetary, fiscal and regulatory policy which articulates historically-conditioned development strategies. In this respect, we depart from the work of the Bolshevik jurist Pashukanis, who despite significantly advancing the materialist analysis of the juridical form, identified in his most significant work a largely derivative role for the state. It is argued that the methodological weakness represented by Pashukanis’ disproportionate emphasis on commodity exchange – his failure to proceed from the basis of the capitalist economy as a contradictory unity of production and circulation – prevents him from fully apprehending the role of the state in the production and reproduction of capitalist social relations. As the discussion unfolds, there is developed in conversation principally with Gramsci an understanding of the state as the specific material condensation of a relationship of forces among classes and class fractions. Upholding the notion of the ‘integral state’ as a differentiated unity of civil society and political society upon which terrains the capitalist class forms alliances with proximate classes as the prerequisite for and correlate of its domination of labour, the developmental context represented by neoliberalism is conceived in terms of the transition of interest-bearing capital from leading to dominant fraction of the capitalist class in parallel with its tendential contradictory disaggregation from productive capital. Such a process has necessitated a transformation in the character of bourgeois political supremacy involving a dismantling of the civil rights and social protections accumulated during the period bookended by Americanism and the welfare state and increasing dependence upon an expanded machinery of coercion. Proceeding from this basis, it is considered how in specific developmental contexts the state by way of the legal form maps the social totality, achieving distinctive couplings (and de-couplings) of wealth production and social reproduction. There is asserted the second-order integration of public and private spheres in terms of the fundamental unity of capitalist reproduction, the first-order public/private metabolism being evaluated in view of the facilitation and rationalisation of social reproduction in the context of a productive economy structured around dissociated private producers. The legal form is further interrogated in view of its role in structuring the productive antagonism between capital and labour, a relation which on the basis of its form comes to expresses various contents – from consensual integration to casuistic assimilation – as domestic social relations are (in-) validated by the operation of the law of value at the level of the world market. In this connection, the unproductive theoretical polarisation obtaining between approaches which consider law to be epiphenomenal and those which pursue its relative autonomy is enriched by a historicised conception in terms of which law, concretising specific relationships of forces within particular regimes of accumulation, appears as ‘sword’, as ‘shield’ and as ‘fetter’. This framework is particularly useful for evaluating the opportunities for the deployment of legal strategies by labour and groups oppressed under capitalism – a question in relation to which Pashukanis, following Lenin, demonstrated a remarkable political astuteness. </p...|$|R
