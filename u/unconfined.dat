5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an <b>unconfined</b> aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major {{supplier}} of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the Water Authority Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an <b>unconfined</b> aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
25|$|An aquifer is a {{layer of}} porous {{substrate}} that contains and transmits groundwater. When water can flow directly between the surface and the saturated zone of an aquifer, the aquifer is <b>unconfined.</b> The deeper parts of <b>unconfined</b> aquifers are usually more saturated since gravity causes water to flow downward.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} further {{characterize}} aquifers and aquitards some primary and derived physical properties are introduced below. Aquifers are broadly classified as being either confined or <b>unconfined</b> (water table aquifers), and either saturated or unsaturated; {{the type of}} aquifer affects what properties control {{the flow of water}} in that medium (e.g., the release of water from storage for confined aquifers is related to the storativity, while it is related to the specific yield for <b>unconfined</b> aquifers).|$|E
25|$|If the {{distinction}} between confined and <b>unconfined</b> is not clear geologically (i.e., {{if it is not}} known if a clear confining layer exists, or if the geology is more complex, e.g., a fractured bedrock aquifer), the value of storativity returned from an aquifer test can be used to determine it (although aquifer tests in <b>unconfined</b> aquifers should be interpreted differently than confined ones). Confined aquifers have very low storativity values (much less than 0.01, and as little as 10−5), which means that the aquifer is storing water using the mechanisms of aquifer matrix expansion and the compressibility of water, which typically are both quite small quantities. <b>Unconfined</b> aquifers have storativities (typically then called specific yield) greater than 0.01 (1% of bulk volume); they release water from storage by the mechanism of actually draining the pores of the aquifer, releasing relatively large amounts of water (up to the drainable porosity of the aquifer material, or the minimum volumetric water content).|$|E
25|$|<b>Unconfined</b> {{magnesium}} burns through deflagration (flames), {{which is}} controlled combustion propagated through thermal conductivity. However, in a confined space, heat and pressure build up causing detonation (explosion), which is uncontrolled and propagates through shock wave compression.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper level}} of this {{saturated}} layer of an <b>unconfined</b> aquifer {{is called the}} water table or phreatic surface. Below the water table, where in general all pore spaces are saturated with water, is the phreatic zone.|$|E
25|$|When pumping {{water from}} an <b>unconfined</b> aquifer, {{where the water}} table is inside a soil layer with a {{significant}} transmissivity, the water table may be drawn down whereby the transmissivity reduces and {{the flow of water}} to the well diminishes.|$|E
25|$|It {{refers to}} the {{intrinsic}} (or natural) vulnerability of a groundwater system to pollution. Intrinsically, some aquifers are more vulnerable to pollution than other aquifers. Shallow <b>unconfined</b> aquifers are more at risk of pollution because there are fewer layers to filter out contaminants.|$|E
25|$|The {{peninsula}} is {{the exposed}} {{portion of the}} larger Yucatán Platform, {{all of which is}} composed of carbonate and soluble rocks, being mostly limestone although dolomite and evaporites are also present at various depths. The whole of the Yucatán Peninsula is an <b>unconfined</b> flat lying karst landscape. Sinkholes, known locally as cenotes, are widespread in the northern lowlands.|$|E
25|$|The Plio-Pleistocene Wouri {{alluvial}} aquifer, a multi-layer {{system with}} alternating sequences of marine sands and estuarine mud and silt lies below the estuary and surrounding region {{and is an}} important source of well water. The upper aquifer in this system is an <b>unconfined</b> sandy horizon that is hydraulically connected to the brackish waters of the estuary and to the coastal wetlands.|$|E
25|$|At {{such high}} temperatures, {{particles}} {{have a large}} kinetic energy, and hence velocity. If <b>unconfined,</b> the particles will rapidly escape, taking the energy with them, cooling the plasma {{to the point where}} net energy is no longer produced. A successful reactor would need to contain the particles in a small enough volume for a long enough time for much of the plasma to fuse.|$|E
25|$|The ice surface {{reaches its}} {{greatest}} altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost 3,000 metres at latitudes 63°–65°N; the northern dome reaches about 3,290 metres at about latitude 72°N. The crests of both domes are displaced {{east of the}} centre line of Greenland. The <b>unconfined</b> ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur.|$|E
25|$|A {{confined}} aquifer is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively impermeable layer of rock or substrate {{such as an}} aquiclude or aquitard. If a {{confined aquifer}} follows a downward grade from its recharge zone, groundwater can become pressurized as it flows. This can create artesian wells that flow freely without the need of a pump and rise to a higher elevation than the static water table at the above, <b>unconfined,</b> aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{underlying}} rocks are major aquifers and provide a valuable source for water supply in the area. The major aquifers are the Corallian limestone, chalk and Sherwood sandstone. The Corallian limestone outcrops on the hills surrounding the Vale of Pickering and {{is made up of}} a series of limestones and sandstones. This aquifer is <b>unconfined</b> in parts and gets water from the River Rye and River Derwent through swallow holes.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain a}} rough {{idea of what}} phases might occur, one can use a model that {{has some of the}} same {{properties}} as QCD, but is easier to manipulate. Many physicists use Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models, which contain no gluons, and replace the strong interaction with a four-fermion interaction. Mean-field methods are commonly used to analyse the phases. Another approach is the bag model, in which the effects of confinement are simulated by an additive energy density that penalizes <b>unconfined</b> quark matter.|$|E
25|$|Specific yield (Sy) {{is also a}} ratio between 0 and 1 (Sy ≤ porosity) and {{indicates}} {{the amount of water}} released due to drainage from lowering the water table in an <b>unconfined</b> aquifer. The value for specific yield is less than the value for porosity because some water will remain in the medium even after drainage due to intermolecular forces. Often the porosity or effective porosity is used as an upper bound to the specific yield. Typically Sy is orders of magnitude larger than Ss.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} aquifer types {{suitable for}} an ASR system include fractured <b>unconfined</b> rock and confined sand and gravel. Detailed geological investigations {{are necessary to}} establish the feasibility of an ASR scheme. The potential low cost of ASR compared to subsurface storage can be attractive. The design process should consider the protection of groundwater quality, and recovered water quality for its intended use. Aquifers and aquitards need also be protected from damaged by depletion or high pressures. Impacts of the harvesting point on downstream areas also require consideration. Careful planning is required regarding aquifer selection, treatment, injection, the recovery process, and maintenance and monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Hydraulic head is a {{directly}} measurable {{property that}} can take on any value (because of the arbitrary datum involved in the z term); ψ can be measured with a pressure transducer (this value can be negative, e.g., suction, but is positive in saturated aquifers), and z can be measured relative to a surveyed datum (typically {{the top of the}} well casing). Commonly, in wells tapping <b>unconfined</b> aquifers the water level in a well is used as a proxy for hydraulic head, assuming there is no vertical gradient of pressure. Often only changes in hydraulic head through time are needed, so the constant elevation head term can be left out (Δh = Δψ).|$|E
25|$|In mountainous areas (or near {{rivers in}} mountainous areas), the main {{aquifers}} are typically unconsolidated alluvium, composed of mostly horizontal layers of materials deposited by water processes (rivers and streams), which in cross-section (looking at a two-dimensional {{slice of the}} aquifer) appear to be layers of alternating coarse and fine materials. Coarse materials, {{because of the high}} energy needed to move them, tend to be found nearer the source (mountain fronts or rivers), whereas the fine-grained material will make it farther from the source (to the flatter parts of the basin or overbank areas—sometimes called the pressure area). Since there are less fine-grained deposits near the source, {{this is a place where}} aquifers are often <b>unconfined</b> (sometimes called the forebay area), or in hydraulic communication with the land surface.|$|E

Because of an inversion layer, the explosions were heard up to [...] away; there were reports that they were audible in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands.|$|E
500|$|In equal {{protection}} cases, {{the purpose of}} the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged. When {{the purpose of the}} law is not explicitly stated, the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose, assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it, or draw some inferences as to what it is. When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated, the court may either accept it at face value; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration, looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose. In the latter situation, what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation. The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the [...] "thornier aspects of judicial review", because it must either [...] "uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value" [...] or [...] "challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into <b>unconfined</b> realms of inference". The court must then [...] "make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end".|$|E
2500|$|There are two end {{members in}} the {{spectrum}} of types of aquifers; confined and <b>unconfined</b> (with semi-confined being in between). <b>Unconfined</b> aquifers are sometimes also called water table or phreatic aquifers, because their upper boundary is the water table or phreatic surface. (See Biscayne Aquifer.) Typically (but not always) the shallowest aquifer at a given location is <b>unconfined,</b> meaning {{it does not have}} a confining layer (an aquitard or aquiclude) between it and the surface. The term [...] "perched" [...] refers to ground water accumulating above a low-permeability unit or strata, such as a clay layer. This term is generally used to refer to a small local area of ground water that occurs at an elevation higher than a regionally extensive aquifer. The difference between perched and <b>unconfined</b> aquifers is their size (perched is smaller). Confined aquifers are aquifers that are overlain by a confining layer, often made up of clay. The confining layer might offer some protection from surface contamination.|$|E

2500|$|The above diagram {{indicates}} typical flow {{directions in}} a cross-sectional {{view of a}} simple confined or <b>unconfined</b> aquifer system. The system shows two aquifers with one aquitard (a confining or impermeable layer) between them, surrounded by the bedrock aquiclude, which is in contact with a gaining stream (typical in humid regions). The water table and unsaturated zone are also illustrated.|$|E
2500|$|Municipal, irrigation, and {{industrial}} water supplies are provided through large wells. Multiple wells for one water supply source are termed [...] "wellfields", which may withdraw water from confined or <b>unconfined</b> aquifers. Using ground water from deep, confined aquifers provides more protection from surface water contamination. Some wells, termed [...] "collector wells," [...] {{are specifically designed}} to induce infiltration of surface (usually river) water.|$|E
2500|$|Ratting and rat-baiting are not {{the same}} activities. [...] Ratting is the legal use of dogs for the pest control of non-captured rats in an <b>unconfined</b> space, such as a barn or field. [...] Due to rat infestations, terriers are now being used for ratting to hunt and kill rats in the major cities around the world, {{including}} New York City, as well as nations like the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and others. Although ratting with working terriers is far less efficient than using rodenticide or rat traps, the killing of non-target species is zero.|$|E

The Quequechan River originally flowed <b>unconfined</b> over an almost level course for more than a mile. In the last half-mile (800 m) of its progress it rushes down the hillside in a narrow, precipitous, rocky channel, creating the falls for which Fall River is named. In this distance the total fall is about [...] and the volume of water [...] per second.|$|E

2500|$|The {{line that}} rises {{up from the}} nuclear/quark matter {{transition}} and then bends back towards the T axis, with its end marked by a star, is the conjectured boundary between confined and <b>unconfined</b> phases. Until recently it was also {{believed to be a}} boundary between phases where chiral symmetry is broken (low temperature and density) and phases where it is unbroken (high temperature and density). It is now known that the CFL phase exhibits chiral symmetry breaking, and other quark matter phases may also break chiral symmetry, so {{it is not clear whether}} this is really a chiral transition line. The line ends at the [...] "chiral critical point", marked by a star in this figure, which is a special temperature and density at which striking physical phenomena, analogous to critical opalescence, are expected.

2500|$|The {{weight of}} the ice has {{depressed}} the central area of Greenland; the bedrock surface is near sea level {{over most of the}} interior of Greenland, but mountains occur around the periphery, confining the sheet along its margins. If the ice suddenly disappeared, Greenland would most probably appear as an archipelago, at least until isostasy lifted the land surface above sea level once again. The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost [...] at latitudes 63°–65°N; the northern dome reaches about [...] at about latitude 72°N (the fourth highest [...] "summit" [...] of Greenland). The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The <b>unconfined</b> ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur. The ice margin just reaches the sea, however, in a region of irregular topography in the area of Melville Bay southeast of Thule. Large outlet glaciers, which are restricted tongues of the ice sheet, move through bordering valleys around the periphery of Greenland to calve off into the ocean, producing the numerous icebergs that sometimes occur in North Atlantic shipping lanes. The best known of these outlet glaciers is Jakobshavn Glacier (...) , which, at its terminus, flows at speeds of [...] per day.|$|E
