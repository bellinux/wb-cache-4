50|$|Recent {{studies on}} diet and caries have been confounded by the {{widespread}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> toothpastes. Studies {{have argued that}} with greater exposure to fluoride, the sugar consumption/caries relationship may be weaker in the modern age than previously thought, with fluoride raising the threshold of sugar intake at which caries progresses to cavitation. It has been concluded in modern societies that {{a significant relationship between}} sugars and caries persists despite the regular widespread <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> toothpaste. Several reviews conclude that high sugar consumption continues to be the main threat for dental health of whole populations in some developed and many developing countries. Therefore, a key strategy to further reducing levels of caries in individuals as well as for populations, is by means of reducing the frequency of sugar intakes in the diet.|$|E

40|$|Dental caries is {{the single}} most common, chronic oral disease of childhood. It is {{progressive}} and cumulative, and becomes more complex over time. The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health revealed that more than 51 million school hours are lost each year as a result of dental problems. Contemporary caries management philosophy has changed from the traditional surgical approach to a medical model that emphasizes prevention. Among various strategies for caries prevention or reduction, fluoride therapy has been highly promoted. Various in-office and over-the-counter fluoride products are available for caries prevention.

40|$|To date, many of {{the ways}} of {{controlling}} tooth decay involve the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluorides.</b> Either systemically via fluoridated water and tablets, or, topically, with fluoride-containing toothpaste and mouthrinses.

40|$|Caries is an infectious, chronic and {{cumulative}} disease. It seriously affects {{quality of}} life and creates considerable expense for individuals and communities.

However, in contrast to our observation, many previous studies [13, 16] reported that the toothpaste alone was not effective in reducing the post-orthodontic WSLs. Zantiner et al.

The concentration and doses <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> application are controversial. Fluoride agents that release a high dose <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> initially (burst effect) are more effective for increasing enamel resistance against decalcification [30]. A low concentration <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> is more effective in enamel remineralization [31]. The high dose <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> physically blocks the surface layer of enamel to penetration of calcium ions to subsurface layers [32]. Thus, high dose <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> is recommended in inhibiting lesion formation and low dose <b>of</b> <b>fluoride</b> for the remineralization and controlling lesion progression.|$|R
50|$|Fluoride {{therapy has}} been proven to have a {{beneficial}} effect on the prevention of dental caries.

However, it is important to use fluoridated toothpastes correctly; children below the age of two do not usually require toothpaste unless they are already at a high risk of ECC as diagnosed by a dental professional, and therefore it is it is recommended to use a small sized ‘smear’ of toothpaste to incorporate fluoride, with caution removing the toothpaste from within the mouth and not allowing the child to swallow the substances.|$|E
