5|$|Leech {{was named}} in the Olympic squad and the Australian Swimming Union {{exempted}} her from travelling to the national training camp in Townsville so she could train with Froelich, who <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> special dietary requirements. She joined the squad for the final race trials in Melbourne in October before the Olympics. Fraser and Crapp were too strong in the 100-metre freestyle, with Leech finishing second and third in the two races. After combining with Fraser, Crapp and Margaret Gibson to break the world record for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, Leech was selected as one of Australia's three entrants in the 100-metre freestyle events and one of six swimmers for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad for the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Let Go is {{the debut}} studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, {{released}} on 4 June 2002. For {{a year after}} signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. She relocated to Los Angeles, California, and recorded there, her earlier materials for the album; the kind of sound to which the label was not amenable. She was paired to the production team The Matrix, who <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> vision for the album.|$|E
25|$|Priaulx Rainier's largest work of {{that period}} was the orchestral suite Aequora Lunae, a {{continuous}} piece in seven sections, each one descriptive {{of one of the}} Moon's seas. It was dedicated to Barbara Hepworth, whose acquaintance she made in the summer of 1949 when she stayed in St Ives, Cornwall, using a fisherman’s loft as a studio. She remained a close friend of Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. She claimed that only sculptors and architects fully <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> music. Another work premiered at a Prom Concert was Ploërmel (1973), an evocation of one her favourite places, Ploërmel in the North West of France, near the mouth of the River Loire. It uses an orchestra of winds and percussion, including timpani, tubular bells, hand-bells, antique cymbals, high and low gongs, xylophone, and marimba.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} scandal {{occurred}} on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured {{the services of}} a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him—she <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not see behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis.|$|E
25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E
500|$|Rick Millikan {{selected}} Lisa Jane Persky, {{who was at}} the top of his casting [...] "wish list", for {{the role}} of Laura. In the middle of filming, a cast member withdrew from the production for religious reasons. A mother withdrew her baby from the cast during the final run-through of the [...] "cursed-birth" [...] scene. Although a fan of the show, as a devout Catholic she was uncomfortable with her child representing a demon. Director Rob Bowman assured her that the production staff <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> dilemma; the casting staff called down and found a replacement in less than 45 minutes. It was the first time during the filming of the series that a cast-member withdrew for religious reasons.|$|E

500|$|Conan {{enters the}} All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club during the Wimbledon finals. Minerva has been serving [...] "help" [...] in braille into the court. Conan {{calls out to}} her {{revealing}} he <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> message. In response, Minerva serves more messages revealing Hades intends to kill her mother with a bomb when the match ends. Conan deduces Hades is directly opposite of Minerva's mother, as he intends to record her death, {{and is able to}} locate him. Conan coincidentally finds his parents, Yusaku Kudo and Yukiko Kudo, who assists him in apprehending Hades; Conan is then given another pill, by his parents, to bypass airport security to return home. With Hades incarcerated, Minerva is able to focus and win her match. As Conan and friends prepare to return home, Ran converses with Minerva and repeats Shinichi's words. Minerva, having made up with her lover, acknowledges that everything starts from love.|$|E
500|$|On 30 July 2002, Neil Wilkes from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Taylor had quit Coronation Street after five years. Wilkes revealed that her contract would expire in October that year, but the actress {{had chosen to}} stay with the serial beyond that to give the writers time {{to come up with a}} storyline for her character's departure. Series producer Kieran Roberts added that he was sorry to see Taylor go, but <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> decision to move on. Taylor later explained that she chose to leave because she and the writers struggled to come up with storylines for Toyah. She told the Liverpool Echo's Janet Tansley [...] "I was asked where she would go from there and couldn't think what she could do. If I couldn't see a future for her, I couldn't play her." [...] Taylor filmed her final scenes on 3 January 2003.|$|E
500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E

500|$|After {{confirming}} that Klein was directing her video, Gaga {{explained that she}} [...] "doesn't know what [...] {{going to look like}} until it's finished", and commented that [...] " [...] a very good friend of mine and I love him so much, [...] I have so much respect for him. And we've been excited to collaborate and have a fashion photographer tell us a story, the story of my music through his lens and this idea of fashion and lifestyle." [...] Gaga explained that Klein <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> [...] "I am what I wear" [...] lifestyle, making him a suitable director for the video. She added, [...] "It's all about where I'm from and love of theater and love of music and love of the lie in art, and Steven really knows and understands that, [...] So we're making a beautiful video, and I'm so excited." [...] In May 2010, Gaga told The Times about the concept of the video: [...] " [...] purity of my friendships with my gay friends, and how I've been unable to find that with a straight man in my life. It's a celebration and an admiration of gay love—it confesses my envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together. In the video I'm pining for the love of my gay friends—but they just don't want me to be with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blavatsky <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> Theosophy to be {{the heir}} to the Neoplatonist {{philosophers}} of Late Antiquity, who had also embraced Hermetic philosophy.

2500|$|Lord Melbourne {{wrote in}} a letter to Lord Holland that, [...] "The fact is he (Norton) is a stupid brute, and she had not temper nor dissimulation enough to enable her to manage him."

2500|$|At age 14, she <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> {{vocation}} to {{pray for}} priests, to be [...] "an apostle to apostles". In September 1890, at her canonical examination before she professed her religious vows, she was asked why {{she had come to}} Carmel. [...] She answered [...] "I came to save souls, and especially {{to pray for}} priests". Throughout her life she prayed fervently for priests, and she corresponded with and prayed for a young priest, Adolphe Roulland, and a young seminarian, Maurice Bellière. [...] She wrote to her sister [...] "Our mission as Carmelites is to form evangelical workers who will save thousands of souls whose mothers we shall be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bergman {{was soon}} {{accepted}} {{without having to}} modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick. [...] "He let her have her way," [...] notes a story in Life magazine. Selznick <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and [...] "instructed them to lay off". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's [...] "synthetic razzle-dazzle". During the following weeks, while Intermezzo was being filmed, Selznick was also filming Gone with the Wind. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described {{a few of his}} early impressions of Bergman: ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1864 Sheffey married Elizabeth “Eliza” Stafford, {{although}} her {{parents did not}} favor the marriage because of Sheffey’s constant circuit riding. [...] Nevertheless, the marriage was a success. [...] Eliza <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> husband and did not complain about his frequent absences. [...] The couple had one son, Edward Fleming Sheffey, (1865–1933), who became a successful Lynchburg businessman. [...] He remembered as a boy telling his father, “Uncle Johnny thinks {{that you ought to}} spend more time with your family,” to which Sheffey replied, “Son, Uncle Johnny doesn’t know which way the rats run.

2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey.

I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she <b>understood</b> <b>her</b> fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E
