40|$|The present work {{intends to}} {{introduce}} the reader to the essential dimension of intersubjectivity in personal existence in Gabriel Marcel’s philosophy. We will first attend to the characterization of persona; secondly, how we should understand the terms I {{and the other in}} concrete interpersonal relationships; in the third place, we will analize {{the way in which the}} other is given as an other, through the notion of presence. The main objective of this article is to show that personal existence is <b>uncomprehensible</b> without its reference to the other, that is to say, that identity has no sense without alterity. Moreover, the essential intencionality of identity to alterity does not imply only a practical or accidental character, but a metaphysical one, as communion constitutes the very being of personal existence...|$|E
40|$|If {{you want}} to have a resume, read {{conclusion}} first This document describes the operation of the verification condition generator of escjava 2. First we describe how we use the old code, that was designed to produce an unsorted proof (for Simplify), to create a new ast tree, strongly typed, that can be easily used to produce proof for any prover. Design choices are explained, structure of classes and every tricky part of the code is supposed to be detailed here. If {{you want to}} modify/continue 1 the work on this new verification condition generator, this isthe more complete (and still absolutely <b>uncomprehensible,</b> uncomplete and full of english mistakes) and unique reference [...] . Don’t hesitate to contact me for further explanations. Despite this, this paper intends to show you problems related to implementation of proof generator, ideas used to do it for multiple provers and logics. Thus I hope that it will be done in a much much nicer way in the future because of one or two suggestions coming from this document [...] . 1 If you’re reading that for it, make sure to read the entire document, it’s full of explanations, maybe not wel...|$|E
40|$|The main thema of {{this essay}} is {{something}} as dark as a solidarity (?) inbetween thinking and poetry presented {{on the base of}} thoughts of german philosopher Martin Heidegger and his interpretations of poet Friedrich Hölderlin. Nowadays American-English cannot portray anything as even a nearly adequate language for such a peculiar thing, that somehow defy any calculation and systematic reasoning. If its even possible for said languague to establish such a problem as a problem, is very hard to say. What can be described here, tho, is the absolut and universally- transcendental extension of western metaphysics through history into the establishment of scientifically-technical global civilization, its perverse nihilistic regime and enforcement of essencial fateful destruction through cosmopolitan deprivation of European Man and his values in perpetual mobilisation of the "peaceful" progression of the World War and technological decline. Sadly, this, nowadays widely accepted and even celebrated (!), condition actually represents in this text the main disaster and the very biggest catastrophe of present day [...] . However this can be <b>uncomprehensible</b> for the anglo-american and today, alas!, "whole-western", but all in all fundamentally pitiful, worldview. All of this is meant quite seriously, by the way, but [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Single and {{multiple}} unit neuronal activity was recorded from the cortex of the lateral temporal lobe in conscious humans during open brain surgery {{for the treatment}} of epilepsy. Recordings were obtained from the right and left superior, middle and inferior temporal gyrus of 34 patients (41 recording sites). Recordings were restricted to regions to be resected during subsequent surgery. This excluded recordings from language areas proper. Neuronal responses to words and sentences presented over a loudspeaker and during free conversation were recorded. No significant differences between the right and left hemisphere were obvious. All neurons in the superior temporal gyrus responded to various aspects of spoken language with temporally well defined activation/inhibition patterns, but not or only little to non-linguistic noises or tones. Excitatory responses were typically short or prolonged (up to several hundred ms) bursts of discharges at rates above 20 /sec, reaching peak rates of 50 – 100 /s. Such responses could be specifically related to certain combinations of consonants suggesting a function in categorization, they could depend on word length, could differentiate between polysyllabic and compound words of the same length or could be unspecifically related to language as such. No formant specific responses were found, but the prolonged excitations across syllables suggest that consonant/vowel combinations may play a role for some activation patterns. Responses of some neurons (or neuronal populations) depended on the attention paid to the words and sentences, or the task connected with them (repeat words, speech addressed to the patient demanding something). Neurons in the middle and inferior temporal gyrus were only little affected by listening to single words or sentences, but some were unspecifically activated by words or while listening to sentences. Excitatory responses varied within a limited range of discharge rates usually below 5 – 10 /s. Phonetic distortion of spoken language could reduce responses in superior temporal gyrus neurons, but also the slight changes in discharge rate of middle temporal neurons could be absent during distorted and <b>uncomprehensible</b> speech sounds. We conclude that superior temporal gyrus neuron responses reflect some general phonetic but not semantic aspects of spoken language. Middle and inferior temporal gyrus neurons do not signal phonetic aspects of language, but may be involved in understanding language under certain conditions...|$|E
