50|$|When Tokyo Disneyland was constructed, local <b>railway</b> <b>laws</b> were {{applicable}} to any railway that connected two points {{and can be}} used as a means of transportation, even if the railway was entirely on private land. As a result, the Western River Railroad was designed as a loop with no intermediate stops to avoid this regulation. The law was abolished on April 1, 1987, and as a result, Tokyo DisneySea could add railways useful as transportation within the park without falling under the local <b>railway</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 18 April 1843, the <b>Railway</b> <b>Law</b> (Eisenbahngesetz)) was passed, which legislated the {{creation}} of the railways listed above.

The efforts of the Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn, who had rented the line for a time, were fruitless. On 1 April 2005 the section of line was closed.|$|R
50|$|This {{undertaking}} {{was organized}} on 6 February 1900, {{and planned to}} connect larger neighboring towns with Leipzig. The undertaking was controlled from the outset by the GLSt, but traded as an independent company.

50|$|The Hachinohe Rinkai Railway began {{operations}} on March 25, 1966, {{to connect the}} Port of Hachinohe with a nearby Mitsubishi Paper Mill Ltd. factory.

50|$|The San Diego Electric Railway (SDERy) was a San Diego-based, {{light rail}} mass transit system founded by Spreckels in 1892.

2500|$|The total {{damage to}} the railway was valued at 16.5 Million francs, of which 13.59 Million could be {{alleviated}} by natural disaster relief under the Swiss Federal <b>Railway</b> <b>Law.</b> Due to the break in the track, which was closed for 105 days, the Jubilee festivities originally scheduled for July 1991 had to be postponed until October. [...] During the Jubilee, the Brig-Visp-Zermatt-Bahn was renamed as the BVZ Zermatt-Bahn, to highlight more strongly the most important town on the line.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Prussia, Saxony never {{issued a}} <b>railway</b> <b>law.</b> This meant that every railway {{proposal}} {{had to be}} agreed in the state parliament. In spite of the negative experiences of the past, {{the next ten years}} saw an increase in the construction of state railways. The work was not without problems, due to geographical difficulties. The extension of the route between Chemnitz and Riesa as well as the line from Freiberg to Tharandt were technically challenging and correspondingly expensive.|$|R
50|$|To {{open up the}} {{northeast}} of Württemberg, the initial plans called for a route from Heilbronn through the Kocher valley and via Hall to Aalen. Due to the technical difficulty of that route, it was abandoned and a route via Öhringen, Hall, and Crailsheim, then through the Jagst valley to Aalen was planned instead. However, the new <b>Railway</b> <b>Law</b> of 18 November 1858 legislated only {{the construction of the}} Kocher Railway to Hall, which was completed in 1862.|$|R
5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the <b>railway</b> <b>laws</b> were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|R
50|$|The {{flip side}} of the {{economic}} success of the areas on the main railways {{was the fact that}} communities who were not connected to the network were left behind by the industrialization, and more and more pushed for their own integration into the railway net. The connection of these areas, which were often located in unfavorable spots from a geographic perspective, had already been thought about in the <b>Railway</b> <b>Law</b> of 1843, with permission for the construction of these secondary connections to be given to private companies.|$|R

Following the change in control, the city also formed the Detroit Rapid Transit Commission to build a subway system. Early proposals included a [...] next to Detroit City Hall. In 1926, a four-line system encompassing 47 mi of lines was proposed at a cost of $280 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ). By 1929, plans were scaled back further in the face of tough local economic conditions; the plan submitted to voters included one line of 13.3 mi that interconnected with the city's streetcar system by way of two 2.5 mi streetcar tunnels. The bond proposal failed by a 2.5:1 margin that year, killing any proposal for a city subway system in Detroit.|$|R
50|$|The French rail policy, {{once put}} in place, had its deficiencies, but one {{certainly}} cannot {{consider it a}} failure, and other powers attempting to encourage rail developments adopted {{many aspects of the}} French <b>railway</b> <b>laws.</b> The bureaucratisation and influence of special interests associated with all governments, even those of corporations, also negatively affected the French railways. However, the French rail system had failed to grow on its own and required government intervention to expand successfully. While the alleged intrusion of government into the railway sector caused problems, it also proved necessary and inevitable.|$|R
50|$|After {{the start}} of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War (World War II), the {{railways}} came under military control. In 1938, the government decided to <b>unify</b> private <b>railways</b> into regional blocks, making larger companies such as Tokyo Kyuko Electric Railway (called Great Tōkyū in comparison with postwar Tōkyū) and Kinki Nippon Railway.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyse the influence of the actuator’s law of motion on the railroad cars motion when these last are moved by a wire. The first results show that, during the start and stop transients, the moment versus time law (hence the shape of the law of motion given by the winch) significantly affects the railroad cars motion. This suggests that, by means of a suitable actuator’s law of motion, the railroad cars oscillations occurring during the start and stop transients can be possible significantly reduced. Key-Words:- System dynamics, funicular <b>railways,</b> <b>laws</b> of motion influence...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{organized}} as follows: In section 2 the historical roots of third party access regulation are characterized. This includes the Prussian <b>railway</b> <b>law</b> of 1838 and the terminal railroad case of 1912. In section 3 a normative frame-work, based on modern network economics, {{for the evaluation}} of third party access policies is provided. In section 4, the gradual process of market opening for railway transport services and the evolution of third party access regulation in Europe are characterized. In this context the potentials for competition on the markets for passenger rail services and public subsidies are also considered...|$|R
