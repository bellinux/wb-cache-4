5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt <b>underlies</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are {{relatively}} free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash {{into the river}} during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E
5|$|The algebra of observables {{in quantum}} {{mechanics}} is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. Von Neumann began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by von Neumann and his contemporaries are now known as von Neumann algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition {{of a kind of}} operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one hand made no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in particular that <b>underlies</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract harmonic analysis and representation theory.|$|E

500|$|Nature for Pliny was divine, a pantheistic concept {{inspired}} by the Stoic philosophy which <b>underlies</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his thought. But the deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve the human race: [...] "nature, that is life" [...] is human life in a natural landscape. After an initial survey of cosmology and geography, Pliny starts his treatment of animals with the human race, [...] "for whose sake great Nature appears to have created all other things". This teleological view of nature was common in antiquity and {{is crucial to the}} understanding of the Natural History. The components of nature are not just described in and for themselves, but also with a view to their role in human life. Pliny devotes a number of the books to plants, with a focus on their medicinal value; the books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in architecture, sculpture, painting and jewellery. Pliny's premise is distinct from modern ecological theories, reflecting the prevailing sentiment of his time.|$|E

2500|$|Harry Markowitz's 1952 {{doctoral}} thesis [...] "Portfolio Selection" [...] and its published version {{was one of}} the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance. [...] Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of [...] "diversification" [...] in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return.

2500|$|In {{social and}} {{political}} philosophy, economics <b>underlies</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the debate. Bernard de Mandeville's The Fable of the Bees (1714) became a centre-point of controversy regarding trade, morality, and social ethics. [...] Mandeville argued that wastefulness, lust, pride, {{and all the other}} [...] "private" [...] vices were good for the society at large, for each led the individual to employ others, to spend freely, and to free capital to flow through the economy. Mandeville's work is full of paradox and is meant, at least partially, to problematize what he saw as the naive philosophy of human progress and inherent virtue. [...] However, Mandeville's arguments, initially an attack on graft of the War of the Spanish Succession, would be quoted often by economists who wished to strip morality away from questions of trade.|$|E
2500|$|The Southern Whidbey Island Fault (SWIF) is a {{significant}} terrane boundary manifested as an approximately four mile wide zone of complex transpressional faulting with at least three strands. Marine seismic reflection surveys show it striking northwest across {{the eastern end of}} the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Just south of Victoria, British Columbia it intersects the west-striking Devils Mountain Fault (reviewed above), and either merges with it, or crosses (and possibly truncates) it to connect with the Leech River Fault. The Leech River Fault has been identified as the northern edge of the Crescent Formation (aka Metchosin Formation, part of the Siletzia terrane that <b>underlies</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> western Washington and Oregon). [...] Seismic tomography studies show that this portion of the SWIF marks a strong contrast of seismic velocities, such as is expected of Crescent Formation basalts in contact with the metamorphic basement rocks of the Cascades geologic province to the east.|$|E
