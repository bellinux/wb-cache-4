5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> a series of loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps ten {{per cent}} of the {{population}} lived in one of many burghs that {{had grown up in}} the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. A characteristic of Scottish burghs was a long main street of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses were interspersed with the larger stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-storey Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements. Many burghs acquired tollbooths in this period, which acted as town halls, courts and prisons. They often had peels of bells or clock towers and the aspect of a fortress. The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh was rebuilt on the orders of Mary Queen of Scots from 1561 and housed the parliament {{until the end of the}} 1630s. Other examples can be seen at Tain, Culross and Stonehaven, often showing influences from the Low Countries in their crow-stepped gables and steeples.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixteenth}} century perhaps ten per cent of the {{population}} lived {{in one of the}} many burghs. A characteristic of Scottish burghs were long main streets of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. Many houses in Scottish towns had forms derived from those in major urban centres in Tuscany and the Low Countries, although realised with traditional Scottish techniques and materials. Timber-framed houses were common across urban centres in Europe, but, perhaps because of the shortage of large timbers and an abundance of workable stone in Scotland, houses with only timber fronts were more common. Despite the logistical problems timbered houses enjoyed a resurgence in the late sixteenth century, particularly in Edinburgh where there were large numbers of board, jettied and boarded construction. Increasingly half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. By the late seventeenth century these had taken on a recognisably Flemish or Dutch appearance. They were often narrow, with four stories, gabled and crow stepped, but often built in stone and harl. They sometimes had ground floor arcades or piazzas. Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-story Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements.|$|E

5|$|The twin pylons rise to {{a height}} 30metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and {{sacrifice}} of the two countries. At {{the top of the}} pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope and Truth on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located {{at the base of the}} pylons. The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.|$|E

25|$|In {{people with}} {{naturally}} occurring dark skin, the tanning occurs with the dramatic mobilization of melanin <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> the epidermis and continues {{with the increased}} production of melanin. This accounts {{for the fact that}} dark-skinned people get visibly darker after one or two weeks of sun exposure, and then lose their colour after months when they stay out of the sun. Darkly pigmented people tend to exhibit less signs of aging in their skin than the lightly pigmented because their dark skin protects them from most photoaging.|$|E
25|$|Although the Supreme Court {{permitted}} strikebreakers to {{be hired}} under the Mackay doctrine, replacement workers remained largely unused by employers from the mid-1930s to the early 1970s.

The increased use of strikebreakers {{began in the late}} 1960s, and trended significantly <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> the early 1970. President Ronald Reagan's replacement of striking air traffic controllers in 1981 reinforced the trend, perhaps sundering the social contract permanently.|$|E

25|$|The Rouse profile characterizes {{sediment}} concentrations {{because the}} Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling {{under the weight}} of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.|$|E

In 1961, Watanabe spent a year in prison for possession of weapons, and he was again arrested in Osaka in the mid-70s for weapons possession. He became leader of Yamaken-gumi in 1982, and became the head of Yamaguchi-gumi in July 1989, at a ceremony in Kobe attended by over 100 affiliated gang leaders.|$|E
25|$|Eggs of C. sapidus hatch in high {{salinity}} {{waters of}} inlets, coastal waters, and mouths of rivers and are {{carried to the}} ocean by ebb tides. During seven planktonic (zoeal) stages blue crab larvae float near the surface and feed on microorganisms they encounter. After the eighth zoeal stage, larvae molt into megalopae. This larval form has small claws called chelipeds for grasping prey items. Megalopae selectively migrate <b>upward</b> <b>in</b> the water column as tides travel landward toward estuaries. Eventually blue crabs arrive in brackish water, where they spend {{the majority of their}} life. Chemical cues in estuarine water prompt metamorphosis to the juvenile phase, after which blue crabs appear similar to the adult form.|$|E
