500|$|One day, bassist Mike Dirnt was in {{the studio}} {{recording}} a 30-second song by himself. Armstrong decided {{that he wanted to}} do the same, and drummer Tré Cool followed suit. Armstrong recalled, [...] "It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. We kept connecting these little half-minute bits <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> something." [...] This musical suite became [...] "Homecoming", and the group subsequently wrote another suite, [...] "Jesus of Suburbia".|$|E
500|$|On 7 December 2009, Cross {{publicly}} {{testified before}} the Iraq Inquiry, having previously argued that the proceedings should be held in public as, eventually, they were. He gave evidence about the post-war planning done prior to the invasion of Iraq, stating that he had urged Prime Minister Tony Blair and his aide, Alastair Campbell, to delay the invasion two days prior {{to the beginning of}} the conflict. Cross told Sir John Chilcot, the inquiry chairman, that preparations for Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein were [...] "woefully thin". He went on to tell the inquiry that [...] "although I was confident that we would secure a military victory, I offered my view that we should not begin that campaign <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a much more coherent postwar plan." ...|$|E
500|$|American Idiot {{was born}} out of two incidents: the loss of the {{aforementioned}} recordings and an occasion when the trio each individually crafted their own ambitious thirty-second songs. Armstrong recalled, [...] "It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. We kept connecting these little half-minute bits <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> something." [...] This musical suite became [...] "Homecoming", and the group subsequently wrote another suite, [...] "Jesus of Suburbia". It considerably changed the development of the album, and the trio began viewing songs as more than their format— as chapters, movements, or potentially a feature film or novel. Soon afterward, Armstrong penned the record's title track, which explicitly addresses sociopolitical issues. The group then decided that they would steer the development of the album toward what they dubbed a [...] "punk rock opera." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{intended}} {{to become a}} cartoonist, but Speight eventually became a TV presenter following a job painting the set of a television production. He auditioned for SMart and, following a successful interview where he met future co-presenter Jay Burridge, {{he went on to}} present SMart from its first edition in 1994. Speight became close friends with Burridge, whose art studio in West London was used to create all of the art content for SMart; Burridge noted: [...] "We would bounce ideas and jokes off each other all day <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> developed an almost telepathically linked knowledge of what made each other laugh." [...] Speight and Burridge were joined by third presenter Zoë Ball, who was replaced first by Josie d'Arby, and then Kirsten O'Brien and Lizi Botham. With Burridge, O'Brien and Botham, Speight presented the spin-off shows SMart on the Road, and SMarteenies and participated in various live events. He achieved further fame while starring in the BAFTA-nominated ITV Saturday morning show Scratchy & Co. from 1995 until 1998.|$|E
500|$|Burger King's {{creative}} {{control over}} the game impacted its development defined {{as a set of}} rules. The first rule was that there was only one King character. In response, the developers had the idea of the Xbox avatars playing the game and finding the crown to become the King. This idea was rejected by Burger King who said players could not become the King. The developers' next idea was to have one person be the King and the other players lay traps to interfere with his deliveries, but this idea was again rejected by Burger King because the King could not be exposed to any danger. With the usual hazards and competition elements of the video games removed, the developers decided upon a stealth format with no human opponents. In order to better capture the accuracy and authenticity of the King's movements, the King was flown to Britain for motion capture for the game's production. Blitz Games' Edward Linley described Sneak King as the riskiest game concept of the project because it [...] "is the appearance and antics of the King himself that give the game its humor and life; without him, the game simply wouldn't work. <b>Until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the finished King model and motion capture in the game, we couldn't be certain the concept would gel. Fortunately, the moment he went in, we knew we had created something truly unique." [...] Sneak Kings programming code consists of 60,000 active lines with another 43,000 developer comment lines. The game's instruction manual does not include a list of credits.|$|E

We released a 12” vinyl with them once, on one side it had three Tame Impala songs {{and on the other}} it was the same three songs remixed by Canyons and that was really cool, it was a really casual relationship. We always talked about releasing things but we never got round to it because I’d just go round to his house and talk about music for a while. So we never actually got anything pressed <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> signed with Modular and then we went back and did stuff with Canyons." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Pollard 'Dimboola Jim' Phillips was [...] "a fearless umpire who {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for stamping out throwing {{around the turn of}} the [...] century … establishing an international reputation for acumen and honesty." [...] Amongst the bowlers called for throwing by Phillips were Australian Test players Ernie Jones and Tom McKibbin. [...] Jones was first no-balled in a match between South Australia and the visiting English side in 1897/98. [...] Phillips again no-balled him once in the 2nd Test of that series, Jones thus becoming the first bowler to be called for throwing in a Test match. [...] The selectors omitted Jack Saunders from the 1905 team to tour England because it was feared that Phillips would no-ball him for throwing. [...] Wisden blamed English umpires for the problem, claiming that [...] "Australian bowlers never threw in England <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> shown them over and over again that [...] could be broken with impunity." [...] Phillips' actions, including the no-balling of the English amateur champion C. B. Fry, led to a meeting of County captains in 1900, which recommended that nine regular bowlers not be used in the following season.|$|E
2500|$|Dixon {{had worked}} with Brian Higgins, of Xenomania, on her {{previous}} single, [...] "Knockdown", but it failed to enter the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, resulting in Dixon being dropped by her record label, Polydor Records. In early 2007, still with no recording contract, Dixon {{received a phone call}} from Higgins, who asked if she would like to continue working together. Dixon stated, [...] "The plan was to make the whole record with Brian without talking to any record labels, we were just going to wait <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> made something special and then approach people with a finished album." [...] However Dixon's profile was raised when she signed up to compete in Strictly Come Dancing, which she eventually won. Soon afterwards, Dixon signed a deal with Asylum Records. [...] "The Boy Does Nothing", by this time already written, was originally intended to be a jazz orientated track, but Dixon and Higgins decided to change the genre, incorporating mambo influences, due to her experience on Strictly Come Dancing. Dixon described the song as [...] "a very tongue-in-cheek record" [...] and Higgins likened the song to [...] "bottled happiness".|$|E

[...] "Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars— then we went nuts all over again.
