40|$|The {{concentrations}} of thorium, uranium, and potassium have been de-termined in the granites and gneisses of the Rum Jungle Complex. The arithmetic means {{of all the}} rocks analyzed are 10. 3 ppm U and 45. 7 ppm Th. This {{is more than twice}} the average {{concentrations of}} these elements in granites of similar major element composition as taken from the litera-ture. High concentrations of thorium and uranium are also found in the "younger granites " within this area. It is demonstrated that the Rum Jungle Complex and the surrounding area is a thorium, <b>uranium</b> <b>province.</b> The sediments that can be demonstrated in parts to be derived from ma-terial similar to the granites of the Rum Jungle Complex would inherit the high concentrations of uranium and thorium. Subsequent separation of thorium and uranium with concentration of uranium in structurally favorable zones took place during a period of low-grade metamorphism. This may have resulted from mobilization of the uranium occurring dis-persed throughout he sediments or by mobilization and leaching of the basement granites...|$|E
30|$|Aeromagnetic data over {{a part of}} the Singhbhum <b>uranium</b> <b>province,</b> India, {{within the}} {{framework}} of ‘Operation Hard Rock’ have been analyzed. The aeromagnetic anomaly map, its analytic signal amplitude, the Euler solutions and apparent susceptibility map helped in identifying the nature and depth of the magnetic sources in the study region. The Singhbhum Shear Zone is clearly delineated. The location of the mined uranium deposits coincide with the shallow magnetic sources. The present study also identified distinctive magnetic sources between the Dalma Volcanics and the Chotanagpur Granitic Gneissic Complex that suggest the presence of a sub-surface shear. The magnetic sources in this newly identified shear zone lie at a depth of 200 m and depict a similar magnetic signature and susceptibility as those of the Singhbhum Shear Zone where uranium is being mined. This shear could be the subsurface contact between high-grade metamorphic rocks (amphibolite facies) to the north and the greenschist facies low-grade metamorphics to the south. This shear zone, also characterized by radiometric anomalies, possibly indicates a zone of concealed uranium deposit that can be explored in the future. The present analysis shows the importance of aeromagnetic surveys and its utility in exploration for concealed mineral deposits.|$|E

40|$|More than 340 {{million pounds}} (lbs) of U 3 O 8 have been {{produced}} from the Grants uranium deposits in New Mexico between 1948 and 2002, and at least 403 million lbs of U 3 O 8 remain as unmined resources. The Grants district {{is one of the}} largest <b>uranium</b> <b>provinces</b> in the world. The Grants district extends from east of Laguna to west of Gallup in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico. Three types of sandstone uranium deposits are recognized: tabular, redistributed (roll-front, fault-related), and remnant-primary. The tabular deposits formed during the Jurassic Westwater Canyon time. Subsequently, oxidizing solutions moved downdip, modifying tabular deposits into redistributed roll-front and fault-related deposits. Evidence, including age dates and geochemistry of the uranium deposits, suggests that redistributed deposits could have been formed shortly after deposition in the early Creta-ceous and from a second oxidation front during the mid-Tertiary. The source of uranium is important in understanding how the Grants deposits formed. Two possible sources exist: 1) the Zuni Mountains, which lie south of the district and consist of a Proterozoic granitic highland enriched in uranium with as much as 11 parts per million, and with high heat flow; and 2) vol-canic rocks erupted from a Jurassic arc volcanism, which formed southwest of the San Juan Basin, an...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProposed shale-gas {{exploration}} in the semi-arid Karoo, South Africa, {{has created the}} need {{for the development of a}} robust geochemical baseline, differentiating deep and shallow groundwaters. Shallow groundwater is the main source of potable water in the Karoo, and the possibility of upwards migration of poorer quality deep groundwaters is a cause for concern. Radon concentrations of nineteen groundwater samples, from eight locations in the Karoo Basin, were determined in summer and winter. Sub-thermal waters were used as an initial proxy to define deep groundwater. Radon concentrations of < 100 Bq/L were recorded for most sites, with higher concentrations in shallow groundwaters. Seasonal and geographical variations in radon provide insight into the processes controlling radon concentrations in the Karoo groundwater. The presence of uranium and radium nuclides (possibly originating in the Karoo <b>Uranium</b> <b>Province),</b> and the presence of dolerite intrusions are important for controlling radon concentrations. Negligible uranium in deep groundwater was associated with anoxic, low alkalinity, high pH, old sub-thermal waters. Discrepancies between radon concentration and chemistry of groundwater sources defined as shallow is attested to the short half-life of 222 Rn, which records only the last stage of the water's history. Elevated radon may be linked to seismic activity, a cause for concern considering the deep formation micro-fractures associated with hydraulic fracturing...|$|E
40|$|The Lagoa Real uranium {{district}} in Bahia, northeastern Brazil, {{is the most}} important <b>uranium</b> <b>province</b> in the country and presently produces this metal in an open-pit mine operated by Indústrias Nucleares do Brasil. Uranium-rich zones are associated with plagioclase (dominantly albite ± oligoclase) -rich rocks, albitites and metasomatized granitic-gneisses, distributed along NNW/SSE striking shear zones. We have used the ID-TIMS U-Pb method to date zircon and titanite grains from the São Timóteo granitoid, and albite-rich rocks from the Lagoa Real {{district in}} order to assess the age of granite emplacement, deformation/metamorphism and uranium mineralization. The isotopic data support the following sequence of events (i) 1746 ± 5 Ma - emplacement of the São Timóteo granitoid (U-Pb zircon age) in an extensional setting, coeval with the beginning of the sedimentation of the Espinhaço Supergroup; (ii) 956 ± 59 Ma hydrothermal alteration of the São Timóteo granitoid and emplacement of the uranium mineralization (U-Pb titanite age on an albite-rich sample); (iii) 480 Ma metamorphism, remobilization and Pb loss (U-Pb titanite age for the gneiss sample), during the nucleation of shear zones related to the collision between the São Francisco-Congo and Amazonia paleoplates. The 956 ± 59 -Ma mineralization age is apparently associated with the evolution of the Macaúbas-Santo Onofre rift.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the most promising molybdenite-rich area on the north coast of Labrador, Cape Makkovik peninsula. The area, although only 6 square miles in size, is part of the Labrador <b>Uranium</b> <b>Province</b> and its geology is similar to the Beaverlodge and Great Bear Lake camps {{in the western part of}} the Canadian Shield. [...] In a reconnaissance along the Labrador coast in 1900, Daly referred to the glaciated peninsula as "a veritable museum of rock types". The map-area is underlain by an assemblage of folded metamorphosed quartzitic and amphibolitic rocks of Precambrian age which have been termed the Aillik Group. The degree of metamorphism has been largely dependent upon the original character of the rock and upon tectonic stresses which prevailed during deformation. A great number and variety of intrusive rocks ranging in composition from "amazonite" pegmatite to lamprophyre have been intruded at different times along major joint sets. [...] After detailed megascopic and microscopic study, parentage has been determined for those metamorphosed and metasomatized (potash-bearing) rocks which have retained some of their primary features. The relative ages of the igneous rocks have been determined and these observations, combined with radioactive age determinations, may possibly be a means of chronological correlation with dyke systems in other parts of Labrador.

40|$|A {{regional}} geochemical stream sediment {{survey in}} southwestern Newfoundland showed several anomalously high uranium areas. Follow-up soil and rock sampling and geological mapping programs {{were carried out}} {{in one of these}} anomalous areas - the Brinex Lake map-area. [...] The area is underlain by granodiorite, which is possibly of metasomatic origin, schist and gneisses. Pegmatite dykes are numerous and some aplite and basic dykes were also found. Rocks of the Brinex Lake map-area are possibly of Pre-Cambrian age. [...] No uranium mineralization was found in the rocks although some rocks contained anomalously high uranium values, ranging up to 85 ppm. Uranium in the rocks appears to be associated with biotite-rich lenses in schists and gneisses and in the contact zone between them and the granodiorite. Radioactive inclusions in biotite are believed to be the main source of uranium in these rocks. Red hematite alteration, which is characteristic of known uranium occurrences {{in other parts of the}} world, is commonly associated with the biotite lenses. Soil and stream sediment anomalies are closely associated with areas containing abundant biotite lenses.

40|$|AbstractThe Ordos Basin of North China is {{not only}} an {{important}} <b>uranium</b> mineralization <b>province,</b> but also a major producer of oil, gas and coal in China. The genetic relationship between uranium mineralization and hydrocarbons has been recognized by a number of previous studies, but it has not been well understood in terms of the hydrodynamics of basin fluid flow. We have demonstrated in a previous study that the preferential localization of Cretaceous uranium mineralization in {{the upper part of the}} Ordos Jurassic section may have been related to the interface between an upward flowing, reducing fluid and a downward flowing, oxidizing fluid. This interface may have been controlled by the interplay between fluid overpressure related to disequilibrium sediment compaction and which drove the upward flow, and topographic relief, which drove the downward flow. In this study, we carried out numerical modeling for the contribution of oil and gas generation to the development of fluid overpressure, in addition to sediment compaction and heating. Our results indicate that when hydrocarbon generation is taken into account, fluid overpressure during the Cretaceous was more than doubled in comparison with the simulation when hydrocarbon generation was not considered. Furthermore, fluid overpressure dissipation at the end of sedimentation slowed down relative to the no-hydrocarbon generation case. These results suggest that hydrocarbon generation may have played an important role in uranium mineralization, not only in providing reducing agents required for the mineralization, but also in contributing to the driving force to maintain the upward flow...|$|R

Namibia, one of the youngest independent nations in Africa, has a large number of uranium occurrences and deposits in several geological environments. The total estimated uranium resource amounts to about 299 thousand tonnes recoverable uranium at a cost of less than US $ 130 /kg U, within the known conventional resources category. The most prominent geological type of these is the unique, granite-related uranium occurrences located in the central part of the Namib Desert. A number of large tonnage but low-grade deposits suitable for open-cast mining, were identified between 1960 and 1980, the peak period for uranium exploration. At one of these deposits, Rossing, mining operations started in 1976 and will continue into the first quarter of the next century. The presence of other, so far undiscovered deposits are suspected under thin Tertiary cover within this <b>uranium</b> <b>province.</b> Calcrete-hosted uranium occurrences and deposits are of secondary importance, due to a lower recoverable tonnage of uranium and complications with metallurgical processes. At times of better uranium markets however, at least one of these deposits will receive serious attention...|$|E
40|$|As {{high grade}} and easily {{processed}} uranium ore deposits are exhausted {{it will become}} necessary to mine and process lower grade and refractory ore deposits to fuel the world's nuclear reactors and satisfy societal needs for energy. Brannerite is the most abundant of the refractory uranium minerals. It is a uranium titanate with the ideal chemical formula of UTi 2 O 6, though the exact composition varies widely with thorium and light rare earths often replacing uranium. A more general formula for it would be (U, Ca, Y, Ce, La) (Ti, Fe) 2 O 6. Uranium ores containing brannerite mineralisation have been processed in several mines including two active uranium mines in Australia and several uranium-gold mines in the Witwatersrand area of South Africa. Ores in which brannerite is the main uranium mineral have been mined and processed in the Elliot Lake region of Ontario, Canada. Brannerite is present in significant concentrations in many uranium and rare earth element deposits {{including some of the}} uranium deposits located near Mount Isa in Queensland, the Crocker Well deposit in South Australia, the Elkon <b>uranium</b> <b>province</b> in Jakutia, eastern Russia, and in some uranium-gold ores from the Witwatersrand area of South Africa.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{results of a}} recent re-evaluation of {{airborne}} magnetometric and gamma spectrometric data of the <b>uranium</b> <b>province</b> of Lagoa Real (BA), acquired under the project São Timoteo. The main purpose is to provide {{new insights into the}} magnetic and radiometric characteristics of the structural units in this region, derived from a careful analysis of the aeromagnetic and radiometric data of the study area. We provide details of the correction and interpretation procedures employed in data processing. A remarkable feature of the present work has been the judicious use of such interpretation techniques as the vertical derivative, analytic signal and Euler de-convolution, which have lead to identification {{of a large number of}} lineaments and basement features in the study area, not identified in previous studies. Prominent among these are the NW-SE trending lineaments in the northern parts, arc shaped features in the west-central parts and circular features in the south and south-western parts of the Lagoa Real province. There are indications that changes in direction of the lineaments are associated with fracture zones, associated with Uranium mineralization processes. Most of the bodies with magnetic contrasts are located at depths less than 500 meters, but there also a number of bodies at depths extending up to depths of 1500 m. The results have also allowed determination of a number of structural features not identified in geologic studies as well as in previous interpretations of aeromagnetic data. Joint interpretation of magnetic and gamma spectrometric data have allowed identification of uranium mineralization zones, associated with local metasomatic processes. We conclude that the results obtained are in good agreement with the local structural framework inferred from geologic studies, but significantly different from those reported in earlier studies.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the shift in}} governance structures, bargains, and processes in the Saskatchewan uranium industry between the 1970 s and 2000 s. Using a framework based on international political economy, the thesis analyzes the security, production, financial and knowledge structures that shaped {{the environment of the}} <b>province’s</b> <b>uranium</b> industry. In addition, an analysis of bargains created between and among structures helps provide further insight into the industry. Through this type of analysis, the thesis draws comparisons between the Allan Blakeney New Democratic Party and the Brad Wall Saskatchewan Party governments’ attempts to expand the uranium cycle in Saskatchewan. Due to conditions both internal and external to their administrations, the Blakeney and Wall governments engaged in two different processes, one closed and one open. Looking at these two events through content analysis, studying official statements, public documents, government positions and media reports, this thesis explores the circumstances that engendered two different processes and the outcomes each process produced. The 1970 s and 80 s refinery debate relied on a state-centric process that limited relationships with the industrial sector and the societal sector. These factors contributed to the failure of the provincial government to win the refinery contract. Given different governance structures during this era, the outcome reached for the refinery may have been different. Two decades later, the nuclear energy debate in the 2000 s benefitted from evolved governance structures. The state engaged in a stronger working relationship with industry and a more open discourse with the public. However, the increased governing versatility remained unable to counteract economic forces at the global level. Both cases exemplify the difficulty expanding an industry as complex and contentious as uranium despite substantial change in governance models...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{occurrences of}} uranium in the Katanga system of late Proterozoic age were known {{only in the}} Shaban {{province}} of ZaYre, as at Shinkolobwe, and in the Zambian Copperbelt. A survey by AGIP has now shown the existence of uranium mineralization in northwestern Zambia in similar rocks. This mineralization occurs mainly in mica schists underlying a quartz-ite horizon near {{the base of the}} Lower Roan formation at the margins of the Kabompo, Mwombezhi, and Solwezi domes. The mineralization occurs as disseminations or as veins of thorium-free pi•chblende, and as secondary uranium minerals. Several of the occurrences have been investigated by drilling which intersected scattered mineralization of good thickness and grades. The economic significance of this new <b>uranium</b> <b>province</b> is still under study. Uranium occurrences in the Katanga system of the Shaban and Zambian Copperbelts were earlier thought o be of magmatic origin and to belong to a metallogenic epoch independent of the copper-cobalt mineralization. A deposit at Shinkolobwe was in fact classified as of typical endogenous type. It is here suggested that all the known uranium occurrences in the Katanga system in the Copperbelt and domes areas are of sedimentary syngenetic origin like the copper and cobalt mineralization. In the three areas described, i. e., Shaban and Zambian Copperbelts and the domes area, copper and uranium mineralization is found in the Lower Roan formation in the lowest part of the Katanga system in similar environmental conditions and stratigraphic ontrols but areally localized according to a regional metal zoning pattern. Tectonic deformation during the Lufilian orogeny and metamorphism related to and sub-sequent o the orogeny gave rise to epigenetic vein-type uranium deposits by the repeated mobilization and redeposition of the original mineralization.

40|$|Studies {{were made}} to {{identify}} the principal geochemical mechanisms for the mobilization and retardation of 238 U, 234 U and 230 Th in the weathered zone and groundwaters of the Alligator Rivers <b>Uranium</b> <b>Province,</b> Northern Territory, Australia. Selective extraction studies showed secondary iron minerals retard migration of U and Th isotopes. 230 Th/ 234 u activity ratios 3 ̆e 3 ̆e 1 in disseminated crystalline iron oxide grains indicate preferential retention of 230 Th over time scales 3 ̆c 238 U due to recoil emplacement following alpha-decay. Ultrafiltration showed that U isotopes migrate in ARUP groundwaters largely as true solute species. Solute U levels and 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios in shallow aquifers of orebody dispersion haloes approximate a simple twocomponent dilution-by-infiltration model. Desorption of U to the aquifer probably derives from vertical leaching by infiltration. Uranium adsorption in the aquifer is not significant in the short term. Thorium isotopes are significantly associated with colloids. There was no evidence for recoil enhancement of 230 Th dissolution from U ores. 230 Th solute levels were universally lower than expected on thermodynamic grounds. 232 Th is not significantly enriched in ARUP deposits. Competition between rates of complexation and rapid adsorption appeared to cause equivalent ambient levels of complexed solute 232 Th to exceed those of 230 Th. Colloids were composed principally of iron and silicon species, probably ferrihydrite associated with silicate and discrete colloidal silica. Colloidal clays were not evident. Radioactive ferruginous pisoliths from above an orebody were evaluated for their potential as permanent 2 ̆ 2 sinks 2 ̆ 2 for U and Th. Fission track autoradiography and chemical tests indicated an absence of postdepositional leaching of U. No 230 Th/ 234 U activity ratios in excess of unity were found in oxide phases. Accumulating oxide layers cause continuous net accumulation of U by irreversible adsorption. Oxide crystals are smaller than or commensurate with alpha-decay recoil ranges. Authigenic 234 U and 230 Th (but not 226 Ra) m a y b e quantitatively retained by recoil emplacement into crystals and intense adsorption.

40|$|The Damaran belt in Namibia {{represents}} a highly eroded orogenic area, the root zone {{of which is}} exposed between Swakopmund on the coast and Karibib in the west. Primary uranium deposits located in these structurally lower regions of the orogen, have been studied {{in an attempt to}} assess the importance of geological processes associated with remobilization in the genesis of the uraniferous Damaran granitoids. The pre-Damaran basement consists of a sequence of up to 1600 m of shallow water clastic and carbonate rocks with interbedded metabasaltic and pyroclastic horizons. The 'meta-basalts' range in composition from basalt to andesite, and are characterized by chemical features diagnostic of a tholeiitic, and in some cases komatiitic affinity. This sequence, previously assigned to the Abbabis Formation, is intruded locally by 2. 0 Ga gneisses which range in composition from diorites, through granodiorites to alkali-rich granites. Pb-isotope ratios of sulphides from the basement and the Damaran metasedimentary cover indicate that the basement was enriched in U/Pb at 1. 7 Ga, and that the Damaran <b>uranium</b> <b>province</b> has been in existence for at least 1. 7 Ga. The Damara Sequence consists of a lower Nosib Group and an upper Swakop Group. The former consists of fluviatile clastics (Etusis Formation), followed by shallow-water calcareous, feldspathic sandstones (Khan Formation). Uranium minerals, in the form of uranyl silicate inclusions, found within detrital constituents of the Etusis quartzites, provide direct evidence of radioactive material within the pre-Damaran basement prior to its erosion, transportation and deposition within the ii. Damara Sequence. The Swakop Group {{represents a}} typical geosynclinals sequence starting with carbonates, quartzites, conglomerates and pelites (Rossing Formation); followed by mixtites (Chuos Formation) and a dominantly calcareous succession (Karibib Formation); and ending with a monotonous series of biotite schists (Kuiseb Formation). Primary uranium minerals including uraninite and betafite located within schists and calc silicates of the Rossing Formation are considered to have recrystallized during the Damaran metamorphism from syngenetic uranium associated with stratabound copper deposits. The Damaran belt underwent regional deformation between about 650 and 550 Ma, and although early mafic granitoids were emplaced locally, the major granite forming event post-dates the major regional deformation. Between 540 and 46 O Ma dome structures were developed by a process involving diapirism and the upward movement and subsequent ballooning of large volumes of granitic material. The Damaran granitoids may be broadly divided into syn- to post-tectonic Salem type granites and red granites, and late- to post-tectonic leucogranites and alaskites. Field relationships indicate that the Salem type granites are derived from a source deeper than the Damara Sequence, whilst the alaskites appear to be derived from migmatized basement and Damaran metasedimentary cover rocks. The earlier Damaran granitoids, which tend to be more mafic in character, show relatively low Sr-isotope ratios and contain chemical and mineralogical features in common with I-type granitoids. These various factors are considered to reflect derivation from the lower crust or upper mantle. In contrast the later granitoids are normally leucocratic in nature, commonly radioactive and occasionally mineralized. They display relatively high Sr-isotope ratios, and an affinity with S-type granitoids, and they are considered to be derived from basement and Nosib source rocks. The mineralized alaskites contain primary uranium minerals including uraninite, betafite and metamict thorite which crystallized from melts enriched in IJ and Th. Primary mineralizations are not restricted to alaskites, but also occur within red granites. Secondary uranium minerals within the mineralized Damaran granitoids include uranyl silicate, thorogummite, calciothorite, ferrothorite and uranophane. These minerals formed during a deuteric stage of alteration, and also during a recent stage of surface enrichment and secondary alteration. ...|$|E
