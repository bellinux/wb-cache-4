5|$|In England and Wales an {{estimated}} 41,200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%. It {{is estimated that}} 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur {{as a result of}} poisoning each year in England and Wales. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the <b>US</b> <b>than</b> overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults, and 25% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{spends more}} than other {{countries}} for the same things. Drugs are more expensive, doctors are paid more, and suppliers charge more for medical equipment than other countries. Journalist Todd Hixon reported on a study that U.S. spending on physicians per person is about five times higher than peer countries, $1,600 versus $310, as much as 37% of the gap with other countries. This was driven by a greater use of specialist doctors, who charge 3-6 times more in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> in peer countries.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} Latin American countries, the United States had {{cultivated}} {{a relationship with}} the Honduran military. A 1954 agreement between the two countries promised military aid from the US in exchange for resource extraction rights. The military sent representatives to meetings of the US-orchestrated Central American War Ministers group, which became CONDECA (Consejo de Defensa Centroamericana). During the Villeda Morales presidency, the Honduran military had greater allegiance to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> to the Liberal Party government—thereby exerting constant pressure on the government to follow U.S. policy mandates.|$|E

25|$|Some who {{advocate}} against greater government involvement in healthcare have {{asserted that the}} difference in costs {{between the two nations}} is partially explained by the differences in their demographics. Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> in Canada, also add a burden to the system, as many of them do not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms— which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA— as a principal source of care. In Colorado, for example, an estimated 80% of undocumented immigrants do not have health insurance.|$|E
25|$|Honda had {{an easier}} time {{expanding}} in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> in Japan, where Honda first began as a motorcycle manufacturer, only later entering the automobile market in competition with other established competitors including Toyota and Nissan. By 1983, Honda had 805 dealerships in the U.S. In the early 1990s, Honda sold two cars in the U.S. for every one car it sold in Japan. In 1990, American Honda took up residence in its current headquarters facility in Torrance, California. Following the death of founder Soichiro Honda in 1991, the company's global operations were re-organized, forming four regional operations including North America.|$|E
25|$|However, U.S. {{government}} spending covers {{less than half}} of all healthcare costs. Private spending is also far greater in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> in Canada. In Canada, an average of $917 was spent annually by individuals or private insurance companies for health care, including dental, eye care, and drugs. In the U.S., this sum is $3,372. In 2006, healthcare consumed 15.3% of U.S. annual GDP. In Canada, only 10% of GDP was spent on healthcare. This difference is a relatively recent development. In 1971 the nations were much closer, with Canada spending 7.1% of GDP while the U.S. spent 7.6%.|$|E

25|$|While PAVN/VC defeat was {{inevitable}} {{in the face}} of U.S. firepower, the failure to sever the PAVN supply lines and isolate the battlefield meant that the battle lasted longer and was more costly to the ARVN and <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> was necessary. Until the last week of the battle the ARVN, U.S. Marines and 1st Cavalry each fought separate, largely uncoordinated battles without any unified command structure, no overall strategy and competing demands for logistics, air and artillery support. Delaying the counterattack until a clear strategy was developed and the necessary forces assembled might have reduced casualties among the ARVN, U.S. forces and civilians and shortened the battle.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} {{cultural}} {{differences in how}} the genders view infidelity, {{it was observed that}} females found emotional infidelity much more distressful and males found sexual infidelity to be much more distressful than females. A comparison between modern day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the <b>US</b> <b>than</b> in China. The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a more salient concern. Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society (Geary et al. 1995).|$|E
25|$|An {{assessment}} by Health Canada {{found that}} cancer mortality rates are almost identical {{in the two}} countries. Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers {{were higher in the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S. In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries. Their analysis indicates that Canada has greater survival rates for both colorectal cancer and childhood leukemia, while the United States has greater survival rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as breast and cervical cancer.|$|E

25|$|Although a generic, off patent {{medication}} in the U.S., as of January 2016, {{there was}} only one FDA-approved pharmaceutical supplier, Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Due to this monopoly, the cost per 250mg tablet was $70.46 per tablet for a daily treatment cost of ~$2110/day for a 75kg adult (165 pounds) adult and $29,591 for a two-week treatment course as of December 2015. As the most common indication for flucytosine is cryptococcal meningitis, this cost makes flucytosine unavailable for the majority of persons in the U.S. requiring the medicine. This cost of flucytosine is more than 100-fold higher in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>than</b> in the United Kingdom and Europe via Meda AB Pharmaceuticals. Flucytosine tablets are available in India for USD 2.00 per tablet via Jolly Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. and are available in 100 tablet packs.|$|E
