25|$|Hydrogen has a clean {{flame and}} {{is good for}} use on aluminium.

40|$|Xylem {{resistance}} to water stress-induced cavitation is an important trait {{that is associated with}} drought tolerance of plants. The level of xylem cavitation experienced by a plant is often assessed as the percentage loss in conductivity (PLC) at different water potentials. Such measurements are constructed with samples that are excised underwater at native tensions. However, a recent study concluded that cutting conduits under significant tension induced cavitation, even when samples were held <b>underwater</b> during <b>cutting.</b> This resulted in artificially increased PLC because of what we have termed a ‘tension-cutting artefact’. We tested the hypothesized tension-cutting artefact on five species by measuring PLC at native tension compared with after xylem tensions had been relaxed. Our results did not support the tension-cutting artefact hypothesis, as no differences were observed between native and relaxed samples in four of five species. In a fifth species (Laurus nobilis), differences between native and relaxed samples appear to be due to vessel refilling rather than a tension-cutting effect. We avoided the tension-cutting artefact by cutting samples to slightly longer than their measurement length and subse-quent trimming of at least 0. 5 cm of sample ends prior to measurement.

50|$|Weed cutting {{boats are}} {{developed}} {{to enable the}} maintenance of canals, lakes and rivers and to remove excessive aquatic life such as algae and other plants that may negatively affect a waterway's ecology. Mechanical harvesters are large floating machines that have <b>underwater</b> <b>cutting</b> blades that sever the stems of underwater plants, gather the weeds and raise them on conveyor belts, storing the vegetation on board in a hold. Periodically this is discharged to a barge or an onshore facility. The harvested product can be composted, sent to a landfill site or used in land reclamation. In developing countries aquatic vegetation may be harvested by hand or by net from the shore, cut and harvested by boat and lifted ashore by hand, crane, pump or conveyor system. The harvested vegetation {{may be used for}} the feeding of livestock. To reduce the high moisture content and {{to make it easier to}} transport, the weed can be chopped and pressed. Other uses to which the harvested vegetation can be put include ensiling the material for livestock fodder, adding it to the soil as a bulky organic fertilizer, manufacturing the raw material into pulp, paper or fibre, and fermenting it to produce methane for energy production.|$|E

40|$|Fiber-optic {{networks}} {{are vulnerable to}} natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, {{as well as to}} physical failures, such as an anchor <b>cutting</b> <b>underwater</b> fiber cables. Such real-world events occur in specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network. Therefore, the geography of the network determines the effect of physical events on the network's connectivity and capacity. In this paper, we develop tools to analyze network failures after a `random' geographic disaster. The random location of the disaster allows us to model situations where the physical failures are not targeted attacks. In particular, we consider disasters that {{take the form of a}} `random' line in a plane. Using results from geometric probability, we are able to calculate some network performance metrics to such a disaster in polynomial time. In particular, we can evaluate average two-terminal reliability in polynomial time under `random' line-cuts. This is in contrast to the case of independent link failures for which there exists no known polynomial time algorithm to calculate this reliability metric. We also present some numerical results to show the significance of geometry on the survivability of the network and discuss network design in the context of random line-cuts. Our novel approach provides a promising new direction for modeling and designing networks to lessen the effects of geographical disasters or attacks. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} {{development}} of a new underwater laser cutting process in which a water-jet has been used along with the laser beam to remove the molten material through kerf. The conventional underwater laser cutting usually utilizes a high pressure gas jet along with laser beam to create a dry condition in the cutting zone and also to eject out the molten material. This causes a lot of gas bubbles and turbulence in water, and produces aerosols and waste gas. This may cause contamination in the surrounding atmosphere while cutting radioactive components like burnt nuclear fuel. The water-jet assisted underwater laser cutting process produces much less turbulence and aerosols in the atmosphere. Some amount of water vapor bubbles is formed at the laser-metal-water interface; however, they tend to condense as they rise up through the surrounding water. We present the design and development of a water-jet assisted underwater laser cutting head and the parametric study of the cutting of AISI 304 stainless steel sheets with a 2 kW CW fiber laser. The cutting performance is similar to that of the gas assist laser cutting; however, the process efficiency is reduced due to heat convection by water-jet and laser beam scattering by vapor. This process may be attractive for <b>underwater</b> <b>cutting</b> of nuclear reactor components. Keywords—Laser, <b>underwater</b> <b>cutting,</b> water-jet...|$|E
40|$|When {{multifunctional}} pipeline repair machinery (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the cutter heads and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline clamping device was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and cranking block mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions of the clamping device were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the friction torque of clamping points with the driving force. Clamping device and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ø 304. 8 – 457. 2  mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted <b>underwater,</b> and the <b>cutting</b> and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the double rocker mechanism. Second, the driving force of the clamping device increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2  mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving force of the clamping device should be greater than 10219  N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system. The research results in this paper provide technical basis for the research and development of similar engineering prototypes...|$|R

40|$|The <b>underwater</b> <b>cutting</b> {{of large}} steel {{structures}} is a cumbersome process. There is no directly applicable method for the real-time control of abrasive {{water jet cutting}} quality. However, for some applications where structures have to be separated by means of <b>underwater</b> <b>cutting,</b> an adequate process monitoring strategy is indispensable. This paper describes how two related methods are used for indirect cutting process monitoring. One method uses a real-time time and spectral analysis of the emitted sound of the abrasive water jet while the other method monitors the resonant structural behaviour of the structure during the cutting operation. The first section of this paper focusses on the main parameters of an abrasive water jet cutting process and their influence on the resulting sound spectrum of the jet. An overview of the currently applied monitoring methods is given. A second part relates the emitted sound spectrum of the abrasive water jet with its possible disruptions or irregularities during cutting. It is fully outlined how adequate experiments are used for this analysis. The third section analyses the structural resonant behaviour of simple tubes during cutting. It is outlined how real-time vibration monitoring helps to estimate the degree of separation during a typical cutting operation and the remaining defects after a cutting process. Finite elements models are applied to determine the optimal measurement configuration for this vibration monitoring. Simulations are validated by means of lab-scale experiments. Special attention {{is given to the}} spatial resolution that can be reached by this method and a discussion of its advantages and limitations. Section four describes the validation of both methods during an industrial under water abrasive water jet cutting process. It summarizes with general conclusions on the application of both methods. status: publishe...|$|E
