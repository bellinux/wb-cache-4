This thrust on the massification of higher education {{has resulted in a}} new problem-graduate unemployment. The growing problem of graduate unemployment in Malaysia is widely debated in the media and blogs. The Higher Education Ministry, in its Graduate Tracer Study Report 2011, reported that 24 per cent of them have not found a job after six months of graduating. The employment scenario of the urban planning graduates has changed over the years from catering the needs of the public sector, to catering the needs of the private sector and to fulfilling the need of the One Stop Centre or the OSC. The advent of the liberalization of <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> challenges urban planning schools in Malaysia to produce planners not only to cater for local needs but also with the capability of exporting their skills and services internationally. Given the diverse scope of urban planning it is a paradox that graduates of urban planning should converge on the conventional urban planning organizations for employment. The paper will highlight some preliminary findings on the employment prospect of urban planning graduates in the immediate future and the possibility of diversifying employment opportunities of urban planning graduates...|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a start-up firm consists of a chain of activities; technical research, opportunity identification, resource acquisition to name a few. The business model (BM) for a start-up firm is also being developed (intrinsically or explicitly) along with these activities. This development of BM is gradual and continuous. Eventually when entrepreneurs claim to have defined the BM for their start-up, {{most of the time}} they have just identified the BM that is being intrinsically designed since the technology research stage. Entrepreneurs draft a business plan to authenticate the economic value of the technology at hand. This business plan represents a simple value creating and money earning logic. This logic is the first basic design of the start-up’s BM. Even though an initial draft of a BM is in place, actual maturity of each BM element happens in segments. This thesis tries to track the design of a BM in terms of BM elements, which form the start-up’s first efficient BM. To ensure a balanced growth, entrepreneurs should consider the designing of the BM synchronised with start-up development. Scholars have proposed many models for start-up growth, which don’t specifically focus on all BM elements but on overall start-up growth. A roadmap of BM elements using CANVAS and C-SOFT frameworks, in sync with start-up growth is the deliverable of this thesis. This roadmap will assist entrepreneurs to identify which BM elements to develop during specific phases of start-up growth. This guidance is more valuable to an upcoming industry with a great potential for small scale service providing start-ups. Geographical Information System (GIS) service providing industry is embarking on such an opportunity with the rise of open sourced GIS platforms for integrating <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> to manage the rising trend of smart cities.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Town and Regional Planning)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, 2006 The {{research}} {{focuses on}} urbanising communities in the peri-urban areas of the Tamale Metropolitan Area (TAMA) of Ghana and {{the inability of the}} urban authorities to provide adequate basic infrastructure services. Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative research approaches, the author observed that the development planning paradigms practiced over the years placed <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>service</b> delivery in a centralised paradigm which cannot respond adequately to the increasing pressures of urbanisation, nor offer opportunities for the involvement of communities due to this top-down planning approache. The research in fact identified that the communities, through their own initiatives have <b>planned</b> and executed <b>service</b> projects to improve their lives in some respects where the TAMA has failed. The communities have achieved this due to their spirit of social solidarity, self-help and communalism built around their traditional chiefs, which incorporates some of the principles of Local Agenda 21. The TAMA sees this development as an opportunity to henceforth forge collaboration and partnerships with the traditional authorities for improved service delivery in the urbanising communities. This represents innovative <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> and management approaches, which in the context of low-income urban communities, includes participatory <b>planning</b> and <b>service</b> delivery. These innovative approaches have been initiated in the Habitat Agenda emanating from the UN Conference on Human Settlements in 1996. The study advocates the concept of sustainable development and Agenda 21, as a working model which presents a participatory and integrative process for local authorities and communities to work towards urban improvements. The Local Agenda 21 planning approach, it is argued, will integrate and strengthen the already existing local community initiatives and provide a basis for partnerships and improved service delivery.

Multiple institutions and unclear regulatory framework for financing and managing urban heritage assets, combined with the weak capacity of Urban Local Bodies have created major challenges for managing these heritage cities.It is essential to note here that the development of a heritage city is not just about development and conservation of a few monuments, but development of the entire city, its <b>planning,</b> its basic <b>services,</b> quality of life of its communities, its economy and livelihoods, cleanliness, security, reinvigoration of its soul and an explicit manifestation of its character.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} alternative population distribution models on GIS-based spatial accessibility analyses using the two-step Floating Catchment Analysis technique. Two population models were tested: the de facto standard of even-distribution within census tracts and a dasymetric-based approach. The latter builds on previous research {{through the use of}} a novel methodology that integrates raster map data with a recently built mailing information database in order to enhance the precision with which residential areas are identified. Analysis was conducted for a case study area (Cardiff, South Wales) in order to examine variations in accessibility to a number of public services in the city. The dasymetric model showed a general tendency to report lower accessibility scores, but detailed patterns depended on local factors and, to some extent, on modelling assumptions and methodological issues. A paired T-Test analysis demonstrated that significant differences in outcomes were dependant on the population model adopted. Accessibility-based measures are increasingly being incorporated into deprivation indicators and the paper concludes by suggesting that, if such analysis is to inform <b>urban</b> <b>planning,</b> local <b>service</b> provision and the spatial allocation of financial resources, greater attention needs to be given to the method of population representation utilised in such models...|$|R

40|$|South Africa is {{experiencing}} increasing urbanisation {{and an increase}} in the number of the poor in urban areas and thus the number of food insecure households in these environments. Formal economic opportunities however often fail to keep pace with increase in urban population and this result in increases in informal but not officially recognised activities. Formal <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> provision therefore does not enhance the potential of such opportunities. Urban agriculture (UA) is viewed as one such an opportunity not sufficiently activated in urban development strategies. Urban population depends largely on cash income to access food and with unemployment increasing more urban households are unable to access food to meet their needs. Alternative ways of accessing food has become necessary. In Soshanguve close to Pretoria, South Africa, some poor families engaged farming within the township to earn a living. This study has investigated the impact of such farming on household’s food security and income generation. The study investigated an agricultural project launched in 1996 by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) in collaboration with Gauteng Provincial Department of Agriculture (GPDA). Forty-eight participants from nine participating groups in Soshanguve were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Farming in urban environment has been found to benefit poor households through direct saving on food purchases, income generation through sale of produced and provision of a varied range of nutritious foods. The hypothesis adopted by this study was that “urban agriculture is often not considered an “urban land use” activity by <b>urban</b> <b>planning</b> authorities and the potential of this economic rationale strategy to support urban food security is not sufficiently exploited. This result in lack of adequate land use <b>planning</b> for <b>urban</b> agriculture and weak support to urban farmers. Urban agriculture is therefore constrained by lack of integrated development approach. The theoretical framework for this study includes the following: (i) UA is derived from the rational resource allocation of (poor) urban dwellers who are not in a position to earn sufficient income from non farming to provide a sustainable urban family livelihood; (ii) UA can be explained by cost saving and reduction in transaction costs from a consumer viewpoint (point of consumption to point of food acquisition); (iii) UA is often a temporary survival strategy to allow a fall back position if sufficient urban income is not generated; (iv) UA is practised mainly to address household food security with surpluses sold in the market. Major finding of this study includes the findings on approach and operation applied by the farmers. The project has the potential to be successful because the benefits are tangible and direct. Farmers in Soshanguve experienced a host of interlinked problems but the project only addressed the information and input problems. The project lacks monitoring and evaluation framework. The development of small farmers should not only focus on short-term assistance through technical training and input supply. The following recommendations were proposed for the development of a sustainable and viable UA sector. The main recommendation is the need to create an enabling environment through the development of appropriate policies. Such policies should Recognize agriculture as a land use activity in urban environments and provide sufficient support services to the urban small-scale agricultural sector. Encourage investment on infrastructure and technology development required for UA development Co-ordinate agricultural activities within urban and between urban and rural areas Involve beneficiaries in the planning and implementation of projects Establish permanent structures and institutions that will promote urban agriculture activities and develop measures to counter negative impacts of UA Dissertation (M Inst Agrar (Agricultural Economics)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.
