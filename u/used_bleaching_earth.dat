30|$|The {{bleaching}} process is applied after degumming and neutralization in the chemical refining {{and it is}} more appropriately referred to as adsorption treatment. Crude edible oil still contains undesirable substances such as FFA, gummy materials and colouring matters. Colouring matters are due {{to the presence of}} pigments in the crude edible oil. These pigments are carotenoids, chlorophyll, gossypol and related compounds. These impurities from crude oils are removed by using the materials with a strong adsorption power. The usual method of bleaching is the adsorption of the colouring substances on an adsorbent material. Refiners have a wide choice of adsorbents for using and their main criteria are cost and performance of the adsorbent materials. Examples of bleaching agents are natural <b>bleaching</b> <b>earth,</b> acid-activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>earth,</b> synthetic silicates, synthetic resins and activated carbons. Bleaching agents normally possess a large surface that has a more or less specific affinity for pigment-type molecules, thus removing them from oil without damaging the oil itself.

Non-clay minerals such as quartz, anatase, cristobalite, K-feldspar and heulandite are also identified in variable quantities. Chemical analyses of the major elements show that the clays from Bana and Sabga consist mainly of the follow oxides such as SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3. Bana clays have a cation exchange capacity (CEC) between 50 and 60 meq/ 100 g and a specific surface area between 50 and 60 m 2 / g. Sabga clays have a lower capacity cation exchange (38 - 46 meq/ 100 g) and a wider range of specific surface area (33 - 90 m 2 / g). The characterization of the natural clays allowed to select of one sample by locality for sulfuric acid treatment. The acid treatment of these materials led to structural, morphological and textural changes. Analysis by X-ray diffraction showed a progressive decrease in the intensity of the (001) reflection of montmorillonite and a shift of its basal d 001 -value. Treatment with more acid concentration causes an increase in the surface area of the obtained products and a decrease in cation exchange capacity.

When decolorizing fatty oils, oil retention can be up to 50 wt % on <b>bleaching</b> <b>earths</b> and nearly 100 wt % on activated charcoal.|$|R
30|$|Thus, the {{adsorption}} of {{the color}} pigments in neutralized sunflower oil with different types of activated carbon and commercial earth material has been examined at different temperatures, contact times, moisture and bleaching material dosages. The results indicated that activated carbon A 1 and A 2 have great potential in the removal of colour pigments and residues from sunflower oil. Another advantage {{for the use of}} activated carbons A 1 and A 2 in the processing of sunflower oil is the decrease in free fatty acids and the effective overall performance of sample A 2 was found higher than <b>bleaching</b> <b>earth</b> and other activated carbon samples. According to the results of oil analysis, 1 % concentration, 30  min contact time, less than 0.1 % moisture and 20  °C bleaching temperature were optimal bleaching parameters for activated carbon A 1 and A 2. These activated carbon samples can be used as an adsorbent in bleaching of sunflower oil besides <b>bleaching</b> <b>earth</b> in the domestic market.|$|R

Particle size distribution, mineralogical and chemical analyses were done. The activation parameters (temperature, acid concentration and activation time) permitting the optimisation of their bleaching capacities have been determined.

40|$|The {{production}} of ethyl ester from a feed material of esterified crude palm oil with 1. 7 Â wt% of {{free fatty acid}} (FFA) content using microwave heating was investigated. Parametric {{studies were carried out}} to investigate the optimum conditions for the transesterification process (amount of ethanol, amount of catalyst and reaction time). As a result, optimum reaction parameters for the transesterification process aided by microwave heating have been identified: a molar ratio of oil to ethanol of 1 : 8. 5, 1. 5 Â wt% of KOH/oil, a reaction time of 5 Â min and a microwave power of 70 Â W. Glycerin from the ester phase was separated by adding 10 Â wt% of pure glycerin. The ethyl ester was purified with 1. 2 Â wt% of <b>bleaching</b> <b>earth</b> to remove the residual catalyst and residual glycerin. This transesterification process provided a yield of 85 Â wt% with an ester content of 98. 1 Â wt%. The final ethyl ester product met the specifications stipulated by ASTM D 6751 - 02.

40|$|Spent <b>Bleaching</b> <b>Earth</b> (SBE) is a {{waste of}} palm oil {{refinery}} industry. One of the efforts to control the SBE is to be processed into Regenerated Spent <b>Bleaching</b> <b>Earth</b> (RSBE). This study aims to determine the adsorption capability of RSBE and the corresponding adsorption model on ion Fe(III). SBE processing into RSBE by extraction of oil on SBE soxhletation manner using n-hexane at a temperature of 72 °C for 8 hours. Then the rest of the SBE results soxhletation washed with 3 % HCl and physically activated at a temperature of 470 oC. A total of 1 g RSBE mixed with a solution of Fe(NO 3) 3 with a volume of 100 ml at various concentrations (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 ppm). The results showed that the adsorption RSBE reach equilibrium after a contact time of 150 minutes and adsorption that occurs following the Langmuir isotherm models with correlation coefficient (R 2) = 0. 982 and the maximum value jerap capacity = 2. 71 mg Fe (III) / g RSBE...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} bleaching of vegetable oils using activated clays collected from some deposits in Egypt as compared to Tonsil FF currently used by local oil industry. The comparison was made; {{not only on the}} basis of the decolourising power of the earth, but also on the basis of its effects on the oil acidity, formation of the oil peroxides and the decomposition rate of the formed peroxides to aldehydes and ketones during the bleaching process. The activation of the collected earth samples was made using 4 N HCl, 6 N HCl and 30 % H 2 SO 4. The bleaching tests of the activated samples were performed using the major four oil types processed in Egypt being cottonseed, sunflower, soybean and palm oils. In addition to the laboratory-evaluation tests, the performance of the activated samples, which showed promise on the lab-scale have been also tested on an industrial scale. The industrial application has proved that the activated local earth's can be successfully <b>used</b> as <b>bleaching</b> <b>earth</b> of local oils. Thus it can be used as a substitute of the varieties currently imported and used by the local oil sector. La presente investigaci&# 243;n trata de la decoloraci&# 243;n de aceites vegetales usando tierras activadas obtenidas de yacimientos egipcios, compar&# 225;ndola con el Tonsil FF usado normalmente en la industria ole&# 237;cola local. La comparaci&# 243;n se realiz&# 243;, no s&# 243;lo sobre la base del poder decolorante de la tierra, sino tambi&# 233;n sobre la base de sus efectos en la acidez del aceite, la formaci&# 243;n de per&# 243;xidos y la velocidad de descomposici&# 243;n de los per&# 243;xidos formados en aldehidos y cetonas durante el proceso de decoloraci&# 243;n. La activaci&# 243;n de las muestras de tierras recogidas se hizo utilizando ClH 4 N, ClH 6 N y H 2 SO 4 30 %. Los tests de decoloraci&# 243;n de las muestras activadas se llevaron a cabo usando los cuatro tipos mayoritarios de aceites procesados en Egipto: aceite de semilla de algod&# 243;n, de girasol, de soja y de palma. Adem&# 225;s de los tests a escala de laboratorio, la evaluaci&# 243;n de las muestras activadas, se realiz&# 243; a escala industrial. La aplicaci&# 243;n industrial ha demostrado que las tierras locales activadas pueden ser utilizadas con &# 233;xito como tierras decolorantes de aceites locales. De este modo pueden usarse como sustitutos de las variedades mas frecuentemente importadas y usadas por el sector aceitero...|$|R
