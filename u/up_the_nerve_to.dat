5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him {{tips on how to}} give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E

40|$|Target {{location}} is coded into {{the pattern of}} spikes that run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bat's brain. Realistic scenes containing multiple, closely spaced, reflectors give rise to complex echo signals consisting of multiple filtered copies of the bat's own vocalisation. Some of this filtering {{is due to the}} directivity of the bat’s reception system i. e., the outer ears, and some of it is due to sound absorption and the reflection process. The analysis below concentrates on the conspicuous ridges (notches) these filter operations give rise to in the time-frequency representation of the echo as produced by the bat's inner ear. Assuming multiple threshold detecting neurons for each frequency channel it is shown how the distribution of spike times within the generated spike bursts is linked to the presence and characteristics of these notches. A neural network decoding the spike bursts in terms of target {{location is}} described...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} forms of hearing loss, and {{many ways in which}} hearing loss can occur. Until {{recently}} the only commonly recognized forms of hearing loss were issues with the middle ear not functioning properly, or damage to the cilia in the inner ear. The former can be treated {{with the use of a}} hearing aid, but the latter cannot be treated. In most cases, if a person has trouble hearing, and the issue is not in the middle ear, then it is considered untreatable. However recent studies have shown that there are many more places that can be damaged and result in hearing loss. Some of those can be treated, and some still have no verified treatment yet. As sound waves hit the eardrum at the end of the outer ear, they are transferred through the middle ear to the cochlea of the inner ear. The signal is picked <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> cilia in the cochlea, which translate it into electrical signals that then travel <b>up</b> <b>the</b> vestibulocochlear <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thalamus. The signal is assessed for importance in the thalamus, and then sent along to the auditory cortex, to understand the sound. The previously common hearing issues are in the middle ear, and the start of the inner ear. However, after leaving the inner ear, the sound travels via several neural pathways to two distinct parts of the brain, each of which can be damaged in different ways, and each would present loss of hearing along with a few other symptoms. A traumatic brain injury is the most common cause for damage to these areas o...|$|R

40|$|Using {{nineteen}} human cadavers (11 males, 8 females), <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> levator ani, the coccygeus, the obturator internus, the quadratus femoris and the gemelli {{were observed}} macroscopically. The main findings obtained are summarized as the following: 1. The origin most frequently observed of both <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> levator ani and the coccygeus {{was from the}} third(S 3) and the fourth(S 4) sacral <b>nerves.</b> <b>The</b> number most frequently observed of both <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> levator ani and the coccygeus was two. 2. The frequency of the common trunk which was formed by <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> levator ani and <b>the</b> pelvic splanchnic <b>nerve</b> was 63. 6 %. 3. <b>The</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obturator internus arose from {{the confluence of the}} truncus lumbosacralis (Tr), the first (S 1) and the second (S 2) sacral nerves (40. 0 %) or S 1 -S 2 (22. 9 %). 4. <b>The</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quadratus femoris arose from Tr(37. 1 %) or the confluence of Tr-S 1 (60. 0 %). 5. The frequency of the common trunk which was formed by the originating root of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obturator internus and that of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quadratus femoris was 60. 0 %. 6. The following three types were classified according to the arising position of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obturator internus and the quadratus femoris. Type 1. Sciatic <b>nerve</b> type; <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> arises from <b>the</b> main trunk of <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> or it's originating root. Type 2. Transitional type; <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> arises from <b>the</b> point where <b>the</b> bigeminal <b>nerve</b> joins <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve.</b> Type 3. Pudendal <b>nerve</b> type; <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> arises from <b>the</b> pudendal <b>nerve</b> or it's originating root. Among these three types, the most frequent type of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obturator internus was <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> type. <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quadratus femoris was only <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> type. 7. <b>The</b> frequency at which the gemellus superior was supplied by the branch of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obturator internus was 82. 9 %. The frequency at which the gemellus inferior was supplied by the branch of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quadratus femoris was 94. 3 %. As a result of the above mentioned observations it can be assumed that the gemellus superior and the gemellus inferior are innervated separately by different <b>nerves.</b> <b>The</b> term "gemellus", which has been used <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> present time, should be considered as inappropriate. 8. Sato and Sato's hypothesis may account for the relationships between (1) the muscles of the pelvic outlet and the obturator internus, (2) <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> the levator ani and <b>the</b> pelvic splanchnic <b>nerve,</b> (3) <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obturator internus and <b>the</b> pudendal <b>nerve,</b> and (4) <b>the</b> course of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obturator internus...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} {{nerve fiber}} analysis of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plantaris muscle in ten cases. Macroscopically, <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plantaris muscle {{has a tendency}} to branch off from <b>the</b> tibial <b>nerve</b> itself independent of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (the triceps surae muscle). After removing the epineurium of <b>the</b> tibial <b>nerve,</b> it was revealed that, in all ten cases, <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plantaris muscle formed a common funicular trunk with <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> a bipennate part of the soleus. This trunk is akin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deep muscles of the calf. In addition, in five of the ten cases, <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plantaris muscle had another component, which arose from the branch to the popliteus muscle. By removing the perineurium of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> concerned, {{it became clear that the}} elements of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plantaris muscle, and of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bipennate part of the soleus, had an intimate relation (inseparable). On the other hand, the elements of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plantaris muscle and those to the popliteus were separable and they showed different routes proximally. Based on the present findings derived from nerve fiber analysis, we postulate that the plantaris muscle and bipennate part of the soleus muscle were probably derived from the deep muscle anlage of the calf in spite of their topographical closeness to the superficial muscles of the calf...|$|R

40|$|Background: The use of <b>the</b> motor <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> {{masseter}} {{has proved}} to be a reliable and sensible solution in facial reanimation as a donor for free muscle transfer. In this paper we describe the topographic anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> masseter and our original technique for its quick and safe harvesting. Methods: This anatomical study is based on the dissection of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> masseter in 17 embalmed cadaverous sites and is focused on the anatomical relations between <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> surrounding structures. Also buccal and zygomatic branches of <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve</b> were dissected and assessed and the resulting data are compared. Results: <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> masseter has a predictable track inside the muscle which can be identified topographically within a square area under the zygomatic arch. This area is different between males and females and its accuracy has been tested on six patients at the Canniesburn Unit. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> masseter emerges in a very predictable point from the mandibular notch - immediately below the zygomatic arch - to run within the muscle belly. The approach here described allows safer and faster harvesting of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> masseter with minimal dissection through the muscle.
