Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Agr, Casilla, Talca, ChileStudies in Argentina and Chile during 20102011 {{evaluated}} a new trap (Ajar) {{for monitoring}} the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck). The Ajar trap was delta-shaped with a jar {{filled with a}} terpinyl acetate plus brown sugar bait attached to the bottom centre of the trap. The screened lid of the jar was inserted inside the trap, and moths were caught on a sticky insert surrounding the lid. The Ajar trap was evaluated with and without {{the addition of a}} sex pheromone lure and compared with delta traps left unbaited or baited with a sex pheromone lure and a <b>bucket</b> <b>trap</b> filled with the same liquid bait. Studies were conducted in a sex pheromone-treated orchard in Argentina and an untreated orchard in Chile. In Chile, the Ajar trap without the sex pheromone lure caught significantly fewer males, females and total moths than the <b>bucket</b> <b>trap,</b> and fewer males and more females than the sex pheromone-baited delta trap. Total moth catch did not differ between the Ajar trap without a sex pheromone lure and the sex pheromone-baited trap. Adding a sex pheromone lure to the Ajar trap significantly increased total moth catches to levels not different from those in the <b>bucket</b> <b>trap.</b> However, the Ajar trap with the sex pheromone lure caught significantly more males and fewer females than the <b>bucket</b> <b>trap.</b> In Argentina, the Ajar trap with or without the addition of a sex pheromone lure caught similar numbers of both sexes and total moths as the <b>bucket</b> <b>trap.</b> The sex pheromone-baited delta trap caught < 4 % of the number of moths as these three <b>traps.</b> The <b>bucket</b> <b>trap</b> in both studies caught significantly more non-targets than the delta and Ajar traps.

It is not messy like the sticky trap and not cumbersome like conventional live <b>traps.</b> Placing the <b>bucket</b> against a vertical silhouette increases the number of beetles caught. Few nontarget insects are captured except for the clerid Thanasimus dubius. When the trap was baited with Frontalure, about 99 % of the beetles trapped were male.

40|$|Using <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> baited with 2 -tetradecanone, the sex {{pheromone}} of Hoplia equina LeConte, {{an important}} pest of cranberries in Massachusetts, we investigated {{the effect of}} trap height, color, pheromone load, and lure aging on male capture, as well as captures of nontarget arthropods including pollinators. Male capture was inversely related to height of traps over the four heights tested (0, 20, 60, and 100 cm). Captures increased with increasing pheromone load over the doses of 0, 100, 300, and 600 μg, but captures at the highest load, 1, 000 μg, {{were not significantly different}} from 300 or 600 μg. H. equina captures were strongly diurnal, with a flight period spanning ≈ 6 wk starting in mid-June. Vane color of traps (white, yellow, green, blue, red, black) did not affect H. equina capture but significantly influenced capture of nontargets, including pollinators. A <b>bucket</b> <b>trap</b> with the funnel opening at 20 cm, and green (or red) vanes, baited with 600 μg of 2 -tetradecanone, was the optimal design for high male capture and low nontarget capture.

Aphids were sampled using green <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> to estimate aphid landing rates, whereas leaf counts and sweep-netting were used to identify colonizing species. Of the 34 species or species groups collected with green <b>bucket</b> <b>traps,</b> 18 were previously known vectors of PVY. The most abundant vector species or species groups were Acyrthosiphon pisum, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Metopolophium dirhodum, Myzus persicae, Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion spp. The only other species that occurred in high numbers, but whose vector status is unknown, were Acyrthosiphon kondoi and Tetraneura fusiformis. Landing patterns suggest that A. kondoi, A. pisum and M. dirhodum {{may be able to}} discriminate between plant species and select their preferred host plant, if available within a habitat patch, in the pre-alighting phase, whereas other species such as R. padi seemed less selective. Results on aphid landing together with colonization of the crops evaluated suggest that maize and wheat show the highest potential as possible crop border plants in regions where aphids colonizing Poaceae, and lucerne in regions where aphids colonizing Fabaceae are abundant. Soybean appears to be less suitable because cultivars with a high trichome density, which reduces colonization by aphids, are preferentially planted in South Africa.

Two chaining treatments were applied to the study area: standard surface level chaining, and roller-ball chaining with an elevated striking height of 0. 6 m. Larvae were sampled by digging and searching uniform areas of soil t the base of redberry juniper trees, where the larvae are found. Soil was also sampled for moisture content in May 1998. Brown boards on the ground and white buckets in the air, both coated with Tanglefoot@ stickun- 4 were used to capture adult flies and monitor their activity. Brown boards capture mostly male flies, and white buckets capture female flies almost exclusively. Chaining did not significantly affect populations of larvae within one season, or have an effect on soil moisture. In plats receiving the standard chaining treatment, 65 % less flies were captured on <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> than in the controls. Roller-ball chaining did not significantly reduce the number of flies captured on <b>bucket</b> <b>traps.</b> Neither treatment reduced the number of flies captured on board traps.

In a field experiment at Yigo, plastic <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> baited with the lure of the Australian R. obscurus population in combination with ethyl acetate and cut sugarcane captured significantly more weevils than traps baited with pheromone + ethyl acetate, pheromone + sugarcane or individual lure components alone. Traps baited with various semiochemical-based lures and treated with insecticide captured significantly greater numbers of weevils than those not treated with insecticide. Traps baited with cut sugarcane caught significantly more weevils than those without sugarcane. Semiochemical-based trapping in weevil management has potential either in mass trapping or as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) programme.

In the second experiment, the height of the green cross vane had no effect on the numbers of male L. rugulipennis trapped in the funnel traps. However, the higher cross vanes captured more coccinelids and opiliones. In the A. rubi trials there were significantly more individuals in the full height cross vane compared to the half-height or no cross vane treatments. Hence, the most effective trap for A. rubi and L. rugulipennis is a green Unitrap with no bee excluder grid. We are currently testing this device for mass trapping of both pests...|$|R

Two sub‐populations were studied in regions I referred to as Site A and Site B. I located 312 burrows and captured 109 different tortoises, either by hand or using <b>bucket</b> <b>traps.</b> Tortoise density was 4. 48 /ha at Site A and only 1. 15 /ha at Site B.

Six nests were discovered {{over the course of}} the study, all located at Site A. Mean clutch size was 3. 8, much lower than other studies conducted in Florida and Georgia, but egg hatching success (87. 5 %) was comparable to other studies. Growth rates were mostly consistent with other studies for juvenile, sub‐adult and adult age classes, but were unusually high for hatchlings.

40|$|Funnel traps {{were used}} in {{conjunction}} with pit <b>traps</b> (PVC <b>buckets</b> and pipes), Elliott traps and cage traps at 10 sites in southern Western Australia to examine sampling bias of trap types. Funnel traps seldom catch small mammals but catch more of the medium-sized and large terrestrial, diurnal snakes and some of the widely foraging, medium-sized skinks, medium-sized dragon lizards and arboreal geckos that climb out of PVC pit traps. For pit <b>traps,</b> <b>buckets</b> catch more reptiles, particularly smaller ones, than pipes. However, pipes catch more mammals than <b>buckets.</b> Elliott <b>traps</b> catch the same suite of small mammals as pipes plus some of the large, trappable species, such as Rattus spp. Cage traps are useful for trapping Tiliqua spp. and medium-sized mammals such as possums and bandicoots that are unlikely to be caught in pit and funnel traps. Funnel traps, pit traps and cage traps should be used in surveys of small terrestrial vertebrates to determine species richness and relative abundance in Western Australia and probably elsewhere.

We evaluated two novel sampling methods in the field: the Sticky Resting Box (SRB) and the Resting <b>Bucket</b> <b>trap</b> (RBu) to test their efficiency for sampling malaria vectors resting outdoors and inside houses in rural Tanzania. The performance of RBu and SRB was compared outdoors, while indoors SRB were compared with the Back Pack Aspiration method (BP). Trapping was conducted within 4 villages in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania over 14 nights. On each night, the performance for collecting Anopheles vectors and Culicinae was compared in 4 households by SRB and RBu outdoors and by SRB or fixed-time Back Pack aspirator in 2 of the 4 focal households indoors. Findings A total of 619 Anopheles gambiae s. l., 224 Anopheles funestus s. l. and 1737 Culicinae mosquitoes were captured. The mean abundance of An. arabiensis and An. funestus s. l. collected with SRB traps inside and outdoors was significantly lower than with BP or RBu. The SRB however, outperformed BP aspiration for collection of Culicinae indoors. Conclusions Of the methods trialled indoors (BP and SRB), BP was the most effective, whilst outdoors RBu performed much better than SRB.

However, differences in trap captures may be confounded by trap design, trap location relative to a windbreak, and changes in local weather. The objectives of this experiment were, first, to examine differences in O. nubilalis adult (moth) captures among the Intercept wing trap, the Intercept bucket/funnel UNI trap, and the Hartstack wire-mesh, 75 -cm-diameter cone trap (large metal cone trap) as well as among three cone trap designs. Second, we examined {{the influence of the}} location of the large metal cone trap relative to a windbreak on the number of moths captured. Third, we examined the relationship between nightly mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and the number of moths captured in large metal cone traps. The number of moths captured was significantly influenced by trap design, with large metal cone traps capturing the most moths. Wing and <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> were ineffective. Differences among trap captures were significant among trap locations relative to a windbreak. Under strong (3 ̆e 14 kph) or moderate (7 3 ̆c 14 kph) wind speeds, traps located leeward of the windbreak captured the most moths, but when wind speeds were light (3 ̆c 7 kph), traps not associated with windbreaks captured the most moths.

40|$|Aerial traps, using {{combinations}} {{of color and}} attractive lures, are a critical tool for detecting and managing insect pest populations. Yet, despite improvements in trap efficacy, collection of nontarget species (“bycatch”) plagues many insect pest surveys. Bycatch can influence survey effectiveness by reducing the available space for target species and increasing trap screening time, especially in areas where thousands of insects are captured as bycatch in a given season. Additionally, bycatch may negatively impact local nontarget insect populations, including beneficial predators and pollinators. Here, we tested the effect of pheromone lures on bycatch rates of Coccinellidae (Coleoptera), Apoidea (Hymenoptera), and nontarget Lepidoptera. Multicolored (primarily yellow and white) <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> containing a pheromone lure for capturing one of three survey target species, Spodoptera litura (F.), S. littoralis (Boisduval), or Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), were placed in alfalfa and corn fields, and compared to multicolored traps without a pheromone lure. All-green traps with and without H. armigera lures were employed in a parallel study investigating the effect of lure and trap color on bycatch. Over 2, 600 Coccinellidae representing seven species, nearly 6, 400 bees in 57 species, and 3 ̆e 9, 000 nontarget moths in 17 genera were captured across 180 traps and seven temporal sampling events. Significant effects of lure and color were observed for multiple taxa. In general, nontarget insects were attracted to the H. armigera lure and multicolored trap, but further studies of trap color and pheromone lure specificity are needed to better understand these interactions and to minimize nontarget captures...|$|R

40|$|Moths in {{the genus}} Helicoverpa {{are some of}} the most {{important}} agricultural pests in the world. Two species, H. armigera (Hübner) and H. zea (Boddie), cause the majority of damage to crops and millions of dollars are spent annually on control of these pests. The recent introduction of H. armigera into the New World has prompted extensive survey efforts for this species in the United States. Surveys are conducted using <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> baited with H. armigera pheromone, and, because the same pheromone compounds attract both species, these traps often capture large numbers of the native H. zea. Adult H. armigera and H. zea are very similar and can only be separated morphologically by minor differences in the genitalia. Thus, a time consuming genitalic dissection by a trained specialist is necessary to reliably identify either species, and every specimen must be dissected. Several molecular methods are available for differentiating and identifying H. armigera and H. zea, including two recently developed rapid protocols using real-time PCR. However, none of the published methods are capable of screening specimens in large batches. Here we detail a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay that is capable of detecting a single H. armigera in a background of up to 999 H. zea. The assay has been tested using bulk extractions of 1, 000 legs from actual trap samples and is effective even when using poor quality samples. This study provides an efficient, rapid, reproducible, and scalable method for processing H. armigera survey trap samples in the U.

40|$|Methyl eugenol (4 -allyl- 1 - 2 -dimethoxybenzene-carboxylate) is a {{commonly}} occurring plant phenylpropanoid {{which is a}} highly attractive lure to the male oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). Twelve plastic <b>bucket</b> <b>traps</b> were hung {{in a row of}} Norfolk pine trees. Each trap contained either 4 ml of methyl eugenol on a cotton dental wick, 2 g methyl eugenol plastic matrix (hereafter called a “plug”), or an untreated dental wick (as a control). After 5 months and 12 days the control wick was charged with 2 ml of liquid methyl eugenol and was subsequently recharged every two weeks. Results showed that the 4 ml treated wick and the 2 gram plastic methyl eugenol plug had no significant difference in catch per trap per day for the first 2 months. Although the plug actually averaged higher catch the difference was not significant by analysis of variance with or without repeated measures. Using the repeated measures analysis, date was the most significant factor, although there was no interaction between the effects of lure and date. In the subsequent 2 months, the plastic lures continued to catch at a declining rate (mean 36. 7 ± 15. 0 % of the 4 ml lure on a cotton wick). The data suggest that the plastic lure could be used for 2 months where temperatures are not extreme. In exclusion programs maximum rate of catch is a requirement, but that is not necessary for population suppression. For the latter purpose, the 2 ml methyl eugenol plug could be used longer than two months, or the matrix could be adjusted to hold a larger volume of lure. A plug containing 5 g of methyl eugenol was able to catch flies efficiently for one year. Fly capture was more efficient in one-way entrance traps than in traps containing toxicant...|$|R
40|$|Refining 155, 000 {{barrels of}} crude oil daily, a Louisiana plant markets oil {{products}} to gas stations in at least 26 states, including Washington, D. C. The plant uses 8, 538 steam traps with 1, 200 -, 600 -, 250 -, 75 -, 40 - and 15 -psi nominal pressures. Standardized with inverted <b>bucket</b> steam <b>traps,</b> the Louisiana refinery?s maintenance and energy coordinator was content with the results. The Spirax Sarco Inc (SSI) team demonstrated SSI?s Energy Service Group (ESG) capabilities and successes to the refinery manager, operations manager and production manager. From 2004 through 2006, the team presented a series of ESG seminars at the refinery site. The numerous models demonstrated quantitative savings with 3 - to 12 -mo paybacks. For a complete SSI turnkey program, for example, the SSI team presented an ROI with {{less than six months}} payback. The ESG survey found that only 3, 952 (46. 3 %) of the steam traps were operating correctly. The remaining steam traps experienced a variety of failures, including: 613 (7. 2 %) that failed open; 2, 763 (32. 4 %) were cold; 1, 012 (11. 9 %) that failed closed; 6 (0. 0 %) exhibited rapid cycling; and 192 (2. 2 %) were disconnected. The team also found performance and temperature issues with the HP sulfur reactors in the SRU units, largely due to the application of inverted <b>bucket</b> steam <b>traps.</b> Plus, as a result of excessive steam leaks, the sulfur reactors were creating a safety hazard. When these results were presented, management agreed that the sulfur reactors needed process improvement. The SSI team recommended replacing the inverted <b>bucket</b> steam <b>traps</b> with 1 - 1 / 2 -in. strainers and 1 - 1 / 2 -in. flanged float & thermostatic steam traps. They also suggested that the existing trap discharge piping should be removed and re-piped with globe-style bypass valves and gate-style isolation valves to reduce flow velocity. Once the SSI team began negotiations, it only took one survey for the Louisiana refinery to realize all the energy savings opportunities. In fact, the ESG survey uncovered more than $ 1. 3 million in steam losses through failed steam traps and another $ 1 million in steam leak opportunities and production, process, safety and environmental improvements. Impressed with the survey results, the refinery approved the estimated $ 110, 000 turnkey project, which offered a 5. 3 -month payback. Further negotiations netted the team annual steam trap surveys for the next three years, as well as an approved 2008 energy budget of $ 600, 000. Additionally, the Louisiana refinery has indicated that upon successful completion of the ESG program, SSI?s annual energy budget will increase to $ 1, 000, 000. ...|$|R
