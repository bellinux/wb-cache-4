40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{signaling}} value of a tax when agents are less informed {{on the effect of}} their consumption than the policy-maker. When he chooses the tax, the policy-maker optimizes both the incentive effect and the effect on beliefs. We show that optimal taxes under symmetric information are not implementable under asymmetric information. The tax distortion required for credibility depends on the marginal cost of public funds and brings to <b>undertaxation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The EU {{capital market}} integrates. Portfolios become more inter{{national}}, cross border mergers are {{the order of}} the day, and never before has there been so much foreign direct investment. This links national tax systems. Residents pay foreign capital income tax, foreigners pay domestic capital income tax, and no member state can afford to overlook the danger of capital flight. What is the appropriate policy response? To do nothing? To coordinate tax systems at the European level? The data do not unequivocally support the tax-race-to-the-bottom hypothesis. On the one hand, member states decrease their statutory capital income tax rates. On the other, they broaden their capital income tax bases. Thus, fear for an economy-wide <b>undertaxation</b> of capital income -the main tenet of tax competition theory- is as yet ungrounded. Nevertheless, tax coordination may be beneficial. It resolves relative <b>undertaxation</b> of particular kinds of capital, forces convergence of capital income tax rates, and creates order in the costly European tax maze. Unfortunately, it simultaneously infringes upon the sovereignty of member states, and sidelines the disciplining force that tax competition exerts on government spending. This study assesses the most important proposals for capital income tax coordination against a background of the recent trends in capital income taxation and the trade offs between distinct policy objectives. It is a guide to the debate that is easy to read, yet firmly grounded in empirical evidence and economic theory. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{constructs}} a multi-region {{endogenous growth}} model with productive government spending to examine vertical intergovernmental relationship. Specifically, we analyze {{the contribution of}} fiscal decentralization on the optimal tax rates of national and local taxes and on the economic growth rate. In this model, when {{the behavior of the}} governments is taken into consideration, the national tax rate results in an overtaxation and the local tax rate results in an <b>undertaxation</b> compared to the optimal tax rates. In this case, promoting fiscal decentralization increases economic growth. This result is consistent with Oates' claim and with the results of recent studies about the decentralization effect on economic growth. Endogenous growth...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{challenges}} {{the view that}} tax base equalization by the so-called Representative Tax System (RTS) removes inefficient <b>undertaxation</b> in corporate tax competition. The innovation of the paper is that it focuses on a tax on corporate income, instead of the unit tax on capital considered in previous studies. We employ a tax competition model with fiscal equalization and show that the RTS fails to fully internalize pecuniary and fiscal externalities. As consequence, the RTS yields inefficiently low tax rates in the Nash equilibrium of the tax competition game between governments. Tax revenue equalization performs even worse, but combined with equalization of private income it implements the efficient tax rates on corporate income...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{commuting}} {{is introduced}} to a federal economy where benevolent lower-level (state) governments levy an ad valorem tax on labour income. This results in inefficiently low levels of taxation, even when households as a whole do not migrate. Indeed, rather than attracting more workers by lowering taxes, states are out to boost labour supplied by own residents and impede work incentives of non-residents. When the tax base is co-occupied by {{the federal and state}} governments secondly, either under- or overtaxation occurs. We find that when taxation is levied ad valorem, <b>undertaxation</b> is more liable to occur than under unit taxation. For the same underlying reasons lastly, fiscal equalisation is expected to give less cause for overtaxation as commonly assumed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} multinational firms and double taxation treaties for corporate income taxation in open economies. We show that it is optimal for a small open economy to levy positive corporate income taxes if multinational firms are taxed according to the full taxation after deduction system or the foreign tax credit system. Positive corporate taxes also occur in the asymmetric case where some countries apply the exemption system and others apply the tax credit system. If all countries apply the exemption system, the optimal corporate income tax is zero. We also show that, under tax competition, corporate income taxes are not necessarily too low {{from the perspective of}} the economy as a whole. While the <b>undertaxation</b> result is confirmed for the case of the exemption system, tax rates may also be inefficiently high if the deduction or the credit systems are applied.

40|$|This Article advocates {{fundamental}} changes in the federal income tax base by systematically challenging conventional understandings of consumption and investment. As signaled by its title, “Costly Mistakes,” this Article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{has to do with}} the disparate treatment of expenditures incurred by business owners and workers. Where the current tax law treats a business owner 2 ̆ 7 s expenditure as investment, the Article sometimes finds consumption and questions why the law should allow the expenditure to be deducted. Where the tax law treats a worker 2 ̆ 7 s expenditure as consumption, the Article sometimes finds investment and questions why the law does not allow at least a partial deduction. Through an historical analysis of the development of the modern tax law with special attention to Justice Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s 1933 U. S. Supreme Court opinion in Welch v. Helvering and a review of Welch 2 ̆ 7 s judicial and legislative progeny, the Article demonstrates that the deference the tax law traditionally has accorded business owners results in their <b>undertaxation.</b> Through an analysis of the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of workers, it further shows how its structural and substantive rules treat workers primarily as consumers, rather than as producers, and why that results in their overtaxation. The Article then investigates the economic inefficiencies produced by the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s generous treatment of business owners 2 ̆ 7 outlays and its unduly restrictive treatment of workers 2 ̆ 7 outlays. It goes on to suggest how to scrutinize and reform the tax treatment of workers and how to extend that approach to business owners with far-reaching implications. Finally, the Article relates the <b>undertaxation</b> of business owners and the overtaxation of workers to the broader social policy discussions concerning the high rate of unemployment in the private sector and the escalating deficits in the public sector. It concludes that the success of the U. S. economy in the twenty-first century requires the tax law to treat both business owners and workers as producers. It further concludes that the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s continuing failure to acknowledge that business owners and workers are both consumers and producers undermines the goals of efficiency and fairness...|$|E
40|$|Applying {{insights}} from theoretical tax competition models, {{this study of}} man-ufacturing investment and taxes in U. S. states makes four contributions to the empirical tax competition literature. First, while the existing empirical literature has assumed exogenous tax rates, the theoretical model, which endogenizes state tax rate choices, demonstrates that tax rates and investment decisions are deter-mined by {{the same set of}} jurisdiction characteristics. The endogeneity corrected estimates, which rely on instruments motivated by the theoretical model, suggest stronger responses to tax rates than the uncorrected estimates in both this pa-per and the existing literature. The second insight involves the appropriate unit of observation. The empirical literature has conducted both aggregate analyses, in which jurisdictions are the unit of observation, and discrete choice analyses, in which manufacturing plants are the unit of observation. While the tax competition model demonstrates the violation of a key assumption in discrete choice analyses, the estimating equation in this paper, an aggregate analysis, can be derived directly from the model. Third, the theoretical model sheds light on the appropriateness of previously employed measures of tax burdens. The effective tax rate is shown to be superior to the after-tax rate of return, which is both invariant across jurisdictions and dependent on the distribution of investment. Fourth, this paper provides estimates of the degree of <b>undertaxation</b> of capital, which {{has been the focus of}} the theoretical tax competition literature but has yet to be addressed empirically. These estimates suggest that the efficient revenues may be as much as two times the size of actual revenues. ∗The views presented are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of th...|$|E
40|$|The {{upcoming}} one-year {{repeal of}} the federal estate tax in the U. S. creates an opportunity to reconsider the taxation of wealth transfers. This article argues that if inheritances are included in an optimal tax framework, existing {{evidence suggests that the}} ideal wealth transfer tax would be much higher than current law, and {{take the form of a}} comprehensive inheritance tax, which includes amounts inherited above an exemption in the tax base and subjects them to higher rates. Doing so accounts for the net efficiency benefits of taxing inheritances, and the direct and indirect information they provide about the heir 2 ̆ 7 s economic status. The article then proposes seizing the political moment to replace the federal estate tax with a comprehensive inheritance tax that takes into account administrative and political constraints. This new tax would exempt from taxation roughly 2 million in lifetime gifts and bequests received. Inheritances received beyond this amount would be taxed at the heir 2 ̆ 7 s income tax rate plus 15 percentage points. The proposal would improve incentives and reduce complexity relative to the estate tax. More importantly, it would enhance the equity and transparency of the tax system. The paper 2 ̆ 7 s estimates suggest that the estate tax does a good job in aggregate of correcting for the <b>undertaxation</b> of heirs relative to those whose wealth is self-made, but that it does a poor job at an individual level. The proposal would allocate tax burdens more fairly amongst heirs. Ultimately, because its form more transparently embodies its effects, it could also reinvigorate public support for taxing inheritances at more socially-optimal levels in the first place...|$|E
