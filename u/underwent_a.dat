40|$|Using a questionnaire, we objectively {{assessed}} the body image ofdonors who underwent conventional laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (L-DN) or laparoscopic single-site donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN). Subjects were 15 patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN and 15 who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN. The questionnaire consisted ofthe Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ), including a Body Image Scale (BIS) and Cosmetic Scale (CS), and a Photo-Series Questionnaire (PSQ). A higher score indicated {{a more favorable}} assessment, and patient scores were compared. Subjects were also asked which procedure they preferred {{if they had to}} undergo donor nephrectomy again. Pain was assessed by comparing the number oftimes an analgesic was administered during hospitalization. The average BIS score was 18. 7 points (out of 20) for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN and 19. 5 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN; those who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN had a significantly higher score (p＝ 0. 03). Patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN had a median CS score of 17. 5 points (out of 24) while patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN had a median CS score of 19. 1 points; those who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN had a higher score, but the difference in average CS scores was not significant (p＝ 0. 123). The average PSQ score was 7. 1 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN and 8. 8 points for patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN; the higher score for LESS-patients was statistically significant (p＝ 0. 01). Patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> L-DN were administered an analgesic a median of 4 times during hospitalization (range : 3 - 10 times) while patients who <b>underwent</b> <b>an</b> LESS-DN were administered an analgesic a median of 2 times (range : 0 - 4 times), which was significantly less (p＝ 0. 01). Patients who <b>underwent</b> LESS-DN had <b>a</b> better body image and better cosmetic appearance than those who underwent LDN, thus indicating the usefulness of LESS-DN. However, a more prospective larger study needs to be performed...|$|R
