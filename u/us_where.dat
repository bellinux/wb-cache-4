5|$|Development of the Saturn {{began in}} 1992, {{the same year}} Sega's {{groundbreaking}} 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>where</b> it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered {{a factor in the}} console's poor performance.|$|E

The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold.

5|$|Grotrian-Steinweg's history {{dates back}} to 1835 when the first Steinweg piano factory was built by Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry Steinway after his {{emigration}} to the <b>US</b> <b>where</b> he founded Steinway & Sons). In 1856, Friedrich Grotrian became a partner; in 1865 his son Wilhelm Grotrian and two associates bought the factory {{and the right to}} market their pianos as successors to the Steinweg brand. Ensuing generations of Grotrian family members led the company {{to become one of the}} finest piano manufacturers in Germany. Grotrian-Steinweg pianos were preferred by some famous pianists, and they received accolades at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Grotrian-Steinweg operated an orchestra and a concert hall, and established sales rooms in a half dozen major cities in Germany, and by 1920, in London as well. At its peak in the late 1920s, Grotrian-Steinweg employed 1,000 people and made 3,000 pianos per year.|$|E

By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times Platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and Let Go the top-selling debut of the year. By May 2003, Let Go had accumulated over 1 million sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association. By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide, and the RIAA certified the album six-times Platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units in the US (it has sold 6.8million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan).|$|E
5|$|Since common {{starlings}} eat {{insect pests}} such as wireworms, {{they are considered}} beneficial in northern Eurasia, {{and this was one}} of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the <b>US,</b> <b>where</b> this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{horse is}} a horse breed from Canada. It is a strong, {{well-muscled}} breed of horse, usually dark in colour. The horses are generally used for riding and driving. Descended from draft and light riding horses imported to Canada {{in the late}} 1600s, it was later crossed with other British and American breeds. During the 18th century the Canadian horse spread throughout the northeastern <b>US,</b> <b>where</b> it contributed {{to the development of}} several horse breeds. During the peak popularity of the breed, three subtypes could be distinguished, a draft horse type, a trotting type and a pacing type. Thousands of horses were exported in the 19th century, many of whom were subsequently killed while acting as cavalry horses in the American Civil War. These exports decreased the purebred Canadian population {{almost to the point of}} extinction, prompting the formation of a studbook and the passage of a law against further export.|$|E
