40|$|Defining ecologically {{relevant}} <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> {{of species}} {{is important in}} the context of environmental change. The approach used in the present paper estimates the relationship between rates of <b>temperature</b> change and <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> for survival in order to evaluate the maximum long-term survival temperature (Ts). This new approach integrates both the exposure time and the exposure temperature in the evaluation of <b>temperature</b> <b>limits.</b> Using data previously published for different temperate and Antarctic marine environments, we calculated Ts in each environment, which allowed us to calculate a new index: the Warming Allowance (WA). This index is defined as the maximum environmental temperature increase which an ectotherm in a given environment can tolerate, possibly with a decrease in performance but without endangering survival over seasonal or lifetime time-scales. It is calculated as the difference between maximum long-term survival temperature (Ts) and mean maximum habitat temperature. It provides a measure of how close a species, assemblage or fauna are living to their <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> for long-term survival and hence their vulnerability to environmental warming. In contrast to data for terrestrial environments showing that warming tolerance increases with latitude, results here for marine environments show a less clear pattern as the smallest WA value was for the Peru upwelling system.

40|$|Animal physiology, {{ecology and}} {{evolution}} {{are affected by}} temperature and {{it is expected that}} community structure will be strongly influenced by global warming. This is particularly relevant in the tropics, where organisms are already living close to their <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> and hence are highly vulnerable to rising temperature. Here we present data on <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> of 34 tropical marine ectotherm species from seven phyla living in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Short term thermal tolerances and vertical distributions were correlated, i. e., upper shore animals have higher thermal tolerance than lower shore and subtidal animals; however, animals, despite their respective tidal height, were susceptible to the same temperature in the long term. When temperatures were raised by 1 °C hour− 1, the <b>upper</b> lethal <b>temperature</b> range of intertidal ectotherms was 41 – 52 °C, but this range was narrower and reduced to 37 – 41 °C in subtidal animals. The rate of temperature change, however, affected intertidal and subtidal animals differently. In chronic heating experiments when temperature was raised weekly or monthly instead of every hour, <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> of subtidal species decreased from 40 °C to 35. 4 °C, while the decrease was more than 10 °C in high shore organisms. Hence in the long term, activity and survival of tropical marine organisms could be compromised just 2 – 3 °C above present seawater temperatures. Differences between animals from environments that experience different levels of temperature variability suggest that the physiological mechanisms underlying thermal sensitivity may vary at different rates of warming. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} self assembly and automatic oscillation of intelligent poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) [PNIPAM] microgel particles. The equilibrium phase diagram {{as a function}} of temperature and concentration was constructed for the charged PNIPAM spheres. The PNIPAM microgel particles display rhythmic size oscillations when covalently coupled to a nonlinear chemical reaction, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. The nonequilibrium dynamics of PNIPAM microgels in the presence of BZ reaction was studied by the systematic variation of substrate concentrations and temperature. In addition, the BZ chemical reaction was modeled to reveal the existence of <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> for nonlinear chemical systems. The experiments employ environment sensitive PNIPAM particles that are sensitive to temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The PNIPAM particles have been demonstrated here to behave as hard spheres at low pH values and soft spheres at high pH. This is done by measuring the freezing and melting boundary of fluid-crystal coexistence region with a new technique which is simpler and quicker compared to the traditional sedimentation method. A novel method was developed to achieve size uniformity of PNIPAM gel particles with covalently-bound tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) via the coordination chemistry between a ruthenium complex and the monodispersed PNIPAM gel particles bearing bipyridine ligands. The correlation between the dynamic behavior of BZ reaction induced mechanical oscillations of PNIPAM particles and substrate concentrations was presented in a ternary phase diagram. In particular, the dependence of oscillation frequency and induction time on the substrate concentrations was studied. The temperature dependency of the induction time and oscillatory frequency of the BZ reaction in this polymerimmobilized catalyst system were compared to the bulk BZ reaction with the catalyst in the solution phase. Prolonged induction times were observed for the immobilized catalyst, compared with free catalyst, while little difference was observed on the oscillation frequency. A theoretical improvement has been achieved by incorporating the temperature dependence in the BZ Oregonator model. Bifurcation has been calculated in the phase space spanned by initial reagents concentration ratio, stoichiometric factor and temperature. The existence of <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> has been demonstrated...|$|R

The effects of rising temperature and pollution on the unique endemic littoral amphipod fauna of Lake Baikal are unresolved yet. This thesis provides insights into physiological processes determining thermal tolerance and cadmium (Cd) susceptibility in two littoral amphipod species (Eulimnogammarus verrucosus and Eulimnogammarus cyaneus) compared to the related gammarid Gammarus lacustris, which is ubiquitously spread in the Holarctic.
