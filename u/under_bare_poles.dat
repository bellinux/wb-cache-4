Also {{embarked}} on the Duquesne were an almost {{equal number of}} French prisoners, {{which had to be}} closely watched during the passage, in case they made an attempt to take the ship. Duquesne arrived in England without incident, and Walker paid her off for repairs. He then received command of the 36-gun HMS Thalia on 1 March 1805 and escorted convoys to the East Indies and Quebec. The voyage to the East Indies was made with two ships laden with treasure was made safely and quickly, with Walker arriving back at Spithead ten months to the day of his departure. The voyage to Quebec was made in company with two frigates, which delivered the convoy, but were delayed in port by gales until 1 December 1806. After setting sail Thalia became caught in a gale off the Newfoundland Banks and ran for 1250 miles for five days <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles.</b> After returning to Spithead Walker was assigned to the Guernsey station under Sir Edmund Nagle, where he was given command of a squadron of three frigates and a brig to watch the enemy at St Malo.|$|E

60|$|Very true; {{and that}} thought very early {{occurred}} to me; for no idea had I of scudding round Cape Horn in my shirt; for {{that would have}} been almost scudding <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles,</b> indeed.|$|E
60|$|Every {{moment the}} gale increased, obliging the mariners to show but {{a corner of}} the sail. Even this had at last to be taken in, and, during the whole of that dismal day and of the black night which followed, the Penelope drove helplessly before the wind <b>under</b> a <b>bare</b> <b>pole.</b> Fortunately the gale was favourable, so that they were enabled to lay their course, but it {{required}} all the skill and seamanship of Captain Arkal to prevent their being pooped and swamped by the waves that rolled hissing after them as if hungering mightily to swallow them up.|$|R
60|$|The storm {{came from}} the Sunda Straits about which the captain and his son had just been talking, and was so violent {{that they could do}} nothing but scud before it <b>under</b> almost <b>bare</b> <b>poles.</b> All that night it raged. Towards morning it {{increased}} to such a pitch that one of the backstays of the foremast gave way. The result was that the additional strain thus thrown on the other stays was too much for them. They also parted, and the foretop-mast, snapping short off with a report like a cannon-shot, went over the side, carrying the main-topgallant-mast and all its gear along with it.|$|R
60|$|The Frenchman {{followed}} {{the direction of}} her eyes and saw a tall, <b>bare</b> <b>pole</b> at {{the summit of the}} hillock. At the same moment the sun came over the hilltops in a deep, orange glow, and a new light stole like magic over the brown landscape. And, as if they had timed their arrival to that exact moment of sunburst, three brown-faced boys appeared <b>under</b> the straight, <b>bare</b> <b>pole.</b> A cord shivered and flapped, and something ran swiftly up into the air, and swung out in the breeze that blew across the hills--a blue flag with red and white crosses. The three boys bared their heads and the small girl on the verandah steps stood rigidly to attention. Far away down the hill, a young man, cantering into view round a corner of the dusty road, removed his hat in loyal salutation.|$|R

60|$|All {{this the}} good ship Roving Bess did with credit {{to herself and}} comfort to her crew; but {{a few weeks after}} she entered the Pacific, she was met, {{contrary}} to all expectation, by the bitterest gale that had ever compelled her to scud <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|E
60|$|Upon {{the deck}} of the unsuspecting vessel a merry party laughed and chatted in happy ignorance of the {{plotters}} in their path.

40|$|Relationships between partial-wave {{amplitude}} parametrizations, {{in particular}} the Chew-Mandelstam approach, and dynamical coupled-channel models are established and investigated. A <b>bare</b> <b>pole</b> corresponding to the Delta(1232) resonance, found in a recent dynamical-model fit to pion- and omega-meson production reactions, compares closely to one found in a unitary multichannel partial-wave amplitude parametrization of SAID. The model dependence of the <b>bare</b> <b>pole</b> precludes a direct connection between the approaches but is suggestive that the dynamical description and the phenomenological parametrization are closely related.

60|$|Although the Red Eric {{was thrown}} on her beam-ends, or nearly so, by the {{excessive}} {{violence of the}} squall, the preparations to meet {{it had been so}} well made that she righted again almost immediately, and now flew before the wind <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles</b> with a velocity that was absolutely terrific.|$|E
60|$|He {{ordered the}} captain {{to cut the}} halyard by which the cook's body was towing, and also to go forward and cut loose the jib-halyard and sheet. When he had done so, the jib fluttered a couple of moments like a handkerchief, then tore out of the bolt-ropes and vanished. The Sophie Sutherland was running <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} Captain, rising, [...] "we'll let match-makin' {{alone for the}} present. It's like tryin' to beat to wind'ard against a cyclone. The best way is to square the yards, furl the sails, and scud <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles</b> till it's over.

60|$|Yet at {{daylight}} {{this morning}} we were still wallowing in the same dead calm and sickly swell. Miss West says the barometer is down, but that the warning has been too long, for the Plate, to amount to anything.

60|$|This {{was soon}} done and, <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles,</b> the storm jib {{now the only}} sail upon her, the Paramatta tore through the water. There was little motion, for the sea had not begun to get up, seeming to be pressed flat {{by the force of}} the wind. The captain now left the helm. Two or three of the male {{passengers}} were standing {{at the top of the}} companion, peering out.|$|E
6000|$|I exulted in {{the beauty}} of the scene, and augured a prosperous voyage; but the veteran master of the ship shook his head, and {{pronounced}} this halcyon calm a [...] "weather-breeder." [...] And so it proved. A storm burst forth in the night; the sea roared and raged; and when the day broke, I beheld the late gallant convoy scattered in every direction; some dismasted, others scudding <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles,</b> and many firing signals of distress.|$|E

60|$|She cruised {{about for}} some {{days in the}} hope of falling in with it. Then her course was altered, and she was steered once more for Ratinga. But the {{elements}} seemed to league with Ebony in this matter, for, ere she sighted the island, there burst upon her one of those tremendous hurricanes with which the southern seas are at times disturbed.

But the captain's voice was drowned by the {{whistling}} winds, and, seeing that the men were uncertain what to do, he seized one of the axes which were lashed {{to the foot of}} the mast, and began to cut away the ropes which dragged the wreck of the foremast under the lee of the ship. Williams, the mate, and the second mate, followed his example, while Ned sprang to the wheel to see the orders to the steersmen obeyed.

60|$|It was noon, {{and there}} was no {{abatement}} in the tempest, no change in the current, no means of returning, no chance of stopping; away we were driven, like events ruled by fate.

Perhaps the power of the gale had, in a small degree, abated, by two o'clock, {{and it would have been}} possible to carry some short sail; but there being no sea to injure us, it was unnecessary, and the ship continued to drive ahead, <b>under</b> <b>bare</b> <b>poles.</b> Night was the time to dread.|$|E

But the fir-wood behind the little house was forever green and staunch; and even in November and December there came gracious days of sunshine and purple hazes, when the harbor danced and sparkled as blithely as in midsummer, and the gulf was so softly blue and tender that the storm and the wild wind seemed only things of a long-past dream.|$|E
60|$|Billy Towler did try it. Many a London lamp-post had he shinned {{up in his}} day. The {{difference}} did {{not seem}} to him very great. The ball, he observed, was made of light bands or lathes arranged somewhat in the form of lattice-work. It was full six feet in diameter, and had an opening in the under part by which a man could enter it. Through the lozenge-shaped openings he could see two enormous ravens perched on the top.
