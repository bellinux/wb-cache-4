40|$|Consider the {{nonlinear}} matrix equation X-sum_{i= 1 }^{m}A_{i}^{*}X^{- 1 }A_{i}=Q. This paper {{shows that}} there exists a unique positive definite solution to the equation without any restriction on A_{i}. Three perturbation bounds for the <b>unique</b> solution <b>to</b> the equation are evaluated. A backward error of an approximate solution for the <b>unique</b> solution <b>to</b> the equation is derived. Explicit expressions of the condition number for the <b>unique</b> solution <b>to</b> the equation are obtained. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.

5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%).

Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E
