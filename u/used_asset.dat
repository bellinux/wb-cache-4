50|$|If {{enterprise}} A sells a <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> to enterprise B, the valuation errors {{caused by}} the way that A and B each report this transaction will cancel out only if an overstatement of A’s reported GFCF is exactly matched by the understatement in B’s reported GFCF. But if assets migrate from one industry to another, or are imported and exported, or (in the case of means of transport) switch between different uses, the errors will persist. It may appear as though the total fixed capital stock has grown, even although the “net addition to fixed assets” refers only to the change in ownership of an already existing asset.|$|E

Building on the bias–variance tradeoff framework, the paper proposes a Model Portfolio Approach (MPA) and a Global Minimum Variance(GMV) weighting scheme to mitigate asset pricing model uncertainty. Using a well-conditioned pricing covariance estimator, the proposed approach improves out-of-sample pricing performance over six widely <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> pricing models, a model selection method and {{two most popular}} benchmarks in existing model combination studies, that is, the simple arithmetic average (“ 1 /N”) and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) weighting methods...|$|E

For several widely <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> pricing models, we demonstrate that these restrictions imply testable forms of intertemporal dependence in macroeconomic fundamentals such as consumption growth rate. Extensive empirical analysis provides supporting evidence that the momentum and contrarian profits manifest the short-term continuation and the longterm reversal in the macroeconomic fundamentals. Intuitively, the dynamics of the macroeconomic fundamentals induces a common return persistence for individual stocks. When coupled with the selection of past winners and losers, the return persistence generates the momentum and contrarian profits...|$|E

The traditionally <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> pricing methods, {{based on the}} no arbitrage principle, are extended {{to take into account}} electricity specific features: the non storability of electricity and the variability in the load process. The sources of uncertainty include electricity forward curve, prices of resources used to generate electricity, {{and the size of the}} future production. Also the effects of competitors ’ actions are considered. The thesis illustrates how the information in the derivative prices can be used in investment and production planning. In addition, the use of derivatives as a tool to stabilize electricity dependent cash flows is considered.

S., unlike most advanced countries, does not account for capital in its formal budget documents. We estimate depreciation of government capital using a methodology developed by Hulten and Wykoff which is based on <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> price data. We estimate a federal government net nonresidential capital stock of over $ 800 billion in 1984, more than 20 % higher than estimated by the BEA. We also find much larger net federal investment since World War II than the BEA. The behavior of military and civilian structures and equipment is also examined. We analyze the potential importance of these results for measuring the net national savings rate, national wealth, the trend in government {{capital formation}} relative to private capital formation, and the relationship between net investment and deficits. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the theory of}} optimal {{replacement}} investment decisions is employed to interpret the problem of depreciation accounting and market valuation. An asset should be replaced when its net contribution to present worth from an additional (marginal) year of service no longer exceeds its external market value. Three concepts of depreciation are contained or involved in this investment decision rule: market value, capital recovery, and net contribution to present worth. Market value and capital recovery are commonly suggested "methods" of depreciation. Net contribution to present worth declines with asset age, and represents a concept of depreciation that generally may not coincide with market valuation in exchange. The existence of a market for a <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> is interpreted in terms of multiple uses (and marginal internal values) for an asset. Through exchange the asset is downgraded from one use to another until it is junked. ...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{ordinary}} {{least square}} (OLS) regression methods {{are used to}} test asset pricing models. This study focuses {{on the use of}} quantile regression as an alternative approach to the analysis of risk and return distributions in quantitative finance. It empirically examines the behaviour of two widely <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> pricing factors, beta and book to market ratios, but the focus is on minimising absolute deviations around the median rather than minimising squared deviations around the mean of their distributions, as we apply quantile regressions as opposed to OLS. We show how OLS is less able to capture the extreme values or the adverse losses in the return distribution, which on the other hand are captured by quantile regressions. The study not only shows that the factors do not necessarily follow a linear relationship but also shows that the traditional use of OLS becomes less effective when it comes to analysing the extremes within a distribution, which are often a source of keen interest for investors and risk managers...|$|E
40|$|The Black-Litterman (BL) {{model is}} a widely <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> {{allocation}} model in the financial industry. In this paper, we provide a new perspective. The key insight is to replace the statistical framework in the original approach with ideas from inverse optimization. This insight allows us to significantly expand the scope and applicability of the BL model. We provide a richer formulation that, unlike the original model, is flexible enough to incorporate investor information on volatility and market dynamics. Equally importantly, our approach allows us {{to move beyond the}} traditional mean-variance paradigm of the original model and construct “BL”-type estimators for more general notions of risk such as coherent risk measures. Computationally, we introduce and study two new “BL”-type estimators and their corresponding portfolios: a mean variance inverse optimization (MV-IO) portfolio and a robust mean variance inverse optimization (RMV-IO) portfolio. These two approaches are motivated by ideas from arbitrage pricing theory and volatility uncertainty. Using numerical simulation and historical backtesting, we show that both methods often demonstrate a better risk-reward trade-off than their B...|$|E
40|$|The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is {{the most}} widely <b>used</b> <b>asset</b> pricing model that {{measures}} the risk-return relationship. The CAPM is based on Markowitz?s Mean-Variance Analysis. The advancement of Islamic finance leads to the question {{whether or not the}} practice of modern investment theories and analyses like the Markowitz?s Mean Variance Analysis and CAPM are in accordance to shariah and could be used in pricing Islamic financial assets. Therefore, this paper presents a review of the CAPM and to discourse the set of assumptions underlying the model in terms of shariah compliance. Although most of the assumptions are not contradictory to shariah principles, there are Islamic variables such as the prohibition of short selling, purification and zakat that should be taken into consideration when pricing Islamic financial assets. We then develop a mathematical model which is a modification of the traditional CAPM that incorporates principles of Islamic finance and integrating zakat, purification of return and exclusion of short sales. At the end, as a proof-of-concept, this paper presents the results of an empirical study on the proposed shariah-compliant CAPM in comparison to the traditional CAPM...|$|E
