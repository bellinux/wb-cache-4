40|$|This study {{examined}} gender stereotypes for leaders <b>using</b> <b>a</b> more indirect method than is typical in stereotype research. Rather than reveal the leader 2 ̆ 7 s gender, {{this study used}} vignettes in which the leader 2 ̆ 7 s gender was unknown. Consistent with their hypothesis, the authors found that participants {{were more likely to}} infer a male (female) gender identity than a female (male) gender identity when presented with <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> masculine (feminine) style. They also hypothesized that <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-consistent leadership style would be viewed more positively than <b>a</b> leader <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent style. Contrary to this hypothesis, results revealed that men <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent (feminine) style were actually evaluated more positively than men <b>using</b> <b>a</b> gender-consistent style. It is interesting that a perceived female leader who <b>used</b> <b>a</b> gender-inconsistent (masculine) style was evaluated more positively than a perceived male leader who <b>used</b> <b>a</b> masculine style, but only by female participants. Possible explanations for these results are discussed...|$|R
