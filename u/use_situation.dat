Anong language {{is closely related}} to the Derung and Rawang languages. Most of the Anong people in China have shifted to Lisu. In Myanmar, Anong {{is considered one of the}} clans of the Lisu family. in 2014, the whole Myanmar census, the Government did official catalogue all the majorities and minorities groups. In that census Naw people were identified as one of the ethnic people in Kachin group. Currently, the number of Anong speakers are increasing. In Myitkyina town and Putao town, there are literacy and language trainings in every year. About the Anong population, Naw is still mixed with the Lisu population. The majority of Anong speakers in Myanmar are mainly found in Kachin State; Myitkyina township, Putao township, Naungmun township, Machanbaw township, Tannai township, and Khaunglangphu township. Some naw people live in Shan State but it is not clear whether they still use anong or not. There are also many living in different cities such as Yangon, Khanti, and Taunggy etc. The language <b>use</b> <b>situation</b> is still low. Therefore, Anong language is an endangered language.

40|$|The design {{research}} community acknowledges that usability and user experience are largely influenced by user characteristics, goals and contexts of use. For industrially manufactured products, these <b>use</b> <b>situations</b> are often dynamic and diverse. However, little guidance {{can be found}} in literature on the incorporation of dynamic and diverse <b>use</b> <b>situations</b> (DDUS) into the design process. This paper explores this issue by means of an analysis of user centred design literature and an empirical study of design for DDUS in design practice. We retrospectively studied three projects in which a product with DDUS was designed. Based on this study, we identified different effective strategies executed by design practitioners to analyse DDUS. We also observed difficulties in designing for DDUS. These difficulties include the identification of relevant aspects within this broad spectrum of <b>use</b> <b>situations</b> and sharing knowledge of product use between team members. We conclude {{that there is a need}} for guidance in the creation of flexible frames of reference of product use that evolve with solutions in the design process, particularly for design projects that cannot rely on the reuse of such a frame of reference from similar previous projects...|$|R

This increase of the ‘dynamics ’ of use situations is caused by technological developments. The ongoing trend of automation of services results in {{an increasing number of}} products that are used by a wide variety of people such as ATM’s, copiers and museum audio guides. Furthermore the growing opportunities of wireless applications result in an increasing number of mobile products that therefore can be used in different kinds of environments. A static environment can be dynamic as well when objects and persons within it are subject to change. In order to support the needs of each individual user in each individual context of use a designer should attune products to this dynamic <b>use</b> <b>situation,</b> thereby achieving a high level of usability. This paper discusses the criteria a design method for dynamic use situations should meet. Usability Challenge for Dynamic Use Situations Dynamic use situations are defined as use situations of products with varying user characteristics, varying purposes and varying contexts of use (figure 1). Characteristics of users include skills, knowledge and experiences. The context of use comprises the physical environment as well as objects and persons within this environment.

In this model, a situation is set of entities linked by relationships themselves determinedusing sensors. However, such model doesn’t allow to manage uncertainty. In order to take into account an uncertainty relatedto the identification of some entities, we propose to model the set of possible eligible entities, called the universe of discourse,by an anonymous instance in the ontology. This anonymous instance is linked with a “same as” relationships with all possibleeligible entities. In addition, we propose to complete this model by the association of a mass with each “same as” relationship. This paper presents a probabilistic semantic to these masses.
