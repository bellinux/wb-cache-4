5000|$|The {{hitherto}} known plant {{diversity of}} Val Rosandra {{can be summed}} <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few numbers: more than 1,000 fungi, 988 vascular plants, approx. 300 lichens, about 150 bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), and about 100 species of Myxomicetes, {{for a total of}} approximately 2,700 infrageneric taxa. There is a lack of reliable data on cyanobacteria, algae and microfungi, with which the total number of taxa would be much higher. The Val Rosandra reflects the history of the vegetation of the karst, but it has many original features. The geomorphology makes it a [...] "unicum" [...] in the Trieste Karst: agriculture was and is limited to small areas of Flysch such as near Botazzo, grazing is today almost completely abandoned and even in the past it was made difficult by the steep and stony slopes. The valley still retains aspects of the prehistoric vegetation of the karst, especially on rocks and scree slopes. The landscape is {{different from that of the}} rest of the Trieste Karst. The climbers who use the rock walls as a school have wrongly compared it to an [...] "alpine" [...] landscape, whereas it rather recalls the great valleys of Dinaric Dalmatia, with the major forms of erosion and the alternation of shrubs and almost bare surfaces; also the geologic structures are similar, with fissured limestone, scree, etc., the species are often the same and grow in similar associations. Thus, certain sections of M. Carso are extraordinarily reminiscent of the hinterland of Rijeka in Croazia.In Val Rosandra the relationships between vegetation and physical factors are clearer than in the Alps, where the complicated orography and the presence of many types of rocks create a complex pattern of ecosystems. In Val Rosandra the landscape can be read easily, because of the modest development of the reliefs and presence of only two dominant types of substrate: limestone and Flysch. The areas with Flysch have an almost [...] "Apenninic", landscape, while those with limestone give rise to a [...] "Balkan" [...] landscape.|$|E

25|$|When {{the team}} flew to Adelaide they were {{met at the}} airport by Test Selector Sir Donald Bradman, who had got up at 4 {{o'clock in the morning}} to meet their {{overnight}} flight, and Bill Jeanes, the secretary of the South Australian Cricket Association who happily arranged social introductions, golf and other entertainments during their stay. South Australia were stronger than Western Australia, but rarely won the Sheffield Shield and fielded no Test players, though batsman Graeme Hole and wicket-keeper Gil Langley would later play for Australia. Len Hutton had by now recovered from his finger damaged in Colombo and was reunited with his old opening partner Cyril Washbrook. Washbrook had been an original choice for the team who had declined to tour before changing his mind and being flown out to join the party. Brown won the toss again and this time put the opposition in at the Adelaide Oval on what was by tradition a flat, lifeless wicket so that he could fully test his bowlers. Allen MacLean was out for 2, {{but the rest of the}} team batted solidly and Ron Hamence making 114 as Doug Wright (4/103) worked his way expensively through the batting and Brown took 3/55 in the absence of Alec Bedser. Bob Berry was put on and took 0/33 off 12 overs, which made Brown doubt his ability, leading him to be underused for the rest of the tour. When it was their return to bat the MCC bettered the home score by one run before Brown declared on 351/9 with nearly all the runs coming from Hutton (126) and Reg Simpson (119) adding 170 for the second wicket, Godfrey Evans reaching 38 and nobody else making 20. The game looked doom to a draw, but the South Australia captain Ridings declared on 185/3 after Dansie had made 64 to give the MCC a sporting chance of making 185 runs in 135 minutes. Hutton was out driving for 1, but Washbrook (63) and Simpson (69) rattled <b>up</b> 131 <b>in</b> <b>just</b> over <b>an</b> hour before Evans hit six successive balls to the boundary to give his team an undeserved 7 wicket win.|$|R
