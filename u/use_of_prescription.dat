40|$|Background: Foot orthoses are {{commonly}} used for symptomatic flexible pes planus in adults. However, there are no clinical guidelines for the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> customised foot orthoses that are specific to this population. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>prescription</b> habits <b>of</b> Australian podiatrists for customised foot orthoses for symptomatic flexible pes planus in adults and to develop consensus-based practice recommendations for the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> these foot orthoses. Methods: A four round Delphi survey was undertaken with 24 podiatric experts to establish current use and rationale for individual <b>prescription</b> variables <b>of</b> customised foot orthoses for symptomatic flexible pes planus in adults. Round one determined prescription use (consensus) and rounds two, three and four determined the rationale for <b>use</b> (agreement) <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> variables across the rearfoot, midfoot, forefoot, as well as accommodation and materials used. For consensus and agreement to be accepted, 70 % of the respondents were required to use or agree on the rationale for <b>use</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>prescription</b> variables. Results: Consensus was reached in round one for two variables, choice of shell material (polyolefin) and when to prescribe a forefoot post balanced to perpendicular. In rounds two, three and four, agreement was reached for 52 statements related to the rationale for <b>use</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>prescription</b> variables, including when to prescribe: an inverted cast pour [heel in an inverted position], an inverted rearfoot post, a medial heel (Kirby) skive, minimal/maximum arch fill, a medial flange, a forefoot post and common orthotic accommodations. Conclusion: This study found consensus or agreement for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> several <b>prescription</b> variables for customised foot orthoses for symptomatic flexible pes planus in adults. The findings were used to develop the Foot orthosis Prescription Recommendations for symptOmatic flexible Pes planus in adults (FootPROP) proforma, to guide clinicians and researchers in the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> customised foot orthoses for this population.

[...] Paulozzi also testified that all available evidence suggests that unintentional overdose deaths {{are related to the}} increasing <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs, especially opioid painkillers. However, the vast majority of overdoses are also attributable to alcohol. It is very rare for a victim of an overdose to have consumed just one drug.

The CCLE, as well as other cognitive liberty advocacy groups such as , have lobbied for the re-examination and reform of prohibited drug law; one of the CCLE's key guiding principles is that: [...] "governments should not criminally prohibit cognitive enhancement or the experience of any mental state". Calls for reform of restrictions on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> cognitive-enhancement drugs (also called smart drugs or nootropics) such as Prozac, Ritalin and Adderall have also been made on the grounds of cognitive liberty.|$|E

40|$|The nonmedical <b>use</b> {{and abuse}} <b>of</b> <b>{{prescription}}</b> drugs {{is a serious}} public health problem in this country. Although most people take prescription medications responsibly, an estimated 52 million people (20 percent of those aged 12 and older) have used prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons {{at least once in}} their lifetimes. Young people are strongly represented in this group. In fact, the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA) Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey found that about 1 in 12 high school seniors reported past-year nonmedical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prescription</b> pain reliever Vicodin in 2010, and 1 in 20 reported abusing OxyContin—making these medications among the most commonly abused drugs by adolescents. The abuse <b>of</b> certain <b>prescription</b> drugs— opioids, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and stimulants—can lead to a variety of adverse health effects, including addiction. Among those who reported past-year nonmedical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>prescription</b> drug, nearly 14 percent met criteria for abuse of or dependence on it. The reasons for the high prevalence <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drug abuse vary by age, gender, and other factors, but likely include greater availability. The number <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> for some <b>of</b> these medications has increased dramatically since the early 1990 s. Moreover, a consumer culture amenable to "taking a pill for what ails you" and the perception <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs as less harmful than illicit drugs are other likely contributors to the problem. It is an urgent one: unintentional overdose deaths involving opioid pain relievers have quadrupled since 1999, and by 2007, outnumbered those involving heroin and cocaine. NIDA hopes to change this situation by increasing awareness and promoting additional research on prescription drug abuse. Prescription drug abuse is not a new problem, but one that deserves renewed attention. It is imperative that as a Nation we make ourselves aware of the consequences associated with abuse of these medications...|$|R

Methods. A sample of patients between the age of 8 and 18 undergoing treatments with fixed orthodontic apparatus at the Dental University Clinic - Orthodontic Section, UoB, answered a questionnaire regarding <b>use</b> <b>of</b> analgesic drugs during treatment.
