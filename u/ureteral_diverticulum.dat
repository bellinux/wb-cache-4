40|$|A 12 -year-old {{boy with}} a history of {{recurrent}} fever and general fatigue was referred to our clinic from a local physician for a urologic investigation of bilateral hydronephrosis. Retrograde pyelography revealed the presence of a diverticulum in the right lower ureter and left ureteral stricture. Diverticulectomy and right ureterovesiconeostomy were performed. Microscopically the specimen showed the same structure of the original ureter, therefore we diagnosed it a true <b>ureteral</b> <b>diverticulum.</b> Ureteral diverticula are extremely rare and statistically only 35 cases including our case were collected from the Japanese literature. Its etiologic considerations were discussed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} on a case of blind-ending ureter. The patient was a 56 -year-old female who had complained of {{a pain in the}} left flank. There was no urinary tract infection. Excretory {{urography}} revealed a left blind-ending bifid ureter. It was resected and the removed specimen was about 8 cm in length. Histologically, it had all layers of the ureteral structure, but no renal tissue was found. The post-operative course was uneventful. We collected 55 cases of blind-ending bifid ureters reported in Japan including our own and discussed the difference between blind-ending bifid ureter and <b>ureteral</b> <b>diverticulum...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{total number}} of inpatients was 1, 309. There were 1020 males and 289 females, the male to female ratio being 3. 5 : 1. The major {{diseases}} seen in inpatients were benign prostatic hypertrophy, bladder tumor, prostatic carcinoma, <b>ureteral</b> stone, urethral <b>diverticulum,</b> bladder neck contracture, inguinal hernia and renal tumor. The {{total number of}} patients operated on was 1, 211; 953 males and 258 females. These operations were performed at 11 hospitals using a semi-open system. Major operations were transurethral resections of prostatic and bladder tumor, subcapsular prostatectomy, castration, urethral diverticulectomy, nephrectomy, inguinal hernioplasty, ureterolithotomy, radical cystectomy and transurethral ureterolithotripsy. New operation methods were radical prostatectomy by Walsh's method, Kock pouch, penis prosthesis implantation, transurethral incision of bladder diverticular orifice, Gil-Vernet method for VUR and Stamey's method for stress incontinence. Major small operations and examinations for outpatients were transperineal prostatic needle biopsies, transurethral urethral and bladder mucosal biopsies, phimotomy, transurethral intravesical surgery and percutaneous renal cyst puncture...|$|R
25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13â€“21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, <b>ureteral</b> or bladder <b>diverticulum,</b> benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be {{the presence of a}} pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.|$|R
