40|$|Recent {{events in}} the {{business}} world have focused attention on the importance of high quality financial reporting. Of particular interest is where the collapse of prominent companies such as Baring Plc. was due to the company's involvement with derivative instruments. In Australia, some derivative instruments are not recognised in the balance sheet. However, the Australian accounting standard AASB 1033 Presentation and Disclosure of Financial Instruments requires extensive disclosures to overcome the lack of guidance with regard to the recognition and measurement. Therefore, AASB 1033 may be regarded as a high quality disclosure standard. This thesis investigates the transparency or information quality of derivative disclosures of Australian firms in the extractive industries using 1998 to 2001 financial reports. The extractive industries {{play a major role in}} the Australian economy, where they generated exports worth more than A$ 30 billion in 2000 to 2002 (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2003 a and 2003 b). Further, firms in the extractive industries extensively use derivative instruments for hedging purposes (Berkman, Bradbury, Hancock and Innes, 1997). The objective of this study is, first, to examine the relationship between the transparency or disclosure quality of derivative information and firm characteristics. Second, this study investigates the value relevance of derivative disclosures in particularly hedge information, net fair value information and risk information. Quality is measured based on a disclosure index developed from AASB 1033 Presentation and Disclosure of Financial Instruments. A finding of concern is that the majority of firms in this study provide less than complete information and therefore enforcement power is required to ensure compliance (Kothari, 2000) Prior studies have related disclosure quality of accounting information with firm characteristics but no attempt has been made to relate those characteristics with the disclosure quality of derivative instruments. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the relationship between firm characteristics and the quality of derivative disclosures. Firm characteristics investigated are size, profitability, price-earnings ratio, market-to-book ratio, research and development activity, auditor, debt-to-equity ratio and type of extractive firm. This study finds that the variables, firm size, price-earnings and debt-to-equity ratios are associated with the disclosure quality of derivative information. To a lesser extent, the variables, market-to-book ratio and profitability, are also associated with disclosure quality. High disclosure quality has been argued to lead to a reduction in the cost of debt (Sengupta, 1998) and equity (Botosan, 1997), resulting in higher security prices (Miller and Bahnson, 2002). The results of this study indicate that high quality derivative information, as represented by the disclosure index, is value relevant. Market participants do consider hedge information and risk information components as important for decision-making. However, examining the specific information disclosed in the financial statements indicate that some of the disclosed information such as the <b>unrealised</b> <b>gain</b> or loss on financial assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments are not significant. These results contribute to the value relevance literature as this study focuses on the extractive industries which have been neglected in the literature. This study provides important information for standard setters and regulators for future directions in developing accounting standards and is particularly relevant for the impending adoption of International Accounting Standards...|$|E

This has the potential to increase leverage and risk for these firms, thereby also possibly amplifying economic cycles. A study by Goncharov and Van Triest (2011 : 59) on Russian firms found that FVA adjustments are persistent in future earnings; however, no empirical evidence was found to support an increase in dividends in response to <b>unrealised</b> FVA <b>gains.</b> By contrast, when the setting is limited to South African banks only, De Jager (2015 : 157) found that South African banks have paid the full amount of any <b>unrealised</b> transitory <b>gains</b> as dividends. This study focuses on the effects of FVA adjustments on dividend policy for South African firms, as represented by the firms included in the FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index. This furthers De Jager's (2015) study by extending the investigation of the dividend relevance of FVA adjustments from the major South African banks, to South African large firms in general. The results of a panel regression of the net profit of these firms reveal that unrealised FVA adjustments do have a persistent influence on future earnings, indicating that these adjustments contain both transitory and persistent elements.

To all intents and purposes, Australia has been a test for IAS 41 because of the close similarities between IAS 41 and the relevant Australian regulation on forestry that has been operational {{for the last four}} years. The Australian reporting experience is used to identify potential implications for EU reporting entities. Evidence suggests that constituents’ key concerns with IAS 41 relate to the measurement 1 of biological assets at fair value and the inclusion in income of <b>unrealised</b> <b>gains</b> or losses from measuring these assets at fair value. These concerns are borne out by the Australian experiences. Evidence is presented that suggests that compliance with IAS 41 will allow statement preparers a choice of methods to determine the fair value of timber assets. Additionally, it seem likely that the recognition of <b>unrealised</b> <b>gains</b> and losses from timber assets from changes in fair value and the harvest of agricultural produce will markedly affect income statements, introducing greater volatility into reported income. The impact has been greater for government departments. The median timber gain expressed as a percentage of net profit ranged from 44. 5 % to 79. 9 % in individual years.

40|$|The IASB Discussion Paper (2008), Preliminary Views on Financial Statement Presentation {{promises}} {{to extend the}} 'fair value' measurement concept into an aggregated comprehensive income statement. This article extends prior Anglo-Saxon based research by using 56, 700 European firm years from sixteen countries and by examining valuation, prediction and conservatism issues. Findings show net income dominates aggregated comprehensive income as a shareholder valuation metric and in predicting cash flows. Results are robust to pooled and country specific regressions, controls for non-linearities, the impact of reporting incentives, and the underlying accounting framework (local GAAP, US GAAP, IFRS). Aggregated comprehensive income also switches the conservative attributes of income towards a more timely recognition of good news over bad news, thus reducing the agency contracting role for debt.

40|$|Empirical thesis. Bibliography: pages 178 - 201. This {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide an {{empirical}} assessment of the implementation of IAS 41, Agriculture, in the agricultural sector in Australia, {{in the context of}} longstanding concerns over the use of fair value accounting for biological assets. Three areas of concern are examined in three papers: first, whether fair value accounting adopted under IAS 41 provides decision-useful information; second, whether the discretion provided in IAS 41 leads to opportunistic behaviour by management; and third, whether executive compensation contracts and corporate governance attributes are effective to constrain opportunistic behaviour. IAS 41 requires biological assets to be measured at fair value so that the transformation of biological assets through growth is presented in the financial statements in a timely manner, and thus provides information to investors for decision-making. The first paper of this thesis (in Chapter Two) evaluates the decision-usefulness of the information provided under fair value accounting in the Australian agricultural sector by examining the forecasting power of fair value of biological assets for future operating cash flows. The results find that fair value of biological assets contains limited useful information about future operating cash flows. Market-determined prices are not superior to managerial estimates in relation to providing useful information for decision-making. The fair value measurements prescribed in the standard require considerable use of management discretion. Thus, one of the main concerns about the use of fair value accounting for biological assets is the reliability of the information. The second paper of this thesis (in Chapter Three) examines whether managers use the discretion provided in IAS 41 opportunistically. The results indicate that managers in the Australian agricultural sector have used the discretion allowed in IAS 41 to manage their earning sin a manner consistent with meeting or beating target earnings. This problem mainly exists when managerial estimates are applied. The results also show that firms use a wide range of discount rates to achieve their various desired goals. The inclusion of <b>unrealised</b> agriculture <b>gains</b> in the income statement as part of reported earnings raises the question about whether executive compensation contracts and corporate governance are effective in monitoring the reliability of fair value information. The third paper of this thesis (in Chapter Four) examines the pay-sensitivity of executive compensation to agriculture gains as well as the role of corporate governance in monitoring the opportunistic behaviour allowed by the discretion provided in IAS 41. The findings show that executive bonus is not related to <b>unrealised</b> agriculture <b>gains,</b> consistent with boards of directors reviewing the earnings and rewarding executives for realised earnings only. The results also show that <b>unrealised</b> <b>gains</b> are smaller and less associated with pre-agriculture earnings when female directors are present on the board, suggesting that a gender-diverse board is more able to monitor the reliability of fair value information.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the links that continue to be forged between security pricing and accounting, building on recent findings that firms tend to be asymmetrically conservative in the timeliness of earnings recognition. The evidence is that firms in the European Union tend to recognise unrealised losses more quickly in their earnings than <b>unrealised</b> <b>gains</b> (Giner and Rees, 2001; Raonic et al., forthcoming), and {{there is evidence of}} even greater accounting conservatism in the USA (Basu, 1997; Ball et al., 2000; Givoly and Hayn, 2000). This paper investigates whether the Czech market exhibits conformity with the behaviour that has been documented elsewhere by examining the earnings/returns relationship, focusing to begin with on the impact of losses on earnings response coefficients and then considering the asymmetric timeliness of income recognition in the Czech market. The findings indicate that the Czech market is similar to more developed markets, at least in one respect: there is statistically significant evidence of different market effects of profits and losses, in that profits are more persistent than losses. However, contrary to the findings in more developed markets, there is no statistically significant evidence of earnings conservatism in the Czech market. These results are most probably due to the continuing influence of restrictive tax regulations that mitigate any tendency towards conservatism, as well as the transitional nature of the economy. A further reason is likely to be that the regulatory environment in the Czech Republic is close to the kind of stakeholder corporatism that is described by Ball et al. (2000), who show that conservatism tends to be less pronounced in such regimes where there are fewer managerial incentives to bias current earnings. In conclusion, if changes in market prices signal good news and bad news about future risky outcomes, {{there is no evidence of}} asymmetry in the Czech market in accounting for such risks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{current crisis}} exposed {{weaknesses}} {{in the application of}} accounting standards and gaps associated with the valuation of financial products. During the upturn, the revaluation of assets, build-up of off-balance sheet claims, and booking of <b>unrealised</b> <b>gains</b> obscured risk exposures taken by financial institutions. But as we have learned, when the cycles turn, the downward trends and uncertainties in the value of assets may lead to negative dynamics that may exaggerate the trough of the cycle. This is generally accepted, but we need to be more symmetrical in our approach: increasing valuations in the upturns can also create the incentives, through more profits, compensations and dividends, to purchase more of the appreciating assets and thereby exacerbate the peak. All this raises legitimate questions regarding the role of risk management systems, accounting standards and regulations in creating adequate incentives and conveying information on a financial entity’s risk profi le throughout the business cycle. More fundamentally, it raises questions about whether marking-to-market provides the necessary objective representation or may contribute to mispricing of risk during upturns and injecting artificial risk during downturns and thus distorting the information value of prices. Changing accounting standards {{at the height of the}} crisis would risk adversely impacting investor confidence and should be avoided. Furthermore, fair value accounting is the direction to go, but going forward, there is a need to revisit the implications of accounting standards on behavior and incentives, especially during good times, with a view to making possible adjustments to current accounting practices. Inconsistencies of accounting standards with best risk management practices and prudential norms can be very expensive for financial stability. Governance and risk management within financial institutions need to be improved, and supervisors should scrutinise more carefully internal processes and controls, as well as valuation and stress testing methodologies. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{significant}} {{stock market}} fluctuations observed since the mid- 1990 s have generated major <b>unrealised</b> holding <b>gains</b> and losses and sizeable {{changes in the}} market capitalisation of listed companies. Indeed, stock prices rose up to 2000 and then fell until 2003 - 2004, when they posted a recovery. Such fl uctuations have no doubt affected {{the way in which}} economic agents perceive their fi nancial position and have consequently infl uenced their fi nancial behaviour and their use of credit. This study attempts to distinguish, in changes in household and company borrowing behaviour, between the effects of a specifi c fi nancial constraint, attributable to stock market shocks, and more traditional effects, stemming from the business cycle. To do so, the study uses a model, based on the quarterly financial accounts published by the Banque de France in autumn 2004, that tracks the financial behaviour of households and companies over the recent period of equity market turbulence between 1995 and 2003. Given the subject under review, the model focuses on two fi nancial assets – loans and equities – thus making it possible to analyse the borrowing behaviour of these two agents, the structure of their fi nancial assets and the composition of companies’ liabilities. However, it does not take account of households’ real estate assets and therefore measures only the impact of equity market bubbles on credit. In this model, it is assumed that flows of bank loans to households and companies not only depend on their consumption and investment spending but on their fi nancial position as well. More specifi cally, in the case of households, they depend on their net wealth and, in the case of companies, on the share of loans in their liabilities. A stock market shock brings about changes in outstanding amounts of equities held by households and in the valuation of companies’ equity capital. The financial position of these two agents and, consequently, their borrowing behaviour are affected. According to the simulations of this model, companies in France appear much more sensitive than households to stock market shocks. Wealth effects seem to have a fairly limited impact on loans to households. However, the balance sheet structure effect appears to be largely responsible for the expansion of loans to companies. The rise in stock prices {{in the latter half of}} the 1990 s seems to have sharply increased companies’ equity capital, thus allowing them to increase their leverage. Assessing the impact of an equity market bubble on credit remains, in principle, contingent on the way this bubble is measured and in particular on the assumption made regarding the share price trend growth rate that acts as the reference trend. However, whether we assume the latter to be that of the fi rst half of the 1990 s, i. e. 4 % per year, or even twice that rate, the amplitude of stock market fl uctuations over the period was such that this assumption is not a determining factor for the orders of magnitude. In both cases, outstanding loans to companies appeared to rise by just over 8 % in 2001 compared with the amount by which they would have increased had there not been an equity market bubble. ...|$|R
