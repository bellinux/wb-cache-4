40|$|Similar to {{the process}} seen in {{invasion}} biology, urbanized environments lead to biotic homogenization with a few species, often alien, dominating the urban habitat. We investigated avian communities across an urban gradient in Pretoria (South Africa). We defined three urbanization zones: urban, suburban and semi-natural, based on land-cover. We conducted point counts of all species at each of 13 sites in these zones over a 4 -month period. We found significantly more species in the semi-natural zone than the urban zone but abundance was significantly lower in semi-natural than urban. The increase in abundance was mainly {{as a result of}} alien species with the three most abundant species in the urban zone being all alien. Semi-natural contained fewer alien species than urban and significantly fewer than suburban. The Common Myna Acridotheres tristis was the only alien species that was observed in all three <b>urbanization</b> <b>zones</b> and was the second most abundant species in the suburban and urban zones. Our study supports the process of biotic homogenization, where an increase in alien species occurs in the urban compared to semi-natural zone. Although the suburban zone made an important contribution towards native bird abundance in a larger city environment, this environment was also an important environment for alien species, especially for the Common Myna...|$|R

40|$|Land use is {{changeable}} in {{the urban}} area, depending upon the economical mechanism of market. The controlled urbanization area is made a region where the urbanization should be controlled by the city planning and zoning act. However, in the zone, there are also many areas where form regulation of the building is looser than the <b>urbanization</b> <b>zone</b> which should form a city area. Therefore disorderly development acts, such as location of the large-scale commercial institution and leisure facilities unsuitable for circumference environment, are accepted in the controlled urbanization area. On the other hand, energies decrease in existing village by population decrease and declining birthrate and a growing proportion of elderly people become a problem. In order {{to cope with this}} problem, {{it is important to understand}} the past conditions of land use for the urban planning. This paper describes the spatial structure of urbanization control districts based on the present conditions and the change structure of land use by using mesh data surveyed and the copy of the development permission register in a local hub-city in Japan. Land use forecasting systems are designed using neural network. Although land use is classified separately in every surveyed year, the common classification of land use is proposed, considering the similarity of spatial distributions and the physical meanings of land use. Then, the distribution by mesh at each division of land use is studied. Spatial distribution of land use and its transition are also discussed. Next, land use forecasting models are made out using neural network. The feature and structure of change in the land use of an area depends on whether development projects are carried out or not. Therefore, all of the meshes are divided into two groups, and forecasting models are designed. Though our proposed approach is a macroscopic forecasting method of land use, it is useful in the investigation of urban policies for development projects and in the evaluation of their effects. ...|$|E

Nevertheless, peri-urban basins mixing rural and urban behaviors, have not been studied by neither urban nor rural hydrologists. Thus, so far we are still on the pursuit of a well adapted model to these particular basins.

40|$|Abstract Background In Europe, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is {{the main}} {{definitive}} host of Echinococcus multilocularis, the aetiological agent of a severe disease in humans called alveolar echinococcosis. The distribution of this zoonotic parasite among the fox population is remarkably aggregated with few heavily infected animals harbouring much of the parasite burdens and being {{responsible for most of}} the environmental parasitic egg contamination. Important research questions explored were: (i) spatial differences in parasite infection pressure related to the level of urbanization; (ii) temporal differences in parasite infection pressure in relation to time of the year; (iii) is herd immunity or an age-dependent infection pressure responsible for the observed parasite abundance; (iv) assuming E. multilocularis infection is a clumped process, how many parasites results from a regular infection insult. Methods By developing and comparing different transmission models we characterised the spatio-temporal variation of the infection pressure, in terms of numbers of parasites that foxes acquired after exposure per unit time, in foxes in Zurich (Switzerland). These included the variations in infection pressure with age of fox and season and the possible regulating effect of herd immunity on parasite abundance. Results The model fitting best to the observed data supported the existence of spatial and seasonal differences in infection pressure and the absence of parasite-induced host immunity. The periodic infection pressure had different amplitudes across <b>urbanization</b> <b>zones</b> with higher peaks during autumn and winter. In addition, the model indicated the existence of variations in infection pressure among age groups in foxes from the periurban zone. Conclusions These heterogeneities in infection exposure have strong implications for the implementation of targeted control interventions to lower the intensity of environmental contamination with parasite eggs and, ultimately, the infection risk to humans...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to address the}} prevailing development issues and challenges derived from the land use changes in Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia. An effort {{has been made to}} firstly identify and discuss in brief about the history of physical and spatial development and land use changes occurred in Cameron Highlands. An extensive review of relevant literature and using the geospatial inputs from analyzing satellite images of the areas from different period of time will be explicitly presented. We developed an object-oriented method for mapping and monitoring the changes of land-use-land-cover (LULC) in a complex environment. Temporal satellite images (2001 - 2014) are intensively used to produce a series of LULC maps. All high resolution images were intelligently classified into six land use types namely primary forest, secondary forest, agricultural areas, bare soil, urban/settlement and water bodies. The preliminary result showed the forested area significantly decreases, whereas agriculture and <b>urbanization</b> <b>zones</b> are dramatically increasing and causing a number of disasters in the area. This collaborative research has identified the need and requirement of accurate LULC information and possibly monitored their changes. With issues of deforestation and expansion of urban and plantation areas into the environmental sensitive areas (ESA) of Cameron Highlands, there are great concern among local stakeholders on micro-climate changes and disaster-related events that induced by human activities in highland areas such as mud flood and landslides. This study recommended that land use changes influenced by human activities should be continuously monitored using advanced and modern geospatial technology. A geo-smart spatial planning can be a complimentary tool for solving excessive land use issues and subsequently reducing disaster risks. A spatiotemporal analysis can be extended to support the spatial planning process and enforcement at local level. Establishment of special area planning at every sub-districts of Cameron Highlands could also be an achievable target as to regulate land use changes towards sustainable development at grassroots level...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the contradictory relationship between the climate and physical structure of the built environment in Erzurum as one of the coldest climate cities in Turkey. It mainly questions whether the urban form and geometry (size, density, street orientation and ventilation), height and shape of the buildings and vegetation in selected districts of Erzurum are compatible with the cold climate conditions. In this direction, disturbances, vulnerability of urban ecosystem, construction practices, street orientations, settlement patterns, housing typology, density, average height, hard-surfaces, distances, flora and density of green areas are analyzed. The findings show that the urban built environment in Erzurum (City Centre, Dadaskent and Yildizkent districts) is not consistent with the cold climate conditions. Urban heat island, urban sprawl, ventilation problems and existing air pollution, and high temperature differences in the city are the threatening factors for ecologically sustainable urban development. In the context of this study, it is aimed to formulate urban design guidelines for the city of Erzurum in cold climate <b>zone.</b> <b>Urbanization</b> and urban form of the three different districts, which are the focus areas of this research, must be reconsidered from a climate sensitive perspective, otherwise new development areas will not be energy efficient and resilient against changes, surprises and risks.

40|$|River {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} under stress and pressure from agriculture and <b>urbanization</b> in riparian <b>zones,</b> resulting in frequent engineering interventions such as bank stabilization or flood protection. This study provides guidelines {{for a more}} sustainable approach to river management based on hydrogeomorphology concepts applied to three contrasted rivers in Quebec (Canada). Mobility and flooding spaces are determined for the three rivers, and three levels of “freedom space” are subsequently defined based on {{the combination of the}} two spaces. The first level of freedom space includes very frequently flooded and highly mobile zones over the next 50 years, as well as riparian wetlands. It provides the minimum space for both fluvial and ecological functionality of the river system. On average for the three studied sites, this minimum space was approximately 1. 7 times the channel width, but this minimum space corresponds to a highly variable width which must be determined from a thorough hydrogeomorphic assessment and cannot be predicted using a representative average. The second level includes space for floods of larger magnitude and provides for meanders to migrate freely over a longer time period. The last level of freedom space represents exceptional flood zones. We propose the freedom space concept to be implemented in current river management legislation because it promotes a sustainable way to manage river systems, and it increases their resilience to climate and land use changes in comparison with traditional river management approaches which are based on frequent and spatially restricted interventions...|$|R
40|$|The uneven and underexplored {{landscapes of}} the border zone between Haiti and the Dominican Republic has become a {{promising}} frontier for capital accumulation, attracting industrial activity to the island's overlooked regions. This thesis focuses on the most populous border crossing in the island, where {{the implementation of a}} free trade zone in 2004 catalyzed rapid population increase on the Haitian side, and urban infrastructures were unable {{to keep up with the}} fast pace of informal growth. At this site, the borderline coincides with the River Massacre, a major source of water in the region, threatened by the current patterns of urbanization. Given the scenario of industrial expansion and increased migration to Ouanaminthe, investments in affordable housing are at the core of planning strategies to accommodate urban growth. The proposal sees the opportunity for a territorial strategy that integrates housing and water infrastructures to address uneven <b>urbanization.</b> While the <b>zone</b> exists in isolation to the urban fabric of both cities, its existence provides the opportunity to weave an alternative spatial order, countering the reproduction of spatial and social injustices. By seizing infrastructure's ability to act directly on the city, architecture mediates the complex flows of water and people to build a sustainable urban future. Water is drawn as the layer 0 to accommodate the diverse program, staging the sites for affordable housing units, public open spaces, industrial and agricultural activities. Essential to this scheme are aqueducts that position water not at the edge, but at the center of urban development. Together with other infrastructural artifacts, the aqueducts are mechanisms that forge new individual and collective identities. by Luisa de Lucena Schettino. Thesis: S.

40|$|Hoteliers’ {{efforts to}} improve the {{environmental}} sustainability of their operations would be promoted by having a consistent industry-wide measure for benchmarking current operations and tracking the effect of environmental sustainability initiatives. This type of measure can also assist external stakeholders, such as the hotel guests and regulatory entities, to gauge hotels’ environmental sustainability efforts. This report presents the results of an exploratory study that develops such a measure, using resource consumption records of 984 U. S. hotels over a period of eight years. The measure is based on an analysis of resource consumption–related expenses found in these hotels’ year-end operating statements, for electricity, water and sewer, maintenance other expenses, and laundry, linen, and supplies for both the rooms and for food and beverage services. Using a multivariate data analysis technique called exploratory factor analysis, the measure developed in the study consists of two parts: an operating factor that comprises large weights from electricity, water and sewer, and maintenance expenses, and a behavioral factor, which is largely driven by laundry, linen, and supplies for both rooms and F 2 ̆ 6 B operations. In general, costs found in the operating factor are under management control, but the costs in the behavioral factor are subject to guests’ activities. By normalizing the average of each of these two factors at zero, hotels that score above zero on each factor are spending more than other hotels, and those with a score below zero are more efficient than others. These factors can be compared according to various hotel characteristics, such as chain segment, the involvement of a third-party professional management company in the operating structure, location (both in terms of the degree of <b>urbanization</b> and climate <b>zone),</b> and whether the hotel offers F 2 ̆ 6 B service. For instance, the above-average costs of providing F 2 ̆ 6 B are clearly depicted in these measurements (as compared with limited-service operations) ...|$|R
