5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a <b>unique</b> <b>sequence</b> of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as {{the letters of the}} alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E

25|$|UniProt Archive (UniParc) is a {{comprehensive}} and non-redundant database, which contains all the protein sequences from the main, publicly available protein sequence databases.

BLASTX searches showed that 959 <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> shared homology to proteins in the NCBI non-redundant database.

Meanwhile, we identified 15 genes to be abundantly expressed in muscle of the mandarin fish. These genes are involved in muscle structural formation and regulation of muscle differentiation and development. The most remarkable gene in S. chuatsi is nuclease diphosphate kinase B, which is represented by 449 EST sequences accounting for 8. 86 % of the total EST sequences.

40|$|BACKGROUND: American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used herbal {{remedies}} in the world. Its major bioactive constituents are the triterpene saponins known as ginsenosides. However, little is known about ginsenoside biosynthesis in American ginseng, especially the late steps of the pathway. RESULTS: In this study, a one-quarter 454 sequencing run produced 209, 747 high-quality reads with an average sequence length of 427 bases. De novo assembly generated 31, 088 <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> containing 16, 592 contigs and 14, 496 singletons. About 93. 1 % of the high-quality reads were assembled into contigs with an average 8 -fold coverage. A total of 21, 684 (69. 8 %) <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> were annotated by a BLAST similarity search against four public sequence databases, and 4, 097 of the <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> were assigned to specific metabolic pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Based on the bioinformatic analysis described above, we found all of the known enzymes involved in ginsenoside backbone synthesis, starting from acetyl-CoA via the isoprenoid pathway. Additionally, a total of 150 cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) and 235 glycosyltransferase <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> were found in the 454 cDNA library, some of which encode enzymes responsible for the conversion of the ginsenoside backbone into the various ginsenosides. Finally, one CYP 450 and four UDP-glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis through a methyl jasmonate (MeJA) inducibility experiment and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis based on a real-time PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated, with the assistance of the MeJA inducibility experiment and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis, that transcriptome analysis based on 454 pyrosequencing is a powerful tool for determining the genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in non-model plants. Additionally, the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> from this study provide an important resource for the scientific community that is interested in the molecular genetics and functional genomics of American ginseng...|$|R

Little is known about its genome sequence {{although it has been}} extensively used as a test organism in terrestrial ecotoxicology. In order to understand its gene expression response to environmental contaminants, we cloned 4032 cDNAs or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from two E. fetida libraries enriched with genes responsive to ten ordnance related compounds using suppressive subtractive hybridization-PCR. Results A total of 3144 good quality ESTs (GenBank dbEST accession number EH 669363 – EH 672369 and EL 515444 – EL 515580) were obtained from the raw clone sequences after cleaning. Clustering analysis yielded 2231 <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> including 448 contigs (from 1361 ESTs) and 1783 singletons. Comparative genomic analysis showed that 743 or 33 % of the <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> shared high similarity with existing genes in the GenBank nr database.

40|$|Abstract Background Panax notoginseng (Burk) F. H. Chen is {{important}} medicinal plant of the Araliacease family. Triterpene saponins are the bioactive constituents in P. notoginseng. However, available genomic information regarding this plant is limited. Moreover, details of triterpene saponin biosynthesis in the Panax species are largely unknown. Results Using the 454 pyrosequencing technology, a one-quarter GS FLX titanium run resulted in 188, 185 reads {{with an average}} length of 410 bases for P. notoginseng root. These reads were processed and assembled by 454 GS De Novo Assembler software into 30, 852 <b>unique</b> <b>sequences.</b> A total of 70. 2 % of <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> were annotated by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) similarity searches against public sequence databases. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) assignment discovered 41 <b>unique</b> <b>sequences</b> representing 11 genes involved in triterpene saponin backbone biosynthesis in the 454 -EST dataset. In particular, the transcript encoding dammarenediol synthase (DS), {{which is the first}} committed enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of major triterpene saponins, is highly expressed in the root of four-year-old P. notoginseng. It is worth emphasizing that the candidate cytochrome P 450 (Pn 02132 and Pn 00158) and UDP-glycosyltransferase (Pn 00082) gene most likely to be involved in hydroxylation or glycosylation of aglycones for triterpene saponin biosynthesis were discovered from 174 cytochrome P 450 s and 242 glycosyltransferases by phylogenetic analysis, respectively. Putative transcription factors were detected in 906 <b>unique</b> <b>sequences,</b> including Myb, homeobox, WRKY, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and other family proteins. Additionally, a total of 2, 772 simple sequence repeat (SSR) were identified from 2, 361 <b>unique</b> <b>sequences,</b> of which, di-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant motif. Conclusion This study is the first to present a large-scale EST dataset for P. notoginseng root acquired by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The candidate genes involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis, including the putative CYP 450 s and UGTs, were obtained in this study. Additionally, the identification of SSRs provided plenty of genetic makers for molecular breeding and genetics applications in this species. These data will provide information on gene discovery, transcriptional regulation and marker-assisted selection for P. notoginseng. The dataset establishes an important foundation for the study with the purpose of ensuring adequate drug resources for this species. </p...|$|R
