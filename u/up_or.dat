5|$|Adams {{was known}} to the Native Americans as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal {{languages}} (Plateau Penutian, Chinookan, Salishan), Pahto means high up, very high, standing <b>up,</b> <b>or</b> high sloping mountain. The Klickitat name is of Klickitat origin and comes from the Chinookan for beyond.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept <b>up,</b> <b>or</b> gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E

5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E
5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down.|$|E

5|$|The current fifth {{edition of}} the Stanford–Binet scales (SB5) was {{developed}} by Gale H. Roid and published in 2003 by Riverside Publishing. Unlike scoring on previous versions of the Stanford–Binet test, SB5 IQ scoring is deviation scoring in which each standard deviation <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down from the norming sample median score is 15 points from the median score, IQ 100, just like the standard scoring on the Wechsler tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully <b>up</b> <b>or</b> fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned <b>up</b> <b>or</b> otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E

5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag <b>up</b> <b>or</b> touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E
5|$|Blyton {{felt she}} had a {{responsibility}} to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set <b>up</b> <b>or</b> supported, she encouraged and organised them {{to raise funds for}} animal and paediatric charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid, featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break <b>up</b> <b>or</b> control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E

5|$|Citizen's Briefing Book {{is a work}} of {{suggestions}} by individuals compiled into a book format and submitted to President Barack Obama after his inauguration on January 20, 2009. Internet users originally posted their suggestions at Change.gov, with the plan that after Barack Obama was sworn in as President the website hosting the recommendations would direct users to Whitehouse.gov. The option to participate in the request for comment format was open until January 20, 2009, where users were able to post suggestions to the President, read others' recommendations, and comment on each other's ideas. Users voted on individual recommendations with an <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down vote for each suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and {{interacts with the}} game world by clicking the mouse on {{different parts of the}} screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick <b>up</b> <b>or</b> place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E
5|$|During their peacetime careers, {{the vessels}} {{served in a}} variety of roles, {{including}} as survey vessels, training ships, fishery protection ships, and guard ships. Several of them were sent abroad, usually to the Mediterranean Sea on training cruises; during conflicts in Spain and the Ottoman Empire, these vessels were used to protect German nationals in those countries. Starting in 1872, the members of the class began to be withdrawn from service as their hulls began to deteriorate. Several of the ships were converted into storage hulks, while others were simply broken <b>up</b> <b>or</b> in the case of Meteor and Drache, sunk as target ships. Basilisk was the last surviving member of the class, remaining in use as a naval mine storage hulk until at least 1900; her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

Heavy-duty escalators at stations carry passengers <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down at a rate of 0.75m/s, 50% faster than conventional escalators.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped <b>up</b> <b>or</b> leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells that increase the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature <b>up</b> <b>or</b> down one plane when touched.|$|E
