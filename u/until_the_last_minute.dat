5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> before deadline, something he was prone to do.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> the Germans were beaten back but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, mutinies {{erupted in}} Kiel on 3 November; the sailors of the Kaiserliche Marine refused {{to fight a}} battle [...] "for honor". The revolutionary wave spread all over Germany. On November 9, William II was forced to abdicate. The General Staff asked that the {{armistice}} be signed. <b>The</b> fighting continued <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minutes</b> before <b>the</b> armistice took effect at 11:00 am 11 November 1918.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{the senior}} team went un{{defeated}} {{during the regular}} season with a 6-0 record. Eastdale was defeated 46-7 in the quarter finals. Rival Wilson was the opponent in the semi final with home field advantage. Holy Trinity was leading <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minutes</b> of <b>the</b> game, when Wilson would score to move ahead 20-15, denying Holy Trinity to return to the LOSSA Final. The rivalry with Wilson grew stronger.|$|R
50|$|D.C. United played {{its first}} MLS match on April 6, 1996, against the San Jose Clash (now Earthquakes). In this first game, the score {{remained}} tied at 0-0 <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minutes</b> of regulation time, when San Jose's attacker, Eric Wynalda, scored the first goal {{in league history}} and sent United to its first defeat. D.C. United lost its next three games and soon found itself in last place in both the Eastern Division and in the overall standings.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected {{to the satisfaction of}} the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E
5|$|Tod {{is a red}} fox kit, {{raised as}} a pet {{by one of the}} human hunters who killed his mother and litter mates. Tod {{initially}} enjoys his life, but when he reaches sexual maturity he returns to the wild. During his first year, he begins establishing his territory, and learns evasion techniques from being hunted by local farm dogs. One day, he comes across the Master's house and discovers that his presence sends the chained pack of dogs into a frustrated frenzy. He begins to delight in taunting them, until one day when Chief breaks his chain and chases him. The Master sees the dog escape and follows with Copper. As Chief skillfully trails the fox, Tod flees along a railroad track while a train is approaching, waiting to jump to safety <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute.</b> Chief is killed by the train.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day as the {{formation}} of the Anglo-French hunter groups, Admiral Graf Spee captured the steamer Newton Beech. Two days later, she encountered and sank the merchant ship Ashlea. On 8 October, the following day, she sank Newton Beech, which Langsdorff had been using to house prisoners. Newton Beech was too slow to keep up with Admiral Graf Spee, and so the prisoners were transferred to the cruiser. On 10 October, she captured the steamer Huntsman, the captain of which had not sent a distress signal <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> as he had mistakenly identified Admiral Graf Spee as a French warship. Unable to accommodate the crew from Huntsman, Admiral Graf Spee sent the ship to a rendezvous location with a prize crew. On 15 October, Admiral Graf Spee rendezvoused with Altmark to refuel and transfer prisoners; the following morning, the prize Huntsman joined the two ships. The prisoners aboard Huntsman were transferred to Altmark and Langsdorff then sank Huntsman on the night of 17 October.|$|E
50|$|In {{his next}} apparitions for PRIDE Bushido, Sakurai would face {{two members of}} the Gracie family, Rodrigo and Crosley, but he was {{unsuccessful}} in both ventures. He fought an uneventful match against the former, stopping him from passing guard for the first round and being stopped himself from passing guard in the second, before receiving some knees to the head which gained Gracie the decision; and he then lost by submission to the latter, despite him showing a better performance <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, {{a novice}} {{antiques}} buyer may prefer to bid in auctions which already have bids placed by more experienced antiques buyers, {{on the grounds}} that the items which the experienced buyers are interested in are more likely to be valuable. In this case, more-informed buyers may delay bidding <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minutes</b> of <b>the</b> auction to avoid creating competition for their bids, leading to a lower winning bid. The highest bid 10 minutes before the end of a contested auction is often not at all representative of the eventual selling price.|$|R

25|$|In 2014, Seng created The Hidden Sound, {{a planned}} series of music gigs where {{the artist and}} venue {{remained}} secret <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute.</b> Australian singer-songwriter Kate Miller-Heidke performed the first gig in August 2014.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} into the 32 fatalities (excluding firefighters) that occurred in Victoria. It revealed that 25 were outside their homes, several of whom died in vehicles while attempting to escape the conflagration. It was found that delaying evacuation <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> was a common failing.|$|E
25|$|In command, Jackson was {{extremely}} secretive about his plans and extremely meticulous about military discipline. This secretive nature did not stand him in good stead with his subordinates, who were often {{not aware of}} his overall operational intentions <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> and who complained of being left out of key decisions.|$|E
50|$|Al-Ahly {{started in}} 2009 {{with the title}} of the Super Cup after {{defeating}} CS Sfaxien 2-1 at Flavio's goals, before the start of an exciting race on the league's shield with Ismaily, who became <b>the</b> top <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> two <b>minutes</b> of <b>the</b> season.|$|R
60|$|The young American {{was soon}} {{ready for the}} expedition, but De Catinat lingered <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{possible}} <b>minute.</b> When at <b>last</b> {{he was able to}} tear himself away, he adjusted his cravat, brushed his brilliant coat, and looked very critically over the sombre suit of his companion.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} test match New Zealand {{completely}} outplayed Great Britain, {{with the home}} side being held score less <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> five <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> tourists' win set up the series at 1-all and the spotlight then moved to Cheltenham, {{the scene of the}} third and deciding test match.|$|R
25|$|But timeo Danaos et dona ferentes (I {{fear the}} Greeks {{even when they}} bring gifts). By {{accepting}} this present Kastner had sold his soul to the devil... The success of the rescue agreement depended <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> on the Nazi goodwill, and the last minute didn't arrive until long {{after the end of}} the extermination of the Jews in the provincial towns.|$|E
25|$|A leap-frogging tactic {{was also}} {{employed}} to maintain momentum. Spearhead units would sometimes deploy quickly to tackle opposition, while follow-on echelons bypassed such engagements to strike deeper. Infiltration units like sappers also assisted the push by seizing bridges, road junctions {{and other key}} points ahead of the main forces. Deception measures were also widely used, with diversionary operations across a broad area, and troop movements timed <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> to avoid telegraphing the main points of attack. Such methods for example, enabled quick conquest of towns like Ban Me Thuot and their surrounding highways, and {{paved the way for}} further operations towards Saigon.|$|E
25|$|To {{cover the}} evacuation, AA units {{were ordered to}} {{maintain}} maximum activity and especially to prevent reconnaissance overflights. At the same time, 6th AA Bde was ordered by London to recover its guns {{as a matter of}} priority. This was done by progressively thinning out defences. Although much of the force's equipment was saved, the AA guns were kept in action <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> to cover the evacuation, and many had to be abandoned. 6th AA Bde was able to save five 3.7-inch guns at Hardstad, with a number of predictors and heightfinders. The brigade ended all AA defence on 6 June and by 8 June the British troops had embarked with their surviving equipment and the convoy sailed for the UK, still under air attack.|$|E
25|$|Gould {{says that}} Johnson had {{neglected}} the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy's strength <b>until</b> <b>the</b> very <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> {{when it was}} too late for Johnson to recover. Woods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal.|$|R
60|$|The Princess and Jeanne drove homewards in {{a silence}} which {{remained}} unbroken <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> {{events of the}} evening had been somewhat perplexing to the former. She scarcely understood even now why a great personage like the Duke of Westerham had shown such interest in her charge.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} {{casualties}} in the Allied and German armies. Rearguard actions were fought during the Pursuit to the Selle (9 October), Battle of Courtrai (14 October), Battle of Mont-d'Origny (15 October), Battle of the Selle (17 October), Battle of Lys and Escaut (Bataille de la Lys et de l'Escaut) (20 October) (including the subsidiary Battle of the Lys and Battle of the Escaut), Battle of the Serre (20 October), Battle of Valenciennes (1 November) and the Battle of the Sambre (including the Second Battle of Guise (4 November) and the Battle of Thiérache (4 November), with fighting continuing <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minutes</b> before <b>the</b> Armistice took effect at 11:00 on 11 November 1918. One of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> soldiers to die was Canadian Private George Lawrence Price, two minutes before the armistice took effect.|$|R
25|$|Despite being injured {{regularly}} (he was a doubt up <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> for the 1936 Cup Final), Drake's speed, fierce {{shooting and}} brave playing style {{meant he was}} Arsenal's first-choice centre forward {{for the rest of}} the decade, and he was the club's top scorer for each of the five seasons from 1934–35 to 1938–39. The Second World War curtailed Drake's career, although he served in the Royal Air Force as well as turning out for Arsenal in wartime games and also appearing as a guest player for West Ham United later in World War II. However, Drake's career would not last long into peacetime; a spinal injury incurred in a game against Reading in 1945 forced him to retire from playing. With 139 goals in 184 games, he is the joint-fifth (along with Jimmy Brain) all-time scorer for Arsenal.|$|E
25|$|During the campaign, Rodriguez was {{sometimes}} criticized for making potentially unrealistic promises, such as eliminating homelessness in the city, which depended on lobbying the provincial or federal governments for funding and program cooperation that those governments had not guaranteed {{would be made}} available. However, both of his main opponents were also criticized as well. Courtemanche, who did not officially declare his candidacy until {{just a few days}} before the nomination deadline, was viewed by many voters as having been a weak and ineffective leader during the previous council term, and faced allegations that he had held off his campaign launch <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> precisely to insulate himself from having to answer that criticism on the campaign trail. Reynolds, meanwhile, was criticized by the city's media for a vague and confrontational campaign which was critical of the existing council, but offered very few specific new ideas of her own.|$|E
25|$|On 20 February 1996, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals {{rejected}} {{a plea for}} clemency submitted by Bonin's attorneys {{on the grounds of}} inadequate legal representation at both his trials. Scarcely one hour prior to his scheduled execution, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Bonin's final plea to overturn his death sentence, with the convened panel in almost unanimous agreement that Bonin's own attorneys had not failed to give their client adequate legal representation by not earlier discovering their submitted claims to have discovered evidence attesting to Bonin's innocence. Furthermore, these appellate judges ruled that Bonin's attorneys should not have waited <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> to submit arguments to overturn or postpone the impending death sentence of their client. These convened judges also rejected Bonin's final claim that he had a right to choose between the gas chamber or lethal injection as his actual method of execution.|$|E
25|$|This {{time was}} {{different}} however. Connecticut scored the first eleven {{points of the}} second half, to double up Stanford 48-24. Connecticut led by at least 20 <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> five <b>minutes</b> and won 81-64. Jayne Appel matched Renee Montgomery for high scoring honors with 26, but Connecticut also got 24 from Maya Moore.|$|R
25|$|This was Gowdy's {{seventh and}} final Super Bowl telecast, and his last major event for NBC {{before moving to}} CBS later in 1979.

25|$|Roosevelt {{extensively}} used {{executive orders}} {{on a number}} of occasions to protect forest and wildlife lands during his tenure as President. By the end of his second term in office, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish 150 million acres of reserved forestry land. Roosevelt was unapologetic about his extensive use of executive orders to protect the environment, despite the perception in Congress that he was encroaching on too many lands. Eventually, Senator Charles Fulton (R-OH) attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land. Before signing that bill into law, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> to sign the bill into law. In total, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Prior to Roosevelt, only one president had issued over 200 executive orders, Grover Cleveland (253). The first 25 presidents issued a total of 1,262 executive orders. Roosevelt issued 1,081.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{authorities}} believed <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> {{that the}} worst could be avoided, and as such urged the populace {{to stay home with}} buckets of water, so as to be prepared to extinguish any fire and prevent its spread. So feeble a means of stopping the fire quickly proved useless, and the panicked residents tried to save their most precious belongings and fled to the heights of the city, east of the Senne valley. A helpless crowd watched the fire from the park at the ducal palace. By the middle of the night, the entire heart of the city was aflame, including the stone buildings of the Grand Place and its surroundings, the Town Hall, abandoned by the authorities and whose spire was being used as a target by the French artillery, the Breadhouse, the Récollet convent and the Church of Saint Nicholas, whose bell fell on and crushed the neighbouring houses. Max Emmanuel, who had hastily returned from Namur with several troops, tried in vain to organize an effective resistance against the inferno and to maintain order.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, Jack Hearne first {{played for}} Middlesex in 1888 against the Australians. He was not {{qualified}} until 1890, {{and when he}} played his first County Championship match, Hearne did not know he was playing <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute.</b> Yet, he took six for 62, though his performances {{for the rest of}} the year were only moderate given the primitiveness of pitches at the time – something that was changing at a rate unprecedented in cricket history during Hearne's prime. In 1891, however, Hearne advanced in a remarkable way, taking 118 wickets in county cricket for only 10.33 runs apiece. This included two amazing bowling feats – 9 for 32 versus Nottinghamshire at Nottingham and 8 for 22 against Lancashire at Lord's. So much of a sensation did Hearne cause that year that Wisden named him as a Cricketer of the Year for 1892 and he toured South Africa with a party led by W.W. Read to play in his first Test. He made a surprising 40, but had almost no bowling to do.|$|E
