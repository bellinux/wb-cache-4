500|$|When South Pacific {{opened in}} London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed. [...] London's Daily Express praised the music but disliked other {{elements}} of that show, writing, [...] "We got a 42nd Street Madame Butterfly, the weakest of all the Hammerstein-Rodgers musicals. The Daily Mail suggested, [...] "The play moved so slowly between its songs that it seemed more like South Soporific." [...] The Times applauded the songs but indicated that [...] "before the end the singing and the dancing have dwindled to almost nothing, while the rather sad little tale is slowly and conventionally wound up." [...] The Manchester Guardian, however, noted the anticipation {{in advance of the}} opening and concluded that [...] "there was no disappointment... the show bounces the audience and well deserves the cheers." [...] Drama critic Kenneth Tynan of The Spectator wrote that South Pacific was [...] "the first musical romance which was seriously involved in an adult subject... I have nothing to do but thank Logan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and climb <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> knees, a little cramped from the effort of typing in such an unusual position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aeneas {{finishes}} his story, and Dido realizes {{that she has}} {{fallen in love with}} Aeneas. Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus, Aeneas's mother, with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy. Aeneas is inclined to return Dido's love, and during a hunting expedition, a storm drives them into a cave in which Aeneas and Dido presumably have sex, an event that Dido takes to indicate a marriage between them. But when Jupiter sends Mercury to remind Aeneas of his duty, he {{has no choice but to}} part. Her heart broken, Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with Aeneas's sword. Before dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas's people and hers; [...] "rise <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> bones, avenging spirit" [...] (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) is a possible invocation to Hannibal. Looking back from the deck of his ship, Aeneas sees the smoke of Dido's funeral pyre and knows its meaning only too clearly. Nevertheless, destiny calls, and the Trojan fleet sails on to Italy.|$|E
2500|$|In the Roman epic of Virgil, the Aeneid, Queen Dido, the Greek {{name for}} Elissa, is first {{introduced}} {{as a highly}} esteemed character. In just seven years, since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians have rebuilt a successful kingdom under her rule. Her subjects adore her and present her with a festival of praise. Her character is perceived by Virgil as even more noble when she offers asylum to Aeneas and his men, who have recently escaped from Troy. A spirit {{in the form of}} the messenger god, Mercury, sent by Jupiter, reminds Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love, Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. Virgil ends his legend of Dido with the story that, when Aeneas tells Dido, her heart broken, she orders a pyre to be built where she falls upon Aeneas' sword. As she lay dying, she predicted eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own: [...] "rise <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> bones, avenging spirit" [...] (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) she says, an invocation of Hannibal. The details of Virgil's story do not, however, form part of the original legend and are significant mainly as an indication of Rome's attitude towards the city she had destroyed, exemplified by Cato the Elder's much-repeated utterance, [...] "Carthago delenda est", [...] "Carthage must be destroyed".|$|E

40|$|Extract] My {{period was}} only about 10 days overdue, but I had already {{experienced}} a flash of intuitive knowing – one of those millisecond moments whose power leaves you with utter conviction.

The knowing rushed <b>up</b> <b>from</b> inside <b>my</b> cells {{at the speed of}} light, bursting into my consciousness – I'm pregnant! I sat up, startled. Had I dreamt it? I did not dare to really believe. It was too much to absorb all at once, too awesome...|$|R
