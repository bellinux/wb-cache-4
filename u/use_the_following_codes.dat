40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a pair of}} {{correlated}} Gaussian sources (X 1, X 2). Two separate encoders {{observe the}} two components and communicate compressed versions of their observations to a common decoder. The decoder is interested in reconstructing a linear combination of X 1 and X 2 to within a mean-square distortion of D. We obtain an inner bound to the optimal rate-distortion region for this problem. A portion of this inner bound is achieved by a scheme that reconstructs the linear function directly rather than reconstructing the individual components X 1 and X 2 first. This results in a better rate region for certain parameter values. Our coding scheme relies on lattice coding techniques in contrast to more prevalent random coding arguments used to demonstrate achievable rate regions in information theory. We then {{consider the case of}} linear reconstruction of K sources and provide an inner bound to the optimal rate-distortion region. Some parts of the inner bound are achieved <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>coding</b> structure: lattice vector quantization followed by “correlated ” lattice-structured binning. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The Post-traumatic Feeding Disorder {{has been}} {{introduced}} to define clinical evidence characterized by intense anticipatory anxiety of the child {{at the sight of}} food and great distress if the child is encouraged to eat by the caregiver; these children often show clinical history of actual unpleasant events namely of highly food or oral traumatic experiences due to medical treatments. Objective: To identify variables and interactive features of the maternal and child psychological profile in the context of some types of feeding disorders: Post-Traumatic Feeding Disorder, Infantile Anorexia and Food Sensory Aversions. Methodology: Sample: The sample consisted of 80 mother-infant dyads (age range of children: 17 - 36 months). Tools and procedures: Observing mother-child interaction during feeding was assessed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>coding</b> systems: Feeding Scale and Feeding Resistance Scale. The mother's psychological profile was assessed through the Psychiatric Symptom Checklist and Eating Attitude Test. The psychological profile of the child was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist 1 ½- 5. Results: Interactive variables: There were significant differences between all clinical groups examined and the control group to scores of Feeding Scale. In particular, children with Posttraumatic Feeding Disorder obtained higher average scores in all dimensions of Feeding Resistance Scale. Risk indicators in the psychological functioning of mothers: mothers of children with Post-traumatic Eating Disorder get average scores higher anxiety than mothers of children with Infantile Anorexia. Risk indicators in the psychological functioning of children: Children with Post-traumatic Feeding Disorder obtained higher average scores in Externalizing syndromes (aggressive behavior) than other clinical groups and control. Discussion and Conclusions: The results of our study confirm the specific clinical features of emotional dysregulation in children with Post-traumatic Feeding Disorder and the interconnections between psychological of mothers' and children's profile...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests {{investigating}} dynamic pulse buckling of a cylindrical shell under axial impact is compared to several 2 D and 3 D finite element simulations of the event. The purpose {{of the work is}} to investigate the performance of various analysis codes and element types on a problem which is applicable to radioactive material transport packages, and ultimately to develop a benchmark problem to qualify finite element analysis codes for the transport package design industry. Four axial impact tests were performed on 4 in-diameter, 8 in-long, 304 L stainless steel cylinders with a 3 / 16 in wall thickness. The cylinders were struck by a 597 lb mass with an impact velocity ranging from 42. 2 to 45. 1 ft/sec. During the impact event, a buckle formed {{at each end of the}} cylinder, and one of the two buckles became unstable and collapsed. The instability occurred at the top of the cylinder in three tests and at the bottom in one test. Numerical simulations of the test were performed <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>codes</b> and element types: PRONTO 2 D with axisymmetric four-node quadrilaterals; PRONTO 3 D with both four-node shells and eight-node hexahedrons; and ABAQUS/Explicit with axisymmetric two-node shells and four-node quadrilaterals, and 3 D four-node shells and eight-node hexahedrons. All of the calculations are compared to the tests with respect to deformed shape and impact load history. As in the tests, the location of the instability is not consistent in all of the calculations. However, the calculations show good agreement with impact load measurements with the exception of an initial load spike which is proven to be the dynamic response of the load cell to the impact. Finally, the PRONIT 02 D calculation is compared to the tests with respect to strain and acceleration histories. Accelerometer data exhibited good qualitative agreement with the calculations. The strain comparisons show that measurements are very sensitive to gage placement...|$|R

In its current form it supports identifying the flash chip and its various features; automatic address allocation and management; writing and reading {{a number of different}} types of data, ranging from 8 -bit to 32 -bit (signed and unsigned) values, floats, Strings, arrays of bytes/chars and structs to and from various locations; sector, block and chip erase; and powering down for low power operation.

Writing any data larger than a single byte that spanned page boundaries would cause the data to wrap around {{to the beginning of the}} page. The likelihood of this occurring was slim - no one has reported it to date. However, just in case, this has now been squashed in this release. Deprecations: Going forward the ATTiny 85 is no longer officially supported. The library no longer supports <b>using</b> <b>the</b> page number + offset combination instead of addresses. If your code requires you to use a page number + offset combination, <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>code</b> to helpaddress = (pagenumber << 8) + offset.

Page overflow is globally enabled by default and can be disabled by including a "#define DISABLEOVERFLOW" at the beginning of SPIFlash. h.
