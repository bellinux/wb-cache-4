You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> slight Indian accent. I'm not joking." [...] His comment was caught on C-SPAN. When asked to explain further, Biden spokesperson Margaret Aitken stated [...] "The Senator [...] admires, supports and respects the Indian-American community... The point Senator Biden was making {{is that there has}} been a vibrant Indian-American community in Delaware for decades. It has primarily been made up of engineers, scientists and physicians, but more recently, middle-class families are moving into Delaware and purchasing family-run small businesses..." [...] The Indian-American activist who was on the receiving end of Biden's comment later called the media coverage of Biden's comments [...] "completely unfair," [...] and stated that he was [...] "100 percent behind (Biden) because he did nothing wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Biden made remarks {{during the}} {{campaign}} that attracted controversy. On {{the day of his}} January 2007 announcement, he spoke of fellow Democratic candidate and Senator Barack Obama: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] This comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fund-raising capabilities; it later took second place on Time magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007. Biden had earlier been criticized in July 2006 for a remark he made about his support among Indian Americans: [...] "I've had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> slight Indian accent. I'm not joking." [...] Biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatory.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year Grant was {{considered for the}} Academy Award for Best Actor for Penny Serenade—his first nomination from the academy. Wansell claims that Grant found the film to be an emotional experience, because he and wife-to-be Barbara Hutton had started to discuss having their own children. Later that year he appeared in the romantic psychological thriller Suspicion, the first of Grant's four collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock. Grant did not warm to co-star Joan Fontaine, finding her to be temperamental and unprofessional. Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times considered that Grant was [...] "provokingly irresponsible, boyishly gay and also oddly mysterious, as the role properly demands". Hitchcock later stated that he thought {{the ending of the}} film in which Grant is sent to jail instead of committing suicide [...] "a complete mistake because of making that story with Cary Grant. <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cynical ending it makes the story too simple". Geoff Andrew of Time Out believes Suspicion served as [...] "a supreme example of Grant's ability to be simultaneously charming and sinister".|$|E

Aurinia is widely available at garden centers, so home propagation is really not necessary <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unusual form or need great numbers of plants. Small amounts only of complete plant food may be given in early spring as a boost, but feeding is not essential.|$|R
5000|$|Herr {{points out}} that most of what people knew about Kubrick came from the press, {{primarily}} the entertainment press. Few of the journalists that wrote about his life met him or knew much about it. He rarely gave interviews, [...] "because he thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to be crazy to do interviews <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> picture coming out," [...] adds Herr, who contrasted this with the many celebrities eager for the spotlight and thought this contributed to the public image of Kubrick as reclusive.|$|R
5000|$|In Portuguese, Sujeito a Guincho means “subject to tow-away”, as in {{the case}} of an {{improperly}} parked car. Among Brazilian musicians, it also refers to a clarinet player’s constant fear of producing a squeak while playing (the Portuguese word for [...] "squeak" [...] - guincho, means also the tow truck). Either way, to choose this expression as a name for your clarinet quintet would be risky, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good sense of humour and five of the best clarinet players in Brazil. Such is the case with the Sujeito a Guincho quintet.|$|R

2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. [...] But a ring in his nose is no good <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E

25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor <b>has</b> <b>a</b> large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|R
