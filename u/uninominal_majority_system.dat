50|$|The {{legislative}} election of 2016 unfolded differently compared to 2012 and 2008. On 24 February 2015, the Electoral Code Commission decided in principle {{for the future}} electoral law to return to party-list proportional representation, thereby relinquishing the first-past-the-post (uninominal) voting system as introduced in 2008. The option of turning the Parliament of Romania into a perfectly bicameral parliament, with some 300 deputies being elected on a closed list and 100 senators being elected by a single-round <b>uninominal</b> <b>majority</b> vote, had been discussed for years and even agreed upon between the ruling Social Democratic Party and the opposition. The new electoral law promulgated by President Klaus Iohannis on 20 July 2015 however didn't retain uninominal constituencies for the Senate. Closely sticking to the commission's recommendations, the new electoral law completely returned to party-list proportional representation.|$|R
40|$|Since 1990, {{after the}} first {{democratic}} elections inRomania, before each election, there were debates about the technical way inwhich elections should be conducted. If, as of May 20 th 1990 and till the autumnof 2004, parliamentary elections held in Romania were conducted in the form ofproportional representation, by voting on political party lists, in electoraldistricts strictly drawn by type and capital district, after the 2004 electiondebates around the modification of the voting system were approached withincreased interest and very intense discussions at the decision – making levelswere initiated. Thus, after lengthy debates in parliament and inside the civil society, and alsofollowing the referendum on 25 th of November 2007, initiated by the Presidentunder the Constitution of Romania (in consultation with the Parliament), it wasdecided that the Romanian electoral system would be modified from theproportional party lists voting method into the <b>uninominal</b> <b>majority</b> vote inelectoral constituencies and uninominal colleges (districts). The decision being thus taken by the voters, the Parliament started to discuss thesuggested bills and finally Law no. 35 / 2008 was passed in March 2008, this lawbeing known as the "law of the single vote". Law no. 35 / 2008 confirms the modification of the Romanian electoral systemand the November 2008 parliamentary elections were held under itsprerogatives. The consequences of the electoral changes are still commentedupon by the most prominent public life players in Romania...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} impact of winning and losing in {{parliamentary}} systems on protest behavior. I argue that losers in parliamentary systems with single party, majority governments are more likely to protest than losers in systems with coalition governments. In the empirical analysis, I provide support for my argument using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) survey from 2001 to 2006. The results suggest that losers in single party, <b>majority</b> <b>systems</b> were more likely to protest than their counterparts in coalition systems. In addition, while it is unclear whether winning and losing had an effect on protest behavior in coalition systems, losers in single party, <b>majority</b> <b>systems</b> were more likely to protest than winners...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of introducing a majority electoral system for the Chamber of Deputies in the Czech Republic, and discusses the virtues and drawbacks of such a system. It recalculates the electoral results from two previous elections using <b>majority</b> electoral <b>systems</b> (first-past-the-post and two round <b>majority</b> <b>system)</b> to examine how such a change could influence the formation of governmental majorities in the chamber and what the possible consequences for the quality of democracy in the Czech Republic could be. The results show that <b>majority</b> <b>system</b> would likely radically simplify the formation of governments with clear majorities, and hinder emerging populist parties as well as weaken the communist party. On the other hand, the adoption of a majority system would substantially lower barriers to enter the chamber, {{which could lead to}} the disintegration of the party system and its increased fragmentation. Combined with the common practice of Czech politicians to hold various mandates at different levels of the political system at the same time, this could be a significant risk factor...|$|R

Earlier studies, focused mainly on the Southern American states, have revealed that in ethnically mixed environments, competitors with radical positions on ethnic issues perform particularly well.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} majoritarian formulas on the effective number of candidates in the elections for president (absolute majority) and mayor (relative majority) in Chile. Although, in theory, greater fragmentation with the absolute <b>majority</b> <b>system</b> with run-off voting would be expected, the authors demonstrate that, {{in the case of}} Chile, precisely the opposite is observed. Fragmentation is greater in the relative <b>majority</b> <b>system.</b> This is explained by the lower entry and information costs that exist in mayoral elections with respect to presidential ones. We support this hypothesis with a time series statistical model (cross-sectional time series regression model).
