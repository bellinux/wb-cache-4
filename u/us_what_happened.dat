2500|$|.....the police got {{all those}} Aborigines from the Kular tribe that lived {{from the coast}} to the mission...they put the men on one chain and the women with their {{children}} and their kids on another chain. Some of those women had babes at the breast...they killed the men. They just lined them up and shot them one by one...the women had to watch those men being shot...their husbands and brothers and relatives...the men had to collect wood first. They didn't know why they had to collect that wood but they had to get a big pile of it...They lined them up and shot them...then they cut them up into pieces, you know, a leg, an arm, just like that and those bits of body were thrown on the wood...and burnt there...the women were taken to another place just a bit away...and had to stand on the river bank but it was dry that time of year and they were shot there so their bodies just fell into the (dry) river...they bashed the brains out of the babies and threw them into the river with their mothers and burnt the lot (there)...there's a lot of bodies. It {{took a long time to}} burn...With the women was a mother and her two kids...they had bush names. They couldn't speak English...The boy's name (was) Numbunnung and the girl was Loorabane...the boy spoke to his sister in language and told her that when that chain came off to grab mum and head for the bush...they were at the end of the chain...but (when they ran away) the police shot at them...they killed the mother and the girl got shot in the leg there (pointing)...they hid in the roots of the pandanus grass in the Forrest River. They hid under water and breathed through a bit of pandanus grass, you know, it's hollow, like a straw...the police looked for them everywhere but they just kept real still, not moving 'cause they were so scared...by evening, when they thought it was safe to leave, they moved out...swam across the Forrest River and travelled all the next day and then the day after until the evening until they reached the mission where they knew they'd be safe...I was playing with the other girls...when Loorabane came...She was shaking with fright...She told <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> and we told Mamma (Angelina Noble) and Mamma told Jim (Reverend James Noble) and he told old Gribble.|$|E

Research goes on because we don’t know everything.

5000|$|Duggan's {{family did}} not believe that the police have been honest about the shooting, and have {{pressured}} the police and IPCC for greater transparency. Duggan's sister, Paulette Hall, has stated: [...] "We want justice. We want them to come clean and tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> The police are human like us. If you kill someone, you should do the time, just like we would have to do." [...] Hall has reiterated concerns about media portrayals, and produced her own film titled The Real Story of Mark Duggan.|$|E

On the next page, the lyrics are shown, giving the listener the details behind the story. On this particular track, the man goes insane, thinks he's a tiger, and kills a dog. The story precedes the song itself, but also tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to the man.|$|E

5000|$|While Mozumdar's {{teaching}} is popular ... it shows <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when a thinker immersed in Hindu lore completely accepts a world-affirming position. <b>What</b> <b>happens</b> is an {{identification of the}} Hindu conception of a divine universal Self with the Hebrew conception of a divine creative power. To Mozumdar the ultimate God is not uncreative bliss, as {{in the view of}} Sankara, but creative power, as in the Hebrew tradition. Yet this creative Power, he declares, {{is the same as the}} universal Self. Here the universal Self, we should note, is not a finite Ideal, as in Greek philosophy, but the infinite Substance of the world.|$|R

5000|$|Huntingtower {{is said to}} be {{haunted by}} [...] "Lady Greensleeves", a young woman named Dorothea who was the {{daughter}} of the 1st Earl of Gowrie. The legend states that {{she was in love with}} a servant at the castle and that the two used to have clandestine meetings at night in the eastern tower, where the servants slept. One night the girl's mother, the Countess, is supposed to have discovered what was going on and made her way across the bridge from the family's quarters in the western tower to the eastern tower to catch the pair. Dorothea heard her mother's footsteps on the bridge and, unable to return to the other tower by that route, made her way to the roof. Here she leapt from the tower to land safely on the battlements of the western tower and so return to bed where she was discovered by her mother. The distance between the towers was several metres and thus she accomplished quite a feat in leaping the distance. The following day the girl and her lover eloped and no records exist to tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to them.|$|E
5000|$|In The Last Battle, Susan is {{conspicuous}} by her absence. Peter {{says that}} she is [...] "no longer a friend of Narnia", and (in Jill Pole's words) [...] "she's interested in nothing now-a-days except nylons and lipstick and invitations." [...] Similarly, Eustace Scrubb quotes her as saying, [...] "What wonderful memories you have! Fancy you still thinking about all those funny games {{we used to play}} when we were children," [...] and Polly Plummer adds, [...] "She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all {{the rest of her life}} trying to stay that age. Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can." [...] Thus, Susan does not enter the real Narnia with the others at the end of the series. It is left ambiguous whether Susan's absence is permanent, especially since Lewis stated elsewhere that: The books don't tell <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Susan. She is left alive in this world at the end, having by then turned into a rather silly, conceited young woman. But there's plenty of time for her to mend and perhaps she will get to Aslan's country in the end... in her own way.|$|E
