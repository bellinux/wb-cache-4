Soon afterwards, he surveyed the area chosen as a port to become the town of Normanton. The country was difficult for conventional railway tracks due to flooding, lack of suitable timber and voracious termites. In 1884 Phillips patented a system for taking railways across such country which utilised special <b>U</b> <b>section</b> steel sleepers laid directly on the ground. During floods the line could be submerged without washing out the ballast and embankments normally used, so that it could quickly be put back into service when the waters subsided. The steel sleepers were also impervious to termite attack, and although initially more expensive than timber sleepers, were cheaper to lay and maintain. It was this system that was specified for the Normanton to Croydon line and Phillips was engaged to supervise the construction. After the railway was completed he maintained an interest in the area, serving as Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Carpentaria, inspecting artesian bores and writing a report on ports and railways in 1909.|$|E

The optimum conditions for the assay were determined. The calibration curve is linear up to about three micrograms of uranium; the lowest limit of detection is about twenty nanograms (about 0. 10 microgram/g of sample). Routine alpha and beta counting of samples was developed. Section II: The forms of naturally occurring data distributions are discussed, and customary methods of examining these noted, together with their defects. A versatile computer programme was developed to determine the form of natural distributions, and to calculate correlation coefficients and their significances. Section III: An orientation survey of a known mineralised area in the Buller Gorge of New Zealand showed that C. australis, N. fusca, Q. acutifolia, and W. racemosa are suitable for biogeochemical prospecting for uranium. Analysis figures were more nearly log-normally distributed than normally distributed, and multiple distributions were often present. Alpha counts of plant material also proved suitable as indicators {{of the amount of}} uranium in the soil, as did the amount of iron in the leaves. Section IV: Aquatic bryophytes from streams draining mineralised areas were analysed and the results found to be indicative of the presence or otherwise of uranium in the various catchment areas. Even better was the use of specially prepared peat, allowed to soak in the stream water. The accumulation factor for uranium, from stream water, was about ten thousand. Section V: The gamma-ray spectra of plants and soils were carefully characterised by solvent extraction, and ion-exchange techniques. Plants were found to absorb radium and uranium and lead, but not thorium. B. procerum, and M. berteroana, however absorbed both thorium and actinium. Calculation showed that most of the alpha particles emitted by the samples studied were from 238 <b>U.</b> <b>Section</b> VI: Extraction and characterisation of uranium complexes in C. australis leaves showed the presence of a protein-uranium complex, and an RNA-uranium complex.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Çelik yapılarda mühendislik tasarımı ve paket programlar önemli bir yer tutmaktadır. Mühendislik tasarımı sırasında yönetmelikler mühendislere yol gösterici durumundadır. Mevcut yönetmelikler farklı tasarım prensiplerine dayanmakla birlikte hepsinin amacı hizmet süreci içinde insanların can güvenliğini sağlamaktır. Günümüzde yapıların boyutlandırmasında iki temel ilke vardır. Bunlar son yüzyıl süresinde kullanılan emniyet gerilmesi ilkesi, diğeri son otuz yılda yapılan olasılık teorisine dayanan yük ve dayanım ilkesidir. Yüksek lisans tezi olarak sunulan bu çalışmada, uzun doğrultuda merkezi çaprazlı çelik sistem, kısa doğrultuda çerçeve sistem olarak tanımlanmış süneklik düzeyi normal ağır sanayii yapısının, AISC 360 - 10 (American Institute of Steel Construction) ve TS- 648 ’e (Çelik Yapıların Hesap ve Yapım Kuralları) göre SAP 2000 programının çubuk gerilme analizleri incelenmiştir İnşaat mühendislerinin amacı yapıların tasarımının yanı sıra tasarladıkları yapıların maliyetini düşürmektedir. Yapılan bu tez çalışmasında emniyet gerilmesi ilkesi ile yük ve dayanım ilkesi karşılaştırılarak optimum sonuca hangi yönetmeliğin yakın olduğunu gösterilmektedir. Taşıyıcı sistem modeli boyutlandırmasında düşey ve yatay değerleri sabit tutulup AISC 360 - 10 kapsamında bulunan LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor), ASD (Allowable Stress Design) ve TS- 648 yönetmeliklerine öngördüğü kombinasyonlar kullanılarak analizler yapılmıştır. Düşey yük ve rüzgar yükleri için TS- 498 yönetmeliği kullanılmıştır. Deprem yükünün belirlenmesinde ASCE 7 - 10 ve DBYBHY- 2007 yönetmelikleri kullanılmıştır. Engineering {{design and}} {{programmes}} are vital process in steel structures. In this duration of engineering desing many codes are guiding to engineers. Although existing design codes based on different design principles, all the design code’s {{aim is to}} ensure life safety. There are two basic principles in design of structure. One of them is allowable stress design {{and the other is}} load and resistance factor that is based on probability theory. In this study, which is presented as a M. Sc. thesis, in the long direction concentrically braced frame, in the short direction moment frame is defined as nominal ductility level heavy industry structure. AISC 360 - 10 and TS- 648 design codes are used to examine SAP 2000 stress analysis. One of the aim of civil engineers is not only design of buildings but also reducing the cost of the buildings. In this thesis allowable stress design and load and resistance factor design compared to which is closed to optimal results. In the design of structural model, vertical and horizontal loads kept constant and LRFD (load and resistance factor), ASD (allowable stress design) and TS- 648 code’s combinations are used to analyse structure. TS- 498 code is used for vertical load and wind load. Determination of seismic loads ASCE 7 - 10 and DBYBHY- 2007 codes are used. The internal forces of the frame elements located in the SAP 2000 program, AISC 360 - 10 (LRFD), AISC 360 - 10 (ASD) and TS- 648 according to the regulations of stress in the frame elements are compared. When we examine capacity ratio of frames, LRFD and ASD design criteria in sizing results are too close but according to TS- 648 design criteria, we need to change frame section. This case will cause move away from economy and increase the cost of building. Wind loads in the load analysis was calculated according to the principles of TS- 648. Earthquake loads carried by the AISC 341 - 10 code and DBYBHY 2007 code and the results are quite close. Because our infrastructure and existing regulations for snow accumulation of clutter in our profit calculation methods related to the lack of a clear account. Snow accumulation UBC- 97 was performed according to regulations. We used DIN 120 regulation to design crane girders [...] The reason that to use this regulation, especially occurring at constant load is to consider the effects of fatigue. As a result of these studies, some shortcoming appeared in T- 648 code. If we summarize briefly; Though main loads and extra loads for resistance strength identified, the combinations that should be used in sizing aren’t mentioned. There are normal ductility and high ductility definitions in earthquake regulations so as to be used in earthquake analysis of steel contructions. This classification is made by the energy would be swallowed in earthquake. This classification effects reduction factor of earthquake load and earthquake effect decrease at that rate. Besides ductility level, cross-sectional dimentions are defined and slenderness upper limits are identified. When viewed from this aspect, existing TS- 648 seems inadequated. Slenderness upper limits exist for only build-up section based on web and flange section dimentions. In TS- 648 article 2. 4. 2. 4, displacement information given but this information provide nowadays needs. When service quality taken into consideration, it’s observed that constructional users aren’t disturbed by vibration or ascillation and there hasn’t been deformation,vibrations or ascillation in the level to damage components of architectural details Defined from the point of local buckling of differences between compact and non-compact are important in plate girders. In this elements that not carry seismic load AISC 360 - 10 code permit sizing compact and non-compact sections. However, that difference doesn’t in TS- 648 code. When we examine AISC 360 - 10 code we observe that all kinds of section types (I section, <b>U</b> <b>section,</b> pipe section, box section) has different capacity calculations. Even for some sections types the stresses formulas can change. When we analyse TS- 648 unfortunately we can’t see that difference. Its extent is rather limited considering AISC 360 - 10. We clearly see that; TS 648 code that we currently use is behind our nowadays conditions and engineering experiences. TS- 648 code which is technically insufficient; is supposed to be reviewed again as part of nowadays technology, information and construction rules. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
