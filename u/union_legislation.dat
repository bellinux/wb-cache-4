25|$|National {{courts are}} thus by their nature the first guarantors of Union law. To ensure the {{effective}} and uniform application of <b>Union</b> <b>legislation</b> {{and to prevent}} divergent interpretations, national courts may, and sometimes must, turn to the Court of Justice and ask that it clarify a point concerning the interpretation of Union law, in order, for example, to ascertain whether their national legislation complies with that law. Petitions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling are described in Article 267 (ex Article 234) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|As an MP Hughes {{worked on}} trade <b>union</b> <b>legislation,</b> {{but was not}} in a {{position}} to have major changes passed. He had greater success in improving the legal position of co-operatives, which in particular became able to operate as a limited company. The issue of legal obstacles to the operation of labour unions was topical, and in 1867 Hughes was made a member of a Royal Commission set up to consider the matter. Initially he was the only one on the committee sympathetic to the union point of view; after some lobbying he was joined by Frederic Harrison, and a concession was made to union representatives, allowing them observer places in the proceedings. Hughes then worked with Harrison and Robert Applegarth to diminish the effect of some of the testimony from employers.|$|E

[...] The farmers, fishers, and miners who formed the backbone of the movement had little access to credit before the Great Depression, and lost what little they had as the downturn started to bite. With the help of Roy Bergengren and the American credit union movement, Nova Scotia passed the first sound credit <b>union</b> <b>legislation</b> in English Canada in 1932.|$|E

The opposition Nationalist Party leader Simon Busuttil responded by stating that though the Government was attempting to use the issue of same-sex marriage to distract from a government scandal, he could foresee no difficulty in amending Malta's civil <b>union</b> <b>legislation</b> of 2014 to legalise same-sex marriage. The country's leading gay rights organisation subsequently called for a bill to be put forward opening up marriage to all couples irrespective of gender without delay.|$|E

This permits direct connections to outside Spain through the link to the French network at the Perthus tunnel. AVE trains are operated by Renfe, but private companies may be allowed to operate trains in the future using other brands, in accordance with European <b>Union</b> <b>legislation.</b> Some TGV-derived trains used to run on the broad-gauge network at slower speeds, but these were branded separately as Euromed until new rolling stock was commissioned for these services.|$|E

Until 1945, however, the labour movement remained weak, impeded by lack of legal rights, anti-union legislation, management-organized factory councils, and political divisions between “cooperative” and radical unionists. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the US Occupation authorities initially encouraged the formation of independent <b>unions.</b> <b>Legislation</b> was passed that enshrined the right to organize, and membership rapidly rose to 5 million by February 1947. The organization rate peaked at 55.8% of all workers in 1949 and subsequently declined to 18.5% as of 2010.|$|R
