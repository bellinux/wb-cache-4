2500|$|Action Park's most {{successful}} years were the mid-1980s. Most rides were still open, and the park's later reputation for danger {{had not yet}} developed. In 1982, the deaths of two visitors {{within a week of}} each other and ensuing permanent closure of one ride took place, but that hardly dampened the flow of crowds. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in summer 1984 and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the lawsuits. A state investigation of improprieties in the leasing of state land to the park led to a 110-count grand jury indictment against the nine related companies that ran it and their executives for operating an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>insurance</b> company. Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; head Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five insurance fraud-related charges. [...] Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper.|$|E

50|$|Some {{states have}} tried to block health care sharing {{ministries}} {{on the grounds that}} they are selling <b>unauthorized</b> <b>insurance.</b> A majority of states, however, have enacted safe harbor laws specifying that the ministries are not insurance and do not need to be regulated as such. However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issues exemption letters to ministries that have met the criteria to operate independently of the Affordable Care Act.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Grids {{are large}} {{distributed}} systems composed of resources of many computing systems used {{to resolve problems}} that require heavy computations on large amount of data. In such a large distributed system, ensuring information integrity is of particular importance. Honest users and possible malicious entities live together in this network, the risks of unauthorized alterations of data and information cannot be ignored. Since large amount of data are stored on Grid’s resources, insurance has to be given that data are not altered by <b>unauthorized</b> hands. This <b>insurance</b> is given by the security service called integrity of passive data. A guarantee must also be given that the asked computation are executed in the right way, {{in order to produce}} output data that are trustworthy. This guarantee is given by the security service called integrity of active data. We analyze in this paper these integrity concerns and, in particular, we identify the needs when considering privacy aspects of passive data. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the integrity of active data where we propose a Grid’s adapted framework to ensure the integrity of these active data. Key-Words:- Grid security, integrity, privacy...|$|R
