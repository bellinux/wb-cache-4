6000|$|The road {{on which}} we walked was weedy with infant fir-trees, {{an inch or two}} high; and now, on our left hand, came before us a most {{tremendous}} precipice of yellow and black rock, called the Rehberg, that is, the Mountain of the Roe. Now again is nothing but firs and pines above, below, around us! How awful is the deep unison of their <b>undividable</b> murmur; what a one thing it is--it is a sound that impresses the dim notion of the Omnipresent! In various parts of the deep vale below us, we beheld little dancing waterfalls gleaming through the branches, and now, on our left hand, from the very summit of the hill above us, a powerful stream flung itself down, leaping and foaming, and now concealed, and now not concealed, and now half concealed by the fir-trees, till, towards the road, it became a visible sheet of water, within whose immediate neighbourhood no pine could have permanent abiding place. The snow lay every where {{on the sides of the}} roads, and glimmered in company with the waterfall foam, snow patches and waterbreaks glimmering through the branches in the hill above, the deep basin below, and the hill opposite. Over the high opposite hills, so dark in their pine forests, a far higher round barren stony mountain looked in upon the prospect from a distant country. Through this scenery we passed on, till our road was crossed by a second waterfall, or rather, aggregation of little dancing waterfalls, one by the side of the other for a considerable breadth, and all came at once out of the dark wood above, and rolled over the mossy rock fragments, little firs, growing in islets, scattered among them. The same scenery continued till we came to the Oder Seich, a lake, half made by man, and half by nature. It is two miles in length, and but a few hundred yards in breadth, and winds between banks, or rather through walls, of pine trees. It has the appearance of a most calm and majestic river. It crosses the road, goes into a wood, and there at once plunges itself down into a most magnificent cascade, and runs into the vale, to which it gives the name of the [...] "Vale of the Roaring Brook." [...] We descended into the vale, and stood at the bottom of the cascade, and climbed up again by its side. The rocks over which it plunged were unusually wild in their shape, giving fantastic resemblances of men and animals, and the fir-boughs by the side were kept almost in a swing, which unruly motion contrasted well with the stern quietness of the huge forest-sea every where else.|$|E

5000|$|In the Mali Empire, an evident {{example of}} oral {{history is the}} Sunjata Keita or Sundiata Keita story. The Sunjata Keita story remains a strong {{representation}} of oral history. Because there are a plethora of versions of the Sunjata story, this exemplifies how oral history can change slightly depending on the griot reciting the history. Also, oral history {{can be traced back}} to Sunjata because in the story Sunjata’s griots play a major part to his success. Bamba Suso in his version of Sunjata writes: [...] After that had happened they went into the circumcision shed. After they had come out of there, It was not long before his father died. Sunjata announced, ‘As for myself, However extensive my father’s property may be, [...] I want no part of it except the griots.’ They asked him, ‘Do you want the griots?’ They said, Leave it; [...] A person who has nothing will not have griots for long.’ The griots said, ‘Since he has let all his inheritance go, [...] And says that it is only us that he wants, We will not abandon him. If he does not die, we shall not desert him.’ The griots were at his side. [...] Suso’s story of Sunjata shows how griots often remain within the family lineage. When Sunjata’s father died, like other parts of his father’s estate, Sunjata was able to choose griots from his father’s estate as well. The Sunjata story shows that in the Mali Empire, noble families needed griots in order to spread family history. Sunjata states, “I want no part of it property except the griots”. Sunjata’s need for a griot emphasizes how noble families and griots were often seen as <b>undividable.</b> In the Mali Empire, griots were associated with noble families because such families needed oral historians to accompany them in order to tell the history of their life. Emperors and great warriors often had griots and with such griots, oral history in Mali spreads. The oral historians who were “assigned” to or rather “chosen” for a family were set to remain loyal to that family for life. Loyalty was an important quality a griot must have. In Suso’s version of the Sunjata story says: “We griots will not abandon him”. In the Mali Empire, the bond between griots and the emperor, warrior-king, or family they served was meant to be a lifelong bond. In Sunjata, Sunjata’s griot, Bala Faaseega Kuyate acted as both the oral historian for Sunjata and his advisor at times. Throughout Suso’s version of Sunjata, Bala Faaseega Kuyate accompanies Sunjata. Suso writes: [...] "A day will come When bush fowls will lay their eggs on the site of your deserted town. He says here is your gold.’ When he had done that, Sunjata buried his mother; [...] Then he and Nyakhaleng Juma Suukho, And his younger brother, And Bala Faaseega Kuyate Rose up and went. When he and Bala Faaseega Kuyate were on their way, They had gone far into the bush, And they had been travelling for a long time when Bala said, ‘I Am terribly hungry.’ Sunjata said, ‘Wait here.’ He went into a clump of thick bush, He examined the calf of his leg where there was plenty of flesh and he cut some off. When he had cut it into thin strips, he cooked it, Then he pounded the leaves of a medicinal shrub and then tied up his leg, He came back, And he said to Bala, ‘Here is some meat’".The relationship between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate describes the relationship between oral historians and emperors or aristocrats in the Mali Empire. Sunjata was very protective of Kuyate, in turn; Kuyate was extremely loyal to Sunjata. It is the job of the griots to be loyal to the family or person they “work” for. Griots did not merely work for the nobility, griots in the Mali Empire also worked for villages. Such griots were used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the village.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} a unique 2003 survey dataset to analyse the {{developments}} in {{land use and}} exchange in Bulgaria. The survey analysis yields several results. Land is highly fragmented in Bulgaria which increases {{the need for an}} efficient exchange of land between owners and users of land. However, the land sales market is not well developed. In contrast, land rental agreements are very widespread. Land rental is widely used to exchange land between owners and users of the land. The users include a variety of farm types, including cooperatives, farming companies, and individual farms. While land titles are distributed and land plots clearly defined and delineated, an important property rights problem exists under the form of so-called "co-ownership". By law, certain plots are <b>undividable</b> among heirs because the plot size after division would fall under the imposed minimum plot size. Our estimation results show that co-ownership has a major impact on land use and allocation. Land under co-ownership and which is <b>undividable</b> by law, {{is more likely to be}} left abandoned or used by large enterprises - the default users of land given the history of land use in Bulgaria - compared to owner-cultivation or renting out to another household. Our analysis shows that solving co-ownership problems would not only stimulate efficient land allocation which in turn affects the household's welfare level. Land that is cultivated by the household or rented to an other household contributes more to its welfare than land that is rented to a cooperative or left abandoned.

30|$|The higher-order factor {{structure}} of the TEAP test, as hypothesized above, is generally consistent with the literature on the structure of L 2 language ability. Research in this area dates back to Oller’s (1983) unitary trait hypothesis. Based on the principal component analysis of placement test data consisting of composition, vocabulary, grammar, phonology, and dictation, he stated that language proficiency was unitary and <b>undividable</b> into different skills and that it could be measured in its entirety, using cloze and dictation tests. A series of subsequent studies using confirmatory factor analysis, however, rejected the unitary trait hypothesis. For example, Bachman and Palmer (1982) analyzed three types of tests designed to measure grammatical, pragmatic, and sociolinguistic abilities and found that L 2 ability was best explained by a higher-order model, with a general ability presiding over some specific first-order abilities. The higher-order model was also shown to best represent L 2 ability in Bachman and Palmer (1989), Llosa (2007), Sawaki (2007), Sawaki et al. (2009), and Shin (2005).|$|E

40|$|Descartes {{argued that}} productivity, namely {{our ability to}} {{generate}} an unlimited number of new thoughts or ideas from previous ones, derives from a single <b>undividable</b> source in the human soul.

In this article, we will address recent evidence concerning the single source hypothesis from brain-imaging studies, linguistics, cognitive theories of music perception, biology of cognition and cognitive development, along with several objections that have been presented against this hypothesis.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{usage of}} renewable energy sources implies, because of their local and time dependant stochastically behaviour, a decentralised supply structure. Thereby, the different possibilities {{of renewable energy}} converter are to be combined {{with respect to their}} complementary character, resulting in so-called hybrid systems. But it would not be possible to build up a more effective, rational, and as far as possible renewable future energy supply system and structure, without a consequent integration of the transport and traffic technology. Most important for this is a complex and interconnected view of these problems as one whole <b>undividable</b> unit. Because of the different stochastically and dynamical behaviour, it seems to be unavoidable for such supply systems to integrate sufficient energy storage capacities. A careful dimensioning of hybrid systems and their interconnections can help to reduce these capacities to an absolute minimum only for security. A special capacity would be necessary to cover the peak power short-time demands, in order to avoid an over dimensioning of the hybrid system converter. In this case electric vehicles could serve as (additional) storage capacities, if they were not used for driving...|$|E

(Liturgics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. λειτουργία denotes all the {{religious}} acts {{and activities of}} worship performed by Christians during the worship service and in life. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the nature of the interactive relationship between the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of a Scripture driven life. The central theoretical argument of the study was that this relationship is dynamic and transforming. Basic theoretical perspectives were formulated in Section A. The comprehensive conclusion attained in this section was that the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of life is an <b>undividable</b> unit consisting of differentiate elements. Meta-theoretical perspectives were formulated in Section B. These principles were drawn from research done relating to postmodernism, the effects of the post- 94 transformation in South Africa on previously advantaged South African Christians and empirical research. The perspectives indicated that the praxis of life impacted directly on the liturgy of the worship service. The conclusions reached in both Sections A and B lead to the final conclusion that the nature of the interactive relationship between the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of life is dynamic and transforming. It was further indicated by the research that the interactive relationship between the liturgy of the worship service and the liturgy of life reflected the broken reality of our sin-corrupted world. Hence an adjusted practical theory and accompanying practical theoretical model were developed to aid the alignment of the praxis as indicated by the meta-theoretical perspectives with the Scriptural ideal purported by the basis theoretical principles.

40|$|Switch-Reference (SR) is a {{phenomenon}} in which the coreferentiality of two (or more) subjects in a complex sentence is indicated by a morphological device. The purpose of this dissertation is to discuss recent work which deals with SR within the Government and Binding Theory, and propose an alternative analysis to it. The framework I will adopt for such an alternative analysis of SR is Categorial Grammar. A basic notion underlying Categorial Grammar is that an expression is divided into a functor and an argument, and each functor and argument are further divided into a functor and an argument until the division reaches to an <b>undividable</b> element. Given the assumptions that a functor and its argument must be compatible and that a functor has some subcategorization properties, I argue that "Agreement" phenomenon (subsuming agreement and disagreement) can be handled insightfully. Furthermore, I propose that such a treatment of "Agreement" can be extended to SR systems in general if we consider the "same subject" and "different subject" phenomena as cases of agreement and disagreement, respectively. I claim that a composite in which a SR morpheme appears forms a functor which takes another composite as its argument, and that {{the relation between the}} functor and its argument and the relation between some parts of the functor and its argument are characterized as "agreement" or "disagreement": The functor and the argument must be compatible as assumed above, and the nature of compatibility (whether "agreement" or "disagreement") is controlled by the subcategorization properties of the SR morpheme associated with the functor (i. e., if "same subject", the relation is agreement, and if "different subject", it is disagreement). By treating SR in this fashion, I intend to provide a unified analysis for apparently different SR systems in three diverse languages, namely, Tairora, Hopi, and Warlpiri...|$|E

In the second part sumarises the overview of to date disponible knowledge of neurosciences, evolutional psychiatry, functional neuroanatomy, biopsychiatry and biocybernetics, needed for pedagogical use. The important point is the question of interaction between genoms and environment. Third: we apply the displayed above into the pedagogy with the aim to prevent children of trangeneration transmission of psycho- and sociopathology and for purpose of subclinical pedagogical intervention as well as resocialisation to help to maladapted individuals. This should be understood as a contribution to prevention efforts of world wide spreading psychopathology epidemy. The textbook offers to the reader an inovative view on the principle of the neurons population organisation on the basis of AND/OR logic function of a single neuron and feedback loops iterative decision making [executive] system. And finally, the textbook connects into single <b>undividable</b> system the brain and body, where body plays a master and brain a slave role. The brain does static and dynamic correlation analysis of external and internal sensory signals on the base of weight coefficients. The very important and new discovered role is that one of neuromodulation and neuromodulators. The key question, the textbook is searching the answer of, is, how the brain is learning and thus how to teach it as best as possible. The discovery is, the brain does work rather than a memory medium as a passive by experience programable filter. The body is recognised as a substantial part of this kind of memory and processing as well. The synthesis is finalised by the case study of hazard of stiring up a schizophrenia by a child aproximately two years old. The general conclusion is, the (probably) found fundamental principle of the organisation of the brain hardware and mental information processing functions and it´s application into the effective upbringing and education of a child. At the same end of the textbook we present a case study of pedagogical psychotherapy of a young, 20 years old blind, extremely anxious maladapted schoolboy Ondra. This is to be understood as an experimental evidence of efficiency of neuropedagogy approach in the everyday life. Main ideas: 1. The computation does not only the brain, but organism - brain and soma feedback interaction. 2. The generation of the response to the environmental asks goes through an iteration. 3. The iteration can converge to the atractor or diverge - in case of mental disorder. 4. The divergency can be oscilating or linearly shifting - cognitive bias. 5. The organism information processing is labile if not anchored to the outer reference point. 6. Neuromodulators are means, how the soma changes weights on synapses and controlls the iterative process. 7. In this sense the soma {{is a part of the}} memory system - so called functional memory. 8.

40|$|The {{exhibition}} disseminates {{the research}} results coming forth from a 11 days design-research workshop (25 Ferbuary 2016 - 6 March 2016) {{with an international}} group of master students at Politecnico di Milano. On a site adjacent to the campus of Politecnico di Milano, the following topics have been thoroughly investigated by design: Tactic 1 : The Perspective Hinge The basic tactic of this workshop starts from a critical reflection on the operational methods in the conception of architecture. Through an intensive process of making, this MIAW 2016 Workshop explores new avenues that attempt to break through habitual ways of seeing the conception of architecture as it aims for the generation of new space, and more specifically how this happens through the intensive dialectics between this space and its architectural detail. Alberto Pérez-Gòmez and Louise Pelletier (Pérez-Gòmez and Pelletier 1997) elaborate {{on the impact of}} tools of representation on the conceptual development of architectural space and form. “Writing from inside the discipline of architecture, rather than from the more common extrapolations from the history of painting and philosophy, Alberto Pérez-Gómez and Louise Pelletier focus on the implications of the tool of perspective (and the hegemony of vision) for architectural representation. Their primary thesis is that tools of representation have a direct influence on the conceptual development of projects and generation of forms, and that there are alternatives to the reductive working methods of most contemporary practice … The authors' ultimate aim is to probe the possibilities of the constructed world—that is, architecture—as a poetic translation, rather than prosaic transcription, of its representations” (outtake from the synopsis of the book, provided by the publisher). Rather than starting from tested ‘methods’ widely applied in architecture, that start from the level of urban design with its extensive surveys of cities through the application of the plan (or the map), this workshop experimentally starts from the intimate architectural fragment that is represented as a vertical section. From there, the plan is seen as the derivative of the section, and not the other way round. This is the moment where/when the perspective hinge is at work, the moment when two dimensional survey erects into the three dimensional representation of the imagined space and its beloved material detail. This representation works through the vertical depth of the architectural section as the ultimate instrument of the architect in his process of architectural creation. References: Pérez-Gòmez, A., and Pelletier, L. (1997), Architectural Representation and the Perspective Hinge, MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts and London, England. Tactic 2 : sequence of perceptions: storyboard In a first design cycle, the students investigate the site through observations from their eye level through making a sequence of perceptions that are consciously made as a serial view of vertical sections. These are made through the method of the storyboard, a method architecture can borrow from cinematography. It includes the conscious framing of views, positioning these views in a sequence, and critically assessing these views and their sequence in order to discover their potential and to define a point of preference in the site (see below). The students make the aforementioned observations from the eye level through serial sketching, making photographs and discussing their observations in small groups. The verticality of the observation is crucial, and the registration through sketching and making photographs happens mainly through the frontal view as section or elevation. Tactic 3 : the fragment as point of (p) reference The point of preference, once defined and situated, subsequently also becomes the point of reference, around which the design process evolves into a new architectural fragment. The architectural fragment is situated between the whole of the architectural body and the architectural detail, hence it is strategically positioned to penetrate into the macro and micro scales of architectural conception. Hence the architectural fragment is the strategic scale from where the full span from techné to poiesis can be investigated. Tactic 4 : the poetics of the technics of architectural detail This MIAW 2016 Workshop methodically is atypical in that it does not apply the traditional funnel design approach that starts from the urban scale and subsequently comes down to the scale of architecture to finally end up in the scale of the architectural detail that has to be ‘technically resolved’ in the end. Rather, the method applied here starts from the acknowledgment of the poetic capacities of the architectural detail. It can be explored and developed through the technical mastery of the architect who is the master builder, capable of seamlessly putting his technical mastery at the service of his/her beloved poetics. Hence, the architect should and can be able to span the full stretch from technics to poetics. Techné and Poiesis coexist in this <b>undividable</b> moment of architectural intensity. Intensity is the key word in architecture, as it is in this MIAW 2016 workshop. status: publishe...|$|E
