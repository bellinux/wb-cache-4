5|$|By {{the end of}} March, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents and preventing Croatian police from intervening. In early April, {{the leaders of the}} Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control,</b> known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuks were {{advancing}} towards al-Jazira, and {{the descendants}} of Qatada ibn Idris fought with their Ayyubid overlords over control of Mecca. The conflict between them was taken advantage of by the Rasulids of Yemen who attempted to end Ayyubid suzerainty in the Hejaz and bring the region <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control</b> which they accomplished in 1238 when Nur al-Din Umar captured Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble a deck of five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and {{four corners of the}} card, and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, that card is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point values, with the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control,</b> with a draw occurring if they have the same number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control,</b> they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxons, who {{are known}} to have {{included}} Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century.

5|$|The Superbas lodged a {{complaint}} against the Reds, claiming that Kelley was still <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control,</b> seeking compensation from the Reds.

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements {{from the}} colonial headquarters at Batavia, the Dutch launched an attack in 1635 {{and were able}} to crush opposition and bring the area around present-day Tainan fully <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> After seeing Mattau and Soulang, the most powerful villages in the area, defeated so comprehensively, many other villages in the surrounding area came to the Dutch to seek peace and surrender sovereignty. Thus the Dutch were able to dramatically expand the extent of their territorial control in a short time, and avoid the need for further fighting. The campaign ended in February 1636, when representatives from twenty-eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement Dutch sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|After the British invasions {{had been}} repelled, Rosas {{and his family}} moved from Buenos Aires to their estancia (ranch). His work there further shaped his {{character}} and outlook {{as part of the}} Platine region's social establishment. In the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, owners of large landholdings (including the Rosas family) provided food, equipment and protection for families living in areas <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Most of these peons, as such workers were called, were gauchos.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control</b> {{as a way of}} making the family lands book-land and free from secular service. Book-land was at first an exclusive right of ecclesiastical property. By transferring land to a family-controlled monastery, the family would retain the use of the land without having to perform any services to the king for the land.|$|E

50|$|In their later years, however, Northern Qi and Northern Zhou set up {{lots of new}} prefectures to {{represent}} areas that were not <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>controls.</b> For example, Northern Qi set up Guangzhou which were controlled by Chen dynasty and Yizhou which were controlled by Northern Zhou. In the area between Yangtze and Huai rivers, people who ran away to escape from wars in earlier periods started {{to move back to}} their hometowns. However, many of their original hometowns were destroyed completely. As a result, people from the same town gathered and established new towns and named those towns with original names. This led to the situation that many towns with the same name were established. For example, within Luozhou and Yuzhou, there were multiple counties named Chenliu.|$|R
30|$|Ultimately, by {{fighting}} to maintain local resources <b>under</b> <b>their</b> immediate <b>control,</b> pastoralists seek reliability in an inherently unpredictable and competitive global world.

Shortly after arriving Jetfire becomes mortally wounded by Starscream and sacrifices himself to give Optimus power to defeat The Fallen.

Megatron and Starscream get sucked into a space bridge, which transports them to The Fallen's throne room. At {{the end of the}} game, the Autobots rebuild the destroyed pyramid, and Megatron and Starscream observe the creation of a massive Decepticon army now <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

5|$|The peoples {{known to}} us as the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in {{southern}} and eastern Britain, and {{by the beginning of}} the seventh century, southern England was almost entirely <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> Tytila was a member of the Wuffingas family, the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of the East Angles that was named after his father Wuffa. The Wuffingas may have been descendants of an earlier Scandinavian dynasty. Both he and his father are semi-historical figures.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of 1991 saw the fiercest {{fighting}} of the war, as the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. The Battle of Vukovar ended on 18 November, when the JNA captured the city after nearly three months of fighting. At the same time, Croatian Serb authorities began systematically expelling non-Serb civilians from areas <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control.</b> The expulsions {{in the area of}} eastern Slavonia were primarily motivated by the aim of changing the ethnic composition in favour of Serbs as well as the resettling of Serb refugees who had fled western Slavonia following Operation Swath-10 by the Croatian Army.|$|E
5|$|Turan-Shah {{drove out}} the Hamdanid rulers of Sana'a, conquering the mountainous city in 1175. With {{the conquest of}} Yemen, the Ayyubids {{developed}} a coastal fleet, al-asakir al-bahriyya, which they used to guard the sea coasts <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>control</b> and protect them from pirate raids. The conquest held great significance for Yemen because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana'a) under a single power. However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in Yemen in 1176, uprisings {{broke out in the}} territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of Yemen.|$|E

50|$|Ethics {{can thus}} {{be viewed as a}} lever but one that rests on a moral fulcrum of {{pre-existing}} assumptions, like the bodies of the beings in conflict, placed there by circumstances, environments, situations, mostly out of <b>their</b> <b>control</b> - only the choice of resolution is <b>under</b> <b>their</b> own <b>control.</b> When the environment or context has some status in the decision, as in ecological ethics, there {{is said to be a}} situated ethics.
