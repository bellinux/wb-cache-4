5000|$|UCNPs {{have been}} {{integrated}} into solar panels {{to broaden the}} spectrum of sunlight that can be captured and converted into electricity. The maximum output of a solar cell is dictated {{in part by the}} fraction of incident photons captured to promote electrons. Solar cells can only absorb and convert photons with energy equal to or greater than the bandgap. Any incident photon with energy smaller than the bandgap is lost. UCNPs can capture this wasted sunlight by combining multiple low energy IR photons into a single high energy photon. The emitted photon will have sufficient energy to promote charge carriers across the band gap. UCNPs can be integrated into solar cell systems of a number of different classes and in multiple forms. For example, UCNPs can be laminated onto the back sides of semiconductors as a film, to collect low energy light and <b>upconvert</b> it. Such a treatment generated a 37% efficiency for upconverted light. Another strategy is to disperse the nanoparticles throughout a highly porous material. In one device architecture, UCNPs are infiltrated into a titania micro-scaffold. More titania is added to embed the UCNPs, UCNPs have also been used in dye-sensitized cells.|$|E

Since they can convert the low energy photons (NIR light) into the high energy ones (visible light), the enhanced solar energy generation of DSSCs can be obtained due to the increased visible light absorption in dyes [12 – 14].

Early works on infrared upconversion are reviewed. The development of applications is discussed as to astronomical spectroscopy and infrared image upconversion involving either angular or positional resolution elements.
