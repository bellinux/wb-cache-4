25|$|The term of post bureaucratic is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>senses</b> in the {{organizational}} literature: one generic and one much more specific. In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic {{is often used}} to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber's ideal type bureaucracy. This may include total quality management, culture management and matrix management, amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber's rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies, rather than a fundamental shift away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at 'Tech' argued that 'the essence of bureaucratic control - the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations - does not change in principle.....it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization's culture'.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{specific}} Chinese {{word for}} a city wall is Chéngqiáng (城墙), which can be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>senses</b> in the modern Chinese language. It broadly refers to all defensive walls, including the Great Wall of China, as well as similar defensive structures in areas outside of China such as Hadrian's Wall. More specifically Chengqiang refers to defensive walls built around a city or town. However in classical Chinese, the character Chéng (城) denoted the defensive wall of the [...] "inner city" [...] which housed government buildings. The character Guō (郭) denoted the defensive wall of the [...] "outer city", housing mainly residences. The phrase Chángchéng (長城), literally [...] "the long wall", refers to the Great Wall.|$|E

6000|$|There {{is another}} change of position, {{the value of}} which is not so {{apparent}} to me, as it may well seem to be {{to those who are}} unfamiliar with the subject under discussion. Mr. Gladstone discards his three groups of [...] "water-population," [...] "air-population," [...] and [...] "land-population," [...] and substitutes for them (1) fishes, (2) birds, (3) mammals, (4) man. Moreover, it is assumed, in a note, that [...] "the higher or ordinary mammals" [...] alone were known to the [...] "Mosaic writer" [...] (p. 6). No doubt it looks, at first, as if something {108} were gained by this alteration; for, as I have just pointed out, the word [...] "fishes" [...] can be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>senses,</b> one of which has a deceptive appearance of adjustability to the [...] "Mosaic" [...] account.

6000|$|The word {{success can}} of course be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>senses.</b> It {{may be used}} with {{reference}} to a thing serving its immediate and peculiar purpose, as of a wheel going around; {{or it can be}} used with reference to a thing adding to the general welfare, as of a wheel being a useful discovery. It is one thing to say that Smith's flying machine is a failure, and quite another to say that Smith has failed to make a flying machine. Now this is very broadly the difference between the old English public schools and the new democratic schools. Perhaps the old public schools are (as I personally think they are) ultimately weakening the country rather than strengthening it, and are therefore, in that ultimate sense, inefficient. But {{there is such a thing}} as being efficiently inefficient. You can make your flying ship so that it flies, even if you also make it so that it kills you. Now the public school system may not work satisfactorily, but it works; the public schools may not achieve what we want, but they achieve what they want. The popular elementary schools do not in that sense achieve anything at all. It is very difficult to point to any guttersnipe in the street and say that he embodies the ideal for which popular education has been working, in the sense that the fresh-faced, foolish boy in [...] "Etons" [...] does embody the ideal for which the headmasters of Harrow and Winchester have been working. The aristocratic educationists have the positive purpose of turning out gentlemen, and they do turn out gentlemen, even when they expel them. The popular educationists would say that they had the far nobler idea of turning out citizens. I concede that it is a much nobler idea, but where are the citizens? I know that the boy in [...] "Etons" [...] is stiff with a rather silly and sentimental stoicism, called being a man of the world. I do not fancy that the errand-boy is rigid with that republican stoicism that is called being a citizen. The schoolboy will really say with fresh and innocent hauteur, [...] "I am an English gentleman." [...] I cannot so easily picture the errand-boy drawing up his head to the stars and answering, [...] "Romanus civis sum." [...] Let it be granted that our elementary teachers are teaching the very broadest code of morals, while our great headmasters are teaching only the narrowest code of manners. Let it be granted that both these things are being taught. But only one of them is being learned.|$|E
60|$|If, however, {{practical}} convenience is {{a sufficient}} warrant {{for making the}} main demarcations in our arrangement of objects run in lines not coinciding with any distinction of Kind, and so creating genera and species in the popular sense which are not genera or species in the rigorous sense at all; à fortiori must we be warranted, when our genera and species are real genera and species, in marking the distinction between them by those of their properties which considerations of practical convenience most strongly recommend. If we cut a species out of a given genus—the species man, for instance, out of the genus animal—with an intention on our part that the peculiarity by which {{we are to be}} guided in the application of the name man should be rationality, then rationality is the differentia of the species man. Suppose, however, that being naturalists, we, for the purposes of our particular study, cut out of the genus animal the same species man, but with an intention that the distinction between man and all other species of animal should be, not rationality, but the possession of “four incisors in each jaw, tusks solitary, and erect posture.” It is evident that the word man, when used by us as naturalists, no longer connotes rationality, but connotes the three other properties specified; for that which we have expressly in view when we impose a name, assuredly forms part of the meaning of that name. We may, therefore, lay it down as a maxim, that wherever there is a Genus, and a Species marked out from that genus by an assignable differentia, the name of the species must be connotative, and must connote the differentia; but the connotation may be special—not involved in the signification of the term as ordinarily used, but given to it when employed as a term of art or science. The word Man in common use, connotes rationality and a certain form, but does not connote the number or character of the teeth; in the Linnæan system it connotes the number of incisor and canine teeth, but does not connote rationality nor any particular form. The word man has, therefore, two different meanings; though not commonly considered as ambiguous, because it happens in both cases to denote the same individual objects. But a case is conceivable in which the ambiguity would become evident: we have only to imagine that some new kind of animal were discovered, having Linnæus’s three characteristics of humanity, but not rational, or not of the human form. In ordinary parlance, these animals would not be called men; but in natural history they must still be called so by those, if any there should be, who adhere to the Linnæan classification; and the question would arise, whether the word should continue to be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>senses,</b> or the classification be given up, and the technical sense of the term be abandoned along with it.|$|E

In older classification systems, it refers to a highly paraphyletic group of all the green algae within the green plants (Viridiplantae) and thus includes about 7,000 species of mostly aquatic photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms.
