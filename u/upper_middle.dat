After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese begin to occupy the settlement, and in the ensuing chaos, Jamie is separated from his parents. Jamie's mother shouts at him over the panicked mob to wait at their house and promises that they will come back for him. He spends some time living in his deserted home, but after eating all the food he ventures out into the city.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIndia has {{recently}} witnessed various initiatives that harness {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) to promote electoral reform and political mobilization. These efforts have been initiated mainly by non governmental organizations drawn from India's urban, English-speaking, <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> classes. These efforts have been focused on non-partisan process improvements or short-lived political mobilization with limited success. We analyze these initiatives against the backdrop of modern India's political evolution which has seen the marginalization of <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> classes in politics. We see technology as central to the re-engagement of ICT-savvy <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> classes with the political sphere. We suggest that political neutrality may be an effective and appropriate strategy for India's <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> classes in the pursuit of their policy agendas...|$|R
5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The right lung {{has both}} more lobes and {{segments}} than the left. It {{is divided into}} three lobes, an <b>upper,</b> <b>middle,</b> and a lower, by two fissures, one oblique and one horizontal. The upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the hilum.|$|E
5|$|Highway407 {{begins in}} Burlington within Halton Region at the Freeman Interchange between Highway403 and the QEW, {{from which it}} {{branches}} off northward. The six-lane route passes under Brant Street, <b>Upper</b> <b>Middle</b> Road and Guelph Line (Halton Regional Road1) before it interchanges with Dundas Street (Halton Regional Road5 and former Highway5). It briefly enters greenspace as it curves gently to the northeast, avoiding the nearby Niagara Escarpment. The route is crossed by Walkers Line, east of which residential subdivisions line the south side and greenspace lines the north. At an interchange with Appleby Line (Halton Regional Road20), the highway straightens and travels parallel to Dundas Street before passing over Bronte Creek and under the Canadian National Railway's (CN) Halwest Subdivision.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{this was}} not the case. For most of its history, ain't was {{acceptable}} across many social and regional contexts. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers, and was found in the correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E

Also in this classification was damage to pipe supports along a portion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between the <b>Upper,</b> <b>Middle,</b> and Control Gorge Power Plants southeast of Crowley Lake. Intensity V (Moderate) effects (including cracked windows and broken underground pipes) were present in the Central Valley, Death Valley, and Carson City, Nevada.|$|E
5|$|Running {{parallel}} to the main high street is a leat with a public footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (<b>Upper,</b> <b>Middle</b> and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but {{the south end of}} the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat is no longer in use for powering mills and the Environment Agency is not interested in managing the leat nor keeping it flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore and maintain the Leat in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and food preservation techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and pickling) made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E

Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage.

5|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{eleventh}} century BC, Mari became part of Hana whose king Tukulti-Mer took the title king of Mari and rebelled against Assyria, causing the Assyrian king Ashur-bel-kala to attack the city. Mari came firmly under the authority of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was assigned {{in the first half of}} the 8th century BC to a certain Nergal-Erish to govern under the authority of king Adad-Nirari III (reigned 810–783 BC). In c. 760 BC, Shamash-Risha-Usur, an autonomous governor ruling parts of the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> Euphrates under the nominal authority of Ashur-dan III, styled himself the governor of the lands of Suhu and Mari, so did his son Ninurta-Kudurri-Usur. However, by that time, Mari was known to be located in the so-called Land of Laqe, making it unlikely that the Usur family actually controlled it, and suggesting that the title was employed out of historical reasons. The city continued as a small settlement until the Hellenistic period before disappearing from records.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for the lack timber there. For the first decades of settlement, settlers refused to purchase the land in the barrens because it was considered too far from the timber needed to build homes, fires, fences, and other necessities. The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The Central Barren covered most of the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19thcentury, settlers began to discover that the barrens were among the most fertile farmlands in the state, and they quickly filled up with landholders. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20thcentury the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.|$|E
