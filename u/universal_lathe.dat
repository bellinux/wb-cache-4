40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the process of chip {{formation}} in metal cutting as being dependent {{not only on the}} work piece material but, even on the micro and macro structures of the work piece materials. Cutting operations were carried out on a <b>universal</b> <b>lathe</b> machine thereby making turning operation the basis for the experimental works for the research. Three major types of work piece materials were used: mild steel, stainless steel and titanium. The cutting operations were carried out dry for the three work piece materials used. Cutting conditions chosen are; cutting speed, v, between 2 - 120 m/min; cutting feed, s, 5 mm/rev; and cutting depth, t, 3 mm. The cutting tools used were uncoated, and a jig, known as quick stop mechanism was developed to facilitate obtaining the chip roots which were later studied. 1, 500 chip roots of titanium and over 600 chip roots each of both mild steel and stainless steel were studied. It was discovered that; the micro-structural block of titanium and its alloys play major roles in the chip formation process, the type of tool grade does not affect the process of chip formation, tool geometry does not affect the process of chip formation, and the shear zone during the process of turning titanium is not constant...|$|E

In accordance with the opinions of certain researchers, the divergent thinking could contribute to the increase of creative processes efficiency. On the other hand, the axiomatic design method is considered as a method able to stimulate the technical creativity when the problem of designing a mechanical equipment is stated. To increase the efficiency of using the axiomatic design method, the possibility of selecting the most convenient solution among many available solutions could be discussed.

40|$|Stellite 6 is {{a highly}} {{regarded}} engineering alloy and it possesses the wear, corrosion and heat resistance properties. Parts made of Stellite 6 are widely used in aerospace, nuclear and medical industries. Under the action of cutting forces, residual stresses may be developed during the machining of Stellite components which greatly affect the product fatigue life. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the level of sub-layer residual stresses developed in the surface of a Stellite 6 workpiece when machined using optimised cutting parameters (established earlier) and using coated carbide insert as cutting tool. Experiments with turning operations have been carried out on a <b>universal</b> <b>lathe</b> machine for optimising cutting regimes on the basis of surface roughness (Ra). Optimised cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) for nose radius 0. 4 mm 0. 8 mm and 1. 2 mm were used for making sample to nalyse residual stress. Residual stresses on the machined surfaces were examined by X-ray diffraction methods. Values of residual stresses were plotted against the tool nose radii in graphical form which displays the magnitude of residual stresses and the effect of nose radius with optimised cutting parameters. Finally the best nose radius with optimised cutting parameters has been offered depending on the sub-layer residual stresses for Stellite machining industries...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho foi investigado através da técnica de aplicação de pressão constante, a usinabilidade do ferro fundido nodular austemperado em função de tratamentos térmicos de recozimento e austêmpera. Os resultados foram correlacionados com a formação microestrutural e com as propriedades mecânicas. Para tanto foi utilizado o processo de torneamento, variando a profundidade de corte, a velocidade de corte, o ângulo de posição da ferramenta de corte e utilização e não utilização de fluido de corte. Para este fim, 36 amostras (18 recozidas previamente) foram austemperadas em etapa única nas temperaturas de 300 °C, 360 °C e 420 °C nos tempos de 30 min, 60 min e 90 min. e 16 peças (8 com recozimento prévio) em duas etapas à 245 °C e 300 °C nos respectivos tempos de 5 min e 30 min.. Para austêmpera em etapa única, amostras austemperadas à 300 °C por 30 minutos (sem recozimento prévio) obtiveram melhor usinabilidade, resistência ao impacto e menor dureza. Já, as austemperadas no mesmo tempo e temperatura (com recozimento prévio) obtiveram pior usinabilidade, maior dureza e menor resistência ao impacto. A austêmpera em duas etapas foi realizada em 8 peças que obtiveram melhor usinabilidade e em 8 peças de pior usinabilidade nos testes de austêmpera em única etapa. Estes testes de usinabilidade foram executados com e sem o uso de fluido de corte utilizando-se os ângulos de posição da ferramenta de corte de 90 º e 60 º. Os resultados apontam para melhor usinabilidade às amostras austemperadas pelo processo de duas etapas e que foram previamente recozidas e austemperadas à 300 °C durante 30 minutos, quando usinadas com fluido de corte e ângulo de posição da ferramenta de corte de 60 º. A microestrutura foi composta por matriz ausferrítica, grafita e austenita não transformada. The {{objective}} of this work is to analyze the influence of annealing and austempering heat treatments on the machinability with constant pressure of an austempered ductile cast iron. The results were correlated to microstructural formation and mechanical properties. It was used the turning process varying the depth of cut, the speed of cut, the angle of tool {{and the use of}} cut fluid. The samples (18 initially annealed) were heated at 910 °C for 90 minutes for austenitization and cooled in salt bath in one-step at temperatures 300 °C, 360 °C and 420 °C for 30, 60 and 90 minutes. Other 16 samples (8 previously annealed) were austempered in two-step process at 245 oC and 300 oC for 5 and 30 minutes, respectively. The samples were analyzed initially by optical microscopy and mechanical tests (Brinell hardness and Vickers microhardness), and after were machined in an <b>universal</b> <b>lathe</b> for machinability tests. The mechanical lathe was instrumented in relation to active power and cutting time, and the machinability evaluation was made with reference to cutting force, cutting pressure and material removal index criteria. The samples austempered at 300 oC for 30 minutes (with annealing) showed the best machinability, impact resistance and lowest hardness in the one-step process. However, the samples in the same temperature and time (with annealing) showed the worst machinability, highest hardness and lowest impact resistance. The two-step austempering was performed in 8 samples that showed the best machinability and 8 samples that showed the worst machinability in one-step process. In these samples, the machinability test were performed with and without fluid cut and cut angle of 90 o and 60 o. The results showed the highest performance for the condition austempered at 300 oC for 30 minute in two-step process, with previous annealing, when machined with fluid cut and angle of tool of 60 o. The microstructure was composed by ausferrite, graphite and retained austenite...|$|E
