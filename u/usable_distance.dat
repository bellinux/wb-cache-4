40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} basic possibilities of communication using ISM bands. It also includes extracts from the ČTÚ regulation concerning usage of ISM bands. The theoretical part describes mainly {{the functions of}} chosen transmitter and receiver module. Secondly it describes the design and realization of transmitter and receiver devices including the C libraries for basic use, <b>usable</b> <b>distance</b> measurement and example application using developed devices...|$|E
50|$|In UK railway applications, it {{is common}} to power the trains at 25 kV AC. To {{increase}} the distance between electricity supply Grid feeder points they can be arranged to supply a 25-0-25 kV supply with the third wire (opposite phase) out of reach of the train's overhead collector pantograph. The 0 V point of the supply is connected to the rail while one 25 kV point is connected to the overhead contact wire. At frequent (about 10 km) intervals, an autotransformer links the contact wire to rail and to the second (antiphase) supply conductor. This system increases <b>usable</b> transmission <b>distance,</b> reduces induced interference into external equipment and reduces cost. A variant is occasionally seen where the supply conductor is at a different voltage to the contact wire with the autotransformer ratio modified to suit.|$|R
5000|$|Most Sturmey Archer and Fichtel & Sachs 'Torpedo' systems default to {{top gear}} at slack-cable, which {{could make the}} bicycle <b>usable</b> for long <b>distance</b> travel in flat terrain even if a fault {{developed}} in the change mechanism (rather like a derailleur system, which can be manually set to a high gear {{in case of a}} similar fault). The very earliest Sturmey-Archer hubs, however, defaulted to low gear. Some modern hub gear systems (e.g., 7-speed Shimano) also default to bottom gear and are thus more dependent on the cable-pull ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, {{the use of}} TV White Spaces for {{broadband}} communication has raised interest. White Spaces refer to regions of radio spectrum that are not used {{all the time in}} a specific geographical location. This paper presents the preliminary performance assessment of a TV White Spaces deployment in Malawi. The method used involved coverage simulations at the TV White Spaces frequencies, deployment of the network, monitoring and performance analysis. The preliminary results report <b>usable</b> coverage <b>distance</b> up to 7. 5 km which has allowed that remote students access the content of the university library and interact with the university faculty. The results thus show that the TV White Spaces technology can be used for broadband connectivity in rural and undeserved areas even when the WiFi and broadcasting spectrum is already utilized. A typical application that supports remote access of e-library resources from a rural Secondary School was developed using DSpace architecture over the White Spaces infrastructure is discussed...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 10 - 12, 1972 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaMonitoring the {{internal}} environment of marine organisms {{as well as}} that of man in the oceanic milieu presents unique problems to the physiologist as signals used for data telemetry may have clear behavioral effects. The question of a tolerable level using different transmission modes is found to be species specific, but general guidelines are drawn on the basis of filtering and detection theory, the properties of the transmission media and the excitability characteristics of biological tissue. Transmission through water is surveyed and attenuation characteristics are presented. Experimental findings indicate that waves propagated through water and tissues are time dispersive and thus at sufficiently high frequencies the received signal process must be carefully evaluated with regard to optimal demodulation. Frequencies up to 1 MHz appear to be within the immediately <b>usable</b> range for <b>distances</b> of 1 meter or less. This bandwidth may be used for frequency-division multiplexed subcarriers or appropriately coded PCM transmission. Successful underwater transmission of physiological signals has been accomplished using frequency modulation of carriers transmitted by return-current-density methods, as part of an external biotelemetry system. Experimental evidence shows that implanted devices operating at high frequencies and at levels far below stimulation threshold can be used for transmission to the external transponder where adequate power is available for transmission to an underwater habitat or through data buoys to remote recording centers...|$|R
40|$|We explore {{correlations}} between various properties of Galactic globular clusters, using a database on 143 objects. Our goal is identify correlations and trends {{which can be}} used to test and constrain theoretical models of cluster formation and evolution. We use a set of 13 cluster parameters, 9 of which are independently measured. Several arguments suggest that the number of clusters still missing in the obscured regions of the Galaxy is of the order of 10, and thus the selection effects are probably not severe for our sample. Known clusters follow a power-law density distribution with a slope approximately - 3. 5 to - 4, and an apparent core with a core radius approximately 1 kpc. Clusters show a large dynamical range in many of their properties, more so for the core parameters (which are presumably more affected by dynamical evolution) than for the half-light parameters. There are no good correlations with luminosity, although more luminous clusters tend to be more concentrated. When data are binned in luminosity, several trends emerge: more luminous clusters tend to have smaller and denser cores. We interpret this as a differential survival effect, with more massive clusters surviving longer and reaching more evolved dynamical states. Cluster core parameters and concentrations also correlate with the position in the Galaxy, with clusters closer to the Galactic center or plane being more concentrated and having smaller and denser cores. These trends are more pronounced for the fainter (less massive) clusters. This is in agreement with a picture where tidal shocks form disk or bulge passages accelerate dynamical evolution of clusters. Cluster metallicities do not correlate with any other parameter, including luminosity and velocity dispersion; the only detectable trend is with the position in the Galaxy, probably reflecting Zinn's disk-halo dichotomy. This suggests that globular clusters were not self-enriched systems. Velocity dispersions show excellent correlations with luminosity and surface brightness. Their origin is not well understood, but they may well reflect initial conditions of cluster formation, and perhaps even be used to probe the initial density perturbation spectrum on a approximately 10 (exp 6) solar mass scale. Core radii and concentrations play a role of a 'second parameter' in these correlations. While a global manifold of cluster properties has a high statistical dimensionality (D greater than 4), a subset of structural, photometric, and dynamical parameters forms a statistically three-dimensional family, as expected from objects following King models; we propose to call this set of quantities the King Manifold. Some of the observed correlations may be <b>usable</b> as <b>distance</b> indicator relations for globular clusters...|$|R
