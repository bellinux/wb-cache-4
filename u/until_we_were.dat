25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're doing things on your own {{you can do whatever}} you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E
500|$|Film author Patrick Webster {{considers}} Kubrick's {{methods of}} writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming. Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness {{to allow him to}} improvise a scene, stating that [...] "there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> bored with it".|$|E
500|$|... "Grey Matters" [...] {{was written}} by screenwriters Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz, and was {{directed}} by Jeannot Szwarc. In an interview the following year, Miller noted that [...] "Your characters will often assert themselves, and remind you who they really are. In 'Grey Matters' there's a moment where pre-madness Walter wakes up in the chair — that beat emerged on the page. We {{had no idea it}} was going to be in the script <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> writing the scene. As a writer, you live for that." ...|$|E

500|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{were asked}} to write the script for a new Star Trek film, but {{initially}} turned it down despite Orci being {{a fan of the}} series. Orci suggested rebooting the timeline as seen previously in the films and television series, and adding the return of Leonard Nimoy as Spock from [...] He considered the first two films in the reboot series to be the origin story for the crew, and that the third film would start where the crew was at the beginning of Star Trek: The Original Series. Orci felt that the relationship between the James T. Kirk and the younger Spock was reflective of the partnership of himself and Kurtzman, he said that [...] "We didn't even realize we were writing about ourselves <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> halfway through the script, that was a little embarrassing.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} the episode's airing, Hearst {{expected}} that most Veronica Mars fans would not remember her kidnapping and the subsequent events, stating [...] "I won't be a distraction for them. They can focus in on the juicy story line." [...] Charles Shaughnessy appears as Selma Rose's husband, Budd. The episode was initially written to feature a lesbian kiss between Hearst's character and Keri Lynn Pratt's character, Hallie, when the two were discovered to be having an affair. However, The CW, the network the series aired on, stepped in and decided to cut the scene before it was filmed. Hearst reported, [...] "I meet Keri and I'm like, 'Hello.' We didn't know <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on the set we couldn't actually kiss. We were all set for that." [...] AOL TV commented that the network might have made the choice to prevent [...] "Lord of the Pi's" [...] from becoming a lesbian kiss episode involving an older woman, while AfterEllen.com called the choice [...] "bizarre".|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, [...] "t would be madness {{for the country to}} stop rearming <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good." [...] However, later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich. Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes. However, Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord. Having considered a general election immediately following Munich Chamberlain instead reshuffled his Cabinet. By the end of the year, however, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that [...] "to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election" [...] would be [...] "suicidal".|$|E

2500|$|Writing for {{the record}} began in September 2003, soon after Isis had {{relocated}} from Boston to Los Angeles. According to guitarist Mike Gallagher, “we started working on ideas for songs and sounds as individuals, in pairs or as a whole group <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to shape the ideas into songs {{that we were all}} happy with and could stand behind”. Whilst some tracks originated from [...] "little jams" [...] the band would do at sound check, the majority of the album was created in time dedicated to writing new material. Gallagher adds that “usically speaking, Panopticon came out a couple of ideas that had been kicking around in our heads for some time, but the bulk of it was composed after we decided {{that it was time to}} do a new record. The writing process consisted mostly of an individual starting the core of an idea for a song at home then either pairing off with someone else or bringing it to everyone where it was worked on and refined until everyone was satisfied”. According to Jeff Caxide, this process was significantly different from that of previous Isis albums, as “everyone wrote a lot on this record. There is not one song that could be credited to one person”.|$|E
2500|$|According to Lords, she and {{her sister}} Lorraine both {{developed}} early; this fueled their father's concerns about their sexuality. [...] "I think my father hated women. He dealt with us <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> eleven, then he started to lay this guilt on us about sex." [...] At the age of ten, Lords was raped by a sixteen-year-old boy who she had befriended at her friend's birthday party. When she was twelve, Lords moved with her mother and sisters to Lawndale, California, along with her mother's new boyfriend. It was the last time she saw her father. In September 1982, she began attending the Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California. During her early school years, Lords developed a rebellious attitude. She was angry at her mother, blaming her for their poverty, and found a father figure in her mother's boyfriend. Roger Hayes, as she calls him in her , was a cocaine dealer and molested Lords in her sleep. After her mother broke up with him due to his drug use, she began dating his friend. Lords refused to follow them to a new place and was left with her older sister Lorraine. Her mother and two younger sisters eventually ended up in a women's shelter until her mother was able to find a new apartment.|$|E
2500|$|Remarkably, Bore {{found the}} middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. [...] The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. [...] Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to {{complete}} a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask [...] "What did you do that for?" [...] "It wasn't in the right place." [...] Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. [...] The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, [...] "That's it, we've won". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. [...] Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. [...] As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister [...] "We were stunned. We got in the car and I don't think we spoke a word <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs".|$|E
