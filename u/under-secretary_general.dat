2500|$|Toda {{was active}} in {{creating}} a prominent group of 28 supporters who endorsed [...] "The System of Value-Creating Pedagogy" [...] including Tsuyoshi Inukai, who was to rise to become prime minister of Japan in 1931. The first volume of the [...] "System of Value-Creating Pedagogy" [...] included a calligraphy by Inukai as well as forewords by Inazo Nitobe, who {{at that time was}} one of the <b>Under-Secretaries</b> <b>General</b> of the League of Nations, sociologist Suketoshi Tanabe, and the folklorist Kunio Yanagita.|$|R

He became a founding director of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (which later became UNESCO under the United Nations' mandate). His legacy in this period includes the settlement of territorial dispute between Sweden and Finland over the Swedish-speaking Åland Islands. In its resolution, the Islands remained under the Finnish control, but adopted complete disarmament (i.e., no military presence on the islands) and granted autonomy, averting a possible armed conflict (See also Åland crisis).|$|R
500|$|During the five-years {{from the}} end of 2004 through 2009, {{worldwide}} renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall. In 2011, UN <b>under-secretary</b> <b>general</b> Achim Steiner said: [...] "The continuing growth in this core segment of the green economy is not happening by chance. The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach." [...] He added: [...] "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Tharoor was {{appointed}} {{director of communications}} and special projects and executive assistant to the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

5000|$|Marshal Graziani, as {{army chief}} of staff, {{went to the front}} to take over the general {{direction}} of war after 10 June. He was joined by the <b>under-secretary</b> of war, <b>General</b> Ubaldo Soddu, who had no operational command, but who served as Mussolini's connection to the front and was appointed deputy chief of the Supreme General Staff on 13 June. Graziani's adjutant, General Mario Roatta, remained in Rome to transmit the orders of Mussolini—restrained somewhat by Marshal Badoglio—to the front. Many of Roatta's orders, like [...] "be {{on the heels of the}} enemy; audacius; daring; rushing after", were quickly contradicted by Graziani. Graziani kept all the minutes of his staff meeting during June 1940, in order to absolve himself and condemn both subordinates and superiors should the offensive fail, as he expected it would.|$|R
40|$|Thailand is an {{agricultural}} country with about 80 {{percent of the}} population operating farms. Agriculture is the main source of national income and 90 percent of all exports are agricultural products. The farms are small and a high percent of the farmers are illiterate which accounts for so many people remaining on farms. Even though agricultural development is under the National Economic and Social Development Plan, new methods of farming are not easily accessible to the small farmers. They still follow their ancestor 2 ̆ 7 s methods of cultivating, irrigating, and harvesting their crops. Most farmers operate subsistent farm units. They plant enough rice for their own family for the year and if all the rice is not consumed it is sold. They are not familiar with modern agricultural science: fertilizer, soils, plants, mechanization, entomology or market demands. Farm boys and girls have {{to drop out of school}} in low grade levels because the farmer cannot afford school expenses. Young people are expected to help their families on the farms. The younger generation will likely follow in the footsteps of their parents unless additional educational opportunities are provided. Extension Service can be a way of providing informal education to farmers and their families. Separate Agricultural Extension Departments in Thailand were organized by the Ministry of Agriculture many years ago for general agriculture, rice, livestock, fishery, and forestry. In 1967 the Agricultural Extension Department was established in the Ministry of Agriculture and combined three Extension Departments: Office of the <b>Under-Secretary</b> of State, <b>General</b> Agricultural, and Rice Department into one department. This is likely the beginning of real Agricultural Extension Service in Thailand. Although the Cooperative Extension Service in the United States of America started under the Smith-Liver Act in 1914, agricultural extension had been organized long before that year. The general objectives of Cooperative Extension Service are to strengthen agriculture, home economics, and youth programs. Extension Service is organized to meet the people 2 ̆ 7 s needs. Utah is one of the pioneers in agricultural extension in the western states. In 1911, Lou Windsor was hired as the first county agent in the Uintah Basin. Since Utah has one of the oldest Cooperative Extension Services, its organization and administration will be studied to gather information that might be applied and incorporated into the Agricultural Extension Service in Thailand...|$|R

2500|$|Leibovich {{was one of}} {{a number}} of bloggers who criticized Khulood Badawi, an Information and Media Coordinator for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs who tweeted a picture of a Palestinian child covered in blood. She captioned it [...] "Another child killed by #Israel... Another father {{carrying}} his child to a grave in #Gaza." [...] It was discovered the picture was published in 2006 and was of a Palestinian girl who had died in an accident and been brought to the hospital shortly after an Israeli air strike in Gaza. Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Ron Prosor called for Badawi's dismissal, stating that she was [...] "directly engaged in spreading misinformation". Humanitarian Coordinator and the Head of Office in Jerusalem later met with officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel to discuss these events. UN <b>Under-Secretary</b> <b>General</b> Valerie Amos wrote, [...] "It is regrettable that an OCHA staff member has posted information on her personal Twitter profile, which is both false and which reflects on issues that are related to her work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aid {{agencies}} {{have reported that}} Gaza [...] "looks like earthquake zone": widespread destruction of houses, infrastructure, roads, greenhouses, cemeteries, mosques and schools are reported in Jabalia, Tal Al Hawa, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip. According to the ICRC, [...] "a number of areas, including parts of Beit Lahia looked like {{the aftermath of a}} strong earthquake". Meanwhile, Al Mezan Center field workers reported that [...] "entire urban blocks have disappeared" [...] in North Gaza and eastern of Gaza City. The International Red Cross reports that in Jabalia alone, between one and two thousand households are now living in the rubble of their houses. John Holmes, the <b>Under-Secretary</b> <b>General</b> of the United Nations, in his statement to the Security Council, reports that he saw an entire industrial and residential area in East Jabalia which had been [...] "systematically bulldozed", an area of at least one square kilometer and that one of the best schools in Gaza is reduced to rubble 2,000 refugee families had their shelters totally destroyed. UNRWA was ready to provide cash assistance and shelter repair for those families, but has been unable to deliver this assistance to beneficiaries due to a shortage of liquidity and construction material in the Gaza Strip.|$|E
2500|$|The UN's {{foremost}} peacekeeping official, <b>Under-Secretary</b> <b>General</b> for Peacekeeping Operations Alan Le Roy, {{claimed that}} a [...] "humanitarian tragedy" [...] was unfolding in the Congo. Despite the organization's largest peacekeeping force being situated there, {{he claimed that}} [...] "compared to {{the enormity of the}} tasks it is assigned and the vast expanse of the DRC – roughly the size of the United States east of the Mississippi and virtually without infrastructure – this number is actually rather small. Civilians have suffered from intense and often chaotic fighting, driven from their homes, caught in the crossfire and subjected to direct attacks and reprisals by armed groups and undisciplined elements of the national army. MONUC forces cannot serve as a substitute for the Congolese army to fight a war or impose peace; [...] are not an expeditionary or counterinsurgency force. With so much at stake, the international community simply cannot afford to let the Congo slide into the abyss, the time to act is, and indeed must be, now." [...] Le Roy reaffirmed that more action should be taken until agreements could be reached by the opposing sides. At a conference on December 9 EU ministers remained divided on the issue of sending a [...] "bridging force", citing the stabilizing situation.|$|E
2500|$|Tensions later {{heightened}} as Nkunda's rebels {{announced that}} they would walk out on the talks if other groups were included, while pro-government Mai-Mai rebels stated they would pull out of negotiations if the CDNP got their own separate talks that were not {{under the banner of}} earlier [...] "Amani" [...] peace talks from January 2008 which aimed to unite all of the armed groups in the Congo in peace talks. [...] "To proceed in this way is to incite us to quit the Amani programme, the government should not forget this", claimed Mai-Mai leaders. [...] "We are not a negligible group, we have arms... We want the CNDP to rejoin Amani. It seems that by quitting Amani, they have become more important than the other groups. We don't understand the decision by the government to go and negotiate with the CNDP... We are disappointed, it's a flagrant violation of Amani's terms." [...] CNDP spokesman Bertrand Bisimwa stated that the rebels [...] "are going to Nairobi to discuss only with the government outside of the Amani programme... If the government insists on staying in Amani, we'll pack our bags." [...] CNDP representatives, led by deputy executive secretary Serge Kambasu Ngeve, had arrived in the Kenyan capital city of Nairobi believing that they would be participating in bilateral discussions with the Congolese government alone. The government representatives, led by Congolese Minister for International and Regional Cooperation Raymond Tshibanda, did not express concern, with Information Minister Lambert Mende claiming that if the CNDP wanted to walk out [...] "that's their problem not ours. It's their problem if they don't want peace. They'll be held accountable for their acts." [...] Meanwhile, Alan Le Roy, <b>Under-Secretary</b> <b>General</b> for Peacekeeping Operations, pressed for more action to be taken to intervene in the situation.|$|E
