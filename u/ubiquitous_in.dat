In this scenario, securing events dissemination and protecting users' privacy are essential requirements for <b>ubiquitous</b> applications. <b>In</b> this thesis, we propose an encryption key establishment scheme for encrypting disseminated events <b>in</b> <b>ubiquitous</b> Pub/Sub infrastructures. The proposed key establishment scheme considers the dynamism, scalability and failure tolerance issues of ubiquitous environments. More importantly, the generated encryption keys reflect multi level access control polices, which is important to enforce users' privacy polices...|$|R

5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>in</b> lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E

5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>in</b> the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>in</b> developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>in</b> modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E
