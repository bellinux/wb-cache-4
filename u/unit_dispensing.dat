40|$|Background: Direct-to-consumer {{advertising}} (DTCA) {{is assumed}} to be a major driver of rising pharmaceutical costs. Yet, research on how it affects costs is limited. Therefore, we studied clopidogrel, a commonly used and heavily marketed antiplatelet agent, which was first sold in 1998 and first direct-to-consumer advertised in 2001. Methods: We examined pharmacy data from 27 Medicaid programs from 1999 through 2005. We used interrupted time series analysis to analyze changes in the number of <b>units</b> <b>dispensed,</b> cost per <b>unit</b> <b>dispensed,</b> and total pharmacy expenditures after DTCA initiation. Results: In 1999 and 2000, there was no DTCA for clopidogrel; from 2001 through 2005, DTCA spending exceeded $ 350 million. Direct-to-consumer advertising did not change the preexisting trend in the number of clopidogrel <b>units</b> <b>dispensed</b> per 1000 enrollees (P = 3 D. 10). However, there was a sudden and sustained increase in cost per unit of $ 0. 40 after DTCA initiation (95 % confidence interval, $ 0. 31 -$ 0. 49; P <. 001), leading to an additional $ 40. 58 of pharmacy costs per 1000 enrollees per quarter thereafter (95 % confidence interval, $ 22. 61 -$ 58. 56; P <. 001). Overall, this change resulted in an additional $ 207 million in total pharmacy expenditures. Conclusions: Direct-to-consumer advertising was not associated with an increase in clopidogrel use over and above preexisting trends. However, Medicaid pharmacy expenditures increased substantially after the initiation of DTCA because of a concomitant increase in the cost per unit. If drug price increases after DTCA initiation are common, there are important implications for payers and for policy makers in the United States and elsewhere...|$|R

This study was aimed at identifying the extent of RBC wastage and evaluating the effects of various interventions in reducing this wastage. From January 2011 to March 2011, baseline wastage level was evaluated using temperature-sensitive labels. Following this initial analysis, various interventions were implemented, including modifying the transfusion practice, intensifying training of and communication with the medical staff and improving the transport conditions. The impact of these interventions on wastage was measured during two periods, and results were compared with baseline wastage level. Based {{on the extent of}} label colouring, 7 · 5 % of the <b>units</b> <b>dispensed</b> by the transfusion laboratory were determined as non-reusable at baseline. After implementation of the various interventions, wastage decreased to 1 % of the <b>units</b> <b>dispensed,</b> potentially leading to an annual saving for our hospital of approximately € 208 · 000 /$ 230 · 600 on the total number of RBCs dispensed.

METHODS This is a cross-sectional and quantitative study, with data from the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos – Serviços, 2015 (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – Services, 2015). For the analysis, we considered the data stratification into geographical regions. We analyzed the data on workers in the municipal pharmaceutical services management and in the medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> according to the country’s regions. For the statistical association analysis, we carried out a Pearson correlation test for the categorical variables. RESULTS We analyzed 1, 175 pharmacies/dispensing units, 507 phone interviews (495 pharmaceutical services coordinators), and 1, 139 professionals responsible for medicine delivery. The workforce in pharmaceutical services was mostly constituted by women, aged from 18 to 39 years, with higher education (90. 7 % in coordination and 45. 5 % in <b>dispensing</b> <b>units),</b> having permanent employment bonds (public tender), being {{for more than one}} year in the position or duty, and with weekly work hours above 30 h, working both in municipal management and in medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units.</b> We observed regional differences in the workforce composition in <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> with higher percentage of pharmacists in the Southeast and Midwest regions.

Aims: The aim was to examine temporal trends of levothyroxine utilization in Canada, Greece, Ireland and the United States. Settings and Design: A cross-sectional, population-based time series study was conducted to assess monthly utilization rates from January 1, 2005 to September 20, 2011, in Canada, Greece, Ireland and the United States. The primary outcome measure was the monthly rate of levothyroxine utilization for each country analyzed. Materials and Methods: Levothyroxine utilization data were obtained from IMS Health Inc., and temporal trends in monthly <b>units</b> <b>dispensed</b> per 1, 000 population were examined. Statistical Analysis Used: Time series analysis was used to examine temporal trends in levothyroxine utilization.

MethodsThe prediction model was developed considering the standard unit consumption and equivalent patients from IMS database. Drug costs were calculated using official hospital reimbursement prices reported by the Italian Pharmaceutical Agency. By analysing the number of treated patients between 2014 and 2016, clinical experts develop three alternative scenarios and provide estimating the number of patients that they expect to treat during the next 4 years with biosimilars or originator in Italy. ResultsConsidering the number of standard <b>units</b> <b>dispensed</b> each year, the model estimated a total number of 28. 000 patient/year that are treated with infliximab or etanercept (28 % for AR, 17 % for psoriasis, 26 % for psoriatic arthritis, 18 % for IBD and 11 % for other indications). In 2020, drugs expenditure is expected to decline between € 42 and € 90 billion as compared to 2014, (12 % and 26 % of total spending in 2014 respectively). Overall, the cumulative savings are estimated between € 132 and € 296 billions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Polypharmacy {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{management}} issues in public health policies because of its financial impact and the increasing number of people involved. The polymedicated population according to their demographic and therapeutic profile and the cost for the public healthcare system were characterised. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Primary healthcare in Barcelona Health Region, Catalonia, Spain (5 105 551 inhabitants registered). PARTICIPANTS: All insured polymedicated patients. Polymedicated patients were those with a consumption of ≥ 16 drugs/month. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The study variables were related to age, gender and medication intake obtained from the 2008 census and records of prescriptions dispensed in pharmacies and charged to the public health system. RESULTS: There were 36 880 polymedicated patients (women: 64. 2 %; average age: 74. 5 ± 10. 9 years). The total number of prescriptions billed in 2008 was 2 266 830 (2 272 920 total package units). The most polymedicated group (up to 40 % of the total prescriptions) was patients between 75 and 84 years old. The average number of prescriptions billed monthly per patient was 32 ± 2, with an average cost of 452. 7 ± 27. 5. The total cost of those prescriptions corresponded to 2 % of the drug expenditure in Catalonia. The groups N, C, A, R and M represented 71. 4 % of the total number of drug package <b>units</b> <b>dispensed</b> to polymedicated patients.

RESULTS More than half (53 %) of the units presented a space smaller than 10 m 2 for dispensing of medicines; 23. 8 % had bars or barriers between users and dispenser; 41. 7 % had computerized system; and 23. 7 % had counters for individual care. Among those responsible for dispensation, 87. 4 % said they always or repeatedly inform users {{how to use the}} medicines, and 18. 1 % reported developing some type of clinical activity. Isolated pharmacies presented a more developed physical and personal structure than those belonging to health units, but we found no significant differences regarding the information provided and the development of clinical activities.
