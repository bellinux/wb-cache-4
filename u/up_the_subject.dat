5|$|Twice in May 1940 Churchill {{broached}} {{the subject of}} bringing Lloyd George into the government. Each time Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud. However, Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.|$|E

After watching just the first three episodes of P.A.Works' True Tears (2008), however, he was shocked at the high quality and immediately went to P.A.Works' studio in Toyama Prefecture {{to meet with the}} production staff in the hope that one day Aniplex could collaborate with them on a project together. The following week, Maeda brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of deciding on an animation studio for Angel Beats! and mentioned that he too had seen True Tears and had become interested in P.A.Works. Shortly after that, Toba formally made the proposal to P.A.Works to animate the project.|$|E

David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

The United Democratic Nationhood Party (PPDK) {{was the first to}} bring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of nomination. In September 2003, Yudhoyono's own party began to make preparations in case Yudhoyono was willing to accept a presidential nomination. The Democratic Party then initiated a publicity campaign to promote Yudhoyono as a candidate. For his part, Yudhoyono was not responsive both to PPDK or the Democratic Party's manoeuvrings to nominate him and continued his duties as Minister. PPDK was disappointed in Yudhoyono's reaction and the Democratic Party continued to wait for Yudhoyono to resign his position as was expected of all presidential candidates apart from the incumbent President and Vice-President.|$|E

[...] He {{exhibits}} characteristics of a well-schooled child of his time; his speech is polite and peppered with [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you", and when he unexpectedly encounters the partial child, he requests pardon for staring. He can count to a thousand, though his tact in bringing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> {{in the presence of the}} numbers-hating King Azaz is not the best. Mindful of his mother's admonition to eat lightly when a guest, he initially orders a light meal at the banquet, only to find the waiters bringing in insubstantial light beams. Not realizing he will be asked to eat his words, he then makes a plausible start at a speech before being interrupted by the king.|$|E
500|$|In essence, the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is {{intended}} to teach children the specific virtues that make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter of the work. While trying to accomplish this goal, Smart emphasizes the joy of creation and Christ's sacrifice that allowed for future salvation. However, he didn't just try to spread joy, but structured his poems to treat valuable lessons about morality; his subjects begin with the three Theological Virtues (Faith, Hope, and Charity), then the four Cardinal Virtues (Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude) and adds Mercy. The next six hymns deal with Christian duties and are followed by ten hymns on the Gospels. The final works introduce the miscellaneous Christian virtues that were necessary to complete Christopher's original self-proclaimed [...] "plan to make good girls and boys." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something is terribly wrong when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, {{graduate}} student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an Archaeopteryx specimen. Using {{scanning electron microscopy}} technology and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the single-feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant structure was then {{compared to that of}} 87modern bird species and was determined with a highest likelihood to be black. The feather studied was most probably a single covert, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that Archaeopteryx was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, new analyses of Archaeopteryxs feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes. In a press release, Carney argued against this interpretation, insisting the wing feather was [...] "matte black with a darker tip" [...] and one of his colleagues also brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> in a review paper however, no new evidence was published.|$|E
500|$|Smart's Hymns are {{modelled}} after {{a tradition}} exemplified by Robert Nelson. They are steeped in Anglican tradition and also emphasise English patriotism and England's divine favour. The Hymns, according to Guest, [...] " [...] a delight in creation {{that is largely}} absent {{from the work of}} other hymn-writers of the century, unless they are paraphrasing the words of David." [...] To Hawes, the Hymns exemplify an evangelical spirit that separates Smart from the traditional Anglican church. Although he wrote his second set of hymns, Hymns for the Amusement of Children, for a younger audience, Smart cares more about emphasising the need for children to be moral instead of [...] "innocent". These works have been seem as possibly too complicated for [...] "amusement" [...] because they employee ambiguities and complicated theological concepts. In essence, the Hymns for the Amusement of Children is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> matter of the work. Like the Hymns for the Amusement of Children, Smart's The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ were designed to teach morals. However, these Parables alter the original Biblical parables in order to simplify them and help them [...] "make sense" [...] As such, Todd Parker claims that the Parables, and the other religious works of Smart, are part of his final push for the [...] "evangelization of London's reading public." ...|$|E
