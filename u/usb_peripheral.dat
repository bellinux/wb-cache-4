50|$|When {{attached}} to a PC, an OTG device requires a cable which has a USB Standard-A plug on one end and a micro-B plug on the other end. In order to attach a peripheral to an OTG device, the peripheral either needs a cable ending in a micro-A plug, which is inserted into the OTG device's micro-AB receptacle, or the OTG device itself needs an adapter cable with a micro-A plug on one end and a Standard-A receptacle on the other. The adapter cable enables any standard <b>USB</b> <b>peripheral</b> to be {{attached to}} an OTG device.
