5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the soaring flight. <b>Unpowered</b> gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in <b>unpowered</b> gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while <b>unpowered</b> gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>unpowered</b> glider needed ballast to {{be flown}} empty, the Hamilcar X was less {{sensitive}} to {{centre of gravity}} issues.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages {{at each end of}} the train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is <b>unpowered,</b> it is equipped with a pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an <b>unpowered</b> passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|Blackwolf, {{co-founder of}} the Champions and Damsel's ex-husband. A Batman-like character, he is the team's only <b>unpowered</b> member, but he is athletically trained and intellectually gifted. He is {{motivated}} {{by the death of}} family members and has mild autism. He divides his time between managing his successful corporation and work as a superhero.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The <b>unpowered</b> rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no <b>unpowered</b> leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|Gliding is a {{recreational}} activity and competitive air sport in which pilots fly <b>unpowered</b> aircraft known as gliders or sailplanes using naturally occurring currents of rising {{air in the}} atmosphere to remain airborne. The word soaring is also used for the sport. which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in Germany's Weimar Republic. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers {{in the rest of}} the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, many were {{relieved}} {{to have survived}} {{the worst of the}} Category4 hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from <b>unpowered</b> refrigerators and freezers. Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kauaʻi) and the Honolulu Symphony, provided free concerts to the victims.|$|E
5|$|Trials {{conducted}} using a conventional, powered C-47, first conducting ordinary deadstick landings, then being towed by another C-47, {{indicated that the}} scheme was feasible. Therefore, a C-47-DL was taken in hand for conversion into a glider, which was given the designation XCG-17. The aircraft, formerly a Northwest Airlines DC-3 that had been impressed into military service {{at the start of}} World War II, was modified by the removal of the aircraft's engines; the nacelles, containing the landing gear, remained in place, covered with aerodynamically profiled hemispherical domes for streamlining, containing fixed weight to compensate for the removal of the engines. Other equipment, no longer necessary with the conversion to an <b>unpowered</b> configuration, was also removed to save weight; items removed included the aircraft's wiring and bulkheads, along with the navigator's and radio operator's positions.|$|E
25|$|Animal aerial {{locomotion}} can {{be divided}} into two categories—powered and <b>unpowered.</b> In <b>unpowered</b> modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces. Animals using <b>unpowered</b> aerial locomotion cannot maintain altitude and speed due to unopposed drag, while animals using powered flight can maintain steady, level flight as long as their muscles are capable of doing so.|$|E
25|$|Rocket-powered {{aircraft}} consume their fuel {{quickly and}} so most must land <b>unpowered</b> {{unless there is}} another power source. The first rocket plane was the Lippisch Ente, and later examples include the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered interceptor. The American series of research aircraft starting with the Bell X-1 in 1946 up to the North American X-15 spent more time flying <b>unpowered</b> than under power. In the 1960s research was also done on <b>unpowered</b> lifting bodies and on the X-20 Dyna-Soar project, but although the X20 was cancelled, this research {{eventually led to the}} Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The key {{constraint}} in {{this approach}} was that it had limited traction because of the single driver. These locomotives were equally characterized by both axles, powered or <b>unpowered,</b> being of equal size. Even though the locomotive had the 2-2-0 designation, the leading axle was <b>unpowered</b> and not a lead truck.|$|E
25|$|As of 1947, the <b>unpowered</b> Pomona {{was still}} in existence, on the Willamette River.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} <b>unpowered</b> glide tests, Scaled Composites' SpaceShipTwo hybrid {{spaceplane}} successfully conducts its first rocket-powered flight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unpowered</b> flying wings {{built for}} {{aerodynamic}} research include the Horten flying wings, the scaled glider {{version of the}} Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 jet powered flying wing.|$|E
25|$|The British Rail Class 488 are <b>unpowered</b> trailer sets, {{converted}} from Mark 2F coaches for the Gatwick Express service from London Victoria railway station to Gatwick Airport.|$|E
25|$|Passenger coaches – {{the main}} part of the set is formed from eight Class 488 <b>unpowered</b> {{trailers}} previously operated on the Gatwick Express, which were purchased in 2001.|$|E
25|$|UIC {{classification}} system was typically used for electric locomotives, {{as it could}} handle the complex arrangements of powered and <b>unpowered</b> axles and could distinguish between coupled and uncoupled drive systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was originally {{conceived as a}} retractable engine motor glider, to be a competitor to the Albastar Apis, but instead it was put into production as a conventional <b>unpowered</b> glider.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there were}} a number of <b>unpowered</b> trailer cars, the 820 and 860 classes. These had been {{modified}} from steam-era suburban carriages and were used with the Redhens between 1955 and 1987.|$|E
25|$|On July 20, 2011, the Connecticut Department of Transportation {{announced}} {{the order of}} 25 <b>unpowered</b> M8 railcars, with options for up to 25 more, {{at a cost of}} US$93 million to replace the 48-car M6 fleet.|$|E
25|$|All the Escarpment's {{public lands}} are {{available}} for passive recreation such as hiking, camping and birding. Hunting and fishing are permitted within season and as otherwise regulated by the state. <b>Unpowered</b> boating is permitted on Echo and North-South lakes.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, Virgin Galactic {{announced}} that the <b>unpowered</b> subsonic glide flight test program was essentially complete. In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the rocket engine, and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.|$|E
25|$|The typical initial {{treatment}} {{known to be}} effective is scaling and root planing (SRP) to mechanically debride {{the depths of the}} periodontal pocket and disrupt the biofilm present. This is done using a powered ultrasonic or sonic scaler and/or <b>unpowered</b> hand instruments.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{holiday house}} in the village, near Wyangala Dam Public School. Additional {{accommodation}} is found at Wyangala Waters State Park, which contains numerous powered and <b>unpowered</b> camping sites, five bungalows, three cottages, one lodge, seven cabins and Jayco ensuite cabins.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{operating}} safety features, such as (depending on design) avoidance of pressurized operation, automatic passive (<b>unpowered,</b> uncommanded) reactor shutdown, avoidance of water cooling {{and the associated}} risks of loss of water (leaks or boiling) and hydrogen generation/explosion and contamination of coolant water.|$|E
25|$|During snowstorms, the MBTA runs {{an empty}} train during non-service hours {{to keep the}} tracks and third rail clear. The Red Line {{experienced}} major service disruptions {{in the winter of}} 2014–15 due to frozen-over third rails, leaving <b>unpowered</b> trains stranded between stations with passengers on board.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} of activity, Whitehead also {{reportedly}} tested an unmanned and <b>unpowered</b> flying machine, towed by men pulling ropes. A witness said the craft rose above telephone lines, flew across a road and landed undamaged. The distance covered was later measured at approximately 1,000ft (305m).|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of skating robots have been developed, {{one of which is}} a {{multi-mode}} walking and skating device. It has four legs, with <b>unpowered</b> wheels, which can either step or roll. Another robot, Plen, can use a miniature skateboard or roller-skates, and skate across a desktop.|$|E
25|$|The Arabian American Oil Company {{constructed}} a standard gauge railway {{in cooperation with}} the Saudi government. The company ordered three RDC-2s in 1951, supplemented by a fourth in 1958. The cars operated on various routes originating in Dammam. All were converted to <b>unpowered</b> trailers by 1965.|$|E
25|$|Typically, railroads {{operating}} in the United States reserve one- to four-digit identification numbers for powered equipment such as diesel locomotives and six-digit identification numbers for <b>unpowered</b> equipment. There is no hard and fast rule for how equipment is numbered; each railroad maintains its own numbering policy for its equipment.|$|E
25|$|Gyrodynes {{are also}} known as {{compound}} helicopters or compound gyroplanes. A gyrodyne has the powered rotor of a helicopter with a separate forward thrust system of an autogyro. Apart from take-off and landing the rotor may be <b>unpowered</b> and autorotate. Designs may also include stub wings for added lift.|$|E
25|$|The ASM-N-5 Gorgon V was an <b>unpowered</b> air-to-surface missile, {{developed}} by the Glenn L. Martin Company during the early 1950s {{for use by the}} United States Navy as a chemical weapon delivery vehicle. Developed from the earlier PTV-N-2 Gorgon IV test vehicle, the program was cancelled without any Gorgon Vs seeing service.|$|E
25|$|It {{was common}} in the 1890s for sternwheelers on {{excursions}} to lash alongside an <b>unpowered</b> barge to carry additional passengers, and this was planned for he excursion, scheduled for Saturday, July 30, 1892, to Martin’s Bluff carrying the Knights of Pythias. Brass bands were frequently hired to provide entertainment to the excursionists.|$|E
25|$|The South Shore Line {{operates}} with a {{fleet of}} 82 rail cars built between 1982–2009 by Nippon Sharyo. The fleet consists of 58 single-level self-propelled cars, 10 single-level <b>unpowered</b> trailers, and 14 bilevel self-propelled cars. The single level fleet's design shares commonalities with MARC's locomotive-hauled MARC II fleet, which were also built by Nippon Sharyo.|$|E
25|$|Tri-Rail uses {{two types}} of {{passengers}} cars. Since the beginning of operations, the system has used 26 Bombardier BiLevel Coaches acquired from GO Transit, a common model among US commuter railroads, 11 with operating cabs and 15 without. Briefly, bi-level rolling stock from Colorado Railcar (4 DMU power coaches and 2 <b>unpowered</b> coaches) was used beginning in 2006.|$|E
