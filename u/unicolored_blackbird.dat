Boxes show the median line and the 25 th and 75 th percentiles; bars show {{the full range of}} variation. Sample sizes are: Agelasticus cyanopus cyanopus (41 ♂, 38 ♀), possible intergrades between A. c. cyanopus x A. c. beniensis (3 ♂, 1 ♀), A. c. beniensis (19 ♂, 15 ♀), A. c. atroolivaceus (10 ♂, 5 ♀), possible intergrades between A. c. atroolivaceus and A. c. unicolor (4 ♂, 4 ♀) and A. c. unicolor (12 ♂, 11 ♀) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{this study}} we {{compared}} the utility of two molecular biology techniques, cloning of the mitochondrial 12 S ribosomal RNA gene and hydrolysis probe-based qPCR, to identify blood meal sources of sylvatic Chagas disease insect vectors collected with live-bait mouse traps (also known as Noireau traps). Fourteen T. guasayana were collected from six georeferenced trap locations in the Andean highlands {{of the department of}} Chuquisaca, Bolivia. Methodology/Principal Findings: We detected four blood meals sources with the cloning assay: seven samples were positive for human (Homo sapiens), five for chicken (Gallus gallus) and <b>unicolored</b> <b>blackbird</b> (Agelasticus cyanopus), and one for opossum (Monodelphis domestica). Using the qPCR assay we detected chicken (13 vectors), and human (14 vectors) blood meals as well as an additional blood meal source, Canis sp. (4 vectors). Conclusions/Significance: We show that cloning of 12 S PCR products, which avoids bias associated with developing primers based on a priori knowledge, detected blood meal sources not previously considered and that species-specific qPCR is more sensitive. All samples identified as positive for a specific blood meal source by the cloning assay were also positive by qPCR. However, not all samples positive by qPCR were positive by cloning. We show the power of combining the cloning assay with the highly sensitive hydrolysis probe-based qPCR assay provides a more complete picture of blood meal source...|$|E
40|$|Cherries Prunus avium (L.) by frugivorous {{birds and}} mammals was studied in an area in {{northwest}} Spain in summer during July–August 2005, ana-lysing in particular how the fruits were obtained by terrestrial seed-dispersing mammals. During the study cherries were practically the only ripe fleshy fruits available in the area. They were con-sumed {{by a variety of}} birds (16 species), with a very high mean rate of feeding visits (136 birds per hour for 10 trees, n = 4091 feeding visits). Most of these visits were by a priori seed-dispers-ing birds that usually swallow the fruits whole, in particular the Spotless Starling Sturnus <b>unicolor</b> Temminck, <b>Blackbird</b> Turdus merula L., Blackca...|$|R
