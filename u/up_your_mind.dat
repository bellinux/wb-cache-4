500|$|Through the story, Armstrong {{hoped to}} detail {{coming of age}} in America {{at the time of the}} album's release. While he {{considered}} their previous record heartfelt, he felt a more instinctual feeling to speak for the time period in which the album was released. He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the [...] "climate" [...] surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, [...] "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules." [...] In addition to the album's political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled [...] "confusion and loss of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One Minute" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song with electropop influences, and begins with Clarkson singing, [...] "You're going crazy, running on empty / You can't make <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> / You try to hide it, {{but you had to}} say it / Restless all this time." [...] It is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5. Critics have observed the influence of 1980s music on the song, while Talia Kraines of BBC Music compared it to pop rock songs released by singers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan. A reviewer for Billboard commented on the song's structure, writing that [...] "One Minute" [...] consists of [...] "rapid-fire give-and-take verses".|$|E

500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> Don't come to our conference unless you {{have something to say about}} the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:... Steve Dodds , who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to make <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> to kill someone and then to kill them, but take my word for it, it only takes a second'".|$|E
500|$|Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who, {{along with}} bandmate James Hetfield {{inducted}} Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said [...] "Black Sabbath is {{and always will}} be synonymous with heavy metal", while Hetfield said [...] "Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside.

2500|$|... "Jaka's Story", {{a tragic}} {{character}} study dealing with gender roles {{and the political}} suppression of art, is generally cited as the series' pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal and began to alienate many long-time fans, his female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in Reads) contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt misogyny, but which Sim describes as [...] "anti-feminism". During {{this part of the}} story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional [...] "reads" [...] author, interspersed with the main Cerebus storyline. [...] In Davis' material, he refers to the [...] "creative male light" [...] and the [...] "emotional female void", a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of Church and State (namely, the [...] "female light" [...] being raped by the [...] "male void" [...] and shattering into the physical universe). As Sim himself says in an interview with The Comics Journal, [...] "Cerebus #1-200 [...] the completion of the story. The yin and yang. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I'm attaching an allegory to the Big Bang. You make <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> which one's the pit and which one's the top of the mountain." [...] By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. Issue #186 was followed by an even harsher essay in the back of issue #265 called [...] "Tangent", in which Sim identified a [...] "feminist/homosexualist axis" [...] that opposed traditional and rational societal values. [...] This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.|$|E

2500|$|After {{performing}} Camelot for six months, in July 1961, Burton met producer Walter Wanger {{who asked}} him to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra. Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film. The gigantic scale of the film's troubled production, Taylor's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton's off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname [...] "Le Scandale") all generated enormous publicity; Life magazine proclaimed it the [...] "Most Talked About Movie Ever Made". Fox's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40million. During filming, Burton met {{and fell in love}} with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, [...] "Has anyone ever told you that you're a very pretty girl?" [...] Taylor later recalled, [...] "I said to myself, Oy gevalt, here's the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he comes out with a line like that." [...] Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her [...] "Miss Tits" [...] and opined to Mankiewicz, [...] "I expect she shaves"; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first for Céligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton's affair with Taylor, cabled him: [...] "Make <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?". Burton replied [...] "Both".|$|E

6000|$|The {{following}} Letters {{were written}} to Mr. Thomas Dixon, a working cork-cutter of Sunderland, during the agitation for Reform {{in the spring}} of the present year. They contain, in the plainest terms I could use, the substance of what I then desired to say to our English workmen, which was briefly this:--"The reform you desire may give you more influence in Parliament; but your influence there will of course be useless to you,--perhaps worse than useless, until you have wisely made <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> what you wish Parliament to do for you; and when you have made <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds</b> about that, you will find, not only that you can do it for yourselves, without the intervention of Parliament; but that eventually nobody but yourselves can do it. And to help you, as far as one of your old friends may, in so making <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>minds,</b> such and such things are what {{it seems to me you}} should ask for, and, moreover, strive for with your heart and might." ...|$|R
