To let it, in such a locality, was impossible, so it must remain <b>unavailable</b> <b>capital,</b> and Honora decided on leaving her old {{housekeeper}} therein, with a respectable married niece, who would inhabit the lower regions, and keep the other rooms in order, for an occasional stay in London. She would have been sorry to cut herself off from a month of London in the spring, and the house might farther be useful to friends who did not object to the situation; or could be lent {{now and then to}} a curate; and she could well afford to keep it up, so she thought herself justified in following her inclination, and went up for three mournful days of settling matters there, and packing books and ornaments till the rooms looked so dismantled that she could not think how to face them again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the strategic {{use of capital}} income taxation and lump-sum fiscal policies for gaining national advantage in an integrated world capital market. Each fiscal authority seeks to maximize a social welfare function defined over the utilities of home country residents incorporating national redistributing objectives. A national optimum policy is to impose a non-discriminatory source-based capital income tax or subsidy along with an optimal lump-sum tax and transfer plan. Residence-based capital income taxes do not augment the set of lump-sum fiscal instruments, although both policies {{can be used to}} influence the world interest rate to national advantage, redistributing welfare internationally. When unrestricted lump-sum fiscal policies are <b>unavailable,</b> source-based <b>capital</b> income taxes may be needed to achieve distributional objectives, so that departures from global production efficiency can arise in a cooperative equilibrium. ...|$|R
40|$|Viet Nam has {{experienced}} spectacular economic {{growth over the}} past decade, in part the result of massive foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. Although {{much has been written}} on the impacts of FDI in developing countries, previous studies have generally ignored macroeconomic consequences in cost-benefit assessments. These macroeconomic aspects can be particularly important in transitional economies like Viet Nam, where some of the tools for macroeconomic stabilization may be blunt or <b>unavailable.</b> First, <b>capital</b> inflow growth needs to be accommodated by real exchange rate appreciation. In dollarized economies like Viet Nam, the nominal exchange rate cannot be relied upon to deliver it, so inflation usually results. In these economies, it is also difficult for the central bank to conduct open market operations to sterilize large capital inflows or mop up excess liquidity. Again, this could feed inflation. The combination of a young and inexperienced banking system and an investment-hungry state-owned enterprises (SOE) sector only exacerbates the situation, and increases the risk of imbalances that could result in crisis. capital inflow; macroeconomic adjustment; FDI; real exchange rate; Viet Nam...|$|R

Frost Company to buy timber rights in British Columbia, and another to the New Orleans Gouther and Grand Isle Railway secured by a rolling stock of dilapidated rail cars. In 1912 it undertook a campaign of expanding into Quebec and eastern Canada, {{to the chagrin of}} the western Canadian Directors who were seeing much of the bank's <b>capital</b> <b>unavailable</b> for western loans. At the same time, many of the large loans went unpaid and the accrued interest, through a form of bank fraud, was recapitalized onto the principal of the loans.|$|R

5000|$|Wartime {{policies}} {{during the}} Russian Civil War {{coincided with a}} large decrease in the country's economy. Industrial output in 1922 was 13% of that in 1914. A recovery followed under the New Economic Policy, which allowed a degree of market flexibility {{within the context of}} socialism. Under Stalin's direction, this was replaced by a system of centrally ordained [...] "Five-Year Plans" [...] in the late 1920s. These called for a highly ambitious program of industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture.With seed <b>capital</b> <b>unavailable</b> because of international reaction to Communist policies, little international trade, and virtually no modern infrastructure, the government of Stalin financed industrialization both by restraining consumption on the part of ordinary Soviet citizens to ensure that capital went for re-investment into industry and by extraction of wealth from kulaks.|$|R

Jordan's {{aim was to}} reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise {{would have to go}} to London if they wanted to obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the Society of Apothecaries. As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type <b>unavailable</b> outside the <b>capital</b> and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} new {{estimates of}} capital inputs in the Chinese economy. Estimates {{are made for}} the total economy (1953 - 2003), for the industrial sector (1978 - 2003) and for the manufacturing sector (1985 - 2003). The estimates for industry and manufacturing are broken down by thirty regions. The main contribution of this paper lies in constructing hitherto <b>unavailable</b> estimates of <b>capital</b> inputs {{at the level of}} Chinese regions. The paper makes a systematic attempt to apply SNA concepts to the estimation of Chinese capital inputs, according to the Perpetual Inventory Method. It makes a clear distinction between capital services and wealth capital stocks. After a general discussion of theoretical issues in capital measurement, the paper provides a detailed analysis of the relevant Chinese statistical concepts and data. It goes on to discuss previous capital estimates {{in the light of the}} modern conceptual and theoretical discussions. It ends with an explanation of the procedures followed in constructing the national and regional capital input series. ...|$|R
