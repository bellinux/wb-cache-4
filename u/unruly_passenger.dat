50|$|Sometimes {{a flight}} must be {{diverted}} to allow an aircraft to dispose itself of an <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> {{as soon as}} possible.|$|E
50|$|In May 2017, Thompson helped Air Canada {{crew and}} other {{passengers}} restrain an <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> who allegedly {{tried to open}} a cabin door on a flight from Jamaica to Toronto, which had to subsequently be diverted to Orlando, Florida.|$|E
5000|$|Froma Harrop says in her {{syndicated}} column {{that if there}} had been an <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger,</b> Slater should not have abandoned his fellow flight crew. She says that even if his story is true, he was just an angry person acting out and not a case of [...] "a working-class hero".|$|E
50|$|In Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{reserves}} {{the right}} to use stun guns to subdue <b>unruly</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station complex {{also has}} long housed an upper Hudson Line station of the MTA Police. <b>Unruly</b> <b>passengers</b> are often put off {{here to be}} taken into custody.|$|R
50|$|Intercity {{bus driving}} is {{generally}} safe but carries its risks for drivers. Accidents occur, {{which can be}} harmful to the driver, passengers, and those in other vehicles involved alike. Dealing with <b>unruly</b> <b>passengers</b> can be another challenge, something which operators are not generally equipped to handle. Such passengers can be harmful to the driver and other passengers alike.|$|R
50|$|Extremely unruly {{passengers}} {{who must be}} restrained are restrained {{using a variety of}} methods. Some airlines carry flexcuffs for this purpose. Others use seatbelts, adhesive tape, neckties, shoe laces, or whatever is available on the aircraft. While the United States does not allow passengers to actually be confined to the seat or any other part of the aircraft, and only allows their individual body parts to be restrained, other countries, such as Iceland, do allow tying an <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> to the seat.|$|E
40|$|Foreword <b>Unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> {{incidents}} {{have received}} considerable media attention {{over the past}} few years. Unruly passengers are those whose demeanour, behaviour or failure to comply with cabin crew directions present a threat to the safety or security of the aircraft and/or those on board. Australian airlines respond to and manage a small but consistent number of <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> incidents every year. Specific strategies implemented by the airlines, the Australian Federal Police and government and regulatory bodies have focused on minimising the occurrence of and risks associated with these incidents. Despite this, <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> incidents continue to occur, with ramifications for the safety and security of the crew, passengers and aircraft. In June 2015, the Australian Institute of Criminology hosted a roundtable to discuss <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> incidents. Participants included Australian airlines, the police, and other government and regulatory agencies involved in aviation security. This paper draws on both international literature and the roundtable discussions to identify issues related to the identification and management of <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> incidents and the minimisation of associated safety and security risks...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 of {{this thesis}} will {{describe}} {{the problem of}} unruly passengers and try to outline and {{explain some of the}} possible reasons for this phenomenon. Afterwards, the existing legal system will be analysed and scrutinized for its effectiveness. Currently, the system to prosecute unruly passengers does not govern the problem to its whole extent so that many offences, especially minor ones, generally stay unpunished. In addition, it contains several loopholes and States do not provide sufficient law enforcement. This is partly due to insufficient rules of jurisdiction since powers of jurisdiction and prosecution can be allocated to several States. After this analysis, with reference to the ICAO proposal on how to solve the problem, suggestions will be made for the improvement of the existing system in order to govern the problem as a whole. Finally, {{the question of how to}} implement such improvements will be addressed. Chapter 2 will deal with passenger rights that are applicable to the problem of unruly passengers. Therefore, the rights of fellow passengers in terms of civil liability of the airline and of an <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> will be outlined. Next, the rights of an <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> himself in cases of mistreatment and blacklisting will be addressed. Although the <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> breaks the law he possesses rights, which must be respected under the rule of law. Finally, a connection between this phenomenon and the "passenger-rights movement" will be drawn...|$|E
50|$|Due {{to extreme}} crowding, <b>unruly</b> <b>passengers</b> (colloquially called Atappers) had been riding {{on top of}} the trains en masse, but that has since been brought under control with {{physical}} barriers. In July 2013, the operator introduced the Commet (Commuter Electronic Ticketing) system replacing the old paper ticket system and changing the old fare system into progressive fare system, as well as modernization of all 80 serving stations.Starting on April 1, 2015, the number of trips per day increased to 872, dominated by Bogor/Depok route and Bekasi route with 391 trips and 153 trips per day, respectively. Headway of Bogor route is 5 minutes, while Bekasi route is still 12 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The Transportation Security Administration in the United States has {{implemented}} security operations {{centers for}} most airports that have federalized security. The primary function of TSA security operations centers is {{to act as}} a communication hub for security personnel, law enforcement, airport personnel and various other agencies involved in the daily operations of airports. SOCs are manned 24-hours a day by SOC watch officers. Security operations center watch officers are trained in all aspects of airport and aviation security and are often required to work abnormal shifts. SOC watch officers also ensure that TSA personnel follow proper protocol in dealing with airport security operations. The SOC is usually the first to be notified of incidents at airports such as the discovery of prohibited items/contraband, weapons, explosives, hazardous materials as well as incidents regarding flight delays, <b>unruly</b> <b>passengers,</b> injuries, damaged equipment and various other types of potential security threats. The SOC in turn relays all information pertaining to these incidents to TSA federal security directors, law enforcement and TSA headquarters.|$|R
40|$|Under the {{framework}} of the European Union Funded SAFEE project(1), this paper gives an overview of a novel monitoring and scene analysis system developed for use onboard aircraft in spatially constrained environments. The techniques discussed herein aim to warn on-board crew about pre-determined indicators of threat intent (such as running or shouting in the cabin), as elicited from industry and security experts. The subject matter experts believe that activities such as these are strong indicators of the beginnings of undesirable chains of events or scenarios, which {{should not be allowed to}} develop aboard aircraft. This project aimes to detect these scenarios and provide advice to the crew. These events may involve <b>unruly</b> <b>passengers</b> or be indicative of the precursors to terrorist threats. With a state of the art tracking system using homography intersections of motion images, and probability based Petri nets for scene understanding, the SAFEE behavioural analysis system automatically assesses the output from multiple intelligent sensors, and creates. recommendations that are presented to the crew using an integrated airborn user interface. Evaluation of the system is conducted within a full size aircraft mockup, and experimental results are presented, showing that the SAFEE system is well suited to monitoring people in confined environments, and that meaningful and instructive output regarding human actions can be derived from the sensor network within the cabin...|$|R
40|$|With {{the first}} proper {{commercial}} sub-orbital “space tourist” flights seemingly around the corner, {{the need to}} develop a proper legal system addressing all relevant parameters, scenarios, and events also arises more visibly. This is particularly true for the United States, where so far the major developments in private manned spaceflight are concentrated, some of which may soon move from relatively straightforward up-and-down sub-orbital trajectories to longer-duration suborbital and/or orbital flights, or even long-duration presence in (potentially private) space stations. As one author succinctly put it: humans are essentially unpredictable, and the longer their flights will be, the less preordained and foreseeable will their activities be. As a consequence, the somewhat haphazard and multifaceted approach US national law has so far taken vis-à-vis space activities now threatens to result in major gaps, notably in the exercise of domestic jurisdiction for the purpose of compliance with US international responsibilities and liabilities under the outer space treaties. In between the regulatory competencies of the FAA (to license launch and reentry), FCC (to license and regulate satellite operations as far as the use of radio-frequencies and attendant orbits is concerned), NOAA (to license and regulate remote sensing satellite operations), and NASA (to regulate life on board manned US civil space vehicles and the ISS, {{at least as far as}} the US modules and/or US astronauts is concerned), questions now arise in Congress for example as to how to legally address a future space tourist turned <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger.</b> The paper addresses these issues in some detail, which includes touching upon some vexing definitional issues as regards “launch,” “re-entry,” “sub-orbital,” “orbital,” and “outer space” itself as these might ultimately have to be clarified before a comprehensive, logical and effective legal regime for exercising of US national jurisdiction as appropriate and necessary can be developed...|$|E
40|$|A contextual inquiry was {{conducted}} at the Systems Operations Control (SOC) of a regional airline with approximately 50 aircraft from the 8 th- 11 th of November 2006. A total of 35 hours of direct observation were conducted with {{various members of the}} SOC Staff including the System Operations Control Shift Manager (SOCSM), the System Customer Service Manager (SCSM), the Dispatchers, and the Line Maintenance Planners (LMP). During the inquiry a wide variety of situations occurred: unscheduled maintenance delays, estimated ready time slips, a lightning strike, aircraft damage from a ground vehicle, a system-wide gate printer outage during a departure push, ATC delays, internet and subsequent ACARS outage, an <b>unruly</b> <b>passenger</b> disruption and turn back, and a sick dispatcher. The vast majority of these situations were handled as if they were no different from routine operations; however, there were moments when the SOC personnel were fully involved in the situation, and other minor tasks were being ignored or transferred to other personnel. The majority of high impact problems faced by the the airline’s SOC on a daily basis came from unscheduled maintenance or IT glitches. Unlike other airlines, ATC restrictions are not often an issue for this airline, although station curfews in southern California do place an additional constraint on the schedule recovery process. Similarly, weather was also only a minor issue during the contextual interview. Beyond the inevitable weather and maintenance interruptions, the majority of problems stemmed from software tools which limited the efficiency of the SOC personnel, and from procedures that required the SOCSM to do certain steps multiple times. For example, {{in order to keep the}} non-SOC personnel informed about the state of the airline, the SOCSM is required to run reports after each routing change and paste them into both email and the shift log. Additionally, the SOCSM is required to manually enter flight data to create new flights or to maintain existing ones. Similarly, the SOCSM is also required to manually enter and maintain maintenance segments for aircraft. The solution to these problems includes making better use of the current software’s functionality, investigating the actual information needs of the routing change recipient list, and incorporating additional automation to automatically create routing change reports and shift logs. The current software includes a capability to create new flights or maintenance segments using a correctly formatted text file. Using this capability would save much time in manual entry and minimize the number of typographical errors. Additional software should also be created to transition the incident reporting system and the shift log to an electronic database to facilitate data analysis. The SOCSM is currently responsible for posting any routing changes to a preset list via email. The actual information needs of these recipients should be reviewed to determine how frequently this information is actually required and whether or not a more scheduled reporting of all routing changes during a given time period might be adequate. Depending on the outcome, it might be possible to consolidate reports to once or twice a shift. Regardless, additional software should be created to automate the reporting process...|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian Air Carrier Protection/Protective Program (CACPP) {{began on}} September 17, 2002 when a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with Transport Canada, the {{authority}} responsible for Canadian aviation security, and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA), {{for the implementation}} and administration of the CACPP. The program is conducted by specially trained undercover, armed RCMP officers (known as Aircraft Protective Officers- APOs) on selected domestic and international flights and all flights to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Pilots and flight attendants are advised of their presence and the officer will physically intervene should an unauthorized person attempt {{to gain control of}} an aircraft. APOs, however, will not be involved in controlling <b>unruly</b> <b>passengers.</b> While they are peace officers within Canadian territories, they rely on section 6(2) of the Tokyo Convention as a legal basis for intervening an incident outside of Canadian airspace. By law, such officers are exempt from acquiring a permit for importing or exporting their duty firearms when crossing the border. However, the exact nature of their weaponry is not released to the public except they are [...] "deadly and effective and should not damage the aircraft." [...] The Canadian Forces Military Police members of the Canadian Forces Air Marshal Detail, are responsible for providing security to Canadian Forces aircraft, crew and passengers - passengers who may include the governor general, the prime minister and members of the royal family.|$|R
50|$|After pilots {{reported}} an <b>unruly</b> Middle-Eastern <b>passenger</b> {{and due to}} confusion and lack of communication between Boston and Cleveland, Delta ordered Flight 1989 to land at Cleveland. The flight reversed course over Toledo, Ohio, and landed uneventfully in Cleveland at 9:47 AM, some 6 minutes after Boston Center called NEADS and told of Delta 1989. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and city SWAT team evacuated the airport and held the aircraft at gunpoint on the tarmac for two hours, though all passengers were cleared. After an investigation by local and FBI authorities, it was concluded there was no threat aboard Delta 1989. As noted by the 9/11 Commission report, “During {{the course of the}} morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south American 11 had already crashed into WTC 1 was the first; Delta 1989 was the second”.|$|R
40|$|Airline {{personnel}} have, increasingly, {{found it}} necessary to deal with <b>unruly</b> and disruptive <b>passengers,</b> some of whom display violent behaviour. This behaviour can result in serious injury to staff and passengers and can compromise the safety of the aircraft. Termed 2 ̆ 7 Air Rage 2 ̆ 7, this phenomenon enjoys regular media attention and airlines, unions and governments are attempting initiatives to tackle this issue. This paper examines the main incidents of air rage and presents reasons why this phenomenon should come to the public eye in recent years. This paper also summarises initiatives that airlines, air transport unions and aviation authorities have introduced in an attempt to combat air rage incidents. Finally, the paper concludes by reporting on preliminary research undertaken to assess the importance of including air rage in higher education curricula and discussing the role higher education can play in better preparing graduates to deal with these situations...|$|R
50|$|Following {{his role}} as Chief of Staff, Huberman was named by Mayor Daley to be President of the Chicago Transit Authority in 2007. His {{appointment}} to head the second largest public transit system in the U.S. was greeted as a “breath of fresh air” as Huberman pledged to press for better system-wide performance, employee accountability and an emphasis on customer service. Huberman addressed customer communication, oversaw investment in new rail-car and bus technology, and brought his Performance Management process to the agency. He mothballed a project that was running $100 million over budget, negotiated new labor contracts that saved the system more than $100 million and improved operations by significantly reducing “Slow Zones” on the system’s rail lines, the “L", while increasing ridership. He also oversaw negotiations for long-term agreements with the CTA’s 21 collective bargaining units which included pension and health care savings. Huberman, an avowed “L” rider during his tenure at the CTA, once removed an <b>unruly</b> and disorderly <b>passenger</b> from a train he was riding on after the rider verbally harassed a female passenger.|$|R
