40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the discoloration of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) specimens treated with different chemicals and surface coated with different <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> before being subjected to artificial weathering. The results showed that the influence of coatings containing <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> (<b>UV</b> screeners micronized TiO 2 and UVA of hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine types) were similar to each other. The UV screener TiO 2 led to the least discoloration of the coated wood surface, closely followed by the UVA of hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines (HPT). The color stability was determined to be better for pine wood treated with micronized copper preservative coated with <b>UV</b> <b>absorber,</b> in comparison to when it was only coated with <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> and then subjected to weathering. Microscopic observation revealed that the clear-coats penetration behavior was different in wood preservative-treated and in untreated wood of Scots pine, which has various extractives. However, the color stability and coating penetration was nearly the same in beech wood treated with preservatives and in untreated beech wood. We provide an explanation for why these effects occurred and discuss the implications of our findings for the development of weather-resistant wood materials...|$|R
40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/{{ionization}} (MALDI) {{has been}} widely used as a soft ionization technique and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) {{has been used to}} characterize polymeric materials. 1 - 5 MALDI is achieved in two steps. 6 - 9 In the first step, a mixture solution of an analyte and a matrix is spotted on the sample plate, and is dried before analysis. A solid solution deposit of analyte-doped matrix crystals is obtained, and the analyte molecules are completely isolated from each other by embedding throughout the matrix. The second step involves ablation of the solid solution by pulse laser. The pulse laser irradiation induces rapid heating to cause sublimation of the matrix crystals and ionization can occur during this process. Selection of the matrix in MALDI-MS absolutely affect the MALDI process. 1, 2 o-Hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole and hydroxyphenyl tri-azine derivatives are commonly used as <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers.</b> They absorb destructive <b>UV</b> radiation and dissipate the energy in the form of heat. 9 - 15 In general, the <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> absorb <b>UV</b> wavelength between 295 and 400 nm, so they can potential-ly play a role as a matrix in MALDI analysis. 16, 17 In this study, the <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> were employed as the matrix to analyze polystyrene (PS) using MALDI-MS.

In this study, an organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating that consist of a UV-curing paint, ethyl acetate, anhydrous alcohol, and BTZ- 1 was prepared, and the behaviour of this coating applied on OBS (sample D) when exposed to UV radiation was investigated. The colour characterization has demonstrated {{the efficiency of the}} organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating in promoting the stability of L* and ∆E*. The results of glossiness showed that the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> coating exhibited a high gloss retention during weathering treatment. A positive correlation between CAs and SFE stabilities of samples and the application amount of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> (BTZ- 1) was noticed. The chemical structure of the coating after the addition of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> became more stable during exposure. The slight colour change, high gloss retention, slight CAs/SFE changes, and high functional group stability illustrate that the rate of degradation is much lower for sample D with the applied coat d than that for the control sample (A and B). In conclusion, the addition of the organic <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> improved the exterior durability of OBS. The coating d is considered to be the best UV shielding layer in this study and is effective in protecting OBS and reducing the surface photodegradation of the substrate and the coating.|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} that the outflowing <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> in Seyfert 1 galaxies arise primarily in their inner narrow (emission) line regions (NLRs), based on similarities in their locations, kinematics, and physical conditions. 1) Hubble Space Telescope observations show that nearly all Seyfert galaxies have bright, central knots of [O III] emission in their NLRs with radii of tens of parsecs. These sizes are consistent with most previous estimates of the distances of <b>UV</b> (and X-ray) <b>absorbers</b> from their central continuum sources, and a recently obtained reliable distance of ~ 25 pc for a <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. 2) The nuclear emission-line knots {{in a sample of}} 10 Seyfert galaxies have velocity widths of 300 - 1100 km/s (half-width at zero intensity), similar to the radial velocities of most <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers.</b> The highest radial velocity for a Seyfert <b>UV</b> <b>absorber</b> to date is only - 2100 km/s, which is much lower than typical broad-line region (BLR) velocities.

Using a STIS spectrum of the nuclear emission-line knot in NGC 4151, obtained when the continuum and BLR fluxes were low, we are able to match the observed line ratios with photoionization models that require a component with Cg ~ 1 and an ionization parameter and hydrogen column density that are typical of <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers...</b>|$|R

A modern trend in medical chemistry is the design of multifunctional molecules such as <b>UV</b> <b>absorbers</b> covalently bound to nitroxides, which provides both UV protec-tion and antioxidant properties combined in the same molecule. In the present work, we report the synthesis of conjugates of a natural <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> kynurenine (KN) with nitroxides (KN-RNO• conjugates) {{and the study of}} their photochemical properties in aqueous and methanol solutions.

The reaction of intramolecular electron transfer between photoexcit-ed KN and nitroxide moieties is the main factor determining the quantum yield of KN-RNO • conjugates photodecomposition. Consequently, KN-RNO • conjugates in aqueous solution are photochemically less stable than the parent KN molecule.

Somewhat unexpectedly, each component has a covering factor (of the continuum source + broad emission line region) of about 0. 6.
