Just as Michael Porter’s “five forces” {{provided}} a practical analytical tool for describing {{the forces that}} shape competitive strategy, so business ethicists ought to provide business leaders with a workable framework for understanding the sources of ethical obligations. The forces that shape compet-itive strategy vary according to time and industry, but are anchored in an <b>ultimate</b> <b>criteria</b> of profitability. Similarily, ethics can use a set of analytical categories that identify the relevant forces to business ethics {{on the basis of}} relationality.

40|$|Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic {{tumors in}} {{children}} and adolescents are a relatively common group of soft tissue proliferations that range from reactive to hamartomatous to neoplastic, with a full spectrum of benign, intermediate, and malignant neoplasms. These lesions are diagnostically challenging because of morphologic and immunohistochemical overlap, despite significant clinical, genetic, and prognostic differences. The fibromatoses are a major subgroup, and all types of fibromatoses can occur in the 1 st 2 decades of life. Intermediate and malignant fibroblastic-myofibroblastic tumors are an important group that includes variants of fibrosarcoma and other tumors with recurrent cytogenetic or molecular genetic abnormalities and low metastatic potential. Pathologic examination is enhanced by adjunct techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics, although morphology provides the <b>ultimate</b> <b>criteria</b> for a specific diagnosis.

The project of 'legalizing of human rights', which I understand as involving both the institution of a legal protection of human rights and their recognition as a fundamental norm of the legal order, despite important achievements, remains fraught with difficulties. First, experience shows that legalization of human rights presents certain flipsides. Second, as illustrated by recent developments, the attitude of European states and EU institutions indicates that, while accepting human rights in theory, in practice they remain ambivalent towards the constraints deriving from these norms...|$|E

The <b>ultimate</b> <b>criteria</b> for controlling a complete plant have been systematically addressed only infrequently. In principle, the effluent has to meet the standard at a minimal cost. Basically, the process is at the time driven by disturbances, mostly via the influent flow, but sometimes created within the plant. An essential task for any control system is to either minimise {{the consequences of the}} disturbances or to even eliminate them, before they hit the process. In this paper the main purpose is to systematically classify cause-effect relationships between available knowledge and open questions. This qualitative reasoning is meant to better define what can be achieved in the operation of a plant. The dynamic of an activated sludge system span over several orders of magnitude, from seconds to months. These different time scales allow many control actions to be decoupled. As a result, slowly varying variables can be controlled while assuming the fast dynamics to be instantaneous. Likewise fast varying variables may be manipulated while the slow modes are considered constant...|$|E

40|$|Binding {{degeneracy}} {{is thought}} to constitute a fundamental property of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), yet its structural basis is poorly understood. We determined the crystal structure of a complex involving the BM 3. 3 TCR and a peptide (pBM 8) bound to the H- 2 K(bm 8) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, and compared it with the structures of the BM 3. 3 TCR bound to H- 2 K(b) molecules loaded with two peptides that had a minimal level of primary sequence identity with pBM 8. Our findings provide a refined structural view of the basis of BM 3. 3 TCR cross-reactivity and a structural explanation for the long-standing paradox that a TCR antigen-binding site can be both specific and degenerate. We also measured the thermodynamic features and biological penalties that incurred during cross-recognition. Our data illustrate the difficulty for a given TCR in adapting to distinct peptide-MHC surfaces while still maintaining affinities that result in functional in vivo responses. Therefore, when induction of protective effector T cells is used as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>criteria</b> for adaptive immunity, TCRs are probably much less degenerate than initially assumed...|$|E

In this paper, we summarize recent advances in biological research for direct CO 2 injection and discuss required research work for the future. Possible biological impacts caused by CO 2 storage in the ocean can be categorized into acute and chronic. Acute impacts such as on the survival of marine organisms could be determined by laboratory and field experiments and assessed by simulation models. Chronic impacts, on the other hand, such as sub-lethal effects {{would be difficult to}} verify by the same approach as for acute impacts. One of the practical solutions for this issue is field experiments starting with controlled small-scale and, eventually, large-scale CO 2 injection intended to determine ecosystem alteration. Practical {{implementation of}} CO 2 ocean sequestration must employ a comprehensive monitoring program of its biological impacts.

40|$|Research on {{behavioral}} {{factors in}} automobile driving (e. g. perception, motivation, per-sonality) is hindered {{by the fact}} that the <b>ultimate</b> <b>criteria</b> of driving ability-accidents or traffic violations-are relatively infrequent. The influence of any given behavioral factor is obscured, since a crash or citation depends on the con~uence of several determinants which may converge only a few times in the course of a year. In studying the effects of a particular training program, for example. one ordinarily has to use large samples and wait several months for the evidence to accumulate. The latter procedure is self-defeating if the effect of the program is real but temporary, since the likeli-hood of detection will diminish as the data-gathering period extends. There is therefore a pressing need for interrrre&nte criteriu-measurement tools which can detect short-term changes in intervening variables which govern the likelihood of the occurrence of accidents or violations. The search for vafid intermediate criteria has been frustrating. Verbal tests of knowledge. for example, seem to have little relationship [...] or even a negative relationship-with driving record [note. for example, Crancer er nl [...] 19711. Performance tests such as simple reaction time have likewise been disappointing [Gold-stein, 19611. An alternative approach which appears somewhat more promising has been to measure the perceptual accuracy of drivers. Spicer [19641 devised a film showing eleven 34 -min seg-ments representing a variety of traffic situations: after each segment, subjects selected from a check-list whatever features they had noticed that were of importance to them.

40|$|In his book, The Concept of Law, H. L. A. Hart claims {{there are}} two conditions, {{necessary}} and sufficient, {{for the existence of}} a legal system. First, there are those rules of behavior which are valid according to the system 2 ̆ 7 s criteria of validity and they must be generally obeyed. Secondly, there is the rule of recognition specifying the criteria of legal validity and its rules of change and adjudication which must be effectively accepted as common public standards of official behavior by the system 2 ̆ 7 s officials. The acceptance of the rule of recognition finds expression when the rule is viewed from an internal perspective. Hart does not explain what this internal perspective is or how it supports the general concept of acceptance, yet he insists on its importance. Hart states, 2 ̆ 2 this is not merely a matter of the efficacy or health of the legal system, but is a logically necessary condition of our ability to speak of the existence of a single legal system 2 ̆ 2 (CL, pp. 112 - 113). In fact, Hart rejects the command theory model of law because it lacks the necessary settled character that a legal system should possess. The settled character is contained in the internal perspective, and constitutes a sense of obligation. Without this sense of obligation, an internal perspective, and the acceptance of the rule of recognition, a legal system lacks validity. The internal perspective, however, seems to share in certain principles of a moral nature for its general expression. Such a relationship is denied by Hart. In criticizing natural law theory, which Hart believes follows in the Thomistic tradition, he maintains that there is no necessary connection between law and morality; and that where such a connection has been pushed, the consequences for law are negative. A closer analysis of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s theory will show that his internal perspective does indeed have ties to moral principles and that his critique of the Thomistic natural law tradition is off base. Given these facts, two alternatives will emerge for Hart. The first alternative will involve dropping the notion of acceptance which expresses the internal perspective and provides a system with its <b>ultimate</b> <b>criteria</b> of validity in the rule of recognition, given the necessary and sufficient conditions of a legal system. This alternative will prove untenable for Hart because it will render Hart 2 ̆ 7 s proposed improvements on the command theory model ineffective. The second alternative, which I think Hart must accept, will involve developing a legal psychology which will reinforce Hart 2 ̆ 7 s notion of acceptance for the internal perspective which undergirds the rule of recognition and subsequently his notion of validity with respect to the necessary and sufficient conditions of a legal system. This second alternative poses a potential compromise of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s denial of the necessary connection between law and morality. However, it will be demonstrated that accepting the possibility of a necessary relationship between law and morality is far less damaging to his theory than maintaining that distinction while hanging his theory on an ill-formed internal perspective. Ultimately, a blend of Hart 2 ̆ 7 s legal theory and St. Thomas 2 ̆ 7 will produce a most coherent and viable alternative foundation for a legal system...|$|E
