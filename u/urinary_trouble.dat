40|$|Abstract: An ethnobotanical {{study focused}} on {{medicinal}} utility of plants was carried out among the Munda and Santal communities of Tripura, India with aims to document the traditional knowledge of the medicinal plants used in various ailments. The information was based on normal conversation, interview and discussion with local herbal practitioners, elderly {{men and women of}} different tribal communities. In this study, a total of 31 plant species belonging to 23 families were described which have been used in the treatment of around 27 diseases. Most frequently medicated claims were dentalgia diabetes and gastritis. Apart from them the other uses includes gynaecological problems, cuts and wounds, skin diseases, <b>urinary</b> <b>troubles</b> All these claims need to be subjected to previous established literature to validate the potentiality of these plants and plant parts as drugs...|$|R
40|$|Medicinal plants provide rich {{resources}} of ingredients {{which can be}} used in drug development and synthesis. In Pakistan Periploca aphylla Decne. (Asclepiadoideae) is used to treat gastrointestinal, dermatological and topical diseases whereas Fagonia olivieri (Zygophyllaceae) is generally used for the cure of cancer, diabetes, asthma, fever, toothache, <b>urinary</b> discharges, stomach <b>troubles</b> and renal disorders. This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological activities of P. aphylla and F. olivieri using in vitro and in vivo models. The fresh samples (whole plant) of P. aphylla and F. olivieri were collected and made in to a fine powder after shade drying. Methanol extract of powder was resolved with escalating polarity to get fractions; n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and residual aqueous fraction. The extract/fractions were subjected to phytochemical analysis which showed the existence of tannins, saponins, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, alkaloids, phlobatannins and flavonoids. All the extracts/fractions showed potent activity against Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteria and fungal species. However, the most active fractions of F. olivieri were ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous while methanol, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of P. aphylla exhibited activity against a maximum number of strains as compared to other fractions. These fractions also exhibited good cytotoxic activity as the maximum (96. 66...|$|R
