40|$|<b>Upland</b> <b>moors</b> are {{dominated}} by Heather (Calluna Valguris), the most characteristic vegetation type in Scotland. These moorlands have significant economic and conservative value. However, due to increasing pressure {{from a range of}} environmental stresses such as over grazing, recreational use, species invasion and aforistation. the extent and quality of vegetation cover is declining in these <b>upland</b> <b>moors</b> leading to a reduction in peat accumulation, habitat loss, erosion and landscape change. As rates of habitat and ecosystem destruction continue to rise, the need for proper understanding, conserving and up-to-date inventories become a very sensitive issue and of utmost importance (Wilson, 1998). Therefore, vegetation mapping and classification is needed to generate accurate and timely information of <b>upland</b> <b>moors.</b> However, due to the extent and remoteness of uplands, manual survey is difficult. Remote Sensing offers an alternative approach to classify heather canopies, but the most appropriate spatial resolution for specific levels of classification accuracy still needs to be determined...|$|R

Grasses are abundant in places, and Cyperaceae form the dominant ground cover in wet hollows. On flatter areas between the <b>upland</b> <b>moor</b> and the forest edge are areas of moorland or upland grassland composed of Agrostis producta, Festuca convoluta (Poa kilimanjarica), Koeleria gracilis (Koeleria capensis), Deschampsia sp., Exotheca abyssinica and Andropogon amethystinus, with scattered bushes of Adenocarpus mannii, Kotschya recurvifolia and Myrica meyeri-johannis (Morella salicifolia). Various species of Helichrysum are found in the grasslands and in the <b>upland</b> <b>moor.</b> Two distinct forms of giant groundsel occur on the upper mountain: Senecio johnstonii cottonii, endemic to the mountain and only occurring above 3600 meters , and S.johnstonii johnstonii which occurs between 2,450 meters and 4,000 meters, and shows two distinct forms. At all altitudes Senecio favours the damper and more sheltered locations, and in the alpine bogs is associated with another conspicuous plant, growing up to 10m tall, the endemic giant lobelia Lobelia deckenii.

Over the 4 -year duration of the experiment, {{the cover of the}} Calluna canopy increased in density over time as part of normal phenological development. Moss cover increased initially in response to N addition but then remained static; increases in cover in response to P addition became stronger over time, eventually causing reductions in the cover of the dominant Calluna canopy. Lichen cover virtually disappeared within 4 years in plots receiving + 20 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 and also in separate plots receiving + 10 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1, but this effect was reversed by the addition of P. Phosphorus supply increased the cover of understorey mosses, which in turn caused decreases in the cover of the dominant Calluna canopy. ...|$|E
40|$|There are policy {{pressures}} to make agriculture more environmentally sustainable {{and to give}} a more local expression to agri-environmental priorities. This paper considers these moves, with particular reference to the beef sector, and speculates on the further policy responses required to facilitate benign local agri-environmental management. The UK beef sector is characterized by its complexity and diversity but four major systems can be identified operating at varying levels of intensity. Of these, suckler herds and grass-rearing systems have long been associated with high natural value forms of agricultural land management. Many of the cherished habitats and landscapes of the UK are dependent upon grazing for their ecological and amenity value. However {{a combination of the}} BSE crisis, the strength of sterling and the recent Foot & Mouth epidemic threatens the sustainability of these high nature value grazing systems. The importance of grazing to fifty selected Sites of Special Scientific Interest is highlighted in the paper. Survey work identified a wide range of systems to be particularly vulnerable to changes in profitability in the beef sector, including: coastal grazing marsh, wet acidic grassland / marshland, <b>upland</b> <b>moor</b> and heath, calcareous grassland and neutral grassland. To maintain these systems requires agricultural policy to be more sensitive to local conditions than appears currently to be the case. There is little policy support for beef farmers in a regional context, still less giving special prominence to those farming within particular biotopes. Nor has there been sufficient policy encouragement to markets for traditional and local beef breeds. The continuing pressure for CAP reform offers further opportunity for policies to be devolved to regions and localities...|$|E
40|$|Bassenthwaite Lake is, in many ways, {{different}} from the other major lakes in the English Lake District: it is the most northerly, the shallowest, has the largest catchment and the shortest mean retention time. There is also considerable temporal variation in lake level. Although the lake is surrounded by rich lowland soils, the catchment is dominated by <b>upland</b> <b>moor</b> and improved pasture, underlain by four dominant soil types: well drained loam with bare rocks and scree, shallow acid upland peat, fine loam and thick acidic peat soils. The supply of catchment-derived sediment, and its recycling within the lake, has serious implications for water quality and for the ecology of this site. These sediments largely comprise inorganic material, and are believed to originate mainly from the high fells and the floodplain of the River Derwent. Typically the lake thermally stratifies between May and September, and is mixed {{for the remainder of the}} year. However, the lake is only ever weakly stratified and episodic mixing events influence the ecology of the lake, by increasing the concentration of oxygen at depth and resuspending sediment in shallow water. Palaeolimnological reconstruction of long-term changes in total phosphorus concentration has revealed that, over the past 250 years, the lake has become increasingly eutrophic, with increases in phosphorus concentration being particularly dramatic in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. Though tertiary sewage treatment was implemented at Keswick (the principal town in the catchment) in 1995, there has been only a slight reduction in phosphorus concentration in the lake. At present, diffuse sources contribute more to the total phosphorus load than do point sources and it is suspected that efficient internal recycling of a relatively modest sediment store, caused by wind-driven resuspension, may be one reason for the limited reduction in phosphorus availability. ...|$|E
