5|$|Following {{continued}} turmoil {{between the}} centre-right parties, {{there was even}} an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right national <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> on a balanced budget program, an idea he did not reject. He was the headline speaker at the single largest Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in Tønsberg in 1928. In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship Stella Polaris, holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali {{resigned}} {{from his post}} on 6 September following the Ba'ath Party's withdrawal from the cabinet. As a result, Quwatli attempted to nominate Lutfi al-Haffar as Prime Minister, but reneged after opposition from the Ba'athists. Afterward, Quwatli asked Rushdi al-Kikhiya to form a cabinet, but the latter refused, citing that influence from the Syrian Army would deprive his government of real power. President Nasser of Egypt recommended the reappointment of Asali, but Quwatli refused, instead opting for Said al-Ghazzi, an independent. Ghazzi agreed and subsequently presided over a national <b>unity</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> {{suffered}} a partial collapse in 1995. The continuing violence, along with appointing {{of local government}} officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi, caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu government members, including prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu and interior minister Seth Sendashonga. Twagiramungu resigned in August, and Kagame fired Sendashonga and three others the next day. Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but {{the makeup of the}} new government was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame. Twagiramungu and Sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving the government.|$|E
5|$|In May 1996, about 200 {{soldiers}} of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people. Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a national <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> in early 1997. The Patassé government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the Bangui Agreements in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy. The same year, the rebel troops refused a military base in Bangui and in June a new revolt broke out.|$|E
5|$|Since 30 May 1990 (the first multi-party {{parliamentary}} election held following the 45-year Communist rule), the Republic of Croatia {{has had a}} total of twelve governments headed by ten different prime ministers. The prime minister in the first government after the first multi-party election was Stjepan Mesić, who would later go {{on to become the}} President of Croatia. That government was formed by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), as were seven other governments of Croatia. Three governments have been formed by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and one was a national <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> (representing a wide coalition of political parties) formed during the Croatian War of Independence's peak, between July 1991 and August 1992, with Franjo Gregurić as the prime minister.|$|E

5|$|Both in 1991 {{and years}} later, Špegelj criticised Tuđman's {{decision}} to disregard his advice {{to attack the}} JNA barracks earlier than Septemberspecifically during the Ten-Day War in Slovenia in JuneJuly 1991. Špegelj said that an earlier move, preempting deterioration of the strategic situation in Croatia, would best serve Croatian defensive needs. Furthermore, {{he said that the}} JNA would be unable to respond in force because it would need two months to mobilise the required forces and that all prerequisites for a decisive victory against the JNA were met. Tus thought that Tuđman kept postponing the blockade because of the pressure applied by the international community against confrontation with the JNA. Zdravko Tomac, deputy prime minister of a national <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> in Croatia at the time, and later an opposition leader, stated that while Špegelj's view was militarily correct, Tuđman's position was politically better. Kadijević conversely said that the JNA would have fared better if Croatian forces had confronted it earlier because the JNA's capabilities declined during the summer of 1991.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003 general {{elections}} were held again, and the CPP won. However, {{they failed to}} secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, {{as required by the}} constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.|$|E

In the 1969 elections Rakah again won three seats. During the 1973 elections Rakah saw a rise in support as the party picked up four seats.|$|R

During the <b>unity</b> <b>governments</b> that lasted from 1984 until 1990, responsibility for Israeli Arab affairs was given to a Minister without Portfolio; Ezer Weizman (Yahad/Alignment), Moshe Arens (Likud) and Ehud Olmert (Likud).|$|R
5|$|The CRPP {{maintained}} frosty {{relations with}} FUNCINPEC, which had earlier ousted Ranariddh as its president in 2006. When Ranariddh {{announced plans to}} form the party in February 2014, several FUNCINPEC leaders including Nhek Bun Chhay, Keo Puth Rasmey and Sisowath Sirirath questioned Ranariddh's leadership abilities and past political track record. Ranariddh was particularly critical of the CNRP and in March 2014, he denied accusations by CNRP leader Sam Rainsy that the CRPP was formed {{with the aim of}} splitting the opposition voter base. Ranariddh also charged that the Rainsy would end Cambodia's status as a constitutional monarchy if they were elected to power. In May 2014, Ranariddh called on the CPP and CNRP to form a <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> and proposed that the CRPP was keen to act as a mediator between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|At the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990, {{under the}} Australian-sponsored Cambodian Peace Plan, {{representatives of the}} CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power-sharing {{arrangement}} by forming a <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> known as the Supreme National Council (SNC). The SNC's role was to represent Cambodian sovereignty on the international stage, while the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was tasked with supervising the country's domestic policies until a Cambodian government was elected by the people through a peaceful, democratic process. Cambodia's pathway to peace proved to be difficult, as Khmer Rouge leaders decided {{not to participate in}} the general elections, but instead they chose to disrupt the electoral process by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants. In May 1993, Sihanouk's FUNCINPEC movement defeated the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), formerly the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), to win the general elections. However, the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia, where most of the CPP's votes were drawn from, would secede from Cambodia. To avoid such an outcome, Norodom Ranariddh, the leader of FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP. Shortly afterwards, the constitutional monarchy was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed Cambodian Government.|$|E
5|$|Greece– November 2011– After intense {{criticism}} from {{within his own}} party, the opposition and other EU governments, for his proposal to hold {{a referendum on the}} austerity and bailout measures, PM George Papandreou of the PASOK party announced his resignation in favour of a national <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> between three parties, of which only two currently remain in the coalition. Following the vote in the Greek parliament on the austerity and bailout measures, which both leading parties supported but many MPs of these two parties voted against, Papandreou and Antonis Samaras expelled a total of 44 MPs from their respective parliamentary groups, leading to PASOK losing its parliamentary majority. The early Greek legislative election, 2012 were {{the first time in the}} history of the country, at which the bipartisanship (consisted of PASOK and New Democracy parties), which ruled the country for over 40 years, collapsed in votes as a punishment for their support to the strict measures proposed by the country's foreign lenders and the Troika (consisted of the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank). The popularity of PASOK dropped from 42.5% in 2010 to as low as 7% in some polls in 2012. The radical right-wing, extreme left-wing, communist and populist political parties that have opposed the policy of strict measures, won the majority of the votes.|$|E

5|$|The new {{constitution}} came into force on 24 September 1993, and Sihanouk was reinstated as the King of Cambodia. A permanent coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC, CPP {{and a third}} political party, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP). In turn, Sihanouk made Ranariddh and Hun Sen First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively. Shortly after that, Sihanouk left for Beijing, where he spent several months for cancer treatment. In April 1994 Sihanouk returned, and the following month called the government to hold new elections so that the Khmer Rouge could be co-opted into the government. Both Ranariddh and Hun Sen rejected his suggestion, but Sihanouk pressed on, and further proposed a national <b>unity</b> <b>government</b> consisting of FUNCINPEC, CPP, and the Khmer Rouge headed by him. Again, both prime ministers rejected Sihanouk's proposal, arguing that Khmer Rouge's past intransigent attitude made the proposal unrealistic. Sihanouk backed down, and expressed frustration that Hun Sen and Ranariddh had been ignoring him. As both Norodom Sirivudh and Julio Jeldres, his younger half-brother and official biographer, respectively, saw it, this was a clear sign that the monarchy's ability to exert control over national affairs had diminished, at least vis-a-vis the prime ministers.|$|E
