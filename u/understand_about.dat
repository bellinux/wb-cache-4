25|$|I had {{carefully}} learned to <b>understand,</b> <b>about</b> that experience which I could have upon things of rule, how fortune is failing or great, subject to such rule in common, so that otherwise I {{would have had}} scant reason to desire such a rule, had I not found myself obliged to it through God’s bidding and nature. Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then my good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that I should take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
25|$|At a young age, {{children}} can already utilize {{their knowledge of}} different social categories to form stereotypes about what they <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people’s behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An {{example of this is}} the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys. Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience. The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.|$|E
25|$|At current state, the Internet {{provides}} {{a form of}} education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs, minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways. For example, users attempting to learn the minority language may opt to read and <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> it in a majority language and stop there, resulting in a loss instead of gain in the potential speakers of the minority language. Also, speakers of minority languages may be encouraged to learn the more common languages that are being used on the Web {{in order to gain}} access to more resources, and in turn leading to a decline in their usage of their own language. The future of endangered minority languages in view of the spread of Internet remains to be observed.|$|E

500|$|Tim Minear and Joss Whedon {{pointed out}} two scenes that, they believed, {{articulated}} {{the mood of}} the show exceptionally clearly. One scene is in the original pilot [...] "Serenity", when Mal is eating with chopsticks and a Western tin cup is by his plate; the other is in [...] "The Train Job" [...] pilot, when Mal is thrown out of a holographic bar window. The DVD set's [...] "making-of" [...] documentary explains the distinctive frontispiece of the series (wherein Serenity soars over a herd of horses) as Whedon's attempt to capture [...] "everything you need to <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> the series in five seconds".|$|E

[...] Moon later said in a talk to church members: [...] "Why did we put so much effort into the movie Inchon? No matter what the result the motivation was for people to <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> MacArthur. I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people. MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together. He really respected and loved the people. He also loved God very much and fought with great strength against tyranny and communism. That is what I want the people to understand." ...|$|E
500|$|Atwell {{referred}} to Carter's relationship with Jarvis as the series' comic relief, while Fazekas called their relationship [...] "the center {{relationship of the}} show". Executive producer Tara Butters compared the relationship to that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the early seasons of The X-Files, where [...] "you really believed they cared about each other but it wasn’t sexual. That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, so, when she comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts is a really interesting story for him, which is, how much did he really <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... we will see in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{children}} younger than 3 or 4 years old may have any theory of mind is a topic of debate among researchers. It is a challenging question, due {{to the difficulty of}} assessing what pre-linguistic children <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> others and the world. [...] Tasks used in research into the development of ToM must take into account the umwelt—(the German word 'Umwelt' means [...] "environment" [...] or [...] "surrounding world")—of the pre-verbal child.|$|E

We're awful. And the Yankees are usually really good. So why do you boo us? You should feel badly for us. We root for this awful team that never wins and yet the Yankees fans boo us.

2500|$|The {{original}} Semitic base (Siculo-Arabic) comprises around {{one-third of}} the Maltese vocabulary, especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words, but {{about half of the}} vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian; [...] and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary. A recent study shows that, in terms of basic everyday language, speakers of Maltese are able to understand {{less than a third of}} what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic, which is related to Siculo-Arabic, whereas speakers of Tunisian are able to <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> 40% of what is said to them in Maltese. This reported level of asymmetric intelligibility is considerably lower than the mutual intelligibility found between Arabic dialects.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} the {{scientists}} observed that, unlike young children, Genie would never use any piece of grammar before complete comprehension. She also never spoke with the excessive specificity and overly marked words, such as [...] "tooked", that are characteristic {{of people in this}} phase of language acquisition. Furthermore, whereas children typically begin to use two-word phrases when their vocabulary is about 50 words, Genie only began to do so after she could use and <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> 200, matching the timeline previously observed in children with various types of aphasia. Curtiss also noted that when Genie used the word dog to describe any dog but not other animals, indicating she understood how to use generic terms, and that upon learning the name of the Riglers' dog she recognized that name was specific to him. In 1978, language psychologist Susan Goldin-Meadow suggested Genie's lack of overgeneralization may have been due to differences between the mind of a young child versus an adolescent as opposed to the properties of early language acquisition. She also had many more action verbs than normal in her early vocabulary.|$|E
40|$|Whenever natural {{resource}} professionals discuss the future, issues arise to which “education” is the answer.

2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to <b>understand</b> <b>about</b> making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E

40|$|New {{methods of}} {{dissident}} surveillance employed by repressive nation-states increasingly involve socially engineering targets into unwitting cooperation (e. g., by convincing them {{to open a}} malicious attachment or link).

We conducted in-depth interviews of 30 potential targets of Middle Eastern and Horn of Africa-based governments, also examining settings and software on their computers and phones. Our engagement illuminates the ways that likely targets are vulnerable to the types of social engineering employed by nation-states...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionarily}} conserved TGF-β proteins {{are distributed}} ubiquitously {{throughout the body}} and {{have a role in}} almost every biological process. In immunity, TGF-β has an important role in modulating immunity. Much is <b>understood</b> <b>about</b> the process of TGF-β production as a latent molecule and of the consequences and the intercellular signaling of active TGF-β binding to its receptors; however, there is little discussed between the production and activation of TGF-β. This review focuses on what is <b>understood</b> <b>about</b> the biochemical and physiological processes of TGF-β activation and identifies the gaps in understanding immune cell activation of TGF-β. A mechanistic understanding of the process activating TGF-β can lead to regulating multiple biological systems by enhancing or inhibiting TGF-β activation...|$|R
