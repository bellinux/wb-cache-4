5|$|Regardless of the {{corrective}} measures chosen {{to solve the}} current predicament, as long as cross border capital flows remain unregulated in the euro area, current account imbalances are likely to continue.

5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Agency had produced no coordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith created a new Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Langer's staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By December 1, Smith had formed a Directorate for Administration. The Agency would <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.|$|E

But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E

5|$|The X-Files is an American science fictionsupernatural {{television}} series that originally aired on the Fox network from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002. The series centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully is assigned to make scientific analyses of Mulder's discoveries which could <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> used to discredit his work. Throughout the series the two develop a close friendship. During the eighth and ninth seasons of the series, Duchovny's role was reduced from lead actor to an intermittent lead role.|$|E

However, CASS4 may <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> relevant in clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other types of cancer). At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{knee injury}} would limit Comminges to just two {{appearances}} during the 2009–10 season, missing {{nine months of}} first-team action {{as a result of}} the injury. He had suffered the injury during training at the club after teammate Jay Bothroyd fell awkwardly onto Comminges, causing his knee ligament to detach. Comminges originally attempted to continue training but was ordered not to by manager Dave Jones on the advice of club doctors, who later discovered the severity of the injury. Comminges' contract was initially due to expire at the end of the season but, having suffered the injury, he was offered a six-month extension by the club until January 2011 in order to regain fitness and improve his chances of finding a new club. His appearance as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away victory at Plymouth Argyle on 18 August 2009 would <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> his last for the club.|$|E
5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would <b>ultimately</b> <b>be</b> short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E
