40|$|In this thesis, two {{different}} optical management techniques for organics based solar cells are explored. The first part {{is focused on}} the development of a textured rear reflector for OPVs. The use of textured reflector (TR) facilitates an increase in the optical path length along with light trapping within the active layer. TR was fabricated through a relatively simpler technique by depositing metal films over a microlens array (MLA). Zinc oxide nanoparticles were used to minimize the shadowing effect. Using TR, enhancements in short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiencies up to 10 - 25 % were demonstrated for a polymer based organic solar cell. The second part is focused on improving the effectiveness of MLA incorporation in OPVs. The increase in path length achieved <b>using</b> <b>MLA</b> can be improved by increasing the refractive index of MLA and incorporating MLA directly on the transparent electrode instead of glass substrate. This approach could avoid the optical losses occurring at the interface between MLA and glass substrate and increase the net path length of light within the active layer.

In order to {{determine}} the specificity of this resistance in barley, we extended our previous mapping efforts to include blast isolates from barley and rice grown in Thailand and we assessed two resistance phenotypes: leaf blast (LB) and neck blast (NB). The largest-effect resistance QTL, on chromosome I H, was associated with NB and LB and is located in a region rich in resistance genes, including QTL conferring resistance to stripe rust (incited by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei) and the mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) resistance gene Mla. The LB, NB and mildew resistance alleles trace to one parent (Baronesse) whereas the stripe rust resistance allele traces to the other parent (BCD 47) of the mapping population.

High-resolution heavy mineral stratigraphy for the succession {{will be used to}} determine provenance of the detrital material. To achieve this, a methodical approach will be used where geochemistry, XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), and semi-quantification of heavy minerals <b>using</b> <b>MLA</b> (Mineral Liberation Analyzer) are combined with FEG-SEM-BSE-EDS-CL (Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope, Back Scattered Electron, Energy Dispersive Spectrometer and Cathodoluminescence). Heavy mineral size distribution suggests normal size distribution with peaks around 125 - 150 microns for all samples, with one exception, Zf 409, which has bimodal size distribution in the range of 75 – 125 microns. Furthermore, all heavy mineral particles are generally angular to sub-angular, which can infer a short transportation route. The samples display relative similar mineralogy according to FEG-SEM and MLA analyses. One can suggest a proximal metamorphic source based on findings of i. e. chamosite, garnets, clinopyroxene, as well as the possibility of the identified grossular are Ca-epidotes according to XRD analysis. Moreover, the chemical composition of garnets was plotted in ternary diagrams, which show evidence of amphibolite facies and metabasic rock associations.

40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to explain why {{multilevel}} analysis (MLA) is often necessary to correctly answer the questions CSCL researchers address. Although CSCL researchers continue to use statistical techniques such as analysis of vari-ance or regression analysis, their datasets are often not suited for these techniques. The first reason is that CSCL research deals with individuals collaborating in groups, often creating hierarchically nested datasets. This means that such datasets for example contain variables measured {{at the level of}} the individual (e. g., learning performance) and variables measured {{at the level of the}} group (e. g., group composition or group performance). The number of unique observations at the lowest level, the individual, is higher than at the highest level, the group. Related to this, CSCL datasets often contain differing units of analysis. Some variables that CSCL researchers are interested in are measured at the individual level (e. g., gender, interactive behavior, familiarity with other group members), whereas other variables are measured at the group level (e. g., gender group composition, group performance, group consensus). Finally, because group members interact with each other in CSCL environments, this leads to nonindependence of the dependent variable(s) in the dataset. Because of their common experience during the collaboration, students scores on the dependent variables will likely correlate (e. g., in a group with a relatively long history of successful collaboration, group members will report similar, high levels of trust, while in groups with a negative collaboration history, group members will likely report low levels of trust). Whether nonindependence is present in a dataset can be establish by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. Whenever researchers encounter datasets with hierarchically nested data, differing units of analysis, and nonindependence, MLA is needed to appropriately model this data structure since it can appropriately disentangle the effects of the different levels on the dependent variable(s) of interest. Researchers however also employ other strategies to deal with nonindependence and hierarchy in their datasets (e. g., ignoring nonindependence and hierarchy, or aggregating or disaggregating their data). We will highlight the dangers of these strategies using examples from our own research (e. g., increasing the chance of committing a Type I error). The chapter ends with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of <b>using</b> <b>MLA</b> for CSCL research. For example, although MLA is a powerful technique to address the data analytical problems CSCL researchers encounter, relatively large sample sizes are necessary...|$|E
40|$|In era of dwindling {{fossil fuel}} supplies, {{increasing}} energy demand and {{high rates of}} carbon emission, investment in the clean and renewable-energy market is now the goal of many governments. This global prospect pushes the countries to consolidate new policies and rules to increase the production of cost-eﬀective resources and grow the deployment in renewable energy. Sunlight, wind, waves and geothermal heat are the natural energy resources that strongly contribute to our global energy consumption. Organic materials - restricted to those that have conjugated structure and exhibit semiconducting properties - have gained intense interest in research and academia, leading to eﬃcient and commercially applicable devices. Organic photovoltaic (OPV), organic ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are the most prominent devices in the ﬁeld of organic electronics. These devices are promising due to potentially low cost, mechanical ﬂexibility, lightweight as well as high and ease of processability from solution (such as, spin-coating, drop casting, roll painting, and ink jet printing). Signiﬁcant improvements have been achieved - especially for OLEDs, which have now been commercialized for cellular telephone applications as well as high-deﬁnition television screens. For OPVs, however, inferior performance and short lifetimes hinder their successful commercialization. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on three diﬀerent performance-related issues and strategies for OPVs; electrode-interface engineering, morphology tuning, and optical absorption enhancement. The work on morphology tuning is also extended and applied to OLEDs and OFETs. In chapter one, a schematic showing the organization of this dissertation is presented. In the same chapter, a general introduction on organic materials and thin-ﬁlms is also discussed. Furthermore, the architecture and basic operation of OPV, OFET and OLED devices are considered. Chapter two discusses the possibility of fabricating new OPV devices on previously used Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) substrates, which went through prior device processing with popular acidic interfacial layer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). We show that, contrary to the concerns in the literature, only the top few nanometers of ITO are etched by PEDOT:PSS in typical device processing and storage thereafter. Conductivity losses are oﬀset by transmission gains leading to an increased power conversion eﬃciencies (PCE) for PTB 7 -based (PTB 7 : poly[[4, 8 -bis[(2 -ethylhexyl) oxy]benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b’]dithiophene- 2, 6 -diyl][3 - ﬂuoro- 2 -[(2 -ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3, 4 -b]thiophenediyl]]) OPVs on used ITO substrates compared to devices on fresh ITO. In chapter three, we introduce a generic morphology tuning technique with anisotropic applicability -exposure to static electric-ﬁeld (E-ﬁeld) gradient during the solidiﬁcation of solution-processed polymeric thin-ﬁlms. This technique improves the connectivity between polymer chains; by changing the E-ﬁeld direction, radiative pathways in polymeric thin-ﬁlms can be altered, charge transport in- and out-of-plane can be improved, and phase-separation in polymer-fullerene blends can be coarsened in the bulk and perpendicular to the substrate. In exemplary cases, we improved the hole mobility in OFETs, power conversion eﬀciency in OPVs, and electroluminescence eﬃciency in OLEDs. In {{the last part of}} this dissertation, we studied the eﬀect of using microlens array (MLA) to increase the light absorption inside the active-layer of OPVs. Our MLA approach does not hinder the fabrication of the OPV because MLA lies on the non-conductive side of the ITO glass. In chapter four, we initially investigated the eﬀect of <b>using</b> <b>MLA</b> with 2000 nm feature size. We found that thick (P 3 HT:PCBM) and thin (PCDTBT:PCBM) OPVs exhibit an improved short-circuit current. This enhancement stems from the increased light path coupled with the constructive interference patterns inside the OPV photoactive layer. In chapter ﬁve, we used MLAs with smaller feature sizes. In addition to feature size of 2 micrometer, 1. 5 micrometer, 1 micrometer and 0. 6 micrometer MLAs were also investigated. The experimental and simulations results show agreement on an increased light absorption inside the photoactive layer; improved current-density and PCE were realized for PTB 7 :PCBM and PCDTBT:PCBM OPVs (w. r. t. control) using 1 micrometer and 1. 5 micrometer feature size MLAs, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, micro lens arrays {{have played}} a crucial role in optical {{illumination}} systems. The function of micro lens arrays (MLAs) is to create a uniform light intensity or shape the light profile. Polymers that are commonly <b>used</b> as <b>MLAs</b> have several advantages, such as cost effectiveness, light weight, and easy formation. In general, the ultra-precision diamond-turning technique and plastic injection molding technique have been combined to fabricate MLAs with polymer materials. However, residual stress and non-balance injection pressure are produced on MLAs during injecting processing. Therefore, this paper presents the fabrication of <b>MLAs</b> <b>using</b> a direct molding method (DMM). The STAVAX with electroless nickel coating and PMMA were used as the mold and polymer preform, respectively. First, a mold of MLA with 100 % filling factor was fabricated using the ultra-precision diamond-turning technique. A high filling factor can decrease the non-effective area of the MLA in an optical system. Subsequently, an MLA was formed on the PMMA surface using DMM processing.

Recently, several researchers have turned to multilevel analysis (MLA) to answer their research questions (e. g., Cress, 2008; De Wever, Van Keer, Schellens, & Valcke, 2007; Dewiyanti, Brand-Gruwel, Jochems, & Broers, 2007; Schellens, Van Keer, & Valcke, 2005; Strijbos, Martens, Jochems, & Broers, 2004; Stylianou-Georgiou, Papanastasiou, & Puntambekar, chapter #).

Instead, many CSCL researchers continue to use ‘traditional’ statistical techniques (e. g., analysis of variance, regression analysis), although these techniques may not be appropriate for what is being studied.

In this study, a nanosecond pulsed ultraviolet-laser is used for MLAP of aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and hydroxyapatite <b>using</b> an <b>MLA</b> with 150 mum lens pitch. It is shown that depending {{on the number of}} laser pulses and laser fluences, the pattern depth can be increased from less than one micrometer up to tens of micrometer. Different pattern geometries are also obtained by translating the ceramic material with X and Y stages. The MLAP speed is calculated and compared to direct laser writing using galvanometric scanning mirrors...|$|R
5000|$|Consider mineral {{royalties}} today. Today, for {{a granite}} block {{that is worth}} Rs 100 in market, whose extraction and transportation cost is below Rs 10, Govt gets royalties of Rs 5 or even less. Why are the bids so low? Because the local mining contractors hire criminals to ensure that more miners cannot come and bid in the Collectors’ offices to submit the bids. But the criminals are able to operate ONLY because they have support of MLAs, MPs, Ministers, CMs, PM, IPS, IAS and relative lawyers of the judges. IOW today, <b>using</b> criminals, <b>MLAs,</b> MPs, Ministers, CMs, PM, IPS, IAS and relative lawyers of the judges ensure that lion's share of deemed royalties come into their hands via the mine contractors and criminals they bless. Now today, I activists were to tell commons that commons should fight against these Ministers, IPS, IAS and judges’ relative lawyers, then two key questions arise - ...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of ore {{particle}} composition distribution, commonly termed mineral liberation distribution, {{are used}} in assessing process performance in mineral processing. In many applications, comparisons are made between particle composition distributions (for example comparing the products of fine and coarse grinds) and in such comparisons {{it is useful to}} understand the errors in the measurements in order to decide whether any differences are significant. A statistical approach based on bootstrap resampling has been applied to estimate the confidence intervals for ore particle composition distribution measurements obtained <b>using</b> the <b>MLA</b> automated mineralogy system. In this approach confidence intervals for each individual composition class are estimated as compared to a previous analytical solution which provides this information for particle composition data in cumulative form (Leigh et al., 1993). The effects on the magnitude of the error associated with measured values of particle composition distribution of the number of ore particles measured in the analysis and the complexity of the particle texture are investigated. Examples from a gold-bearing pyrite ore and an iron oxide copper gold ore are presented to demonstrate the practical application of this approach...|$|R
