60|$|Tallantire {{drove his}} spurs into a rampant {{skewbald}} stallion with china- blue eyes, and settled {{himself for the}} forty-mile ride to Fort Ziar. Knowing his district blindfold, he wasted no time hunting for short cuts, but headed across the richer grazing-ground to the ford where Orde had died and been buried. The dusty ground deadened the noise of his horse's hoofs, the moon threw his shadow, a restless goblin, before him, and the heavy dew drenched him to the skin. Hillock, scrub that brushed against the horse's belly, <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> where the whip-like foliage of the tamarisks lashed his forehead, illimitable levels of lowland furred with bent and speckled with drowsing cattle, waste, and hillock anew, dragged themselves past, and the skewbald was labouring in the deep sand of the Indus-ford. Tallantire was conscious of no distinct thought till {{the nose of the}} dawdling ferry-boat grounded on the farther side, and his horse shied snorting at the white headstone of Orde's grave. Then he uncovered, and shouted that the dead might hear, 'They're out, old man! Wish me luck.' In the chill of the dawn he was hammering with a stirrup-iron at the gate of Fort Ziar, where fifty sabres of that tattered regiment, the Belooch Beshaklis were supposed to guard Her Majesty's interests along a few hundred miles of Border. This particular fort was commanded by a subaltern, who, born of the ancient family of the Derouletts, naturally answered to the name of Tommy Dodd. Him Tallantire found robed in a sheepskin coat, shaking with fever like an aspen, and trying to read the native apothecary's list of invalids.|$|E
6000|$|We {{ran across}} bare hills on an <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> under a burning sun {{in front of}} a volley of playful repartee from the {{prominent}} citizens inside. It was the 4th of July. The horses had American flags in their head-stalls, some of the women wore flags and coloured handkerchiefs in their belts, and a young German on the box-seat with me was bewailing the loss of a box of crackers. He said he had been sent to the Continent to get his schooling and so had lost his American accent; but no Continental schooling writes German Jew all over a man's face and nose. He was a rabid American citizen--one of a very difficult class to deal with. As a general rule, praise unsparingly, and without discrimination. That keeps most men quiet: but some, if you fail to keep up a continuous stream of praise, proceed to revile the Old Country--Germans and Irish who are more Americans than the Americans are the chief offenders. This young American began to attack the English army. He had seen some of it on parade and he pitied the men in bearskins as [...] "slaves." [...] The citizen, by the way, has a contempt for his own army which exceeds anything you meet among the most illiberal classes in England. I admitted that our army was very poor, had done nothing, and had been nowhere. This exasperated him, for he expected an argument, and he trampled on the British Lion generally. Failing to move me, he vowed that I had no patriotism like his own. I said I had not, and further ventured that very few Englishmen had; which, when you come to think of it, is quite true. By the time he had proved conclusively that before the Prince of Wales came to the throne we should be a blethering republic, we struck a road that overhung a river, and my interest in [...] "politics" [...] was lost in admiration of the driver's skill as he sent his four big horses along that winding road. There was no room for any sort of accident--a shy or a swerve would have dropped us sixty feet into the roaring Gardiner River. Some of the persons in the coach remarked that the scenery, was [...] "elegant." [...] Wherefore, even at the risk of my own life, I did urgently desire an accident and the massacre of some of the more prominent citizens. What [...] "elegance" [...] lies in a thousand-foot pile of honey-coloured rock, riven into peak and battlement, the highest peak defiantly crowned by an eagle's nest, the eaglet peering into the gulf and screaming for his food, I could not {{for the life of me}} understand. But they speak a strange tongue.|$|E

50|$|As the Reichswald is on a glacial ridge, {{it is not}} {{subjected}} to flooding. The glacial gravel contains a lot of loam from the northern German plain and this causes the surface to become extremely muddy when using the <b>unmetalled</b> <b>roads</b> during a rainy period.|$|R
50|$|Coal mining was {{an early}} {{industry}} in the area. Tunnelling first started in 1875, {{but it was not}} practical to carry the coal over the <b>unmetalled</b> <b>roads</b> to Whangarei wharf. In 1882 a short railway line was completed between Kamo and Whangarei to carry the coal. This was one of Northland's first railways. The railway still exists as part of the North Auckland Line. The mine closed in 1955, with the seams worked out. Limonite was also quarried at Kamo.|$|R
5000|$|The old <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> between Ludwigslust and Parchim was {{upgraded}} in 1845 to a surfaced road. One {{year later}} roadworks were completed {{as far as}} Lübz and, in 1936, the first road bridge over the Elbe was opened in Dömitz [...]|$|E
50|$|The Broadwood {{area was}} first settled by Pakeha in the 1880s, and an access road was {{constructed}} {{through the area}} from Takahue to Motukaraka on the Hokianga harbour. An <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> through the Te Karae Valley to Kohukohu was constructed in 1908.|$|E

5000|$|The {{village is}} linked to the NH 6, also known as Mumbai/Bombay Road, through a narrow road known as Sarat Road. The highway links it to other places {{including}} Kolkata, the state capital. The roads of the village are unmetalled and are made of bricks. There is also a barrage, a kind of breakwater created to protect the villages from floods. The barrage, the <b>unmetalled</b> <b>roads</b> and the Sarat Road links it to the nearby villages. Th Sarat Road further leads to Kalyanpur and Hooghly in the north, called the [...] "Sarat Road".|$|R
50|$|Abhicharan is {{a village}} in Sadar {{sub-division}} of West Tripura district of Tripura, India. The people here belong to the Tripuri tribe and they speak Kokborok. The government figure for the population is 2822. The village has amenities like telephones, schools, rice-mill, markets and also it is connected with {{the nearby town of}} Khayerpur via Kisong. It is also connected to Agartala through Kamalghat junction. A Tripura State Rifles out-post is located in this village, which looks after the security problems of this village, as this village is very strategic in location. It is situated right in the heart of Sadar sub-division. From here the villages of the interiors can be accessed very well through village <b>unmetalled</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{no public}} access to the summit though a public {{footpath}} contours the hill at half-height on its northwestern side and an <b>unmetalled</b> public <b>road</b> passes through the col known as Bwlch y Gors immediately to its west. The Beacons Way descends this track northwards towards Y Garn Goch en route for Llangadog.|$|R

Part of the <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> {{that runs from}} Fairholm (Craigvue) down towards Craig House is known as Spiersland Way; the latter part is known as Roughwood Road after the farm of that name. A Spier's care Home also exists in Beith.|$|E
50|$|The Indian {{government}} {{is planning to}} build a road over Shingo La. Currently there is no road going south from Zanskar. However, there is an <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> till Zanskar Sumdo which is 9-10 hrs from this pass towards Darcha side. The four-wheelers however can come till Palamo which is around 8 km from Zanskar Sumdo towards Darcha side.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, {{travel by}} foreigners was not {{recommended}} because of security problems. To travel between Osh and Batken the road crosses the So'x enclave, {{which requires a}} double-entry Kyrgyz visa and an Uzbek transit visa: {{it is possible to}} take an <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> around the enclave. The southern mountains offer excellent, but very difficult climbing with many sheer rock faces. Summits are Pyramid Peak 5509 m and Pik Skalistiy 5621 m.|$|E
500|$|The first {{organised}} {{initiative for}} the construction of new roads and maintenance of [...] existing roads in the Presidency was initiated in 1845 with the appointment of a special officer for the maintenance of main roads. The principal roads {{under the aegis of the}} officer were the Madras-Bangalore road, Madras-Trichinopoly road, Madras-Calcutta road, Madras-Cuddapah road and the Sumpajee Ghaut road. A Public Works Department was initiated by Lord Dalhousie in 1852 and subsequently in 1855 an East coast canal was constructed for the purpose of easy navigation. Roadways were handled by the Public Works Secretariat which was under the control of the member of the Governor's Executive Council. The principal highways of the Presidency were the Madras-Calcutta road, the Madras-Travancore road and the Madras-Calicut road. By 1946–47, the Madras Presidency had [...] of metalled roads and [...] of <b>unmetalled</b> <b>roads,</b> and [...] of navigable canals.|$|R

5000|$|The most {{frequently}} used ascent route is from the Windautal, which may be reached via Hopfgarten im Brixental and Westendorf in the north. Cars can also get {{to the foot of}} the mountain on a partly <b>unmetalled</b> toll <b>road.</b> There are parking areas by the Gamskogel Hut, a little way above the valley, and at the Holzlagerplatz (...) in the valley below the Rotwand Grundalm.|$|R
50|$|Pello {{railway station}} {{is located in}} the {{municipality}} of Pello in the Lapland Province of Finland. The station is extremely basic, with one solitary unpaved platform. The sole amenity for passenger comfort is a small wooden shelter. There is a building for railway staff. The station is accessed from Pello by an <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road.</b> The station is mainly used for the loading of logs onto freight waggons, although there are daily passenger services to Kolari railway station and Helsinki Central railway station.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the name Redhill that has been found is on Day & Master's map of Somerset from as late as 1782. The name may simply derive from {{the appearance of the}} <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> up the hill, with deep cartwheel ruts scored into the red earth. Alternatively the name may mean Roe Hill or Roe Hollow, alluding to the roe deer which are still plentiful in the area. Some dictionaries give the name as deriving from Ragiol, a village featured in the Domesday Book of 1086; this however, seems more likely to be Regil or Ridgehill.|$|E
50|$|Kundol Lake is {{accessible}} {{only during the}} summer; during the winter, the roads are closed due to heavy snowfall. It can be accessed by <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road</b> from Kalam up to Utror in a four-wheel automotive where a link road ends in a green valley called Ladu {{in the foothills of}} the mountain. Earlier, jeeps used to go till a higher village called Ladu but now bridge and jeep track is destroyed due to floods and rains so total trek time has increased from 3-4 hrs to 6-8 hrs till the lake. There are also small refreshment huts in Ladu valley where one can take tea and get something for eating. From Ladu it takes almost four to six hours to reach the lake. The mountains around this small valley are covered with tall cedar and pine trees.|$|E
50|$|This was a {{small and}} very {{isolated}} single platform halt with access only via an <b>unmetalled</b> downland sheep <b>road.</b> It was built as a temporary stop to accommodate a competition held by the National Rifle Association in 1888. However, from 1889 military summer camps were established near to the station which required {{the use of the}} halt as the only access to the site. Timetables provided that trains would not call at Churn unless prior notice had been given to the Stationmaster at Didcot.|$|R
5000|$|The lake is {{accessible}} from Dowarian by an <b>unmetalled</b> 19 km <b>road</b> cum hiking trek through breath-taking sites. Dowarian is the base camp to this lake. Jeeps are easily available from Dowarian & during peak season they {{will cost you}} around PKR 8,000. From Dawarian it takes almost Two and half hour to reach base camp at Domail. From that point it's preferable to get horses , as the tracking is too much steep. Young people can do tracking, it will take almost one hour to reach lake.. All the tour is safe for families also. Take your rain coats and jackets along with you.

40|$|Artykuł prezentuje możliwość wykorzystania modeli terenu pochodzących z danych LiDAR do odtworzenia elementów historycznych fortyfikacji polowych. Podczas badań odtworzono przebieg linii okopów pochodzących z II wojny światowej na obszarze Pasma Jałowieckiego i Grupy Mędralowej. W celu weryfikacji dokładności danych pozyskanych z LiDAR i identyfikacji form punktowych oprócz interpretacji modelu przeprowadzono kartowanie terenowe z użyciem GPS. Zaprezentowana w artykule metoda badań pozwala na zidentyfikowanie linii okopów rozmieszczonych na rozległym, często trudno dostępnym obszarze, przez co wskazana jest do stosowania podczas prowadzonych badań na obszarze Karpat. LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) {{data are}} very useful in geographical, {{historical}} and archeological studies. It {{is because of}} large ALS point cloud precision, which makes possibility of studying small forms in relief, such as <b>unmetalled</b> <b>roads,</b> historical agricultural systems, archaeological sites or old field fortifications, like trench lines. The aim {{of this article is}} test on the usability of LiDAR data in research of trench lines built during Second World War in Poland, in Beskidy Mountains. The study area chosen to this text was located in Jałowiec Range and Mędralowa Mountain Group in south-west of Małopolskie voivodeship, south of Poland (Fig. 1). Jałowiec Range and Mędralowa Mountain Group is a continuation {{to the north of the}} Massif Babia Góra (Beskid Żywiecki, Carpathians). The fortifications were been built in this area before and during the Second World War. The first objects were built by Polish Army in 1939 and second time there was built two large fortification lines 1944, by polish people forced to do it by german soldiers. The most objects in studied area were made on the slopes of Malikowski Groń. Objects founded in 1944 were preserved in good condition up to the present day (Tab. 1). The few objects have been transformed by the geomorphological processes and by overgrown trees and shrubs on them. These objects have survived to this day, because they were not damaged during hostilities. The research was performed on a piece of trench line on Malikowski Groń (760 ma. s. l.) about 12, 2 km long (Fig. 3, Fig. 6), Lachów Groń (708 m a. s. l.) about 1, 6 km long (Fig. 3) and Mędralowa Mountain Group (1169 m a. s. l) about 2, 3 km long (Fig. 4). During the field test the plan of trench lines (Fig. 3 C, 5 B) was performed by using GPS mapping and by measurement of the size and depth of the trenches. Second plan (Fig. 3 B, 5 A) is the result of LiDAR data analyses and vectorization. After then the obtained results were compared in research analysis. The trench lines and objects are quite good visible in LiDAR data, but it is impossible to do the classification of point objects made in field observation (Tab. 1, 2, 3). However, as a general comment, it is the possibility to signing the object classes in neighbor areas by way of analogy to field testing research...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the people of N.Lungpher depend on Agriculture and horticulture for their livelihood. Apart from these, a small population including immigrants relying on livestock. The village approached road, which is the <b>unmetalled</b> <b>road,</b> is 15 km long from the metalled road of Saitual Town - Phullen village. Although agriculture has become the main source of income for the communities, most of the products are sold outside the village especially through Middleman. Marketing through middlemen has reduced {{the amount of money that}} could be earned by the primary producers from the export of vegetables and cash crops. Ginger is intensively grown by the farmers of N.Lungpher since the land in N.Lungpher village area is highly capable of growing such a crop in Kharif season. Nearly 90% of the total exported agricultural products from the village to the Market is Ginger. Since the village is located almost 100 km away from the nearest city, the farmers of N.Lungpher village did not have the opportunity to sell their products in a distant market, they need to go through middlemen in order to sell their products, but marketing through middlemen has reduced the amount of money that could be earned by the primary producers from the export of vegetables and cash crops. Rice/paddy, Bal, Maize, Brinjal and Samtawk are also the commonly cultivated vegetables and cash crops which are produced in a large quantity. The villagers can have a good deal of production without introducing fertilizers. But, as the population is increasing as well as household, there will be a growing pressure on land for cultivation. Therefore, it is imperative to introduce organic fertilizer in order to optimize the land use and increase in production.|$|E
