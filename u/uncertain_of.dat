40|$|Uncertainty {{theory is}} a new branch of axiomatic {{mathematics}} for studying the subjective uncertainty. In uncertain theory, uncertain variable is a fundamental concept, {{which is used to}} represent imprecise quantities (unknown constants and unsharp concepts). Entropy <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> variable is an important concept in calculating uncertainty associated with imprecise quantities. This paper introduces the single parameter entropy <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> variable, and proves its several important theorems. In the framework of the single parameter entropy <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> variable, we can obtain the supremum <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> variable by choosing a proper q. The single parameter entropy <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> variable makes the computing <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> variable more general and flexible...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{uncertainty}} theory, {{the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> process {{was given by}} Liu [3] as a sequence <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> variables indexed by time. Besides, the concept <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> integral was also proposed by Liu [3] in order to integrate an uncertain process {{with respect to a}} canonical process. Furthermore, Liu [4] recast his work via the fundamental theorem <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> calculus and thus produced the techniques of chain rule, change of variables, and integration by parts. Since then, the theory <b>of</b> <b>uncertain</b> calculus was well developed.|$|R

5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was <b>uncertain</b> <b>of</b> how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole {{by means of an}} {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; <b>uncertain</b> <b>of</b> {{the extent to which the}} public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E

5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. <b>Uncertain</b> <b>of</b> {{the identity of}} the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe could see that there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although <b>uncertain</b> <b>of</b> his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its centre. The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade, {{off the coast of}} Miletus. The Persians were <b>uncertain</b> <b>of</b> victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the Samian contingent accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line. Although the Chian contingent and a few other ships remained, and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so <b>uncertain</b> <b>of</b> victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons not}} entirely clear, on 7 October Mack ordered Franz Xavier Auffenburg {{to take his}} {{division}} of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Günzburg to Wertingen {{in preparation for the}} main Austrian advance out of Ulm. <b>Uncertain</b> <b>of</b> what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions– Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, and Nansouty's 1st Cuirassier Division. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by Nicolas Oudinot's grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the northeast. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians lost nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were taken prisoner. The Battle of Wertingen had been an easy French victory.|$|E

He was ordered back to Cherry Point, where he joined VMF-913, another Corsair squadron, and learned that he had qualified for a regular commission. In March 1946, he was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in southern California. He volunteered for service with the occupation in North China, believing that it would be a short tour. He joined VMF-218 (yet another Corsair squadron), which was based at Nanyuan Field near Beijing, in December 1946, and flew patrol missions until VMF-218 was transferred to Guam in March 1947. He finally returned home in December 1948.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon {{as the storm}} became more symmetrical. However, due {{to the location of}} the storm, {{there was a lack of}} accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was <b>uncertain</b> <b>of</b> its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger.|$|E
