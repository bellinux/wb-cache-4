Main outcome measures:standardised <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> for CEA {{and measures of}} inter-district variability. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for associations between variables. Results:variation in <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> was considerable (14 -fold difference across district populations). More individuals had bilateral surgery in the Yorkshire region than in the Northern (11. 7 % vs. 5. 5 %, p= 0. 002).

40|$|Background: Research {{has shown}} that women with disabilities face {{additional}} challenges in accessing and using healthcare services compared to non-disabled women. However, relatively {{little is known about}} the utilisation of cancer screening services for women with disabilities. This study addresses this gap by examining the utilisation of the Papanicolaou test and mammography for disabled women in Chile. Methods: We used cross-sectional data, taken from a 2015 nationally-representative survey. Initially, we employed logistic regressions to test for differences in <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> for the Papanicolaou test (66, 281 observations) and the mammogram (35, 294 observations) between disabled and non-disabled women. Next, logistic regressions were used to investigate the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors affecting <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> for cancer screening services for disabled women (sample sizes: 5, 823 observations for the Papanicolaou test and 5, 731 observations for the mammogram). Results: Disabled women were less likely to undergo screening tests than non-disabled women. For the Papanicolaou test and mammography, the multivariable regression models showed that living in rural areas, having higher education, being affiliated with a private health insurance company, giving a good health self-assessment score, and being under medical treatment for other illnesses were associated with higher <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates.</b> On the other hand, being single, inactive with regard to employment, and having a better income were linked with lower <b>utilisation.</b> While <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> for both disabled and non-disabled women have increased since 2006, the utilisation disparity has slightly increased. Conclusions: This study shows the influence of various factors in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> of preventive cancer screening services for disabled women. To develop effective initiatives targeting inequalities in the utilisation of cancer screening tests, it is important to move beyond an exclusively single-disease approach and acknowledge the complexity of the patient population...|$|R

We calculated the proportion and number of EBRT and BT given or planned within 6 months of diagnosis in 4 Dutch regions, according to stage and age in a population-based setting including 47, 259 prostate cancer patients diagnosed from 1997 until 2008. During this study period, the overall <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of EBRT remained stable at around 25 %, while the rate of BT for non-metastasized patients increased from 1 % (95 % CI: 0 - 1 %) to 12 % (11 - 13 %) in 2006 and slightly decreased towards 10 % (9 - 11 %) in 2008. From 2001 on, the overall <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of EBRT decreased significantly in one region (p < 0. 05). In this region, a sharp rise in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of BT for non-metastatic patients was noted to 17 % (14 - 20 %) in 2008 after a peak of 24 % (21 - 27 %) in 2006.

Such evaluation studies are becoming increasingly important in the current era of organisational downsizing and coping with resource constraints. A client satisfaction survey was used to assess client's satisfaction with the program, while data obtained from the management information system of the company was used to compute both the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> as well as the cost-effectiveness of the programme. The <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> was computed to be 5. 2 % which is within the acceptable range as posited by the available literature. The <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> was further examined in terms of the demographics of the client population as well as that of the EAP. The demographic information revealed that the most common problem addressed by the EAP was marital problems (37. 8 %). Another finding of note was the very high percentage of management / mandatory referrals. Supervisor feedback reports indicated that the most common problem amongst employees that resulted in referral was absenteeism and morale. Supervisors rated involvement in incidents /accidents and absenteeism as being the constructs that improved the most with EAP intervention. The survey of EAP clients (self-referrals) suggested that the majority of clients were satisfied with the overall quality of EAP services.
