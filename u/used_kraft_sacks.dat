40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} the potency of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) bagasse as raw material for pulp and paper <b>using</b> <b>kraft</b> pulping. The effects of alkali and sulfidity loading on kraft pulp and paper properties were also investigated. The pulping condition of the kraft pulp consisted of three levels of alkali loading (17, 19 and 22 %) and sulfidity loading (20, 22 and 24 %). The maximum cooking temperature was 170 °C for 4 h with a liquid to wood ratio of 10 : 1. Kraft pulping of this Numbu bagasse produced good pulp indicated by high screen yield and delignification selectivity with a low Kappa number (< 10). The unbleached pulp sheet produced a superior brightness level and a high burst index. The increase of active alkali loading tended to produce {{a negative effect on}} the pulp yield, Kappa number and paper sheet properties.

It mainly consists of cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses.

AimsThe aim was to quantify the antioxidant properties of lignins extracted from oil palm biomass <b>using</b> <b>Kraft,</b> soda, and organosolv pulping. The potential of the extracted lignins as inhibitors of mild steel corrosion was also assessed. Methods Ground and dried 1 – 3 -mm-mesh-size oil palm fronds were submitted to Kraft, soda, and organosolv pulping in rotary digesters. The extracted lignin was characterized and oxygen uptake was measured. Anticorrosion properties of extracted lignins were monitored via electrochemical measurements and surface analysis. Results Soda-extracted lignins displayed the highest antioxidant activities as compared to Kraft and ethanol organosolv lignins. The highest inhibition of corrosion of mild steel was reached in the presence of soda-extracted lignins. Conclusion Oil palm fronds are potential sources of lignins usable as green antioxidant for corrosion inhibition of mild steel...|$|R

For a tropical country like Malaysia, banana stem {{is one of the}} sources of biomasses. Like other biomasses-based products, only cellulose part of banana stem is used while the lignin portion is discarded due to overly hydrophilic character.

This research is aimed to synthesis water absorbent-based lignin from banana stem. The lignin had been extracted from banana stem <b>using</b> <b>Kraft</b> process prior to grafted with acrylic acid monomer (AA) in order to increase its water absorbency. The reaction was carried out via free radical polymerization in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as initiator and ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate as a catalyst. The reaction temperature was set at 600 C. Grafting efficiency of polyacrylic acid (PAA) onto lignin backbone was determined by varying the amounts of AA monomer, lignin and initiator. The highest grafting percentage was acquired at 60 % with the amount of 6 ml acrylic acid, 2 ml initiator and 0. 2 g lignin respectively...|$|R

Two series of yield measurements of E. macarthurii revealed that these trees were very uniform in their performance, which complicated the development of a calibration model.

A robust calibration model was created using a large number of E. macarthurii yield values as well as yield values of other eucalypt species.
