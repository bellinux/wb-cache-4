25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for social workers to study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either <b>unbanked</b> (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who have an understanding of financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E
2500|$|The {{likelihood}} that a family will use a payday loan increases if they are <b>unbanked,</b> or lack access to a traditional deposit bank account. [...] In an American context the families who will use a payday loan are disproportionately either of black or Hispanic descent, recent immigrants, and/or under-educated. These individuals are least able to secure normal, lower-interest-rate forms of credit. Since payday lending operations charge higher interest-rates than traditional banks, they {{have the effect of}} depleting the assets of low-income communities. [...] The Insight Center, a consumer advocacy group, reported in 2013 that payday lending cost U.S communities $774 million a year.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the provisions, {{control and}} {{regulations}} of Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India {{had continued to}} be {{owned and operated by}} private persons. Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies, and ignoring the priority sector. Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority population) <b>unbanked.</b> After becoming Prime Minister, Gandhi expressed the intention of nationalising the banks in a paper titled, [...] "Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation" [...] in order to alleviate poverty. The paper received the overwhelming support of the public. In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks. After the nationalisation of banks, the branches of the public sector banks in India rose to approximate 800 percent in deposits, and advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent. Nationalisation also resulted in a significant growth in the geographical coverage of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in the <b>unbanked,</b> rural areas. The nationalization drive not only helped to increase household savings, but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India's industrial and agricultural base. Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, was solid in his praise for her bank nationalisations.|$|E
