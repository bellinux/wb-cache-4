5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They {{must be taken into}} account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the <b>unit</b> <b>interval.</b> Such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E

25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, an {{indifference}} graph is an undirected graph constructed by assigning a real number to each vertex and connecting two vertices by an edge when their numbers are within one unit of each other. Indifference graphs are also the intersection graphs of sets of unit intervals, or of properly nested intervals (intervals none of which contains any other one). Based on {{these two types of}} interval representations, these graphs are also called <b>unit</b> <b>interval</b> graphs or proper interval graphs; they form a subclass of the interval graphs.|$|E

The algorithm rounds the points (or interval centers) down to the nearest smaller integer, uses a hash table to find all pairs of points whose rounded integers are within one of each other (the fixed-radius near neighbors problem), and filters the resulting list of pairs for the ones whose unrounded values are also within one of each other.|$|E
25|$|In arithmetical terms, the Cantor set {{consists}} of all real {{numbers on the}} <b>unit</b> <b>interval</b> that are expressible as a ternary (base 3) fraction using only the digits 0 and 2. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. It further follows that the Cantor set has a bijective mapping with the set of infinite binary sequences.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOnline {{interval}} {{selection is}} a problem in which intervals arrive one by one, sorted by their left endpoints. Each interval has a length and a non-negative weight associated with it. The goal is to select a non-overlapping set of intervals with maximal total weight and run them to completion. The decision regarding a possible selection of an arriving interval must be done immediately upon its arrival. The interval may be preempted later in favor of selecting an arriving overlapping interval, in which case the weight of the preempted interval is lost. We follow Woeginger (1994) [12] and study the same models. The types of instances we consider are C-benevolent instances, where the weight of an interval is a monotonically increasing (convex) function of length, and D-benevolent instances, where the weight of an interval is a monotonically decreasing function of length. Some of our results can be extended to the case of <b>unit</b> length <b>intervals</b> with arbitrary costs. We significantly improve the previously known bounds on the performance of online randomized algorithms for the problem, namely, we introduce a new algorithm for the D-benevolent case and for <b>unit</b> <b>intervals,</b> which uses a parameter θ and has a competitive ratio of at most θ 2 lnθ(θ− 1) 2. This value is equal to approximately 2. 4554 for θ≈ 3. 513 being the solution of the equation x− 1 = 2 lnx. We further design a lower bound of 1 +ln 2 ≈ 1. 693 on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm. The lower bound is valid for any C-benevolent instance, some D-benevolent functions and for <b>unit</b> <b>intervals.</b> We further show a lower bound of 32 for a wider class of D-benevolent instances. This improves over previously known lower bounds. We also design a barely random online algorithm for the D-benevolent case and the case of <b>unit</b> <b>intervals,</b> which uses a single random bit, and has a competitive ratio of 3. 22745...|$|R
