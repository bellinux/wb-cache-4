As such, it cannot be evaluated in absolute terms of success or failure, of either standards rigidly applied or a complete discrepancy among national legislations. It is rather an open and ongoing process, which evolves according to forms of gradual, never-ending approximation.

40|$|With {{the long}} awaited {{ratification}} of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it appears that plans within Europe to achieve an ‘ever closer union’ are back on track, yet, {{in the field of}} illicit drug policy, harmonisation remains as elusive a goal as ever. Sweden and the Netherlands have long provided examples of the different paradigms of drug policy operating within Europe and this article seeks to examine whether, as European <b>Union</b> <b>harmonisation</b> moves forward, recent developments bring the two any closer to convergence on this contentious issue. In addition to changes in Swedish and Dutch drug policy, the progress of the drug policy of other European countries has been evaluated. The article concludes that the Swedes and the Dutch remain ultimately wedded to their national policies and that movement both towards increased repression of drug use and increased liberalisation of drug use can be observed among other European countries.

40|$|Competition {{in local}} access {{networks}} and local loop unbundling have been central in the 1999 {{review of the}} EU communications regulatory framework. These issues also figure high on national policy agendas. Competition in local access is thought to stimulate internet penetration {{and the development of}} e-commerce and interactive applications, all key elements for the move towards a 'new economy'. Following an analysis of different ways to promote competition in local access networks and a review of the respective EU debate, this paper then concentrates on the relevant developments in Britain. At a broader level, it explores the interplay between EU debates and British policies and actions and the scope for harmonisation of national regulatory regimes. At a more specific level, the paper assesses the evolution of local access competition and relates this to the role of regulation and the question of facilities- vs. services-based entry. It is argued that the introduction of new market restructuring initiatives, such as local loop unbundling, requires a larger involvement by regulators, particularly in the early stages, rather than just a reliance on general competition rules.

Attempts to produce harmonisation in these fields have led to ‘disharmonisation’, while the new social problems arising from globalisation have hardly been dealt with.

Awarded {{the first}} edition (for year 2012) of the European Law Faculties Association (ELFA) prize for {{outstanding}} Doctoral Thesis on European Law, on 16 May 2013 at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. Abuses of Union law {{can be defined as}} undesirable choices of law made by Union citizens. The treatment of choices of law by Union citizens has proved inconsistent under Union law, being alternatively endorsed (Centros) or sanctioned (Cadbury Schweppes) by Union institutions. This inconsistent treatment of choices of law is a manifestation of a broader dialectic between two conceptions of economic integration, designated as the paradigms of Regulatory Neutrality and Regulatory Competition. If economic integration is conceived as competition among Member States (Regulatory Competition), artificial choices of law ought to be endorsed as a legitimate process of regulatory arbitrage, by which Union citizens elect their favourite national law. Conversely, if the objective of economic integration is to avoid the competition among private businesses being distorted by national laws (Regulatory Neutrality), artificial choices of law ought to be sanctioned as abuses of law. Accordingly, ‘regulatory arbitrage’ and ‘abuse of law’ are two masks covering one phenomenon: the election of a more favourable national law by Union citizens. More generally, this dialectic between two conceptions of economic integration pervades our perception of the internal market, and therefore accounts for long-established contradictions of internal market law. Social dumping and reverse discriminations distort the competition among private businesses, but represent the ordinary functioning of the competition among Member States. <b>Union</b> <b>harmonisation</b> is desirable under Regulatory Neutrality, whereas Regulatory Competition requires regulatory diversity. In the context of the freedoms of movement, Regulatory Neutrality promotes Host equality (equal treatment of migrant citizens with Host society), while Regulatory Competition endorses Home equality (equal treatment with Home society). State aids should be prohibited under Regulatory Neutrality, but allowed under Regulatory Competition. In sum, one (internal market) law is assigned the contradictory mission of ensuring the proper functioning of two competitive processes: the competition among private businesses (Regulatory Neutrality) and among Member States (Regulatory Competition) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{what extent}} are governments drawing on {{relevant}} international standards in their technical regulations, as {{mandated by the}} WTO TBT Agreement? A number of sources of data exist, including electronic databases maintained by governments, but they cannot be used to obtain systematic, international perspective, {{because there is no}} harmonised international format and they are incomplete. This study develops an analytical frame for collecting and presenting data on the use of standards in regulation in any sector, as a basis for effective monitoring of the actual extent of use of international standards in regulation and for empirical analysis of the trade effects. This template is then applied to collect and report for five OECD countries detailed factual information on technical regulations, their objectives and standards use in three sectors – electrical household appliances, equipment for natural gas and telephony. The research finds that core government policies confirm the receptiveness of policy and regulation to the use of international standards. It illustrates the difficulty of identifying, for a given sector, which standards are used, for which regulatory objectives, and with which links – direct or indirect – to standards used internationally. The data collected in the harmonised format of the template show how transparency of data on standards use could be improved. Improved transparency can facilitate efforts to improve harmonisation where this can help to remove barriers to trade. Explicit identification of regulatory objectives can ensure that attempts to promote wider harmonisation take account of those objectives. Also, the range of non-national standards actually used as a basis for technical regulation is greater than sometimes acknowledged, and wider knowledge of their availability and use could be helpful to regulators. Another benefit of transparency is that factual presentations of the use of standards in technical regulations provide a source of rich and accurate data for use in empirical work on how regulatory use of standards influences international trade.

The main {{aim of this}} paper is investigate to what extent international policy measures on foreign trade, international recycling and <b>harmonisation</b> of <b>legislation</b> can contribute in effectively reducing environmental pressure caused in the truck tyre life cycle. A two-region simulation model, representing Western and Eastern Europe, is developed that integrates the complete life cycle, incorporates environmental impacts in its economic analysis, is technically dynamic by accounting for learning-by-doing effects, and allows for variations in trade of new and old truck tyres. In this study the economic, environmental and social effectiveness of harmonisation and trade measures in the European life cycle for truck tyre is tested. Several conclusions can be drawn from the model simulations. First, the environmental effects caused by the trade of used tyres from Western to Eastern Europe are of limited impact on the overall environmental damage caused by truck tyres. The consumption stage is by far the main contributor to environmental damage. Within the marginal analysis of trade, harmonisation of disposal fees illustrated to generate very limited positive results. The private and external costs in the soli...|$|R

MethodsRegulations for non-commercial driving licenses were sought from appropriate national or state authorities and epilepsy societies. The literature was searched for consensus guidelines and data relevant to risk analysis, including an appropriate seizure-free period (SFP). ResultsThe SFP varied widely from 3 to 24 months and in most countries no distinction was made between UFS and recurrence of established epilepsy. In the European <b>Union</b> (EU), <b>harmonisation</b> is underway but implementation of the relevant directive has been slow. The excess risk of RTA in epilepsy is minimal, especially compared to other factors such as alcohol, and few accidents result from seizures at the wheel. Risk analysis supports the shortened SFPs that are being enacted in the EU. ConclusionRegulations across the world continue to vary widely, and the available data support rules which are less stringent than those currently in force {{in many parts of}} the Western world.
