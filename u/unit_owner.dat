50|$|In a townhouse complex, {{multiple}} physical {{houses are}} combined into a single architectural building. Each <b>unit</b> <b>owner</b> owns an identified plot of land and the building affixed to it, but that building is physically {{part of a larger}} building that spans lots. There is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses. If there is an apartment below not owned by owner of townhouse it is not a townhouse just a bi-level apartment, condominium. Legally, this is very similar to detached houses, but because of the intertwining of interests in the single architectural building, a homeowner's association is required. It would be impractical, for example to replace the roof of just one townhouse. But unlike the condominium, the townhouse complex's HOA owns none of the building or the land under it. It is essentially under contract to the townhouse owners to maintain the parts of the building that are hard to divide. Even the walls between townhouses are usually outside the purview of the HOA, being jointly owned and maintained by the owners of the townhouses on either side. Like the condominium, the townhouse complex often has common areas for roads, parking, clubhouses, and such.|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} of expected profit-maximizing bidding {{behavior in a}} multi-unit, multi-period auction with step-function supply curves is used to estimate cost functions for electricity generation units and derive tests of expected profit-maximizing behavior. Applying these techniques to data from the National Electricity Market in Australia reveals statistically significant evidence of output-dependent marginal costs within and across half-hours of the day, but no evidence against the hypothesis of expected profit-maximizing behavior. These cost function estimates quantify the economic significance of output-varying costs and how forward financial contract obligations impact the amount of these costs the generation <b>unit</b> <b>owner</b> incurs.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a prospective and retrospective {{quantitative assessment of}} the impact of a passive vertical integration between a large electricity retailer and a large electricity generator in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We motivate our study by adapting a standard model of fixed-price forward contracting behavior by an electricity retailer before and after the acquisition of a share of a baseload electricity generation plant to determine the likely change in its contracting behavior. Using bid and market outcome data during the three years leading up to the acquisition, we estimate the change in bidding behavior of the generation <b>unit</b> <b>owner</b> from the change in its fixed-price forward contract obligations brought about by the acquisition. This change in bidding behavior is used to compute a prospective change in each half-hourly wholesale price during the pre-acquisition period. Because this acquisition was challenged but allowed to take place, we also use market-clearing prices of wholesale electricity in the NEM and the price of the marginal input fuel during the pre-acquisition and post-acquisition time periods to compute a variety of treatment effects estimates {{of the impact of}} this acquisition. We find fairly close agreement between the prospective and retrospective quantitative impact of the acquisition on wholesale prices. Using both methodologies we find a significan...|$|E

40|$|In late January 2013, the Third District Court of Appeal sent shockwaves {{throughout}} {{the real estate}} community with regards to condominium associations’ rights as unit owners. In AventuraManagement, LLC v. Spiaggia Ocean Condominium Association (Spiaggia), the appellate court interpreted Florida Statute § 718. 1162 in an unprecedented way. The court held that if a condominium association takes title to a unit before the bank forecloses on a defaulting <b>unit</b> <b>owner,</b> the association is {{jointly and severally liable}} for all past due assessments with the previous owner that came due, up to the time of transfer of title. 3 Condominium associations across Florida became worried that the Spiaggia decision could spark a judicial trend that limits associations’ ability to recoup delinquent assessment fees. Although the Spiaggia court likely ruled correctly from an appellate perspective, the outcome of the case is contrary to the legislative intent of § 718. 116 and could have disastrous consequences for Florida condominium associations.
