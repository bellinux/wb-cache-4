40|$|The {{ease and}} {{speed with which}} {{business}} transactions {{can be carried out}} over the Web has been a key driving force in the rapid growth of electronic commerce. In addition, customer interactions, including personalized content, e-mail campaigns, online customer service, and online surveys provide new channels of communication that were not previously available or were very inefficient. The Web is revolutionizing the way businesses interact with each other (B 2 B) and with each customer (B 2 C). It has introduced entirely new ways of doing commerce, including auctions and reverse auctions, micro-segmented offers, dynamic pricing, and up-to-date content. It also made it imperative for organizations and companies to optimize their electronic business. Knowledge about the customer is fundamental for the establishment of viable e-commerce solutions. As described by Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. com, and mentioned by Joseph Pine in his book The Experience Economy (Pine et al.), customer experience is the key to building customer loyalty in an on-line store because leaving the store is only one click away. Web mining for e-commerce is the application of mining techniques to acquire this knowledge for improving e-commerce. The use of mining techniques in e-commerce can help improve cross-sells, <b>up-sells,</b> assortments shown, ads shown.

50|$|A {{customer}} {{magazine is}} a magazine {{produced by a}} business {{as a means of}} communicating to its customers. It is a branch of custom media, a product that broadly shares {{the look and feel of}} a newsstand or consumer magazine but is paid for in part or whole by a business. Rather than copy sales and advertising, the primary goal of a customer magazine is to achieve a particular business objective. This could be for a firm to cross- or <b>up-sell,</b> change brand perception or engender loyalty. In-flight magazines, sponsored by airlines, were among the first customer magazines, and remain typical of the genre. In the UK, every supermarket chain now provides a customer magazine to promote its products through recipes and other food editorial. Many prominent digitally-native companies, like WebMD and Net-À-Portér, have released customer magazines of their own. Some customer magazines carry advertising; this is often seen as a useful way to offset the cost but equally can have some benefit in making the product look more like a regular magazine.|$|E

They increase customer retention and loyalty by providing enhanced personalized services, and consequently improve {{the profitability of}} firms by deploying targeted marketing strategies and exploiting cross-sell and <b>up-sell</b> opportunities. The performance of these systems depends on the comprehensiveness, accuracy and the reliability of the user profile available to the system, and the matching algorithms that use the profile to identify the best products and services to offer a customer. While a substantial amount of research has been conducted to address the matching aspect, relatively little work has been conducted to determine the appropriate profiles for customers to improve the performance of such systems.

40|$|Background By {{measuring}} alcohol retailersâ�� {{propensity to}} illegally sell alcohol {{to young people}} who appear highly intoxicated, we examine whether UK legislation is effective at preventing health harms resulting from drunk individuals continuing to access alcohol. Methods 73 randomly selected pubs, bars and nightclubs in a city in North West England were subjected to an alcohol purchase test by pseudo-drunk actors. Observers recorded venue characteristics to identify poorly managed and problematic (PMP) bars. Results 83. 6 % of purchase attempts resulted in a sale of alcohol to a pseudo-intoxicated actor. Alcohol sales increased {{with the number of}} PMP markers bars had, yet even in those with no markers, 66. 7 % of purchase attempts resulted in a sale. Bar servers often recognised signs of drunkenness in actors, but still served them. In 18 % of alcohol sales, servers attempted to <b>up-sell</b> by suggesting actors purchase double rather than single vodkas. Conclusions UK law preventing sales of alcohol to drunks is routinely broken in nightlife environments, yet prosecutions are rare. Nightlife drunkenness places enormous burdens on health and health services. Preventing alcohol sales to drunks should be a public health priority, while policy failures on issues, such as alcohol pricing, are revisited...|$|E
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{reference}} services are changing and that the reference desk needs to change also, in response. In this article, Julie Middlemas argues that the foundations of the reference interaction remain the same regardless of this shift: that a successful reference interview and the need to save the time of the reader/researcher remain the primary functions of that interaction. Steven Deineh then puts forth his case for student-centered reference, which offers the service of intensive collaborative research working with students behind the reference desk. Students will learn hands-on because, although millennials and others of the digital generation have a perceived comprehensive understanding of technology, there is much they do not understand nor use to full advantage. And millennials learn by doing. Finally, Patty Morrison argues that “information up-sell” needs to be part of every reference desk encounter, whether the student is merely asking for directions or has a more in-depth research need. Why this promotion? Simply because, as Steven points out, there is only a perceived knowledge of technology. In sum, this article recommends the following as a new reference service model: conduct an effective and comprehensive reference interview and invite the student behind the desk for an empowering, hands-on, in-depth research experience when appropriate. For those scenarios when it is not appropriate, <b>up-sell</b> or promote what the library has to uniquely offer students that Google cannot...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{reports on}} and {{discusses}} an extensive interview {{conducted by the}} authors {{with the head of}} pre-sales at a hardware and software re-seller. The Pre-Sales division of the reseller provides advice based on end-to-end solution for IT infrastructure and technology management. Within the team there is expertise spanning a plethora of specifically defined technology areas to support end customers in the decision making process on their capital expenditure in IT equipment. Areas include Software licensing, Server infrastructure development, data storage and management, systems security, and networking infrastructure (and more). The business of being a re-seller may not initially strike the reader as being relevant to cybersecurity in general, and socio-technical matters at all, but we discovered the rather vital role that such an intermediary performs through their added value and corporate ethics. Specifically, this reseller’s team of customer service agents provide advice and referral to colleagues and end customers for subject-matter expertise as well, naturally, for opportunities to <b>up-sell</b> – specifically with that important core of any economy: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (hereafter SMEs) - usually defined as companies with up to 250 employees. In other words, the business both responds to requests for solutions from existing customers (pull) and actively engages with customers to grow awareness about, for example, security risks in order to sell products and services (push). The authors – drawing on a background of research in corporate resilience and SMEs (with a commercial background in the IT sector) were interested to learn from an individual with his finger very firmly on the pulse of SME cyber-security awareness, just what his view was on the general level of cyber-security awareness amongst SMEs and what his company offered in the way of assistance...|$|E
40|$|Rich {{software}} application functionality once constrained to the desktop {{is now available}} via the World Wide Web (WWW) {{with the introduction of}} emergent Web 2. 0 technologies. Leveraging the Softwareas- a-service (SaaS) model, companies can build Web-native, Operating System (OS) independent, applications usable by customers over the internet in addition to those installed natively on their computer. Effectively this enables software development companies to redirect application work cycles away from OS-specific development and, among other things, into infrastructures which encourage participation by third-party WWW developers. With these emergent technologies, and while embracing what is commonly referred to as the network-centric innovation model, companies are hoping to leverage enormous value and strategic significance by creating and protecting proprietary platforms {{while at the same time}} encouraging third-party open source development. In effect, through outward-facing Application Program Interfaces (APIs), these new models have led to the emergence and evolution of complex ecosystems within the WWW space; witness OpenSocial, Facebook, salesforce. com, Amazon, Firefox, eBay and others. eBay for one realized early-on that forging relationships with developers can support and advance its business model. Not long afterwards, [URL] was created giving developers access to a myriad of information on all current and expired auctions. This move enabled companies to enter the ecosystem and provide specialized services to customers based on information mined from eBay's API. (cont.) A few of these companies provide raw analytical data to PowerSellers-those customers doing serious business on eBay. Others use the data to <b>up-sell</b> by listing current eBay auctions on their own websites. The goal of this thesis is to explore what constitutes an appropriate strategy for insurgents intending to enter WWW ecosystems in attempts to usurp competitors within them. This will be accomplished by looking at specific businesses, their strategic options, engineering challenges and general dilemmas while attempting to create inimitability. As well, a framework will be developed for assessing ecosystem players, their influence, understanding the dynamic interactions not only between those entities, but between them and the ecosystem host, as well. by John A.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) at Strathmore UniversityPrice display {{is an integral part}} of the shopping experience in retail stores in Kenya. It helps the customer make an informed purchase decision while in the product aisle without the need for involvement of retail store staff. Current paper based price displays on retail store shelves lack reliability, durability and accuracy required for the retail stores operations. They are susceptible to wear and tear, and can be tampered with. It is also very difficult to tell exactly what price is currently displayed for a specific product on a shelf without being physically at that location. They also act as a bottleneck to these operations where other systems from the store management to the point of sale systems are computerized. This research aimed to come up with an Electronic Shelf Label system that will allow for real-time price and advertisement information update and display on retail store shelves. It will be able to integrate with store management and point of sale systems seamlessly and facilitate instant price changes when necessary. Similar systems are already in use in developed countries with varied rates of adoption and success. The key differentiator for the architecture of the proposed model is that it also provides an advertising platform where retailers can charge vendors to advertise their products. This not only creates various cross-sell and <b>up-sell</b> opportunities for the vendors, but also provides an income generation avenue for the retailers, which overcomes the initial setup costs that have otherwise made retail stores particularly in Kenya shy away from such systems in the past. It will, in the long-term, also provide a platform for analytics for both retail stores and vendors to gauge correlation between customer purchase patterns and the prices of their products as well as competitors. The research is a form of applied research. The sample size was computed through convenience non-probability sampling. Most of the respondents recommended an automated system hence the reason for creating this prototype. The prototype was developed using v-process methodology since the clarity of the user requirements was high and the technical expertise needed was readily available. The prototype produced 98 % accuracy in real-time price information update and display with alerts for the non-successful updates generated by the prototype to inform the operator so that they resend the information...|$|E
