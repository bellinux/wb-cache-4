40|$|What {{accounts}} for variance {{in public opinion}} support for the PPACA? The political science (and social science in general) literature is relatively sparse on this question. This paper suggests that state level support for the PPACA has a largely political, rather than economic, motivation. Multivariate models are estimated, with support measured {{at the state level}} using 2010 data from Gallup; explanatory variables (per capita where necessary) include <b>uninsured</b> <b>percentage,</b> change in uninsured, unemployment, Medicaid recipients, state GDP, poverty rate, percents African-American and Latino, and the state PVI. A bivariate relationship is counter-intuitive; as the rate of uninsured in a state increased, so does opposition to the PPACA. Multivariate models estimate a more nuanced picture, with partisanship, religiosity, and race being consistent significant predictors of state level support for the PPACA across three models. In other words, judgment of the PPACA as policy is mediated by pre-existing partisan attributes rather than economic indicators...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. We {{created an}} index {{quantifying}} the longitudinal burden of racial health disparities {{by state and}} compared this index to variables to guide the construction of, and validate support for, legislative efforts aimed at eliminating health disparities. Methods. We evaluated 5 focus areas of greatest racial disparities in health from 1999 to 2005 and compiled state health disparities index (HDI) scores. We compared these scores with variables representing the purported social determinants of health. Results. Massachusetts (0. 35), Oklahoma (0. 35), and Washington (0. 39) averaged the fewest disparities. Michigan (1. 22), Wisconsin (1. 32), and Illinois (1. 50) averaged the greatest disparities. The statistical reference point for nationwide average racial disparities was 1. 00. The longitudinal mixed model procedure yielded statistically significant correlations between HDI scores and Black state population percentage {{as well as with}} the racial gap in <b>uninsured</b> <b>percentages.</b> We noted a trend for HDI correlations with median household income ratios. Conclusions. On the basis of the HDI-established trends in the extent and distribution of racial health disparities, and their correlated social determinants of health, policymakers should consider incorporating this tool to advise future efforts in minority health legislation...|$|R
40|$|This policy brief {{examines}} a {{range of}} health issues and trends among California's approximately three million women ages 50 - 64, an age group that often faces new and accelerated chronic health conditions. The authors found that women ages 50 - 64 are more prone than younger women {{to a wide range}} of health conditions, including asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Nearly four in ten women in this age group will be diagnosed with high blood pressure in their lifetime while nearly six in ten are either obese or overweight -– in both cases a proportion higher than for younger women. Using data from the 2007 California Health Interview Survey, the authors also found that one-quarter of women who had never married and 21 percent of divorced, separated, or widowed women were <b>uninsured</b> -– <b>percentages</b> that are more than twice the rates of married women...|$|R
25|$|Another {{concern is}} the rate of uninsured people in the US. In June 2014, Gallup–Healthways Well–Being {{conducted}} a survey {{and found that the}} uninsured rate is going down. 13 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the <b>uninsured</b> rate (3 <b>percentage</b> points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year.|$|R
40|$|Objectives—The study {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} relationship between number of emergency departments (EDs) per capita in California counties and measures of socioeconomic status, to determine whether individuals living in areas with lower socioeconomic levels have decreased access to emergency care. Methods—The authors linked 2005 data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals with the Area Resource Files from the United States Department of Health and Human Services and performed Poisson regression analyses of the association between EDs per capita in individual California counties using the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county codes and three measures of socioeconomic status: median household income, <b>percentage</b> <b>uninsured,</b> and years of education for individuals over 25 years of age. Multivariate analyses using Poisson regression were also performed to determine if any of these measures of socioeconomic status were independently associated with access to EDs. Results—Median household income is inversely related to the number of EDs per capita (rate ratio = 0. 83; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 71 to 0. 96). Controlling for income in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} 2 ̆ 2 best practice 2 ̆ 2 recommendations for successful implementation of the EPSDT outreach program at Memorial Health System 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital for Children in Colorado Springs through a policy analysis of Medicaid EPSDT services in Colorado. A successful program at Memorial will increase education and awareness of EPSDT services, enrollment, and access to and utilization of health care services for eligible children. Methodology utilized in this study included questionnaires designed for the EPSDT contract administrator and outreach coordinators/workers; analysis of current federal and state policies; and studies conducted at {{the federal and state}} level, and by various advocacy groups. The need for this analysis of EPSDT came about in part through an awareness of increasingly high numbers of children in poverty and who are <b>uninsured.</b> Though the <b>percentage</b> of children living in poverty in Colorado is slightly below the national average (see Table 2), according to data analyzed by The Annie E.

40|$|Jan. -June) NOTES: A {{person was}} defined as uninsured {{if he or she}} did not have any private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), State-sponsored or other government-sponsored health plan, or {{military}} plan {{at the time of the}} interview. A person was also defined as uninsured if he or she had only Indian Health Service coverage or had only a private plan that paid for one type of service such as accidents or dental care. The analyses excluded persons with unknown health insurance status (about 1 % of respondents each year). The data on health insurance status were edited using an automated system based on logic checks and keyword searches. For comparability, the estimates for all years were created using these same procedures. The resulting estimates of persons without health insurance coverage are generally 0. 1 - 0. 2 percentage points lower than those based on the editing procedures used for the final data files. CI is confidence interval. Beginning with the 2003 data, the National Health Interview Survey transitioned to weights derived from the 2000 census. In this Early Release, estimates for 2000 - 02 were recalculated using weights derived from the 2000 census. See “About This Release ” and table II in the Appendix for more details.

40|$|AbstractThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims {{to expand}} {{coverage}} to the previously uninsured, {{improve the quality}} of coverage, and help eliminate inefficiencies in the health care market. We evaluated the implications of ACA on the drug industry by examining the impact on the “Dinner-for-Three” dynamic in our health care system. We can think of our system as an odd dinner party in which one person pays (the insurer), one orders the meal (the physician), and yet another eats the meal (the patient). This dynamic requires us to examine each stakeholder and how they interact with one another {{to assess the impact of}} the ACA. Of the 6. 7 million initial exchange enrollees, ~ 3. 8 million subjects were previously <b>uninsured.</b> A higher <b>percentage</b> of these enrollees are using their pharmacy benefit, and they are disproportionately filling prescriptions for specialty drugs relative to those covered in employer-sponsored plans. Formulary designs in exchange plans are passing on higher cost-sharing for prescription drugs to the patient. ACA has also resulted in the development of accountable care organizations (ACOs); these organizations may play a role going forward in the management of drug spending and the development of formularies and protocols that impact drug prescribing. Payers are tightening control over drug spending and are finding physicians and physician groups increasingly less reluctant allies in doing so. Patients are faced by more complexity than ever in the health care system and are expected to take a more active role in responsibly managing the cost of their care. It is increasingly critical that drug manufacturers develop robust value propositions and communicate that value to all stakeholders. They should re-evaluate trial investment decisions and consider changes in price setting, rebates (how much and to whom), copay programs, and physician and patient support programs in light of changing market needs...|$|R

40|$|Two {{additional}} {{questions were}} added to the health insurance section of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) beginning with quarter 3 of 2004 to improve the accuracy of the estimates. Therefore, some estimates reported here are not directly comparable with estimates previously published. From January through September 2004, 41. 6 million persons of all ages (14. 5 %) were uninsured {{at the time of the}} interview, 51. 0 million (17. 7 %) had been uninsured for at least part of the year prior to the interview, and 28. 9 million (10. 1 %) had been uninsured for more than a year at the time of the interview. For children under age 18 years, the <b>percentage</b> <b>uninsured</b> at the time of the interview was 9. 2 % in the first three quarters of 2004, continuing the decline observed since 1997. The <b>percentage</b> of children <b>uninsured</b> for more than a year has continued to decrease since 1997. From January through September 2004, 69. 6 % of poor children and 44. 6 % of near poor children were covered by a public health plan at the time of interview. From 1999 through 2003, the estimates of public coverage increased among children, but the largest increase was seen among near poor children. During the same period, there was a decreasing trend in the percentage of poor and near poor children with private coverage. However, the differences in the estimates of private or public coverage between 2003 and the first 9 months of 2004 for children were not statistically significant. During the first 9 months of 2004, more than 58 % of currently unemployed adults and nearly 21 % of employed adults aged 18 – 64 years had been uninsured for at least part of the past year, and 32. 8 % of currently unemployed adults and 12. 6 % of employed adults had been uninsured for more than a year...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, HIV has become a {{worldwide}} epidemic. Given the surge {{in the rate of}} sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, this sheds light as a new worry for sexually active older adults, raising questions about risk behaviors among this group. The issues facing older adults are three-fold in that they are 1) not identifying themselves as being at risk; 2) not identifying risk behaviors; and 3) are not largely being identified in the public realm as participating in risk behaviors. For these reasons, understanding both environmental and individual factors and their unique influences on HIV risk behaviors among older adults is very important. A study was undertaken to develop an understanding of the environmental and individual population factors that predict HIV risk behaviors among older adults using population- based data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and eight state level data sources, guided by Andersen 2 ̆ 7 s Behavioral Model of Health Utilization (2007). The model investigated the predictive ability of social and environmental factors in addition to individual factors on HIV risk behaviors. Methods: The research design for the study was a multilevel repeated cross-sectional design with a three level nested structure. The software package MLwiN was used to conduct the multilevel analysis using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) analytical method to assess the fit of models with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. Using a nationally representative sample of 23, 950 individuals from 2008 to 2011, nested in 51 states, the trend study allowed for an understanding of the state and individual-level factors that predict participating in HIV risk behaviors. Results: In each step, the model fit improved the DIC statistic. Overall, the results indicated that there were differences between states and their levels of HIV risk behaviors. While HIV risk behaviors decreased from 2008 to 2011, there was significant variation between and within states in the probability of individual HIV risk behaviors. States that had a higher percentage white females, a higher <b>percentage</b> of persons <b>uninsured,</b> a higher <b>percentage</b> of whites with AIDS, a lower percentage of Asians with AIDS, and a lower percentage of Other races with AIDS had a higher probability of individuals participating in HIV risk behaviors. All of the individual predictors of HIV risk behaviors were statistically significant. Conclusion: With the increase in older adults living with HIV or becoming diagnosed or infected later in life, it is paramount that HIV risk behaviors are examined in this population. Results indicated that states that had more white females, more people who are uninsured, and whites, Asians, and other races living with AIDS were environments that had higher levels of HIV risk behaviors. Recommendations for future research are made, with education, policy, and practice implications discussed...|$|R
