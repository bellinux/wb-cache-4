5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> not have a standing army.|$|E
5|$|In September, Paul {{stated that}} the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> avoid {{military}} intervention in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. In an op-ed, Paul disputed the Obama administration's claims {{that the threat of}} military force caused Syria's government to consider turning over its chemical weapons, instead arguing that the opposition to military action in Syria, and the delay that it caused, led to diplomatic progress.|$|E

5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Friedman {{accepted}} {{a position at}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left because of differences with faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II. Friedman believed the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> enter the war. In 1943, Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University (headed by W. Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling), where he {{spent the rest of}} World War II working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of weapons design, military tactics, and metallurgical experiments.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E

5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> join the League of Nations. While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate membership. He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act; the United States never joined the World Court.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project from OSRD, and Groves became the project's director. He {{tightened}} security, which dried up {{the flow of information}} to Britain. American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.|$|E
5|$|John Service, {{while under}} Stilwell's command, {{served as a}} {{diplomatic}} observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking. Over the next three months, he sent {{a series of reports}} to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society {{in stark contrast to the}} corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang. This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies, and this position ruined both careers.|$|E

5|$|Olver {{has been}} a staunch {{opponent}} of the United States involvement in Iraq, and opposed a United States military presence in Iraq since the 2002 authorization {{for the use of}} force in Iraq. Olver has advocated for the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and has consistently voted against proposals to increase funding for military operations and increased deployment. Olver stated that he believes that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> seek out a political solution in cooperation with the states neighboring Iraq, such as Iran and Syria, rather than pursuing a strategy based primarily on military means in order to create a stable and democratic Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The MAUD Committee reports {{urged the}} {{co-operation}} with the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> be {{continued in the}} research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once {{he returned to the}} United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

5|$|The Polish {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam, {{his wife}} Francoise Ulam, who performed the calculations, and their collaborator, Cornelius Everett, {{worked on the}} Super design through 1949. There was no push from the military for the weapon, because the AEC regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military Liaison Committee or the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project about it. In September 1949, the Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device. It fell to Oppenheimer, {{as chairman of the}} AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), to decide whether the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> develop the Super in response. The Super design used large quantities of tritium, which could only be manufactured in a reactor, and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons, so the GAC advised against it. Nonetheless, Truman approved the Super on January 31, 1950. Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision, accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds, and this was a factor in the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954.|$|E
5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him to believe that there was no point in hiding it from them.|$|E
5|$|In Hawaii, Blaine {{worked to}} bind the kingdom {{more closely to}} the United States and to avoid its {{becoming}} a British protectorate. When the McKinley Tariff of 1890 eliminated the duty on sugar, Hawaiian sugar-growers looked {{for a way to}} retain their once-exclusive access to the American market. The Hawaiian minister to the United States, Henry A. P. Carter, tried to arrange for Hawaii have complete trade reciprocity with the United States, but Blaine proposed instead that Hawaii become an American protectorate; Carter favored the idea, but the Hawaiian king, Kalākaua, rejected the infringement on his sovereignty. Blaine next procured the appointment of his former newspaper colleague John L. Stevens as minister to Hawaii. Stevens had long believed that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> annex Hawaii, and as minister he co-operated with Americans living in Hawaii in their efforts to bring about annexation. Their efforts ultimately culminated in a coup d'état against Kalākaua’s successor, Liliuokalani, in 1893. Blaine’s precise involvement is undocumented, but the results of Stevens’ diplomacy were in accord with his ambitions for American power in the region. The new government petitioned the United States for annexation, but by that time Blaine was no longer in office.|$|E

5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> not abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E
