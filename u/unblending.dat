This {{improvement}} increases with increasing blending fold and decreasing survey time. An interesting consequence of this property is that blended surveys {{can be carried out}} under more severe noise conditions than <b>unblended</b> surveys. It is advised to optimize the survey time in areas with a large background noise level or in areas with severe environmental restrictions or in areas where access is only for a limited time period.

40|$|Our {{recent studies}} have {{identified}} benzylamine (BZA) as a promising candidate for CO₂ capture processes, however the formation of stable and insoluble BZA-carbamate salts in highly concentrated <b>unblended</b> BZA solutions, and at high CO₂ loadings, severely restricts the working concentration of the <b>unblended</b> BZA solvent. Thus, BZA is ideally placed {{as a candidate for}} use in a formulated solvent to improve the overall amine concentration and CO₂ loading which can be used. The current work focuses on the investigation of CO₂ absorption into aqueous solutions of BZA as well as formulations of BZA incorporating MEA and AMP as the second amine components, respectively. Mass transfer/kinetic measurements using a wetted wall column (WWC) at 40 °C have been performed for a series of <b>unblended</b> BZA solutions as well as a series of amine concentrations and ratios in the formulations. Overall mass transfer coefficients as a function of total CO₂ loading in the solutions (0. 0 - 0. 4 mol CO₂/total mole amine in solution) have been determined for the <b>unblended</b> BZA solutions and formulations. CO₂ absorption rates into <b>unblended</b> BZA solutions are significantly faster than in MEA solutions at similar concentrations and zero CO₂ loading. The majority of the BZA formulations investigated here can be considered promising candidates for CO₂ capture and possess larger or comparable mass transfer rates (up to 30 % increase at low loadings) when compared to the corresponding <b>unblended</b> 5. 0 and 6. 0 M MEA solutions under similar conditions. Formulations containing BZA and MEA demonstrated the fastest CO₂ absorption rates overall due to the presence of two fast reacting amines, both of which can actively and directly contribute to the absorption of CO₂...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Past {{research}} has implied {{that differences in}} blender performance between commercial and laboratory particleboard blenders may not be attributed to resin distribution between screen fractions, as is commonly believed in the industry today, but to which particles within a screen fraction have resin and which do note To test this, the effect of varying resin distributions within screen fractions was studied and related to internal bond, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and linear expansion. A commercial particleboard furnish was screened into four different fractions, and boards {{were made in the}} laboratory in such a manner that each board had a different percentage of <b>unblended</b> particles of different screen fraction size. Test results showed that as the ratio of <b>unblended</b> particles in a board increased from 0 to 50 percent, strength properties decreased, probably due to an increasing lack of bonding sites between particles coming into contact with each other as the ratio increased. A significant finding in this study was that when the entire fines fraction (- 20 - mesh Tyler) was <b>unblended,</b> strength properties were lower than when the entire coarse fraction was <b>unblended</b> (+ 20 -mesh Tyler). The reason the <b>unblended</b> fines had such a great influence on reducing strength properties was attributed to the extremely large relative surface area (87. 8 percent of the total surface area in the board) that the fines have. When such a high percentage of surface area in a board goes <b>unblended,</b> strength properties tend to decrease. When the average internal bond was plotted at each ratio of <b>unblended</b> particles, it was determined present commercial standards (CS 236 - 66 Type 1 B 1) for internal bond of a 43 pounds per cubic foot board could be met with the laboratory blender by not blending 50 percent of the furnish in a board. If a commercial blender could obtain the efficiency of the laboratory blender, a greater percentage of particles could be blended resulting in greater internal bond properties. Substantial resin savings could then be realized by reducing the total resin content of the furnish to the point where standards could still be met. Obtaining optimum relative spread rates of resin to relative surface area in each fraction is throught to be the best solution for increasing resin efficiency in commercial particleboard blenders. The particleboard industry may be able to make resin savings by utilizing blenders in parallel to accomplish obtaining optimum relative spread rates...|$|R
