50|$|The Proton-M {{launch vehicle}} {{consists}} of 3 stages; {{all of them}} powered by liquid rocket engines using the hypergolic propellant combination of dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer, and <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> for fuel (see infobox).|$|R
5000|$|... 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (<b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> UDMH) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (symmetrical dimethylhydrazine) are hydrazines {{where two}} {{hydrogen}} atoms {{are replaced by}} methyl groups.

40|$|The initial {{rates of}} heat release {{produced}} by the reactions of hydrazine and <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> with nitric acid were determined in a bomb calorimeter under conditions of forced mixing. Fuel-oxidant weight ratio and injection velocity were varied. The {{rate of heat release}} apparently depended on the interfacial area between the propellants. Above a narrow range of injection velocities representing a critical amount of interfacial area, the rates reached a maximum and were almost constant with injection velocity. The maximum rate for hydrazine was about 70 percent greater than that for <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine.</b> The total heat released did not vary with mixture ratio over the range studied...|$|R
5000|$|The YZ-1 has a {{thrust of}} [...] with a {{specific}} impulse of 315.5 seconds. It uses the storable hypergolic propellants <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), and can perform at least two burns within its rated life of 6.5 hours.|$|R

50|$|Like ethylenediamine, DETA {{can also}} be used to sensitize nitromethane, making a liquid {{explosive}} compound similar to PLX. This compound is cap sensitive with an explosive velocity of around 6200 m/s and is discussed in patent #3,713,915. Mixed with <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> it was used as Hydyne, a propellent for liquid-fuel rockets.|$|R
50|$|Hydyne is {{a mixture}} of 60% <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and 40% {{diethylenetriamine}} (DETA), developed in 1957 at Rocketdyne for use in liquid-fuel rockets. Hydyne was used as the fuel for the first stage of the Juno I rocket that launched Explorer 1, the first successful satellite launch conducted by the United States.|$|R
50|$|All {{models are}} 11.35 m long (except Scud-A, which is 1 m shorter) and 0.88 m in diameter.

50|$|The {{most common}} hypergolic fuels, hydrazine, {{monomethylhydrazine}} and <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> and oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide, are all liquid at ordinary temperatures and pressures. They are therefore sometimes called storable liquid propellants. They {{are suitable for}} use in spacecraft missions lasting many years. The cryogenity of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen limits their practical use to space launch vehicles {{where they need to}} be stored only briefly.|$|R

50|$|Aerozine 50 is a 50/50 mix {{by weight}} of {{hydrazine}} and <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH). Originally {{developed in the}} late 1950s by Aerojet General Corporation as a storable, high-energy, hypergolic fuel for the Titan II ICBM rocket engines. Aerozine continues in wide use as a rocket fuel, typically with dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer, with which it is hypergolic. Aerozine 50 is more stable than hydrazine alone, and has a higher density and boiling point than UDMH alone.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH; 1,1-dimethylhydrazine) is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula H2NN(CH3)2. It is a colorless liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammoniacal smell typical for organic amines. Samples turn yellowish on exposure to air and absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide. It mixes completely with water, ethanol, and kerosene. In concentration between 2.5% and 95% in air, its vapors are flammable. It is not sensitive to shock. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (CH3NHNH(CH3)) {{is also known}} but is not as useful.|$|R
50|$|The actual rocket {{design is}} a liquid fuel rocket, {{generally}} believed {{to use a}} hypergolic combination of <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) as fuel, and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) as oxidizer. Once the fuel/oxidizer combination are fed into the missile, it could maintain a 'ready to launch' condition for several days, or even weeks, like the R-27 SLBM, in moderate ambient temperatures. A fueled Hwasong-10 {{would not have the}} structural strength to be safely land transported, so would have to be fueled at the launch site.|$|R
50|$|Still another {{process has}} been found for the {{production}} of TATB from materials that are surplus to military use. 1,1,1-trimethylhydrazinium iodide (TMHI) is formed from the rocket fuel <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and methyl iodide, and acts as a vicarious nucleophilic substitution (VNS) amination reagent. When Picramide, which is easily produced from Explosive D, is reacted with TMHI it is aminated to TATB. Thus, materials that would have had to have been destroyed when no longer needed are converted into a high value explosive.|$|R
50|$|The R-27 Zyb was a submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile {{developed by the}} Soviet Union and employed by the Soviet Navy from 1968 through 1988. NATO assigned the missile the reporting name SS-N-6 Serb. In the USSR, it was given the GRAU index 4K10. It was a liquid fuel rocket using a hypergolic combination of <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) as fuel, and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) as oxidizer. Between 1974 and 1990, 161 missile launches were conducted, with an average success rate of 93%. Total production was 1800 missiles.|$|R
50|$|Dimethylamine is a {{precursor}} to several industrially significant compounds. It reacts with carbon disulfide to give dimethyl dithiocarbamate, {{a precursor}} to a family of chemicals widely used in the vulcanization of rubber. The solvents dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide are derived from dimethylamine. It is raw material {{for the production of}} many agrichemicals and pharmaceuticals, such as dimefox and diphenhydramine, respectively. The chemical weapon tabun is derived from dimethylamine. The surfactant lauryl dimethylamine oxide is found in soaps and cleaning compounds. <b>Unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> a rocket fuel, is prepared from dimethylamine.|$|R
40|$|Derivatives of hydrazines formed, then {{subjected}} to gas chromatography and detected via chemiluminescence. In method of detecting and quantifying hydrazine vapors, vapors reacted with dinitro compound to enhance sensitivity and selectivity. Hydrazine (HZ), monomethyl hydrazine, (MMH), and <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, either {{alone or in}} mixtures. Vapors collected and reacted with 2, 4 -dinitrobenzaldehyde, (DNB), {{making it possible to}} concentrate hydrazine in derivative form, thereby increasing sensitivity to low initial concentrations. Increases selectivity because only those constituents of sample reacting with DNB concentrated for analysis...|$|R
40|$|Within {{recent years}} {{hydrazine}} and the methyl substituted hydrazines {{have come into}} considerable use as rocket fuels. As {{a result of this}} increased production of hydrazines, the possibility of accidental human exposure is of considerable interest. Obvious concern results from the fact that hydrazine had been used as an experimental means of producing fatty liver in experimental animals for many years. On an acute toxicity basis, O’Brien and coworkers (1964) reported comparative lethal dosebo (LDSo) values for hydrazine 64 mg / kg (2 mmoles/kg), rnonomethylhydrazine (MMH) 28 mg/kg (0. 61 mmoles / kg), 1,l-dimethyl-hydrazine (<b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> UDMH) 102 mg/kg (1. 7 m...|$|R
40|$|Diffuse {{reflectance}} spectroscopy of fuel hydrazines adsorbed on silica, silica-alumina and alimina surfaces {{indicates that}} the primary surface-hydrazine interaction is hydrogen bonding. Hydrazine, on adsorption to a deuterated silica surface, undergoes a rapid H/D exchange with deuterated surface silanol (Si-OD) groups. Adsorption equilibria are rapidly established at room temperature. Monomethylhydrazine and <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> are similarly adsorbed. On adsorption, the C-H stretching and methyl deformation modes of the methylhydrazines are shifted to higher frequencies by 10 to 20 cm(- 1). These shifts are postulated {{to be due to}} changes in the lone-pair electro-density on the adjacent nitrogen atom and an electronegativity effect...|$|R
40|$|Dimethylamine and nitrite, {{which are}} non-combustion {{reaction}} products of <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) propellants, can contaminate spacesuits during extra-vehicular activity (EVA) operations. They can react with {{water in the}} International Space Station (ISS) airlock to form N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. Detection methods for assessing nitrite and dimethylamine contamination were investigated. The methods are based on color-forming reactions in which intensity of color is proportional to concentration. A concept color detection kit using a commercially available presumptive field test for methamphetamine coupled with nitrite test strips was developed and used to detect dimethylamine and nitrite. Contamination mitigation strategies were also developed...|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{claim that}} Proton rocket fuel (<b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH)) and debris created by Russia's space {{programme}} is poisoning areas of Russia and Kazakhstan. Residents claim that acid rain falls after some launches. Anatoly Kuzin, {{deputy director of}} the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, has however denied these claims, saying: [...] "We did special research into the issue. The level of acidity in the atmosphere is not affected by the rocket launches and there is no data to prove any link between the illnesses Altai and the influence of rocket fuel components or space activity of any kind".|$|R
5000|$|NDMA is an {{industrial}} by-product or waste product of several industrial processes. Manufacturing of <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH), {{which is a}} component of rocket fuel that requires NDMA for its synthesis. Of more general concern, water treatment via chlorination or chloramination of organic nitrogen-containing wastewater {{can lead to the}} production of NDMA at potentially harmful levels. [...] Further, NDMA can form or be leached during treatment of water by anion exchange resins. [...] Finally, NDMA is found at low levels in numerous items of human consumption including cured meat, fish, beer, and tobacco smoke [...] It is, however, unlikely to bioaccumulate.|$|R
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the Universal Rocket family, the Proton-K was fuelled by <b>Unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> and {{nitrogen}} tetroxide. These were hypergolic fuels which burn on contact, avoiding the need for an ignition system, and can be stored at ambient temperatures. This avoids the need for low-temperature-tolerant components, and allowed the rocket to sit on the pad fully fuelled for long periods of time. In contrast, cryogenic fuels would have required periodic topping-up of propellants as they boil off. The fuels used on the Proton, were, however, corrosive and toxic and required special handling. The Russian Government paid for the cleanup of residual propellent in spent stages that impact downrange.|$|R
50|$|MMH and its {{chemical}} relative <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) have a {{key advantage}} that they are stable enough {{to be used in}} regeneratively cooled rocket engines. The Apollo Lunar Modules used a one-to-one mixture of hydrazine and UDMH (called Aerozine 50, or A-50) as one part of the rocket fuel for lunar landings and takeoff: the rocket motors formed a hypergolic mixture of the hydrazines with liquid dinitrogen tetroxide as the usual oxidizer. (Otherwise, red fuming nitric acid works.) About three tons of mixed hydrazines and four and one half tons of the oxidizer were required for each landing, and about one-third of those amounts for the lunar take-off to orbit.|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{claim that}} Proton rocket fuel (<b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH)) and debris created by Russia's space {{programme}} is poisoning areas of Russia and Kazakhstan.

The level of acidity in the atmosphere is not affected by the rocket launches and there is no data to prove any link between the illnesses Altai and the influence of rocket fuel components or space activity of any kind".|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} Redstone {{was fueled}} with a 75 percent ethyl alcohol 25 percent water solution, {{essentially the same}} propellants as the V-2, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used hydyne fuel, a blend of 60 percent <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and 40 percent diethylenetriamine (DETA). [...] This was a more powerful fuel than ethyl alcohol, {{but it was also}} more toxic, which could be hazardous for an astronaut in a launch pad emergency. [...] Furthermore, hydyne had never been used with the new A-7 engine. [...] The Mercury-Redstone designers rejected hydyne and returned to the standard ethyl alcohol fuel. The lengthened propellant tanks were thus also necessary in lieu of using less powerful fuel.|$|R
40|$|The electrocatalytic {{oxidation}} of <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) {{has been studied}} on a Prussian Blue modified carbon paste electrode (PBMCPE) by cyclic voltammetry technique. The results show that Prussian Blue acts as a suitable modifier for electron transfer in the oxidation of UDMH. A linear range of 3 &# 215; 10 - 5 to 1. 15 &# 215; 10 - 3 mol L- 1, with a limit of detection (3 &# 963;) of 1. 6 &# 215; 10 - 5 mol L- 1 was obtained using the amperometric method. The proposed sensor exhibited several advantages, including, namely, no interference from hydrazine, simple preparation, good stability and repeatability. Finally, the PBMCPE was successfully applied for determination of UDMH in water samples...|$|R
50|$|The Jupiter-C and Juno I rockets {{used the}} same first-stage engines as the missile, but needed more thrust due to the {{increased}} size of the payload/warhead. With {{the use of the}} newly developed Hydyne, composed of a blend of 60% <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and 40% diethylenetriamine (DETA), the Jupiter-C and Juno I engines gained a 12% increase in thrust and higher specific impulse. The resulting fuel was not only more powerful fuel than alcohol, but also more toxic. The first Hydyne-powered Redstone R&D flight took place on November 29, 1956. After the three Jupiter C and six Juno I launches including the launch of America's first satellite, Explorer I), Hydyne was discontinued in favor of higher performing fuels.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, when Brezhnev {{decided to}} examine a uranium mine shaft, the {{visitors}} had a shortage of protective suits. Ryabenko wore none and received a high dose of radiation. On 24 October 1960 he got exposed to the toxic chemical <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> shortly after the Nedelin catastrophe, in which a ballistic rocket exploded on the launch pad. As a result, Ryabenko was hospitalized for two months with a heart attack. On 9 February 1961 he was with Brezhnev when their plane was attacked by hijacked French jet fighters above the Mediterranean Sea. On 23 March 1982, a platform with people collapsed above Brezhnev and his entourage at a factory near Tashkent. Both Brezhnev and Ryabenko received concussions.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1989, five separate, peer-reviewed {{studies of}} Alar and its {{chemical}} breakdown product, <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH), {{had found a}} correlation between exposure to the chemicals and cancerous tumors in lab animals. In 1984 and again in 1987, the EPA classified Alar as a probable human carcinogen. In 1986, the American Academy of Pediatrics urged the EPA to ban it. Well before the 60 Minutes broadcast, public concern had already led six national grocery chains and nine major food processors to stop accepting apples treated with Alar. Washington State growers had pledged to voluntarily stop using it (although tests later revealed that many did not). Maine and Massachusetts had banned it outright.|$|R
50|$|To {{power the}} new design, Valentin Glushko, who then held a near-monopoly on rocket engine {{design in the}} Soviet Union, {{proposed}} a new engine, the RD-270, running on <b>unsymmetrical</b> <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). This formula is hypergolic (i.e., its components ignite on contact, reducing {{the complexity of the}} combustion system), and was widely used in Glushko's existing engine designs used on various ICBMs. The propellant pair UDMH/N2O4 has a lower potential specific impulse than kerosene/liquid oxygen, but because the RD-270 used the much more efficient full flow staged combustion cycle, as opposed to the simple gas-generator cycle used on the American F-1 rocket engine, the specific impulse of the RD-270 was higher than the F-1.|$|R
