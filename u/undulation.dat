The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little <b>undulation.</b> However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
50|$|The <b>undulations</b> form a {{standing}} wave pattern, {{relative to the}} undular bore front. So, the phase velocity (propagation velocity relative to still water) of the <b>undulations</b> is just high {{enough to keep the}} <b>undulations</b> stationary relative to the bore front. Now, in water waves, the group velocity (which is also the energy-transport velocity) is less than the phase velocity. Therefore, on average, wave energy of the <b>undulations</b> is transported away from the front, and contributing to the energy loss in the region of the front.|$|R
40|$|Centipedes {{have many}} body {{segments}} {{and legs and}} they generate body <b>undulations</b> during terrestrial locomotion. Centipede locomotion has the characteristic that body <b>undulations</b> are absent at low speeds but appear at faster speeds; furthermore, their amplitude and wavelength increase with increasing speed. There are conflicting reports regarding whether the muscles along the body axis resist or support these body <b>undulations</b> and the underlying mechanisms responsible for the body <b>undulations</b> remain largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated centipede locomotion dynamics using computer simulation with a body-mechanical model and experiment with a centipede-like robot and then conducted dynamic analysis with a simple model to clarify the mechanism. The results reveal that body <b>undulations</b> in these models occur due to an instability caused by a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We subsequently compared these results with data obtained using actual centipedes. The model and actual centipedes exhibit similar dynamic properties, despite centipedes being complex, nonlinear dynamic systems. Based on our findings, we propose a possible passive mechanism for body <b>undulations</b> in centipedes, similar to a follower force or jackknife instability. We also discuss {{the roles of the}} muscles along the body axis in generating body <b>undulations</b> in terms of our physical model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of shoreline <b>undulations</b> along the Atlantic coast of Fire Island, NY requires careful consideration in developing erosion control and hurricane protection plans and design alternatives {{for the protection}} of the Fire Island barrier and the Long Island mainland. An analysis and geometric characterization of these morphologic shoreline features revealed that the magnitude of the shoreline <b>undulations</b> approximates typical protective berm design widths and exceeds typical advance nourishment beach widths. Because shoreline <b>undulations</b> are natural morphologic features of the Fire Island shoreline their presence after project construction must be anticipated. Conclusions drawn from the analysis of the Fire Island shoreline <b>undulations</b> indicate that the design berm width could be compromised well before scheduled renourishment if explicit consideration of shoreline <b>undulations</b> is not included in the development of the design cross-section...|$|R

Based on the ellipsoidal height by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations, the accurate orthometric height {{can be calculated}} by adding precise and accurate geoid <b>undulations</b> model information. However, GGMs also provide data from the satellite gravity missions such as GRACE, GOCE and CHAMP. Thus, this will assist to enhance the global geoid <b>undulations</b> data. A statistical assessment has been made between geoid <b>undulations</b> derived from 4 GGMs and the airborne gravity data provided by Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM). The goal {{of this study is}} the selection of the best possible GGM that best matches statistically with the geoid <b>undulations</b> of airborne gravity data under the Marine Geodetic Infrastructures in Malaysian Waters (MAGIC) Project over marine areas in Sabah. The correlation coefficients and the RMS value for the geoid <b>undulations</b> of GGM and airborne gravity data were computed. The correlation coefficients between EGM 2008 and airborne gravity data is 1 while RMS value is 0. 1499. In this study, the RMS value of EGM 2008 is the lowest among the others. Regarding to the statistical analysis, it clearly represents that EGM 2008 is the best fit for marine geoid <b>undulations</b> throughout South China Sea...|$|R

25|$|When swimming, {{the waves}} become larger {{as they move}} down the snake's body, and the wave travels {{backwards}} faster than the snake moves forwards. Thrust is generated by pushing their body against the water, resulting in the observed slip. In spite of overall similarities, {{studies show that the}} pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral <b>undulation,</b> which justifies calling them separate modes. All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the Earth's true gravity field, {{the equilibrium}} figure of sea water, or the geoid, {{will also be}} of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks {{out as much as}} 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the <b>undulation</b> of the geoid, symbol , and is closely related to the disturbing potential.|$|E
40|$|The late Holocene mud wedge on the Adriatic shelf {{offshore}} Ortona, Italy, shows undulating sub-parallel seismic reflector sequences which extend several kilometres along {{strike and}} 100 – 200 m down-dip in water depth between 20 and 80 m. The amplitude of such <b>undulations</b> {{is up to}} 5 m and the <b>undulations</b> continue as stacked sediment packages downwards throughout the 35 m thick mud wedge. The <b>undulations</b> are separated by 4 ° to 5 ° dipping boundary zones and at first glance these sediment <b>undulations</b> resemble the seafloor sedimentary structures visible in the Humboldt Feature offshore California. There is an ongoing debate whether seafloor <b>undulations</b> {{are the result of}} deformation processes or sediment deposition and/or reworking due to submarine shelf currents. A dense net of recently reprocessed and digitally interpreted high-resolution Chirp seismic data on the Adriatic shelf favours an interpretation that these <b>undulations</b> developed, in {{the upper part of the}} stratigraphic section through sediment reworking rather than through deformation. There are three lines of evidence for this: (1) the spatial extent of the <b>undulations</b> coincides with higher seabed reflector amplitudes than found both on the shelf and in the distal part of the shelf. If the features were solely caused by slope failure there should be no change of amplitudes, (2) the seabed reflector amplitude is generally higher on the gently dipping or flat upslope limbs than on the steeper downslope limbs, supporting a current origin that causes preferred deposition of sediments with higher acoustic impedance on the top, (3) the boundaries between the <b>undulations</b> are dipping at angles that are much lower than the angle of internal friction of these sediments excluding that a simple model like the Mohr–Coulomb under gravitational loading could describe the <b>undulations</b> as sediment deformation and failures...|$|R

The Jewish printing house of Lazăr Șaraga hosted Steuerman's selection of Romanian literature, Autori români ("Romanian Authors"). Published in or around 1893, it was divided into two volumes: the Anthology-proper and the Chrestomathy. Steuerman and Șaraga published a second edition in 1896. Between these, Steuerman and his editor worked on translations {{from the work of}} philosopher Vasile Conta, putting out the Theory of Universal <b>Undulation</b> in 1894, and the Basic Metaphysics in 1896.

25|$|A third {{model is}} the geoid, a more complex and {{accurate}} representation of Earth's shape coincident with what mean sea level would be {{if there were no}} winds, tides, or land. Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, conformality and equivalence. Therefore, in geoidal projections that preserve such properties, the mapped graticule would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid's graticule. Normally the geoid is not used as an Earth model for projections, however, because Earth's shape is very regular, with the <b>undulation</b> of the geoid amounting to less than 100m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3millionm Earth radius. For irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids, however, sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial lateral <b>undulation</b> is {{the most}} common mode of {{terrestrial}} locomotion for most snake species. In this mode, the posteriorly moving waves push against contact points in the environment, such as rocks, twigs, irregularities in the soil, etc. Each of these environmental objects, in turn, generates a reaction force directed forward and towards the midline of the snake, resulting in forward thrust while the lateral components cancel out. The speed of this movement depends upon the density of push-points in the environment, with a medium density of about 8 along the snake's length being ideal. The wave speed is precisely the same as the snake speed, and as a result, every point on the snake's body follows the path of the point ahead of it, allowing snakes to move through very dense vegetation and small openings.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe central Nile Deep-Sea Fan {{contains}} a broad area of seabed destabilisation {{in association with}} fluid seepage: slope-parallel sediment <b>undulations</b> are associated with multibeam high-backscatter patches (HBPs) related to authigenic carbonates. During the 2011 APINIL campaign, a deep-towed sidescan and profiling system (SAR) was used to acquire high-resolution data along three transects across water depths of 1, 700 - 2, 650 m. Three seabed domains are distinguished, all developed within stratified sediments overlying mass-transport deposits (MTDs). Upslope of the <b>undulations</b> (< 1, 950 m), sidescan HBPs record focused fluid seepage via seabed cracks. In the western area of <b>undulations,</b> sidescan HBPs are distinct from intermediate-backscatter patches (IBPs) that extend up to 850 m parallel to the <b>undulations,</b> mainly along their downslope flanks; some contain sub-circular HBPs up to 300 m wide, three associated with smaller (< 10 m) hydroacoustic gas flares. Focused fluid seeps are inferred to have shifted over time to form elongate carbonate pavements, preferentially along the footwalls of faults beneath the <b>undulations</b> that provide pathways for fluid flow. In contrast, in the eastern area of <b>undulations,</b> sidescan imagery reveal only slope-transverse furrows formed by turbulent flows, interpreted to indicate that fossil carbonates sampled during submersible operations have been exhumed by erosion...|$|R
40|$|A {{field of}} {{sediment}} <b>undulations</b> has been mapped {{by means of}} high resolution multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection profiles in the Llobregat River prodelta, off the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Similar features had previously been recognized in other prodelta environments and interpreted either as downslope sediment deformation or sedimentary structures induced by bottom currents or hyperpycnal flows. Since the study area is undergoing significant offshore development, proper interpretation of such sediment <b>undulations</b> is needed for a correct risk assessment. The occurrence of the sediment <b>undulations</b> is restricted to the prodelta front on slope gradients between 3 and 0. 2 º. The <b>undulations</b> have developed at the edge and atop an area of gas bearing sediments within the Late-Holocene high-stand mud wedge. An evaluation is made {{of the characteristics of}} the sediment <b>undulations</b> {{in order to determine the}} most likely process for the origin of these structures. Amongst these characteristics are the continuity of the reflections and lack of diffractions in between different <b>undulations,</b> their size distribution (large to small) both from shallow to deep and with depth in section, the asymmetry (decreasing from proximal to distal), the crest to trough vertical distance on the landward side of the <b>undulations</b> (up to 0. 5 m), and the lack of features that could indicate a progressive movement such as growth structures and drag folds. These characteristics indicate that the sediment <b>undulations</b> on the Llobregat River prodelta do not result from sediment deformation, but rather from the interaction of bottom currents generated by hyperpycnal flows from the Llobregat River with regional sea water circulation.

25|$|Most snakes move using lateral <b>undulation</b> where {{a lateral}} wave travels down the snake's {{body in the}} {{opposite}} direction to the snake's motion and pushes the snake off irregularities in the ground. This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, rectilinear locomotion, is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as pythons and boa. Here large scales {{on the underside of the}} body, known as scutes are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective on a flat surface and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use concertina locomotion for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the caenophidian snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as sidewinding on sand or loose soil. The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line crosswise.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies subtly in a pulsating rhythm. While {{various parts of the}} hand or arm may be involved in the motion, the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length, which causes an <b>undulation</b> in pitch. Some violinists oscillate backwards, or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato, since it is believed that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound. Vibrato does little, if anything, to disguise an out-of-tune note; in other words, misapplied vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation. Scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and more effective. Music students are often taught that unless otherwise marked in music, vibrato is assumed. However, it has to be noted that this is only a trend; there is nothing on the sheet music that compels violinists to add vibrato. This can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all, such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles.|$|E
