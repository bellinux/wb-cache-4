More complex panels use a Bus network topology where the wire basically is a data loop {{around the perimeter of the}} facility, and has drops for the sensor devices which must include a <b>unique</b> <b>device</b> <b>identifier</b> integrated into the sensor device itself (e.g. id. biscuit).

40|$|The Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”) prohibits {{video tape}} service {{providers}} from disclosing their consumers’ video rental or sale records. Although the VPPA was originally enacted to regulate disclosures by brick-and-mortar video rental stores, litigators have more recently used the VPPA {{as a vehicle}} to regulate disclosures by online video content providers. The application of the VPPA to video streaming via web browsers and mobile devices raises new questions of statutory interpretation. One key question is whether the scope of the VPPA is broad enough to cover a disclosure of a <b>unique</b> <b>device</b> <b>identifier</b> of a user’s device, rather than a user’s name, in conjunction with the title of a video streamed by the device.

Recently, Identifier (ID) /Locator (LOC) separation based mobility management scheme has been proposed for wireless sensor network. However, it does not perform well in group-based mobility {{management in}} wireless body area network, and thus it tends to induce large registration, packet delivery, and handover delays. To overcome these limitations, we propose a group-based mobility management scheme based on ID/LOC separation concept for ID-based communications with location-based routing {{to reduce the number of}} control messages. In the proposed scheme, each sensor device has a globally <b>unique</b> <b>device</b> <b>identifier</b> (GDID) which contains the information of its home network domain. For handover support, each access gateway maintains its home GDID register (HGR) and visiting GDID register (VGR) which are used to keep the GDID-locator (LOC) mappings for primary mobile devices in the distributed manner. Besides, in the proposed scheme, only the coordinator will send Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement messages to reduce the control messages further. By numerical analysis, we show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the registration, packet delivery, and handover delays, compared to the existing schemes...|$|E

In measuring the anonymity afforded by {{the elements of a}} Bluetooth device profile, we find that (i) attributes such as the device class are poor for linking sightings of the same device; (ii) the device name can provide a surprising amount of anonymity but when it does not it can be a very effective key to link devices with individuals; and (iii) frequently users exhibit privacy-adverse behavior, such as placing telephone numbers in device names or using nicknames that are statistically rare.

40|$|Free mobile {{applications}} (apps) {{available on}} app marketplaces are largely monetized through mobile advertising. The number of clicks received on the advertisements (ads) {{and thus the}} revenue gained from them can be increased by showing targeted ads to users. Mobile advertising networks collect a variety of privacy sensitive information about users {{and use it to}} build advertising profiles. To target ads at individual users based on their interests, these advertising profiles are typically linked with the users' <b>unique</b> <b>device</b> <b>identifiers,</b> such as the advertising ID used in Android. Advertising profiles may contain a large amount of privacy sensitive information about users, which can attract adversaries to attempt gaining access to this information. Mobile devices are known to leak privacy sensitive information such as <b>device</b> <b>identifiers</b> in clear text. This poses a potential privacy risk, since an adversary might exploit the leaked identifiers to learn privacy sensitive details about a victim by sampling personalized ads targeted at the victim. This thesis explores the behavior of mobile ad networks regarding data collection and ad targeting, as well as the possibility of an attack where leaked <b>device</b> <b>identifiers</b> are exploited to request ads targeted at a victim. We investigated these problems in the context of four popular Android ad libraries that support ad targeting, using a custom app and simulated user profiles designed for this purpose. Our findings indicate {{that it is possible to}} use sniffed identifiers to impersonate another user for requesting ads, and to some degree, this can result in receiving ads specific to the victim's profile. In the case of some ad networks, the lack of ad targeting causes it to be infeasible to conduct an attack to request ads targeted at the victim...|$|R

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{nature of}} Bluetooth technology presents opportunities for intelligence gathering based on historical and real-time device presence data. This {{information can be}} of value to law enforcement agencies, intelligence organizations, and industry. Despite {{the introduction of the}} Bluetooth Low Energy standard that incorporates anonymity preservation mechanisms, the presence of devices that support Classic Bluetooth that uses <b>unique</b> and persistent <b>device</b> <b>identifiers</b> is expected to remain significant for a number of years. The common approach to finding discoverable Classic Bluetooth devices relies on a standard inquiry process that is not truly passive. Furthermore, this approach fails to detect devices that remain undiscoverable. Ubertooth One, a low-cost open source Bluetooth development platform, can assist with overcoming this limitation in a truly passive manner, making it an attractive digital forensic instrument. Using vehicle-based sensors and parallel multi-method device discovery, we conduct a practical evaluation of Ubertooth One for passive discovery and contrast its discovery rate to the standard method. Based on 83 comparative field experiments, we show that Ubertooth One can produce forensically sound observations while able to discover up to ten times as many devices. We also show that this method can identify repeat device presence, as we observe 2370 instances of repeat observations on different days in single and multiple location scenarios. We conclude that this passive technique can complement the standard method and has the potential be used as a viable alternative...|$|R

40|$|Hash {{tables are}} fast {{associative}} array implementations which {{became part of}} modern world of information technology and thanks to its simplicity became very popular among computer programmers. The choice of proper hash function is very important. Improperly selected hash function can result in poor hash table performance and its application. Currently there are many exceptional implementations of general hash functions. Such functions are not constrained to a concrete set of inputs, they perform on any input. On the other hand if we know the input domain we can design a specific hash function for desired application thus reaching better levels of performance compare to a general hash function. However hash function design is not trivial. There are no rules, standards, guides nor automated tools that would help us with such a task. In case of manual design the hash function author has to rely on his/her knowledge, experience, inventiveness and intuition. In case of such complicated tasks there is sometimes advantageous to choose a different path and use techniques such as evolution algorithms. Natural computing is an approach of certain problem solutions that are inspired {{by the process of}} species reproduction as defined by Charles Darwin.
