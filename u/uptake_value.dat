40|$|ObjectiveThe best current noninvasive {{surrogate}} for tumor biology is fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron emission tomography}} (FDG–PET). Both FDG–PET maximal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> and selected tumor markers {{have been shown to}} correlate with stage, nodal disease, and survival in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there are limited data correlating FDG–PET with tumor markers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the correlation of tumor marker expression with FDG–PET maximal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> in NSCLC. MethodsFDG–PET maximal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> were calculated in patients with NSCLC (n = 149). No patient had induction chemoradiotherapy. Intraoperative NSCLC tissue was obtained and tissue microarrays were created. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for 5 known NSCLC tumor markers (glucose transporter 1, p 53, cyclin D 1, epidermal growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor). Each tumor marker was assessed independently by two pathologists using common grading criteria. Subgroup analysis based on histologic characteristics and regional nodal status was performed. ResultsFDG–PET correlated with T classification (P <. 0001), N stage (P =. 002), and greatest tumor dimension (P <. 0001). In addition, increasing maximal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> correlated with increased expression of glucose transporter 1 (P <. 0001) and p 53 (P =. 04) in adenocarcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression correlated with maximal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> without predilection for histologic subtype (P =. 004). ConclusionFDG–PET maximal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> correlate with an increased expression of glucose transporter 1 and p 53 in lung adenocarcinoma, but not squamous cell cancer.

The relative prognostic benefit of maximal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> with respect to other clinical/pathologic variables has not been defined. MethodsWe reviewed patients who had positron emission tomographic imaging and an R 0 resection for non–small cell lung cancer between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2004, without induction or adjuvant therapy. The associations between overall survival, histology, pathologic TNM stage, pathologic tumor diameter, and standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> were tested. ResultsFour hundred eighty-seven patients met the study criteria. Median follow-up was 25. 8 months. By using the median values for tumor size (2. 5 cm) and standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> (5. 3), standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> was an independent predictor of survival (P =. 03), adjusting for tumor size (P =. 02) and histology (P <. 01). The optimal standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> for stratification was identified as 4. 4, and this value was identified as an independent predictor of survival (P =. 03) after adjusting for clinical TNM stage. Standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> was not an independent predictor of survival (P =. 09), adjusting for pathologic TNM stage (stage IA vs IB vs stage II–IV, P <. 01).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that high uptake of 18 F-fluoro- 2 -deoxy-glucose in head and neck cancer, as {{determined}} by the standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> on positron emission tomography scan, was associated with poor survival. The aim {{of this study was to}} confirm the association and to establish whether a high standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> had prognostic significance. Seventy-three consecutive patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck underwent a positron emission tomography study before treatment. Age, gender, performance status tumour grade, stage, maximal tumour diameter and standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> were analyzed for their possible association with survival. The median standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> for all primary tumours was 7. 16 (90 % range 2. 30 to 18. 60). In univariate survival analysis the cumulative survival was decreased as the stage, tumour diameter and standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> increased. An standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> of 10 was taken as a cut-off for high and low uptake tumours. When these two groups were compared, an standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> > 10 predicted for significantly worse outcome (P= 0. 003). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that an standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> > 10 provided prognostic information independent of the tumour stage and diameter (P= 0. 002). We conclude that high FDG uptake (standardized uptake value> 10) on positron emission tomography is an important marker for poor outcome in primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> may be useful in distinguishing those tumours with a more aggressive biological nature and hence identifying patients that require intensive treatment protocols including hyperfractionated radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{demonstrate}} three important {{findings in the}} comparison of imaging between 11 C- 4 DST and 18 F-FLT for clinical application. Firstly, both tracers had low-background activity in the normal brain {{and were able to}} visualize the tumor well except one non-enhancing primary diffuse astrocytoma in which both tracers failed to visualize the tumor. Both tracers had similar <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> in the tumor, but the 18 F-FLT uptake in the normal brain was relatively lower than that of 11 C- 4 DST, resulting in better tumor visualization with 18 F-FLT. Secondly, a significant correlation was observed between the Ki- 67 labeling index and the <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> of 11 C- 4 DST and 18 F-FLT in the tumor. We hypothesized that 11 C- 4 DST is superior to 18 F-FLT in evaluating cell proliferation as 11 C- 4 DST uptake represents the whole DNA synthesis process. However, the correlation coefficients of 11 C- 4 DST <b>uptake</b> <b>values</b> to the Ki- 67 labeling index were slightly lower than those of 18 F-FLT.

40|$|ObjectivesRecent {{studies suggest}} that {{standard}} <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan can predict mediastinal lymph node status in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Because mediastinal nodal metastasis {{is known to be}} associated with poor prognosis, we hypothesized that standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography might independently predict survival. MethodsPatients with pathologically proven mesothelioma underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning. Patients fasted and received a minimum of 10 mCi of F 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose. Whole-body emission studies were acquired, followed by whole-body transmission scans with iterative reconstruction. On the basis of the maximal chi-square method, a standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> of 10 was chosen to classify patients as low versus high standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value.</b> Survival probabilities for both standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> groups were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model assessed the joint influence of standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value,</b> histology, and stage on survival. ResultsFrom 1998 to 2005, 137 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent positron emission tomography scans. The median follow-up for all surviving patients was 24 months. Median survivals were 9 and 21 months for the high and low standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> groups, respectively (P =. 02). In a multivariable analysis, high standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> tumors were associated with a 1. 9 times greater risk of death than low standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> tumors (P <. 01). Mixed histology carried a 2. 9 times greater risk of death than epithelioid histology (P <. 01), and stages III and IV had a 1. 8 times greater risk of death than stages I and II (P =. 05). ConclusionsStandard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> greater than 10, mixed histology, and stages III and IV are poor risk factors in malignant pleural mesothelioma.

We hypothesized that incorporating automated cerebral-to-whole-cerebellar standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> ratios into [18 F] florbetapir PET brain scan interpre-tation would reduce this interreader variability. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: This randomized, blinded-reader study used previously acquired [18 F] florbetapir scans from 30 anonymized patients whowere enrolled in the Alzheimer’s DiseaseNeuroimaging Initiative 2. In 4 separate, blinded-reading sessions, 5 readers classified 30 cases as positive or negative for significant -amyloid deposition either qualitatively alone or qualitatively with additional adjunct software that determined standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> ratios.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{aggressiveness}} {{of small}} adenocarcinomas {{has not been}} fully evaluated using integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography. We investigated malignant aggressiveness according to positron emission tomography/computed tomography, high-resolution computed tomographic findings, and the proportions of pathologically defined bronchioloalveolar carcinomas in cT 1 N 0 M 0 lung adenocarcinoma. MethodsSixty consecutive patients with cT 1 N 0 M 0 lung adenocarcinomas of 3 cm or less in diameter underwent fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomograph/computed tomography, and high-resolution computed tomography, followed by complete tumor resection. Correlations between the proportion of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and maximum standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> on positron emission tomographic scan/computed tomographic scan, ground-glass opacity, and tumor shadow disappearance rate were investigated and the findings were compared with clinicopathologic features. ResultsLymphatic and vascular invasion occurred in 18 (30 %) and 13 (22 %) patients, respectively, whereas hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes occurred in 8 patients (13 %). Maximum standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> generally seemed the most valuable predictor of lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, and nodal metastasis compared with ground-glass opacity, tumor shadow disappearance rate, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ratios. Although the association was significant between the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ratio versus maximum standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value,</b> ground-glass opacity ratio, and tumor shadow disappearance rate (all P <. 0001), maximum standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> (R 2 = 0. 245) was less correlated with the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ratio than was the ground-glass opacity ratio (R 2 = 0. 554) and tumor shadow disappearance rate (R 2 = 0. 671). ConclusionsThe malignant behavior of small adenocarcinomas with a lower maximum standardized <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> and {{a greater proportion of}} ground-glass opacity, tumor shadow disappearance rate, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma was less aggressive.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} assess whether the {{standard}} <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> of a pulmonary nodule is an independent predictor of biologic aggressiveness. MethodsThis is a retrospective review of a prospective database of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Patients had dedicated positron emission tomography scanning with F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose, with the maximum standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> measured. All suspicious nodal and systemic locations on computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scanning underwent biopsy, and when indicated, resection with complete lymphadenectomy was performed. ResultsThere were 315 patients. Multivariate analysis showed patients with a high maximum standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> (≥ 10) {{were more likely to}} have poorly differentiated tumors (risk ratio, 1. 5; P =. 005) and advanced stage (risk ratio, 1. 9; P =. 010) and were less likely to have their disease completely resected (risk ratio, 3. 7; P =. 004). Maximum standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> was the best predictor of disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 2. 5; P =. 039) and survival (hazard ratio, 2. 8; P =. 001). Stage-specific analysis showed that patients with stage IB and stage II disease with a maximum standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> of greater than the median for their respective stages had a lower disease-free survival at 4 years (P =. 005 and. 044). The actual 4 -year survival for patients with stage Ib non–small cell lung cancer was 80 % versus 66 % (P =. 048), for stage II disease it was 64 % versus 32 % (P =. 028), and for stage IIIa disease it was 64 % versus 16 % (P =. 012) for the low and high maximum standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> groups, respectively. ConclusionsThe maximum standard <b>uptake</b> <b>value</b> of a non-small cell lung cancer nodule on dedicated positron emission tomography is an independent predictor of stage and tumor characteristics.
