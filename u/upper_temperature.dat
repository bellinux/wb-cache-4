25|$|Many {{underlying}} {{proposals are}} designed to limit global temperature changes {{to no more than}} 2°C above pre-industrial levels, of which 0.8°C has already taken place and another 0.5–0.7°C is already committed. 2°C is usually seen as the <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> limit to avoid 'dangerous global warming'. Due to only minor efforts in global Climate change mitigation it is highly likely that the world {{will not be able to}} reach this particular target. The EU might then not only be forced to accept a less ambitious global target. Because the planned emissions reductions in the European energy sector (95% by 2050) are derived directly from the 2°C target since 2007, the EU will have to revise its energy policy paradigm.|$|E

When the barrier field F is high enough for the CFE regime to be operating for metal emission at 0 K, then the condition kBT<dF provides a formal upper bound (in temperature) to the CFE emission regime. However, {{it has been argued}} that (due to approximations made elsewhere in the derivation) the condition kBT<0.7dF is a better working limit: this corresponds to a λ'T-value of around 1.09, and (for the example case) an <b>upper</b> <b>temperature</b> limit on the CFE regime of around 1770 K.

40|$|Four fire growth models used {{to model}} the effects of room-corner fires are {{appraised}} using data obtained {{from a series of}} experiments involving full scale corner fire testing with four different interior linings. The room-corner models appraised are those of Wade (BRANZFIRE), Janssens, Karlsson and Quintiere. The models are appraised {{on the basis of their}} ability to accurately predict the conditions in the compartment. The models of Quintiere, Janssens and Karlsson are pure flame spread models and as such only provide a prediction of heat release rate, (HRR) and <b>upper</b> layer gas <b>temperature.</b> BRANZFIRE is the only of the three incorporating a zone model so comparison can be made to interface height <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperature</b> and lower layer temperature in the experimental compartment. The models provided by Karlsson and Janssens could not be run in an accurate manner so comparison had to be made on the basis of previously published data. BRANZFIRE was shown to predict the compartment conditions to a good degree of accuracy although the overall trend was to over predict the <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperature</b> and under predict accordingly the lower layer temperature and interface height. Both Karlsson and Quintiere's models are shown to grossly over predict the <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperature.</b> No temperature data was available for Janssens' model, but heat release rate comparisons to Quintiere and Karlsson indicate that this would also significantly over predict the <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperatures.</b> It is concluded that BRANZFIRE provided the best fit to the experimental data and with its adaptability to a multitude of fire situations is the closest to becoming a useable fire engineering design tool.

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are heat engines, {{and as such}} their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized thermodynamic cycles. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the Carnot cycle, whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} difference between the lower and <b>upper</b> operating <b>temperatures</b> of the engine. The <b>upper</b> operating <b>temperature</b> of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the auto-ignition resistance of the fuel. All metals and alloys have a thermal operating limit, and there is significant research into ceramic materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and <b>upper</b> operating <b>temperatures,</b> hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the cylinder temperature rises, the engine becomes more prone to auto-ignition. This is caused when the cylinder temperature nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the spark plug fires, causing excessive cylinder pressures. Auto-ignition can be mitigated by using fuels with high auto-ignition resistance (octane rating), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak cylinder temperature.|$|R

40|$|Comparisons {{between the}} results of zone and {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) fire model simulations have been made; the zone model used was FAST (Peacock et al., 1997) and the CFD model used was SOFIE (Welch and Rubini, 1996). The underlying goal {{of this research is}} to investigate the limitations of zone models for the fire safety design of large enclosures. Three different sized fires have been simulated m two different sized enclosures: 1. A domestic-sized enclosure measuring 3. 7 m long x 2. 5 m wide x 2. 5 m high. 2. An industrial-sized enclosure measuring 41 m long x 11 m wide x 11 m high. The fire sizes simulated were 330, 430, and 500 kW for the domestic-sized enclosure and 300, and 600 kW for the industrial-sized enclosure. The results of these simulations have been compared based on interface height and average <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperature.</b> Two definitions of interface height have been used- the N-percent method by Cooper et al. (1982) and a height derivative of temperature approach, which defines an interface at the point of maximum change in temperature with height. The comparisons between the two fire simulation techniques show that the comparisons are dependant on which definition of interface height is used; the N-percent method was not preferred {{because of the lack of}} any theoretical basis for its use, and its inability to define an interface in locations where the temperature gradient from the floor to the ceiling was small. The comparisons between the zone and CFD simulations show that for the domestic-sized enclosure, the CFD results derived average <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperatures</b> between 30 and 40 % of the average <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperature</b> derived by the zone model. The CFD results indicated that the interface height was between 50 and 80 % of the interface height derived by the zone model. For the industrial-sized enclosure, the CFD results derived average <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperatures</b> between 56 and 96 % of the average <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperature</b> derived by the zone model. The CFD results indicated that the interface height was between 0 and 183 % of the interface height derived by the zone model. Generally, the interface height predicted by the CFD model was higher than the interface height predicted by the zone model. When the enclosure boundaries are assumed to be adiabatic, zone models over-predict (compared to the CFD simulations) the average <b>upper</b> layer <b>temperature</b> for cases where the volumetric heat release rate is large...|$|R
