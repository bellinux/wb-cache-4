5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often <b>under</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September11 {{and almost immediately}} {{led to the formation}} of a tropical depression by 06:00UTC the next day. Steered in a traditional west-northwest fashion, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Julia twelve hours later and continued steady strengthening to become a hurricane by 12:00UTC September14. As a reminder of limited hurricane intensity forecasting skill, the system began a period of rapid intensification thereafter, attaining peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) by 12:00UTC on September15. Julia became the easternmost Category4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic as a result. After peak, the system recurved around a ridge while simultaneously weakening <b>under</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Igor's outflow. It fell back to tropical storm intensity by 00:00UTC on September18 and degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC on September20 while located about 1,095mi (1,760km) west of the Azores. The remnant low turned back west, dissipating late on September24.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the film had been growing since Noé's adolescence, when he first became {{interested}} in matters of death and existence. In his early twenties—while <b>under</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> psilocybin mushrooms—he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then decided that, if he ever made a film about the afterlife, {{that was the way}} in which it would be filmed. Noé had been working on different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. The story had initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the Andes, France, and New York City. Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.|$|E

Thus, the mala-free states begin only from Sakthi. Tirumūlar describes the ānava, kanmam and maya as the inner covering, husk and awn that encase a paddy grain. Thus, the mala do not change the soul but cover it like a shell (v 2192). Paul Murphy (1986 : 27) quotes verse 57 from Abhnivagupta’s Paramartasara which uses an identical imagery of a husk, awn and chaff and says that without these coating the seed will be “freed” from growth.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we deal with}} the problem <b>of</b> driving <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol; which {{is due to the fact}} that alcohol is present in every third traffic accident. We studied the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol on a person and his or her driving capabilities, how often people drive <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, and how often it comes up as a {{secondary}} reason for traffic accidents. We also investigated how drivers <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol are treated, and how occurrences of such driving could be prevented. At the end, we described some projects and organizations that deal with the prevention of this problem. In the empiric part, we used a quantitative approach to check the most common reasons for driving <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. We were also interested in the differences between men and women, and younger and older drivers regarding their opinions on driving <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. We were also looking for a connection between experiences <b>of</b> driving <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and opinions regarding rising or lowering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. The results show that women rarely drive <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, and are more strongly against driving <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> than men. We managed to prove a connection between experiences <b>of</b> driving <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and opinions regarding the altering of allowed concentration of alcohol in the blood. There were no significant differences in our sample between younger and older drivers regarding opinions on driving <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To examine {{correlates}} of perpetration and victimization of intimate partner violence (IPV) under and not <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance, {{we conducted a}} study among women in Russia. Methods: In 2011, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients receiving services at a clinic for sexually transmitted infections in St. Petersburg, Russia. Multinomial logistic regression was used for analysis. Results: Of 299 women, 104 (34. 8 %) and 113 (37. 8 %) reported a history of IPV perpetration and victimization, respectively. Nearly half (47. 1 %) of perpetrators and 61. 1 % of victims reported that the latest IPV event (perpetration and victimization, respectively) was experienced <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance. Factors independently associated with IPV victimization <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance were alcohol misuse and a higher number of lifetime sex partners, whereas only experience of childhood abuse (emotional and physical abuse) was independently associated with IPV victimization that did not occur <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance. Childhood physical abuse, lower age of first sex, sensation seeking, and alcohol misuse were independently associated with IPV perpetration <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance, while only childhood abuse (emotional and physical abuse) was independently associated with IPV perpetration that did not occur <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance.

25|$|With the {{philosophy}} of the Temple Society, to reconstruct the Holy Land in order to gather the people of God, fading in view of the resurrection of the Holy Land by Jewish settlement, the Templers' faith lost binding power for many of its members and especially many younger discovered Nazism as a non-denominational replacement of the vacuum. Thus most Nazis in the Holy Land were from Templer background. This led to a complete turnaround in the Evangelical-Templers' relationship, because before 1933 the Evangelical Protestants had strong mental and financial support by German Protestant church bodies, while Templers were somewhat orphaned. After 1933 Templers increasingly usurped positions with influential connections to Nazi party and Nazi government bodies in Germany, while the German Protestant church bodies as partners of the Evangelical congregations in the Holy Land lost government support by the struggle of the churches and by Hitler's and Alfred Rosenberg's general abandonment of Christianity, considered indissolubly Judaised with the Ten Commandments and the Old Testament. Cornelius Schwarz, a Templer from Jaffa, led the Palestinian faction (Landesgruppe) of the Nazi party, with him many young men gained influence over long established institutions as the Evangelical provostry and its congregations as well as the Temple Society itself. The German Foreign Office imposed on Gentile Germans of different denominational affiliations a stronger co-operation <b>under</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian Nazi officials of Temple background.|$|E
25|$|Importing and {{exporting}} of any classified drug is {{a serious}} offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is hard drug trade, maximum 4 years for import or export of large quantities of cannabis. It is prohibited to operate a motor vehicle while {{under the influence of}} any drug that affects driving ability {{to such an extent that}} you are unable to drive properly. (Section 8 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act section 1). The Dutch police have the right to do a drug test if they suspect influenced driving. For example, anybody involved in a traffic accident may be tested. Causing an accident that inflicts bodily harm, while <b>under</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> any drug, is seen as a crime that may be punished by up to 3 years in prison (9 years in case of a fatal accident).

40|$|Being <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol at work {{or during}} working hours is dealt with as misconduct. On the other hand, in a case where an {{employee}} suffers from alcoholism, such a case is treated as incapacity due to ill health. The possibility of overlap between the two has contributed to a misconception. Alcoholism cases, are at times, incorrectly treated as misconduct. The same applies to cases <b>of</b> being <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol where such cases would be treated as incapacity instead of being treated as misconduct. The distinction between alcoholism and being <b>under</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> alcohol was made clear in Transnet Freight Rail v Transnet Bargaining Council C 644 / 2009 [2011] ZALCJHB (4 March 2011) where the Labour Court held that employers have an obligation of assisting employees who suffer from alcoholism with counselling and rehabilitation.
