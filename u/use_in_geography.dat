In an urban context, models based on cellular automata can provide valuable tools for planning and exploring urban scenarios issued from land use policies.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Suburbanization is {{a process}} that is {{connected}} with political, economic and social changes in our republic after the Velvet Revolution in 1989. New conditions were created for suburban development in the 1990 s. At present a lot of geographers pay attention to suburbanization. I have decided to deal with this process because I am a geography teacher and I live in Prague's hinterland, where suburbanization develops most of all. This work deals with the influence of suburbanization on population development in four case localities and in the district of Prague-East. It is focused on problems and consequences connected with suburbanization. The aim is to find out whether new suburbanites are satisfied with the life in suburbium.

40|$|International audienceThe {{emergence}} of big data, {{as well as}} open data, has led the scientific community to question data collection in different ways: construction, acquisition and ownership. Traditionally, social sciences have been concerned by the opportunities given by data collection or access to existing datasets. The recent changes related to automatic data collection and sharing makes attitudes and expectations of researchers evolve. Social sciences are thus expected to change their current approaches and methodologies regarding data. Geography is a discipline largely concerned with {{data collection and analysis}} and is then at the core of this dramatic change. The wide and fast spread of numerous geolocation tools (based on GPS, GSM, WiFi or IP address) leads to the surge of georeferenced data (Audard, Carpentier, Oliveau, 2014). If an enthusiastic posture currently dominate the appreciation of open/big data in terms of scientific perspectives (Marx, 2013), some cautions emerges regarding their use. These data are generally not built for the purpose of social sciences (Pumain, 2014) and are thus to be used with care for scientific work (Terrier, 2011). Beyond those general considerations, one major fact related to their <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> is the question of the spatial, social, demographic and economic representativeness of such « second hand » datasets built for their own purpose and objectives. In the case of big data, the illusion of completeness tends to obscure the question of representativeness. The huge number of observations does not mean that there is no selection bias; even if a big sample size produce good confidence intervals. That's the main question of this paper: how to reshape the socio-spatial representativeness from data that are not built with regard to the question of spatial representativeness...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{theory of}} small world network as {{initiated}} by Watts and Strogatz 1998 has drawn new insights on spatial analysis {{as well as}} to systems theory. Its concepts and methods are particularly relevant to geography where spatial interaction is mainstream, and where interactions can be described and studied using large volume of exchanges or similarity matrices. Networks indeed organize through direct links or by indirect paths, inducing topological proximities simultaneously involving spatial, social, cultural or organizational dimensions. Network synergies build over similarities and are fed by complementarities between or inside cities, the two effects potentially amplifying each other according to the "preferential attachment" hypothesis that has been explored {{in a number of different}} scientific fields (Barabàsi & Albert, 1999; Barabàsi, 2002; Newmann et al., 2006). In fact, according to Barabási & Albert (1999), the high level of hierarchy observed in "scale-free networks" results from "preferential attachment" which characterizes the development of networks: new connections appear preferentially close nodes already having the largest number of connections. In this way, the improvement in the network accessibility of the new connection will probably be greater. But at the same time, network regions gathering dense and numerous weak links (Granovetter, 1973, 1985) or network entities acting as bridges between several components (Burt, 2004) offer a higher capacity for urban communities to benefit from opportunities and create future synergies. Several methodologies have been suggested on how such denser and more coherent regions (also called communities or clusters) in term of links can be identified (Watts & Strogatz, 1998; Watts, 1999; Barabasi & Albert, 2000; Barabasi, 2003; Auber et al. 2003, Newmann et al., 2006). These communities not only possess a high level of dependency between their member entities, but also show a low level of "vulnerability" allowing for numerous redundancies (Burt, 2000, 2005). The SPANGEO project 2005 - 2008 (SPAtial Networks in GEOgraphy), gathering a team of geographers and computer scientists, has conducted empirical studies to survey concepts and measures developed in other related fields such as physics, sociology or communication science. The relevancy and potential interpretation of weighted or non weighted measures on edges and nodes were examined and analyzed at different scales (intra-urban, inter-urban or both). New classification and clustering schemes based on the relative local density of subgraphs were developed. The article describes how these notions and methods bring a contribution on a conceptual level, in terms of measures, delineations, explanatory analysis and visualization of geographical phenomena. It is shown that, in order to deal in a rigorous way with qualitative information, we can try many tricks. In some cases, the large memories and the power of computation of the machine are enough for facing problems with qualitative data, otherwise non treatable; in other cases, this goal is reached by the possibility of "visualization" of information or "cooperative solution" (through communication) allowed by the computer. Moreover, in some cases the qualitative is managed by means of algorithms (carrying out a sequence of "logical" statements); in other cases the problem is "hardened" (made quantitative), then the output is "relaxed" (reduced to a probabilistic result). Even if the set of methods is rapidly increasing, we look for a taxonomy of the bulk of tools, according to potential <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> and planning. Considering, for instance, characterization of geographical objects, spatial statistical analysis, territorial modeling and simulation, etc., every qualitative method (e. g. conceptual maps, ontologies, folksonomies, cladistics, qualitative regression, cross impact analysis, expert systems, etc.) is classified, with a short description of its main features. For a better understanding of meaning, procedures and potentialities of qualitative methods, a brief account of four case-studies is given. A software for building "ontology" is used to map a system of interacting agents; "textual statistics" are applied for analyzing the perception of landscape on the basis of an "open answer" (qualitative) survey; the "cross impact analysis" is the qualitative modeling tool built for the evaluation of the consequences of a land-use project; in a qualitative "multi-criteria evaluation" it is grounded the site selection for location of a big infrastructure. As a conclusion, the perspectives of qualitative methods are discussed, in the light of two emerging phenomena: respectively, the incoming "extreme data" availability age; and the next "highly automatic" computer-based research activity epoch...|$|E
