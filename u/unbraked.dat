5|$|The NSR {{coaching}} stock was, even until grouping, predominantly four and six wheeled vehicles. Four-wheeled carriages were the norm {{from the start}} and the last were constructed in the 1880s, although by then they had progressed from the <b>unbraked</b> coaches of the 1840s {{with the introduction of}} the communication cord in 1869 and the simple vacuum brake in 1883. The first bogie coaches were introduced in 1906 for use on the Derby–Llandudno service and these were followed by further examples until 1923. By 1919 all carriages, except 13 four-wheelers used on miners trains, had been fitted with steam heating and a number of vehicles had been fitted with through pipes to allow use in trains equipped with Westinghouse brakes. Most carriages were constructed at Stoke but some were purchased from companies such as the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company.|$|E

On 10 May 1973 a worker on the new motorway suffered serious injuries in an accident when he stepped in front of a Cable Car at the Clifton stop, prompting a review. The Ministry of Works concluded that aspects of the Cable Car were unsafe, particularly the use of <b>unbraked</b> trailers, and called for the system to be scrapped. The trailers were withdrawn, considerably reducing capacity.|$|E
6000|$|But let us {{return to}} our sheep--which means the sea-lions of the Cliff House. They are the great show of San Francisco. You take a train which pulls up {{the middle of the}} street (it killed two people the day before yesterday, being <b>unbraked</b> and driven {{absolutely}} regardless of consequences), and you pull up somewhere at the back of the city on the Pacific beach. Originally the cliffs and their approaches must have been pretty, but they have been so carefully defiled with advertisements that they are now one big blistered abomination. A hundred yards from the shore stood a big rock covered with the carcasses of the sleek sea-beasts, who roared and rolled and walloped in the spouting surges. No bold man had painted the creatures sky-blue or advertised newspapers on their backs, wherefore they did not match the landscape, which was chiefly hoarding. Some day, perhaps, whatever sort of government may obtain in this country will make a restoration of the place and keep it clean and neat. At present the sovereign people, of whom I have heard so much already, are vending cherries and painting the virtues of [...] "Little Bile Beans" [...] all over it.|$|E
5000|$|The PAZ {{school bus}} met a Scania wood lorry at the 3rd {{kilometre}} of Sõõru - Nõva road, a narrow unpaved road. Having noticed each other, the drivers chose different strategies: {{the school bus}} driver, driving at a low speed, kept {{to the right side}} of the road in order to give the lorry more space to pass; the lorry, driving at about 70 - 80 km/h, began the manœuvre by braking heavily. On the unpaved road, braking led to cross-road oscillation of the lorry, leading the lorry driver to worry about a risk of falling off the road. The lorry driver compensated by temporarily <b>unbraking</b> and turning sharply left—towards the axis of the road—at an unfortunate time, leading the lorry to drive into the school bus at an angle of about 30 degrees. In the collision, the lorry [...] "skinned" [...] off the school bus' left side, killing 8 students born in 1982 - 1986.|$|R
50|$|Towing {{capacity}} {{may either}} refer to braked or <b>unbraked</b> towing capacity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Unbraked</b> towing {{capacity}} is the {{towing capacity}} of a vehicle towing a trailer {{that does not have}} its own braking system.|$|E
50|$|The brake was a Westinghouse {{compressed}} air brake. It acted {{on both sides}} of the coupled wheelsets. The running wheels in the bogie were <b>unbraked.</b>|$|E
50|$|Braked towing {{capacity}} is the {{towing capacity}} of a vehicle if the trailer being towed has its own braking system, typically connected to the vehicle's braking system via the trailer cable. Braked towing capacity is typically significantly greater than <b>unbraked</b> towing capacity.|$|E
50|$|With all {{the seats}} removed the Viano Extra-Long can {{accommodate}} up to 4610 L of cargo with a payload of 930 kg. It can tow a 2500 kg braked trailer and a 750 kg <b>unbraked</b> trailer. An adjustable self-levelling rear suspension is included on higher specification models.|$|E
5000|$|Criticism of the B10's brakes was {{addressed}} with the [...] "Type B12" [...] which incorporated {{a new system}} of drum brakes that now worked on all four wheels. (On the earlier car the front wheels had been <b>unbraked.)</b> There was also a new semi-elliptical leaf spring arrangement at the front.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guard of}} no 62 {{released}} the handbrakes {{on the rear}} portion, leaving it <b>unbraked</b> and the driver went forward to his engine. When he started the train the tailrope broke and the rear portion began to run back down the grade towards Blandford, coming into collision with the approaching mail train just beyond the Up Distant signal. The collision resulted {{in the death of}} 26 persons. (Gunn has 27 fatalities.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first eight}} wagons were {{equipped}} with the vacuum brake but the pipes had not been connected. The train had run from Ellesmere Port as an <b>unbraked</b> freight train and stopped at Helsby, where it needed to reverse. The guard had forgotten to connect the vacuum pipes when the locomotive coupled up to {{the opposite end of}} the train, so that extra brake power was not available on the falling gradient into Chester. The driver had also omitted to carry out a brake test before departure.|$|E

5000|$|Here is a {{description}} of the narrow gauge ride: [...] "Both the station electric bell and the platform three handbell were rung in our honour. The tiny engine gave a peanut whistle - for once whistle and engine were well matched - and then surreptitiously changed from blowing off to blowing steam through its cylinders. The loose couplings of the <b>unbraked</b> coaches took up their slack and the engine’s hissings turned to the puffing of a small locomotive with small wheels accelerating a light train to cruise at 15 mph.|$|E
50|$|A {{turntable}} at {{the rear}} of the chassis frame supported a bogey, mounted on bearings so it could swivel and pivot. The bogey was fitted with two axles, a fixed middle axle and a steerable rear axle, both of the swinging wishbone type with transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring suspension. The middle axle was fitted with pneumatic brakes, while the rear axle was <b>unbraked.</b> A feedback steering system was included in the design, so that any change in direction by the rear bogey (and fixed middle axle) was duplicated by the steerable rear axle, but to twice the extent. The linkage for the feedback system was for used front towing, and was disengaged during rear towing.|$|E
50|$|The loaded slate trains {{continued}} to operate by gravity {{until the end}} of passenger services in 1939. Slate trains eventually became very long - trains of less than eighty slate wagons carried two brakesmen but over eighty wagons (and this became common) required three brakesmen. About one wagon in every six was equipped with a brake, the others being <b>unbraked.</b> Trains {{continued to}} pass at Tan-y-Bwlch and, to a lesser extent, at Minffordd. The Summer timetable for 1900 had nine trains daily in each direction and trains had been accelerated to one hour from Porthmadog to Duffws including stops at Minffordd, Penrhyn, Tan-y-Bwlch, Dduallt (request), Tanygrisiau, Blaenau (LNWR) and Blaenau (GWR). Speeds in excess of 40 mph were then normal.|$|E
50|$|Catch points {{originate}} {{from the days}} of the 'unfitted' goods train. As these trains tended to consist of either completely <b>unbraked</b> wagons (relying entirely on the locomotive's own brakes), or ones with unlinked, manually applied brakes (necessitating a stop at the top of steep downgrades for the guard to walk along the train and set the brakes on each wagon in turn), they also lacked any mechanism to automatically brake runaway cars. Catch points were therefore required to stop the rear portion of a poorly coupled train that might break away whilst climbing a steep grade - although they would also stop vehicles that ran away for any other reason. Now that trains are all 'fitted' (and broken couplings are far less common), catch points are mostly obsolete.|$|E
50|$|The design {{consisted}} of a fairly conventional autogyro layout, but the wing was disk-like instead of the more traditional helicopter-like bladed assembly. The disk had airfoils formed out of fabric {{on the inside of}} the rim, and four small solid surfaces on the outside. In forward motion the airstream blowing across the four small surfaces would spin the disk, which would provide lift from the fabric airfoils inside. On reaching cruising altitude, the disk would be braked to stop it spinning, and <b>unbraked</b> again for a near-vertical landing. The advantage to this arrangement was that there was no theoretical limit on forward speed, whereas a conventional autogyro cannot be stopped in flight, and has a limit when the speed of the rearward moving blade approaches the stall speed.|$|E

50|$|The Adler {{was built}} on a wooden {{framework}} which was covered with sheet metal. Both wet steam driven cylinders were placed horizontally inside the frame and drove the driving wheelset which {{was placed in the}} middle of the three axles. The driving wheels had no wheel flange, so the locomotive could be operated on small radius curves. The forged spokes were rivetted to the rim. The original wheels were made of cast iron and were encircled with a forged tyre made of wrought iron. The original wheels made of brittle cast iron were replaced later through wheels made of wrought iron. The hollow spokes had a core made of wood to make them more flexible to cushion unevenness of the track. All wheels of the locomotive were <b>unbraked.</b> A mechanical railway brake braked both wheels of the tender on the right side where the fireman was located. There was a fixed connection between the locomotive and the tender. The buffers were made of wood. The horseshoe-shaped water box surrounded the coal stored in the tender. At first coke was burned in the firebox, later bituminous coal was used.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of January 15, 1953, at Washington's Union Station, the Federal overran {{the end of the}} track and into the concourse. According to {{official}} ICC reports, a design flaw on New Haven coach #8665 allowed the handle of an angle cock valve in the air brake system to come into contact with the car frame, causing the valve to close. This disabled the brakes on all of the following cars, rendering them inoperable by the locomotive operator. Approaching automatic block signal #1339, the engineer attempted to apply the brakes to slow the train, with no effect. The <b>unbraked</b> cars pushed the GG1 locomotive and two passenger cars off the end of Track 16 at the station. They crashed through the Stationmaster's office and fell through the floor of Union Station into the baggage room below. The operator at control Tower [...] "K" [...] had contacted station personnel by phone to warn them of the runaway train and the station was evacuated before the crash. In a remarkable demonstration of the durability of the GG1 engine, engine #4876 was later cut into three pieces, hoisted from the baggage room, and reassembled at the Altoona shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It then re-entered commercial service and went on {{to be one of the}} last-serving GG1 engines. It is, as of 2011, being held for restoration at the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore. This crash also inspired the finale for the 1976 film, Silver Streak.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the ES-49 {{is a deep}} sided hexagon {{apart from}} the nose ahead of the cockpit, where an extra singly curved, horizontal panel is inserted for greater visibility. The aft seat is under {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Initially the ES-49 had separate, open cockpits but the first prototype later had a multi-panelled canopy enclosing the forward seat but not that of the instructor. The second prototype had a canopy which enclosed both occupants, an arrangement adopted by production aircraft which have tubular steel framed glazing, with a short, upward hinged section for the instructor who also has under wing side windows and an overhead transparency in the leading edge. The fuselage tapers to the rear, where the straight tapered, blunt tipped tailplane and elevators, covered with a mixture of ply and fabric, are mounted on top. A long trim tab fills the trailing edge of the starboard elevator. Since the elevator hinge is ahead of the fin, only a small cut-out for rudder movement is required. The fin is narrow and short, mounting a balanced rudder with a straight tapered trailing edge and rounded tip which reaches down to the keel. The second prototype had a shorter fuselage and so had a larger area, almost finless, double straight tapered rudder but the production ES-49s reverted to the first prototype's longer fuselage and smaller rudder. The ES-49 lands on a single semi-recessed, <b>unbraked</b> monowheel, assisted under the nose and cockpit by a sprung skid and by a smaller skid under the tail.|$|E
5000|$|After the war the {{destroyed}} {{sections of}} line were rapidly reconstructed, so that trams were again operating on all lines by August 1945. Restoring a complete tram fleet took longer however. In 1947, Winterthur donated a powered tramcar to Solbad Hall, which was its Swiss [...] "partner city"; this started a necessary {{increase in the}} stock of usable powered tramcars. There were plans to buy new tramcars in 1949, but these had to be deferred {{due to lack of}} money. In 1950, however, seven powered tramcars were purchased from Basel, which eased the pressure. For the next two years the green ex-Basel trams stood out from the rest because there were no funds available for paint to paint them in the livery of the Innsbruck tram fleet. Two more trams came from Basel in 1952, and in 1953 several more secondhand Swiss tramcars were purchased, this time from Thun. However, these were found unsuitable for the longer Line 4 (the Hall line), so the unpowered trailer-trams were used on the local Stubai Valley Railway, and the powered tramcars were used chiefly for shunting work. In 1955, it was possible to get hold of another four powered tramcars: these came from Zürich. Little by little during the 1950s the newer tramcars from Switzerland were used to replace Innsbruck's original tram fleet, much of which still dated back to {{the early decades of the}} 20th century. As they were acquired the newer trams were themselves modernised, being fitted with up-to-date compact coupling mechanisms. Brakes were fitted to any <b>unbraked</b> axles. Less- antiquated tramcars in the Innsbruck fleet that were not scheduled to be pensioned-off received similar upgrades to their coupling mechanisms and brakes.|$|E
50|$|Deep mining was (and still is), a {{dangerous}} undertaking, {{and although it}} was never {{the scene of a}} major disaster like that at the nearby Burns Pit, Marley Hill Colliery was no stranger to the accidents which plagued the industry. In total, around thirty-nine miners lost their lives at the colliery during its one hundred and forty-two years of operation. Some of those killed are buried in St. Cuthbert's churchyard. In addition to the various fatalities which occurred underground, one man was killed when a boiler exploded, and the proximity of the various railway lines and sidings to the houses (with the shunting of wagons taking place day and night) yielded tragic results on at least two occasions: firstly in 1888, when a four-year-old girl called Elizabeth Langdon was knocked down and killed by a locomotive while walking on the branch that served the original beehive coke ovens which gave Coke Row its name, and again fifty-four years later, when a Mr. John Mitchell was struck by a locomotive while walking home from the colliery {{at the end of a}} shift. The date of this particular incident (7 Dec 1942) suggests that he may have been walking in the dark under wartime blackout conditions. A possible explanation as to how the collision was not avoided is that Mr. Mitchell and the driver of the locomotive simply did not see each other in the dark. Steam locomotives would have presented a unique threat under such conditions because, unlike diesels, when not working particularly hard they can move remarkably quietly. The noisy environment of a colliery yard, with the constant rattle of <b>unbraked</b> wagons being shunted could no doubt quite easily mask the sound of a locomotive approaching in the dark. Even if Mr. Mitchell had heard the locomotive, (and assuming it was in fact dark at the time) it is quite possible that it would have been difficult to pinpoint its exact location on the maze of points and sidings by sound alone.|$|E
40|$|AC servo drive- 2 Important {{information}} The {{drive systems}} described here are products for general use that con-form {{to the state}} of the art in technology and are designed to prevent any dangers. However, drives and drive controllers that are not specifically designed for safety functions are not approved for applications where the functioning of the drive could endanger persons. The possibility of unexpected or <b>unbraked</b> movements can never be totally excluded wit-hout additional safety equipment. For this reason personnel must never be in the danger zone of the drives unless additional suitable safety equipment prevents any personal danger. This applies to operation of the machine during production and also to all service and maintenance work on drives and the machine. The machine design must ensure per-sonal safety. Suitable measures for prevention of property damage are also required...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>unbraked</b> (freely rolling) taxi tests were {{conducted}} at the Langley landing-loads track with a 32 x 8. 8, type 7, 22 -ply-rating ribbed-tread aircraft tire to obtain data on tire retardation forces developed during rolling in both slush and water. The forward speeds of the tests ranged from 59 to 104 knots. Tire inflation pressures of 350 and 115 {{pounds per square inch}} were used. Results indicated a parabolic increase of retardation force with increasing forward velocity for both slush- and water-covered runway surfaces. The retardation force was found to increase approximately linearly with increasing water depth. Drag coefficients appropriate to the equations used are presented. Calculations made to determine the effect of slush on the take-off distance of a jet transport are in agreement with data obtained from an actual take-off in slush for this airplane. This is an interim report which deals with the effect of slush on the acceleration and the ground-run distance of airplanes during take-off...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility to study the braking and cornering response of a slip ratio controlled aircraft antiskid braking system with ground speed reference derived from an <b>unbraked</b> nose wheel. The investigation, conducted on dry and wet runway surfaces, utilized one main gear wheel, brake, and tire assembly of a DC- 9 series 10 airplane. During maximum braking, the average ratio of the drag force friction coefficient developed by the antiskid system to the maximum drag force friction coefficient available was higher on the dry surface than on damp and flooded surfaces, and was reduced with lighter vertical loads, higher yaw angles, and when new tire treads were replaced by worn treads. Similarly, the average ratio of side force friction coefficient developed by the tire under antiskid control to the maximum side force friction coefficient available to a freely rolling yawed tire decreased with increasing yaw angle, generally increased with ground speed, and decreased when tires with new treads were replaced by those with worn treads...|$|E

Introduction The study of F main-sequence coronae {{is important in}} the context of stellar evolution since this spectral class comprises the transitions from deep to shallow convective zones and from magnetically braked to <b>unbraked</b> rotation.

40|$|When an AC motor is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} main supply, the motor will accelerate quickly and then rotate at a fixed speed which is dependent upon the electrical supply frequency and the motor design. For some applications fixed speed is acceptable and, by carefully selecting gearbox ratios, a desired final output speed can be achieved. However, for most applications, hard acceleration, <b>unbraked</b> deceleration and the inability to vary the speed and torque represent a serious problem. AC drives provide a solution by modifying the voltage and frequency of the AC supply to the motor. Control is achieved by either estimating the motor speed, known as open loop control, or by measuring the speed, known as closed loop control. Therefore this thesis is proposing to design a closed loop PI hysteresis (PIH) current controller for a three phase induction motor fed from an inverter. The objective by developing this control {{is to improve the}} performance of an AC induction motor output by comparing the actual measured currents of the motor with respect to their reference current. The difference is then corrected thus minimizing the current error. The controller is developed in Matlab / Simulink and interfaces with Arduino Uno controller where the controllers generates the PWM signal and send the signal to the gate driver of a three phase inverter to give a stable performance to the induction motor. A simple hardware implementation of the PIH current controller is designed and some simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of this approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} and compare interactions between the abdominal musculature and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during controlled dynamic and static trunk muscle loading. Myoelectric activity was recorded in six subjects from the rectus abdominis, obliquus externus, obliquus internus, transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles using surface and intra-muscular fine-wire electrodes. The IAP was recorded intra-gastrically. Trunk flexions and extensions were performed lying on one side on a swivel table. An adjustable brake provided different friction loading conditions, while adding weights to an <b>unbraked</b> swivel table afforded various levels of inertial loading. During trunk extensions at all friction loads, IAP was elevated (1. 8 - 7. 2 kPa) with concomitant activity in transversus abdominis and obliquus internus muscles-little or no activity was seen from rectus abdominis and obliquus externus muscles. For inertia loading during trunk extension, IAP levels were somewhat lower (1. 8 - 5. 6 kPa) and displayed a second peak when abdominal muscle activity occurred in the course of decelerating the movement. For single trunk flexions with friction loading, IAP was higher than that seen in extension conditions and increased with added resistance. For inertial loading during trunk flexion, IAP showed two peaks, the larger first peak matched peak forward acceleration and general abdominal muscle activation, while the second corresponded to peak deceleration and was accompanied by activity in transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles. It was apparent that different loading strategies produced markedly different patterns of response in both trunk musculature and intra-abdominal pressure...|$|E
