Satyam also held a three-day rehearsals for Sobhan Babu with Vijayalakshmi to help him overcome his nervousness.

To build the rope bridge the filmmakers found a group of British engineers from Balfour Beatty working on the nearby Victoria Dam. Harrison Ford suffered a severe spinal disc herniation by performing a somersault while filming the scene with the assassin in Jones' bedroom. A hospital bed was brought on set for Ford to rest between takes. Lucas stated, [...] "He could barely stand <b>up,</b> <b>yet</b> he was there every day so shooting would not stop.

Wendy Leech, Armstrong's wife, served as Capshaw's stunt double.|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} {{to the character}} of Dexter. Entertainment Weeklys Josh Wolk called him [...] "the hippest-looking killer since American Psychos Patrick Bateman".

But instead of being pent <b>up</b> <b>yet</b> emotionally explosive, like his David Fisher on [...] "Six Feet Under," [...] he's cool and calculated and entirely without compassion as Dexter. That makes him alluring, in a strange way. while Ryan found him to be [...] "among the more compelling characters on the small screen". Gilbert described Dexter as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, calling him a vigilante obsessive murderer with a slippery personality, but [...] "also a hero of sorts". InsidePulse.com reviewer Mathan Erhardt said that the episode did not quite meet his expectations and that [...] "to me the major flaw in the show is Dexter’s noir-esque narration", although he finished the review by saying [...] "Dexter, despite [...] flaws is yet another reason why Sunday night {{is one of my favorite}} nights to watch TV." ...|$|E

In Game 1, West only hit seven of 24 shots, and the Lakers lost 107–101, but L.A. evened out the series at two games each. But West, who had scored 38points in a Game 4 win, had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength {{the rest of the}} series. In Game 5, an injured West scored 35points, but Boston won by threepoints.

500|$|The Haymarket statue was vandalized {{with black}} paint on May 4, 1968, the 82nd {{anniversary of the}} Haymarket affair, {{following}} a confrontation between police and demonstrators at a protest against the Vietnam War. On October 6, 1969, shortly before the [...] "Days of Rage" [...] protests, the statue was destroyed when a bomb was placed between its legs. Weatherman took credit for the blast, which broke nearly 100 windows {{in the neighborhood and}} scattered pieces of the statue onto the Kennedy Expressway below. The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4, 1970, to be blown <b>up</b> <b>yet</b> again by Weatherman on October 6, 1970. The statue was rebuilt, again, and Mayor Richard J. Daley posted a 24‑hour police guard at the statue. This guard cost $67,440 per year. In 1972, it was moved to the lobby of the Central Police Headquarters, and in 1976 to the enclosed courtyard of the Chicago police academy. For another three decades the statue's empty, graffiti-marked pedestal stood on its platform in the run-down remains of Haymarket Square where it was known as an anarchist landmark. On June 1, 2007, the statue was rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters with a new pedestal, unveiled by Geraldine Doceka, Officer Mathias Degan's great-granddaughter.|$|E

[...] In addition, Marshall believed the alien antagonists [...] "give the Weeping Angels a run for their money in scare factor." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek thought the episode was [...] "a triumphant return for Doctor Who, bubbling with confidence and throwing down story strands that hint at an engrossing series." [...] Brew liked Sheppard's performance as Delaware and Darvill's increasing presence as Rory. Brew also complimented Haynes' work in the United States, saying it was an improvement from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan", which featured British actors attempting to play with American accents. Tom Phillips of Metro said the 1969 US setting were [...] "beautifully used," [...] and enjoyed the [...] "spookiness" [...] of the Silence. However Phillips felt the episode would be [...] "a bit hard to get into" [...] for new viewers. Kevin O'Sullivan The Sunday Mirror was more negative towards the episode, stating it was [...] "impossible to understand," [...] and for [...] "strictly sci-fi nerds only," [...] adding that Smith [...] "remains a derivative Doctor who brings nothing new to the party." ...|$|E
