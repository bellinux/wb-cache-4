5000|$|One vessel {{built in}} 1883, the 203 ft long and 807 ton City of Makinac, (later renamed in 1893 the State of New York under the Cleveland and Buffalo Line) was sold back to D&C in 1909 {{to run from}} Detroit to Saginaw and other nearby way ports. Early in her life, the ship served the famous {{amusement}} park Crystal Beach in Ontario, Canada near Buffalo, New York. It was here on Lake Erie she was best known. In 1936, she was retired, stripped of her <b>upper</b> <b>fittings</b> and structures and sold to the Columbia Yacht Club in Chicago {{for use as a}} permanently moored , with a new one-story structure being built on top of the older hull. The rebuilt liner, now renamed Florida, served well for these owners as their primary meeting locale. Only a fire in 1954 interrupted her stationary service, but, with repairs and the name Columbia painted on the old ship's bow, she endured further good use. In 1982, the Florida was sold for scrap. The larger retired railroad and passenger ferry [...] serves in the Florida's place.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of different methods of blood pressure (BP) measurement compared with reference {{standards for the}} diagnosis of hypertension in patients with obesity with a large arm circumference. DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis with hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models. Bland-Altman analyses where individual patient data were available. Methodological quality appraised using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS 2) criteria. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, DARE, Medion and Trip databases were searched. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Cross-sectional, randomised and cohort studies of diagnostic test accuracy that compared any non-invasive BP tests (upper arm, forearm, wrist, finger) with an appropriate reference standard (invasive BP, correctly <b>fitting</b> <b>upper</b> arm cuff, ambulatory BP monitoring) in primary care were included. RESULTS: 4037 potentially relevant papers were identified. 20 studies involving 26 different comparisons met the inclusion criteria. Individual patient data were available from 4 studies. No studies satisfied all QUADAS 2 criteria. Compared with the reference test of invasive BP, a correctly <b>fitting</b> <b>upper</b> arm BP cuff had a sensitivity of 0. 87 (0. 79 to 0. 93) and a specificity of 0. 85 (0. 64 to 0. 95); insufficient evidence was available for other comparisons to invasive BP. Compared with the reference test of a correctly <b>fitting</b> <b>upper</b> arm cuff, BP measurement at the wrist had a sensitivity of 0. 92 (0. 64 to 0. 99) and a specificity of 0. 92 (0. 85 to 0. 87). Measurement with an incorrectly fitting standard cuff had a sensitivity of 0. 73 (0. 67 to 0. 78) and a specificity of 0. 76 (0. 69 to 0. 82). Measurement at the forearm had a sensitivity of 0. 84 (0. 71 to 0. 92) and a specificity 0. 75 of (0. 66 to 0. 83). Bland-Altman analysis of individual patient data from 3 studies comparing wrist and upper arm BP showed a mean difference of 0. 46  mm Hg for systolic BP measurement and 2. 2  mm Hg for diastolic BP measurement. CONCLUSIONS: BP measurement with a correctly <b>fitting</b> <b>upper</b> arm cuff is sufficiently sensitive and specific to diagnose hypertension in patients with obesity with a large upper arm circumference. If a correctly <b>fitting</b> <b>upper</b> arm cuff cannot be applied, an incorrectly fitting standard size cuff should not be used and BP measurement at the wrist should be considered...|$|R

5000|$|There was {{a longstanding}} rumour that the ships could not fire a full {{broadside}} without risk of structural damage.

40|$|Abstract. For a long time, {{the monitor}} and {{maintain}} of navy Vessels equipment {{is based on}} the traditional maintain theories and plan maintain. But with the development of electronically and digitization, this kind of traditional mode is more and more hard to satisfy the need of equipment, and restrict the formation and exaltation of troops fighting strength. Currently the technologies of fault prognostics and integrated health management are becoming regarded, especially on many Vessels equipment systems. There are many factors that influence the equipment environment safety, and Oil mist concentration is one of the important factors. So it is very critical to monitor oil mist concentration accurately and quickly. The paper designed a method to carry on the sampling of the air and get the original data. And forecasting the variety of oil mist concentration with grey model, it opens the air decontamination device before attaining the limited value.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts to integrate electrodes into liners to operate externally powered devices. Various methods and techniques have been tried from RTV laminated sockets to off-the-shelf liners {{as well as a}} number of thermoplastic techniques. All of these techniques, while providing improved suspension and comfort have limitations and drawbacks. However these limitations have not deterred prosthetists from pursuing these options in an effort to provide better control, better suspension and ultimately a better outcome.

40|$|Technological advancements {{in lower}} limb {{prostheses}} {{have resulted in}} actuated motors in both knees and ankles.

In this work, we present approaches to maintaining consistent electrode placements on individuals with transfemoral and transtibial amputations during static non-weight-bearing conditions and dynamic weight-bearing activities.

40|$|Long-span bridges {{suffer from}} higher traffic loads and the {{simultaneous}} presence of multiple vehicles, which {{in conjunction with}} the steady traffic growth may pose a threat to the bridge safety. This study presents a methodology for first-passage probability evaluation of long-span bridges subject to stochastic heavy traffic loading. Initially, the stochastic heavy traffic loading was simulated based on long-term weigh-in-motion measurements of a highway bridge in China. A computational framework was presented integrating Rice’s level-crossing theory and the first-passage criterion. The effectiveness of the computational framework was demonstrated through a case study of a cable-stayed bridge. Numerical results show that the <b>upper</b> tail <b>fitting</b> of the up-crossing rate is an appropriate description of probability characteristics of the extreme traffic load effects of long-span bridges. The average daily truck traffic growth increases the probability of exceedance due to an intensive heavy traffic flow and results in a higher first-passage probability, but this increased trend is weakening as the continuous increase of the traffic volume. Since the sustained growth of gross vehicle weight has a constant impact on the probability of failure, setting a reasonable threshold overload ratio is an effective scheme as a traffic management to ensure the bridge serviceability...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{several examples}} demonstrating that the formal modal representation of surface wavefields often does not describe adequately observable wave parameters, {{such as the}} phase and group velocity dispersion of higher modes.

In such cases the separation of neighboring higher modes may be impossible, and observed dispersion curves may significantly differ from the ones predicted by the theory.

40|$|Introduction. Penetrated {{injuries}} are most difficult injuries of the eye. Intraocular foreign body (IOFB) may lodge {{in any of}} the structures it encounters, from anterior chamber to the retina and choroid. Notable effects caused by foreign body injury include traumatic cataract, vitreous liquefaction, retinal and subretinal hemorrhages, retinal detachment and development of endophtalmitis. Case Outline. A 49 ­year­old man sustained injury of the right eye with a piece of metal wire. On admission visual acuity was VOD: 1. 0 and lower intraocular tension TOD= 6 mmHg (10 ­ 22 mmHg). Corneal entry wound was noticed near limb on 11 h with a prominating foreign body of 18 mm in length that passed through the iris, lens and vitreous. X­ray findings confirmed existence of a large foreign body extending along {{the entire length of the}} globe. IOFB removal was done with anatomic forceps. On postoperative detailed clinical examination we observed retinal rupture in the <b>upper</b> temporal quadrant <b>fitting</b> in the area of the IOFB damaged retina. Laser photocoagulation of retinal tear (laser retinal barrage) was done. Visual acuity on discharge was the same (1. 0) and intraocular tension was within normal limits (10 mmHg). Conclusion. Penetrated injury of eye requires detailed examination of all eye structures, beginning from the anterior to posterior segment. Timely diagnosed ruptures of the posterior segment of eye before the development of traumatic cataract, and adequate therapeutic procedures prevent serious complications of IOFB penetrated eye injury such as retinal detachment and permanent reduction of visual acuity...|$|R
