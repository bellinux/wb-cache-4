5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the <b>unconscious</b> mind of Poe, and the <b>unconscious</b> mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the <b>unconscious.</b> That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
