40|$|In the USA, each {{individual}} vehicle {{is required to}} meet <b>uniform</b> per-mile emission <b>standards.</b> The <b>uniform</b> <b>standard</b> system does not allow vehicle manufacturers flexibility in achieving overall emission reduction goals for motor vehicles. The system provides manufacturers {{with little or no}} incentive to control vehicle emissions beyond what is required. In this paper, an incentive-based marketable permit system is proposed to replace the <b>uniform</b> <b>standard</b> system. Under the marketable permit system, vehicle manufacturers are required to meet corporate average emission standards; they are allowed to buy or sell vehicle emission reduction credits among themselves to meet corporate average standards; and they are allowed to bank vehicle emission reduction credits that are accumulated in earlier years and to use the credits for meeting average standards in later years. It is estimated in this study that relative to the current <b>uniform</b> <b>standard</b> system, the marketable permit system can reduce vehicle emission control costs by $ 150 to $ 400 million per year in California, or 13 - 30 % of the costs currently spent on vehicle emission control. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} a {{transboundary pollution}} problem between two countries and studies the efficiency comparison of uniform versus differentiated abatement standards {{when there are}} imperfect transfers between countries. To achieve this goal, we use a negotiation game and the Nash bargaining solution as equilibrium. On the one hand, we remark that the argument of similarity of countries to defend the use of <b>uniform</b> <b>standards</b> is not appropriate, when there exists high level of fixed costs in abatement technology for symmetric countries. On the other hand, for asymmetric countries, according to the total welfare criteria, we notice first that differentiated standards with transfers are generally better than <b>uniform</b> <b>standards</b> with transfers. Secondly, differentiated standards without transfers always outperform <b>uniform</b> <b>standards</b> without transfers. Last, the numerical {{results show that the}} asymmetry on abatement benefits between the countries makes the uniform regime with imperfect transfers better than the differentiated regime without transfers, while an asymmetry on abatement costs gives the opposite result. Transboundary pollution, cooperative games, bargaining, standards, transfers. ...|$|R
