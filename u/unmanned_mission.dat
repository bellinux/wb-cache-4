25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a concept {{known as the}} Planetary Grand Tour was {{developed}} in the United States by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It would allow a single spacecraft to travel past the asteroid belt and onto each of the outer planets, including Jupiter, if the mission was launched in 1976 or 1977. However, there was uncertainty over whether a spacecraft could survive passage through the asteroid belt, where micrometeoroids could cause it physical damage, or the intense Jovian magnetosphere, where charged particles could harm sensitive electronics. To resolve these questions before sending the more ambitious Voyager missions, NASA and the Ames Research Center launched a pair of twin probes, Pioneer10 and Pioneer11 on March 3, 1972 and April 6, 1973, respectively, on the first <b>unmanned</b> <b>mission</b> to the outer Solar System.|$|E
