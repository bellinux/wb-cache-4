5|$|Turner had his {{own reasons}} for wanting Alderson gone, {{following}} the Battle of St-Eloi in April 1916. After British troops had taken a large crater near {{the ruins of the}} Belgian town of St Eloi, a brigade of Turner's division was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks. Due to dreadful management of the Canadian forces by Turner and Brigadier-General Huntly Ketchen, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army who had overall responsibility for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, Alderson sought his dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no <b>uncertain</b> <b>terms</b> to Commander in Chief Sir Douglas Haig that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support.|$|E

Simultaneous output-feedback linear quadratic controllers are designed for PV generators. This designed control scheme is robust with respect to intermittency and enhances the integration level in a sub-transmission and distributed system.
