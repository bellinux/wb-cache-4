Four green turtles (SSCL: 58. 1 - 71. 2 cm) were applied. Behaviour of each green turtle in the net was recorded by an underwater video camera, and the number and duration of successive pushing-up behaviours were confirmed. Detection of pushing-up behaviour was attempted by filtering the time series attitude angle and the ODBA (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration) of the turtle which were converted from the static surge acceleration or the tri-axial dynamic acceleration. The total number of pushing-up behaviours was 38 times and the total duration was 284 seconds. The most accurate threshold of 35 degrees in attitude angle and 2. 0 m/s 2 in ODBA detected 82 % of all the pushing-up behaviours although it contained non pushing-up behaviours such as quick changes in swimming direction. It also detected 54 % out of the whole duration time. Data from geomagnetic direction and depth sensor would improve precision of the detection in a field experiment...|$|E

30|$|The second {{improvement}} that {{we apply}} {{here is the}} hierarchical structure best described by Veselý et al. [21]. The origins of this technology {{go back to the}} era of shallow networks, which—just as DNNs—were trained on a block of consecutive input vectors. Some authors observed that the posterior estimates obtained can be “enhanced” by training yet another network—but this time on a sequence of output vectors coming from the first network [22]. Other authors refer to this approach as the “hierarchical modeling” [23 – 25] or the “stacked modeling” method [26]. Two trivial improvements to this approach are when the <b>upper</b> <b>net</b> downsamples the output of the lower one [24, 27] and/or when it uses the output of some bottleneck layer instead of the uppermost softmax layer [25, 26]. Veselý’s proposal was to treat this hierarchical construct as one joint model, and he also explained why the compound structure can be interpreted as a deep convolutional network [21]. Here, we experiment with his approach, but we prefer the name “hierarchical modeling” in order to avoid confusion with the more widely accepted interpretation of convolution described earlier. The tests on TIMIT will show that our convolutional maxout networks can be efficiently combined with the hierarchical modeling scheme, yielding a phone error rate reduction of about 5.5 %.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} (seasonal and diel) patterns in the hyperbenthic community structure (> 500 μm) was investigated in the warm temperate, permanently open Kariega Estuary situated along the south-eastern coastline of South Africa. Spatial and seasonal patterns in the hyperbenthic community structure were assessed monthly at six stations {{along the length of}} the estuary over a period of twelve months. Data were collected using a modified hyperbenthic sledge, comprising two super-imposed nets. Physico-chemical data indicate the presence of a constant reverse salinity gradient, with highest salinities measured in the upper reaches and lowest at the mouth of the estuary. Strong seasonal patterns in temperature, dissolved oxygen and total chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations were evident. Total average hyperbenthic densities ranged between 0. 04 and 166 ind. m- 3 in the lower net and between 0. 12 and 225 ind. m- 3 in the <b>upper</b> <b>net.</b> Hyperbenthic biomass values ranged between 0. 02 and 11. 9 mg. dry weight. m- 3 in the lower net and between 0. 02 and 17. 4 mg. dry weight. m- 3 in the <b>upper</b> <b>net.</b> A {{spatial and temporal}} pattern in total densities was detected with an increase in abundance over the period of September to October 2008 particularly in the middle reaches (Stations 3 and 4). Both the lower and upper nets were numerically dominated by decapods (mainly brachyuran crab zoeae) with the exception of June and July 2008 when mysids (mainly Mesopodopsis wooldridgei) dominated, making up 72. 4 ± 58. 14 % of the total abundance in the lower net. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that 99. 2 % of the variance in the hyperbenthic community structure could be explained by the first two canonical axes. Axis one, which accounted for 96. 8 % of the total variation detected in the ordination plot was highly correlated with sedimentary organic content and to a lesser extent the chl-a concentration within the Kariega Estuary. The correlations with the second canonical axis (2. 4 %) were less obvious, however, salinity and seston concentration were weakly correlated with this axis. Diel variability in the hyperbenthic community structure was assessed during March 2009. Samples were collected during the day and night (n = 6 for each period) using sampling gear described above. Total average hyperbenthic densities during the day (497. 9 ± 254. 1 ind. m- 3) were significantly higher than night-time estimates (129. 9 ± 38. 5 ind. m- 3; p 0. 05). A hierarchical cluster analysis identified two significantly distinct groupings, designated the day and night samples. Results from the SIMPER procedure indicated that the high densities of crab zoeae recorded during the day-time accounted for the majority of the dissimilarity between the day and night groupings (44. 7 %). In addition, it is apparent that several benthic species, especially from the cumacean and isopod orders, were absent from the hyperbenthos during the day-time and emerged into the water column at night...|$|E

40|$|The interannual {{variability}} in upper-ocean (0 – 400 m) temperature and governing mechanisms {{for the period}} 1968 – 97 are quantified from a global ocean hindcast simulation driven by atmospheric reanalysis and satellite data products. The unconstrained simulation exhibits considerable skill in replicating the observed interannual {{variability in}} vertically integrated heat content estimated from hydrographic data and monthly satellite sea surface temperature and sea surface height data. Globally, the most significant interannual variability modes arise from El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean zonal mode, with sub-stantial extension beyond the Tropics into the midlatitudes. In the well-stratified Tropics and subtropics, net annual heat storage variability is driven predominately by the convergence of the advective heat transport, mostly reflecting velocity anomalies times the mean temperature field. Vertical velocity variability is caused by remote wind forcing, and subsurface temperature anomalies are governed mostly by isopycnal displace-ments (heave). The dynamics at mid- to high latitudes are qualitatively different and vary regionally. Interannual temperature variability is more coherent with depth because of deep winter mixing and varia-tions in western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that span the <b>upper</b> thermocline. <b>Net</b> annual heat storage variability is forced by a mixture of local air–sea heat fluxes and the convergence of the advective heat transport, the latter resulting from both velocity and temperature anomalies.

40|$|Abstract The {{absolute}} quantified {{measurement of}} haemoglobin skin blood saturation from collected reflectance spectra {{of the skin}} {{is complicated by the}} fact that the blood content of tissues can vary both in the spatial distribution and in the amount. These measurements require an understanding of which vascular bed is primarily responsible for the detected signal. Knowing the spatial detector depth sensitivity makes it possible to find the best range of different probe geometries for the measurements of signal from the required zones and group of vessels inside the skin. To facilitate this, a Monte Carlo simulation has been developed to estimate the sampling volume offered by fibre-optic probes with a small source-detector spacing (in the current report 250 μm, 400 μm and 800 μm). The optical properties of the modelled medium are taken to be the optical properties of the Caucasian type of skin tissue in the visible range of the spectrum. It is shown that, for a small source-detector separation (800 μm and smaller), rough boundaries between layers of different refractive index can play a significant role in skin optics. Wavy layer interfaces produce a deeper and more homogeneous distribution of photons within the skin and tend to suppress the direct channelling of photons from source to detector. The model predicts that a probe spacing of 250 μm samples primarily epidermal layers and papillary dermis, whereas spacings of 400 – 800 μm sample <b>upper</b> blood <b>net</b> dermis an...|$|R

Similarly to the known response of a single cloud, we show that the mean field properties change in a non-monotonic trend, with an optimum aerosol concentration for which the field reaches its maximal water mass or rain yield. This trend {{is a result of}} competition between processes that encourage cloud development versus those that suppress it. However, another layer of complexity is added when considering clouds' impact on the field's thermodynamic properties and how this is dependent on aerosol loading. Under polluted conditions, rain is suppressed and the non-precipitating clouds act to increase atmospheric instability. This results in warming of {{the lower part of the}} cloudy layer (in which there is net condensation) and cooling of the <b>upper</b> part (<b>net</b> evaporation). Evaporation at the upper part of the cloudy layer in the polluted simulations raises humidity at these levels and thus amplifies the development of the next generation of clouds (preconditioning effect).

These two effects act to stabilize the atmospheric boundary layer with time (consumption of the instability).

The simulations demonstrate that tropospheric trace gas profiles in the monsoon season are distinct {{from the rest of}} the year. Air uplifted from the lower troposphere to the tropopause layer dominates the eastern part of the ASMA’s interior, while the western part is characterised by subsidence down to the mid-troposphere. Soluble compounds are being washed out when uplifted by convection in the eastern part, where lightning simultaneously replenishes reactive nitrogen in the <b>upper</b> troposphere. <b>Net</b> photochemical ozone production is significantly enhanced in the ASMA, contrasted by an ozone depleting regime in the mid-troposphere and more neutral conditions in autumn and winter. An analysis of multiple monsoon seasons in the simulation shows that stratospherically influenced tropopause layer air is regularly entrained at the eastern ASMA flank, and then transported in the southern fringe around the interior region. Observed and simulated tracer-tracer relations reflect photochemical O 3 production, as well as in-mixing from the lower troposphere and the tropopause layer. The simulation additionally shows entrainment of clean air from the equatorial region by northerly winds at the western ASMA flank. Although the in situ measurements were performed towards the end of summer, the main ingredients needed for their interpretation are present throughout the monsoon season. A transition between two dynamical modes of the ASMA took place during the HALO ESMVal campaign. Transport barriers of the original anticyclone are overcome effectively when it splits up.

40|$|Large-scale {{perturbations}} in seawater chemistry {{brought about}} by the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 will go on long after emissions decline or stop. Several geo-engineering approaches have been suggested to reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and ocean acidification. One of them is to enhance weathering processes to remove atmospheric CO 2. This method involves dissolving rocks (i. e. limestone, olivine) or adding strong bases (i. e. calcium hydroxide) to the <b>upper</b> ocean. The <b>net</b> effect of these two approaches is to increase ocean alkalinity, thereby increasing the oceanic capacity to take up and store anthropogenic CO 2. Another effect of adding alkalinity would be to drive seawater to higher pH values and thus counteract the ongoing ocean acidification. However, whereas adding bases initially only alters alkalinity of seawater, dissolution of carbonates perturbs both, alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon budgets. Thus, on longer time scales, these two methods will likely have different biogeochemical effects in the ocean. Here we test enduring implications of the two approaches for the marine carbon cycle using the global ocean biogeochemical model HAMOCC which also includes marine sediments. In our model scenarios we add alkalinity in amounts proportional to fossil fuel emissions.

Carbon isotopic ratios of the main diatom marker PLFA, 20 : 5 w 3, were mainly related to changes in d 13 C values of dissolved inorganic carbon and showed a residual variation of ~ 5 ‰, which is probably related to changes in growth conditions along the estuary. The green algal marker 18 : 3 w 3 was much more depleted in 13 C than the diatom markers, suggesting that these two main phytoplankton groups use a different inorganic carbon source or carbon dioxide fixation mechanism. Isotopic ratios of the different bacterial PLFA detected were very similar and ranged between - 30 ‰ and - 21 ‰. They closely tracked d 13 CC values in particulate organic carbon (POC), indicating that POC or material with the same 13 C signature was the main bacterial carbon substrate. In the lower, marine side of the estuary, isotope ratios of bacterial and algal PLFA were similar, suggesting a coupling between primary production and bacterial consumption of organic matter. However, d 13 C values of bacterial PLFA in the upper estuary were enriched compared with algal PLFA (between 6 ‰ and 15 ‰), indicating an uncoupled algal–bacterial system with allochthonous subsidies, such as terrestrial C 3 organic matter or sewage supporting bacterial growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Sources and {{processing}} of carbon in the hypoxic St. Lawrence Estuary are investigated via a coupled bulk (stable carbon isotope and elemental quantitative) and molecular (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and lignin phenols) approach. In order {{to analyze the}} stable carbon isotope ratio of dissolved organic carbon (e 13 C DOC), a novel method was developed. coupling a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer allowing the routine analysis of e 13 C DOC in marine waters. Bulk analyses of five pools of carbon (sedimentary, pore-water dissolved organic, water column dissolved inorganic and organic, and particulate organic) distributed through the estuarine transition zone are analyzed to gain further insight into the spatial variability of carbon source(s) and cycling in the system. with particular insight gleaned into the water column. The system identifies with other non-anthropogenically perturbed systems by all indicators, despite its proximity to major industrial centers {{and one of the}} historically heaviest polluted watersheds in North America. The extensive elemental and isotopic analyses of five pools of carbon show; (1) a clear spatial shift in trophic state between with <b>Upper</b> estuarine <b>net</b> heterotrophy and primary production resulting in lower Estuarine net autotrophy; (2) the dissolved and particulate organic pools do share sources, but appear decoupled because physical mixing outpaces transfer; (3) approximately 90 % of primary produced particulate carbon and nitrogen is consumed prior to sedimentary deposition in the Lower Estuary; (4) stable isotopes indicate the export of riverine dissolved organic carbon is more efficient than estuarine systems from lower latitudes perhaps making similarly located estuaries important sources of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon to the world's oceans; (5) the benthic nepheloid layer may be a site of microbial activity in the hypoxic Lower Estuary; and (6) isotopic fractionation between pore water dissolved organic carbon and sedimentary organic carbon implies compositionally-driven in situ sedimentary fractionation. To better understand estuarine processes, directed experiments investigating the role of UV oxidation coupled to microbial respiration and particle dynamics should be conducted in the future. To better understand where and how carbon is consumed in the hypoxic zone the role of benthic layer cyanobacteria should be a primary focus...|$|R

Coastal groundwater discharge, including submarine groundwater discharge, may provide stabilizing conditions for intertidal zone permeable sediments. In this study, we integrated detailed time series temperature observations, porewater pressure measurements, and two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography profiles {{to understand the}} coupled hydraulic-thermal regime of a tropical sandy intertidal zone in a fringing coral reef lagoon (Rarotonga, Cook Islands). We found three heating patterns across the 15 m study transect over tidal and diel periods: (1) a highly variable thermal regime dominated by swash infiltration and changes in saturation state in the <b>upper</b> foreshore with <b>net</b> heat import into the sediment, (2) a groundwater-supported underground stable, cool region just seaward of the intertidal slope break also importing heat into the subsurface, and (3) a zone of seawater recirculation that sustained consistently warm subsurface temperatures that exported heat across the sediment-water interface. Simple calculations suggested thermal conduction as the main heat transport mechanism for the shallow intertidal sediment, but deeper and/or multi-dimensional groundwater flow was required to explain temperature patterns beyond 20 cm depth. Temperature differences between the distinct hydrodynamic zones of the foreshore site resulted in significant thermal gradients that persisted beyond tidal and diel periods. The thermal buffering of intertidal zones by coastal groundwater systems, both at surface seeps and in the shallow subsurface, can be responsible for thermal refugia for some coastal organisms and hotspots for biogeochemical reactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} the first in a two-part series in which the life cycles of numerically {{simulated}} shallow cumulus clouds are systematically examined. The life cycle data for six clouds with a range of cloud-top heights are isolated from an equilibrium trade cumulus field generated by a large eddy simulation (LES) with a uniform resolution of 25 m. A passive subcloud tracer is used to partition the cloud life-cycle transport into saturated and unsaturated components; the tracer shows that on average cloud convection occurs in a region with time-integrated volume roughly 2 - 3 times that of the liquid water-containing volume. All six clouds exhibit qualitatively similar vertical mass flux profiles, with net downward mass transport at <b>upper</b> levels and <b>net</b> upward mass flux at lower levels. This downward mass flux comes primarily from the unsaturated cloud-mixed convective region during the dissipation stage, and is evaporatively driven. Unsaturated negatively buoyant cloud mixtures dominate the buoyancy and mass fluxes in the upper portion of all clouds while saturated positively buoyant cloud mixtures dominate the fluxes at lower levels. Small and large clouds have distinct vertical profiles of heating/cooling and drying/moistening, with small clouds cooling and moistening throughout their depth, while larger clouds cool and moisten at upper levels and heat and dry at lower levels. The simulation results are compared to the predictions of conceptual models commonly used in shallow cumulus parameterizations. 3 1...|$|R
40|$|Fossil fuel CO 2 {{emissions}} {{result in}} {{climate change and}} ocean acidification. Enhanced weathering or artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) has been proposed as a geoengineering method to mitigate further increase of atmospheric CO 2 and decrease of ocean pH. A variant of AOA involves reacting carbonates and adding the dissolved materials into the <b>upper</b> ocean. The <b>net</b> effect {{of this approach is}} to increase ocean alkalinity, thereby increasing the oceanic capacity to store fossil fuel CO 2. Another effect of adding alkalinity would be to drive seawater to higher pH values and thus counteract the ongoing ocean acidification. We test implications of AOA for marine carbon cycle using the global ocean biogeochemical model HAMOCC. In our model scenarios we add alkalinity in the amounts proportional to fossil fuel emissions. We show that large-scale AOA scenarios in which large amounts of alkalinity are added would be necessary to avoid a significant increase in atmospheric CO 2 and to hold the global seawater pH close to today’s value. Even a short-term AOA would have long-lasting effects on seawater chemistry. When AOA stops, atmospheric CO 2 (and pH) reverts back to rising (decreasing) at the rate determined by the fossil fuel CO 2 emissions growth, but the effect of AOA is permanent. Hence, in contrast to SRM, effects of AOA on seawater chemistry and atmospheric CO 2 retain after stopping alkalinity addition; AOA would not involve a long-term commitment...|$|R
