5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character {{to make him look}} like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E

25|$|Uber {{has been}} criticized for its extreme {{surcharges}} during emergencies such as Hurricane Sandy, the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis, and the June 2017 London Bridge attack, especially when taxis offered to transport riders for free; however, in many cases Uber later refunded surcharges incurred by riders during these events. In 2014, Uber announced that it would not implement surge pricing during emergencies in the United States.

25|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{scholarly}} consensus yet about what the overall long-term effect will be of environmental pollution on the average rate of profit for industries. In some cases, if a resource is depleted (and therefore much more difficult and costly to obtain), the profit yield on producing the resource might fall, since people will only buy it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> price point. In other cases, if an essential resource becomes scarce, its owners can drive up the price, and thus increase their profit rate, because demand remains strong.|$|E

25|$|Since each branch can be infinite, {{this tree}} {{has to be}} visited breadth-first rather than depth-first. This {{requires}} {{a large amount of}} space, as the breadth of the tree can grow exponentially. A method that may visit some nodes more than once but works in polynomial space is to visit in a depth-first manner with iterative deepening: one first visits the tree <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> depth, then increases the depth and perform the visit again. This particular procedure uses the depth (which is also the number of tableau rules that have been applied) for deciding when to stop at each step. Various other parameters (such as the size of the tableau labeling a node) have been used instead.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{giving rise}} to modernist reforms, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> degree the state-sponsored faculties were able to retain their {{independence}} from government control. However, as Pierret has pointed out in detail for Syria, in some countries the orthodox madrasa system remained largely intact, its decentralised organisation protecting it from state control. In fact, the government's attempt at controlling the religious education focussed largely on the academic institutions and neglected the traditional madrasas. By their continuing ability to provide social support and access to an educational alternative which was propagated as being more orthodox according to Islamic faith, the traditional ulama not only maintained their influence on {{large parts of the}} population, but actually increased their political influence and power.|$|E
25|$|One may ask {{analytic}} {{questions about}} algebraic numbers, and use analytic means to answer such questions; {{it is thus}} that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers {{in the field of}} algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> size. This question can be answered by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, a key analytic object at the roots of the subject. This {{is an example of a}} general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.|$|E

25|$|Effective 2016, printed {{electronic}} tickets {{can not be}} used at New York Yankees and New York City FC matches at Yankee Stadium. Only traditional hard-stock tickets, {{and those}} issued via a mobile ticketing system, are accepted. The team justified the decision by stating that it was meant to combat fraud associated with printed digital tickets. However, it was also believed that the team was trying to specifically hinder the ticket resale service StubHub, which competed against an official resale service run by TicketMaster known as the Yankees Ticket Exchange. The YTE is subject to a price flooring policy, meaning that tickets may only be discounted <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> amount. Although StubHub is the official ticket resale partner of Major League Baseball, the Yankees, as well as the Los Angeles Angels and Chicago Cubs, had opted out of this agreement.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began {{studying}} gender development in young children, partially {{in an effort}} to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersex and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term gender identity to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book Man and Woman, Boy and Girl (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.|$|E

Though he several times made higher scores, his finest performance was undoubtedly his innings of 90 for England against Australia at Kennington Oval in August, 1884. The match, resulted in a draw, Australia scoring 551 and England 346 and 85 for two wickets. In England's first innings Scotton went in first, and was the ninth man out, the total when he left being 332. During a stay of five hours and three quarters he played the bowling of Fred Spofforth, Palmer, Boyle, Billy Midwinter, and George Giffen without giving the slightest chance, and but for his impregnable defence it is quite likely that England would have been beaten. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> time he received very little assistance, but when Walter Read joined him, 151 runs were put on for the ninth wicket.|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{motivations for}} the {{provisioning}} of autonomic communication features in next generation services {{is to reduce the}} need of human inference for management tasks.

The consequence is that autonomic systems might deviate from intended states and behaviors, may show inconsistent or unwanted ones. We propose <b>an</b> approach <b>to</b> develop control structures complementary to distributed, heterogeneous services.
