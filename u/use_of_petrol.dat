25|$|The racial riots {{took place}} {{throughout}} Oldham {{and a small}} part of neighbouring Chadderton, peaking on Saturday, 26 May 2001, and continuing on Sunday 27, and Monday, 28 May 2001. They were particularly intensive in Glodwick, an area to the south-east of Oldham town centre. They were highly violent and led to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> bombs, bricks, bottles and other such projectiles by up to five-hundred Asian youths as they battled against lines of riot police. At least 20 people were injured in the riots, including fifteen officers, and 37 people were arrested. Other parts of Oldham such as Coppice and Westwood were also involved.|$|E
2500|$|In Coleman v Kinbacher & Anor (Qld Police), Coleman was {{successfully}} prosecuted for flag burning, {{not because of}} its political nature, but because given {{the size of the}} flag, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> as an accelerant, {{and the fact that it}} was in an open park area, many members of the public experienced [...] "concern, fright and anger", and in these circumstances flag burning could be considered disorderly conduct.|$|E
2500|$|Britain {{pioneered the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> powered, 4-wheel {{synchromesh}} mechanical drive locomotives (known as tractors) for daylight use within visual {{range of the}} front. In 1916 the War Office required [...] "Petrol Trench Tractors" [...] of 600-mm gauge that were capable of drawing 10 to 15 tons at [...] per hour. [...] Early tractors weighed 2 tons. Total production was 102 [...] Ernest E. Baguley tractors, 580 [...] Motor Rail tractors and 220 [...] Motor Rail tractors. An additional two-hundred [...] petrol-electric tractors were produced by British Westinghouse and Dick, Kerr & Co..|$|E

2500|$|In 1937, on the {{occasion}} of the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to the province, the IRA blew up a number of customs posts. In 1939 the IRA launched its Sabotage Campaign in England. This campaign effectively ended on the 25 August, a few days before the outbreak of the Second World War. The war brought additional responsibilities for the police. The security of the land border with the Republic of Ireland, which remained neutral during the war, was one important consideration. Allied to this was a greatly increased incidence of smuggling due to rationing, to the point where police virtually became revenue officers. There were also many wartime regulations to be enforced, including [...] "black-out" [...] requirements on house and vehicle lights, the arrest of striking workers, port security, and restrictions on the movement of vehicles and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2011 model year, all Bentley Continental range {{vehicles}} support the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> and E85 bioethanol fuel types in all markets, including North America.|$|E

40|$|Discussed {{methodology}} of forecasting and forecast {{of demand for}} energy carriers have been presented in two parts. In first part has been given forecast of freight road transport volumes up to the year 2020. Estimated structure of the fleet in the initial period of the forecast. Variant forecast of the fleet size and its structure according to categories and age. In this part has been given forecast of demand for energy carriers by lorries. When forecasting the scale of demand for individual energy carriers by lorries in a given year, the following issues were taken into account: estimated numbers of vehicles registered according to categories and production periods, an estimated average consumption of fuels per 100 km of mileage according to specified categories of vehicles and their production periods, estimated average annual mileages of vehicles according to categories and production periods. A drop in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrols</b> by lorries in Poland {{is expected to have}} taken place by the year 2020. The estimated forecast level amounts to 315 - 325 Gg. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrols</b> in 2020 would decrease to the level of 55 - 57 % of the consumption in the initial period of the forecast. An estimated increase in the demand for diesel fuels by lorries is expected to take place in Poland in 2020 and it is envisaged to reach the level of 5848 - 7680 Gg, which compared to the consumption in the initial period of the forecast, would be tantamount to an increase dynamics of 170 - 223 %. The demand for LPG fuels by lorries in 2020 should amount to 264 - 287 Gg, (an increase of 147 - 160 % compared to the initial period of the forecast). The demand for CNG fuel by lorries in 2020 would reach 61 - 68 Gg...|$|R

50|$|Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) was {{the name}} given to fast torpedo boats by the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy. The 'motor' in the formal designation, {{referring}} to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> engines, was to distinguish them from the majority of other naval craft that used steam turbines or reciprocating steam engines.|$|E
50|$|For the {{cylinder}} liners the N52 Engine uses Alusil {{to coat the}} aluminum cylinder sleeves. Alusil is an aluminium alloy commonly used to make linerless aluminium alloy engine blocks. Alusil, when etched, will expose a very hard silicon precipitate. BMW switched from Nikasil-coated cylinder walls to Alusil in 1996 to eliminate the corrosion problems caused through the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> or gasoline containing sulphur.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1970s the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> leaded <b>petrol</b> was {{ubiquitous}} worldwide, {{but research}} was emerging about {{the damage that}} it was doing to humans and the environment.

50|$|According to eyewitnesses, {{the attackers}} used petrol {{to set the}} houses on fire. In the remote island of Sandwip, which had no motor cars, petrol was {{imported}} from the mainland to set the houses on fire. According to Rakesh Batabyal, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> and kerosene indicates the premeditated and organised nature of the attacks. In Sandwip, revolutionary freedom fighter Lalmohan Sen was killed {{when he tried to}} resist a Muslim mob from killing the Hindus.|$|E
50|$|Besides sailing, the broads {{are also}} very popular with anglers. Recently, new {{facilities}} for disabled people have been created, including a special platform for anglers in wheelchairs. Ormesby Little Broad is used for sailing model yachts, and the Norfolk Model Yacht Club have an arrangement with Essex and Suffolk Water, which allows them to use the broad for this purpose once a month. Like their larger counterparts, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> or oil engines is not permitted, and all remote control is therefore by electric motors.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{presents a}} comparison of portable chain saws and hand saws in arborists. Saws were compared in terms of selected technical parameters and price. As a representative of portable chain saws, I have compared {{the most widely used}} and also brands which were proven by years. It was <b>used</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> and battery category of branch cutting machines with or without stick. It was also made {{a comparison of}} the most common brands of hand saws and hand saws on a stick. Systematics of how both saw groups (portable chain saws and hand saws) in terms of design tools (chain saw and saw blade) works, was also prepared. Finally, measurements of surface roughness cut were taken for both saw groups (portable chain saw and hand saw). Recommendations for practice were figured out based on the results...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, milking {{machines}} replaced hand milking and tractors started {{to replace the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> horses. Alfa Laval became a well-known manufacturer and brand of milking machines. In the 1950s, a large-scale mechanisation took place, <b>using</b> cheap supplies <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> fuels. The Swedish agricultural workforce was reduced by 60 percent from 1945 to 1970, and labour was freed up for employment in the industrial sector.|$|R
50|$|Other {{existing}} legislation governing everyday matters already {{allows for}} special provisions {{in a national}} emergency. For example, the Energy Act 1976 allows the Secretary of State to create regulations governing the production, distribution and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> coal, <b>petrol,</b> diesel, gas, biofuels and electricity in a crisis. For example, it could allow rationing, power cuts in certain areas to allow blackouts near key installations, restrictions on civilian <b>use</b> <b>of</b> cars and the like.|$|R

50|$|With {{the growth}} in {{motoring}} and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>petrol</b> engines there was a call for an extinguisher especially designed for fighting petrol fires. In 1911 Read and Campbell took out patent rights in Argentina on their 'Petrolex' extinguisher. This was acarbon tetrachloride extinguisher operated by a CO2 cartridge. The Royal Automobile Club conducted tests on the 'Petrolex' which passed with flying colours. 'Waterloo' extinguishers-water filled, were installed in many Royal residences and public buildings including 'Windsor Castle and all the Royal Palaces of England',the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the General Post Office. Royal cars were fitted with 'Petrolex' extinguishers.|$|E

50|$|The unique {{character}} of the Hydrogen Hybrid system is the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>using</b> both <b>petrol</b> and hydrogen fuel depending on the driving conditions. The other hydrogen systems for internal combustion engines {{that have been developed}} by other automobile companies are not capable <b>of</b> <b>using</b> both <b>petrol</b> and hydrogen fuel at the same time. Hence, this characteristic of the Hydrogen Hybrid system differentiates Alset Global from the others. Eight years of research and development have led to a very efficient way to burn hydrogen and use the fuel's full potential. Nevertheless, the details of this technology are not revealed to public. Alset Global holds various patents for the future implications of this system and therefore the information is concealed.|$|R
