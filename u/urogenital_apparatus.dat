40|$|Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (OFQ) is a {{recently}} discovered endogenous neuropeptide that structurally resembles on opioid peptide. In {{the central nervous}} system this peptide is implicated in the nociception. More recently its documented distribution in other peripheral structures suggests a possible role for OFQ in regulation of other physiological functions. On this subject the mouse vas deferens is proposed as available bioassay for nociceptin. It therefore seems interesting to evaluate immunohistochemical expression of this neuropeptide in distinct segments of rat male urogenital tract. The results obtained supply the morphohistochemical basis to demonstrate that Orphanin plays a neurocrine control on motility and a paracrine control on secretion in examined <b>urogenital</b> <b>apparatus</b> segments...|$|E
30|$|Primary mucinous cystadenomas are {{extremely}} rare and their histogenesis is not understood completely [5, 6]. This pathology {{tends to be}} more frequent in females, and it is commonly accepted that invagination of the peritoneal mesothelium undergoes mucinous metaplasia and further cystic formation. Malignant transformation of primary mucinous cystadenomas into cystadenocarcinoma has also been considered several other hypotheses include the suggestion that the tumor arises from ectopic ovarian tissue (which may explain the female tendency), from remnants of embryonic <b>urogenital</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and from a teratoma in which the mucinous epithelium overrides the other teratomatous components and dominates into cystic lesion [7, 8]. Although most of the reported cases were benign, close follow-up is recommended for borderline lesions due to their malignant propensity.|$|E
40|$|A male {{accessory}} sex organ, {{termed the}} juxtatesticular body (JTB), {{is located in}} the posterior part of the trunk, outside the coelomic cavity, lying ventral to the urinary ducts and dorsal to the urinary bladder and testes in jawfishes. Its microscopic structure is unusual for an accessory sex organ because it is highly vascularized, organized in small follicles, and ductless. The embryological origin of the JTB and the development of the <b>urogenital</b> <b>apparatus</b> was studied in juveniles of Opistognathus whitehurstii and O. maxillosus. Both sexes possess a structure located outside the coelomic cavity in the posterior part of the trunk. In females this structure showed the same histological organization as the kidney, however in males it was different and recognized as the JTB. The degree of development of the JTB followed that of the testes, being represented in youngest recognizable males only by a small mass of mesenchymal cells while it was fully developed in males with spermatogenic testes. In most immature males renal structures, such as tubules and glomeruli, were found in the dorsal part of this structure. On the basis of anatomical and cytological features a nephrogenic origin for the JTB is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This review {{covers the}} most {{important}} female congenital pelvic malformations. The first part focuses on the embryological development of the <b>urogenital</b> and anorectal <b>apparatus,</b> morphological features, and the diagnostic and surgical approach to abnormalities. Comprehension of the embryological development of the <b>urogenital</b> and anorectal <b>apparatus</b> is essential to understand the morphology of congenital pelvic abnormalities and their surgical treatment. Congenital pelvic malformations are characterized by specific common features; the severity of which often subverts the pelvic morphology completely and {{makes it difficult to}} comprehend before surgery. The development of imaging, mainly magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, in the investigation of pelvic floor disorders has recently become a fundamental tool for surgeons to achieve better understanding of the anatomy. Forty years ago, the primary aim of clinicians was to save the lives of such patients and to achieve anatomical normality. However, nowadays, functional reconstruction and recovery are essential parts of surgical management. Introduction of minimally invasive surgery has allowed the improvement of cosmetic results that is so important in paediatric or adolescent patients after reconstructive surgery. The option of sharing the complexity of pelvic congenital diseases by entrusting specific competencies to subspecialists (paediatric urologists, urogynaecologists, neurourologists, paediatric endocrinologists and neonatologists) has improved the quality of care for patients. However, at the same time, active interaction between various specialists remains fundamental. The exchange of knowledge and expertise, not only during the diagnostic-therapeutic process but also during follow-up, is crucial to obtain the best anatomical and functional results throughout the life of the patient.

40|$|Introduction. The Propionibacterium acnes and the Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii are {{occasional}} pathogenic bacteria. The intrascrotal localization of the Propionibacterium acnes is exceptional. The Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii is {{not able}} to colonize the <b>urogenital</b> <b>apparatus</b> but it is the most frequently responsible for blood culture contamination even if it can sustain, in particular conditions, systemic infections. Case Presentation. We report the case of a 72 -year-old man who is under observation for pain and swelling of the left hemiscrotum associated to high fever. The scrotal ultrasound shows the presence of a left intra-scrotal abscess with didymus, epididymis, and intact didymus-epididymis tunicae. The blood culture executed for evening fever during antibiotic therapy has underlined an infection with Propionibacterium acnes. A following blood culture has shown an increase in Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii. Due to fever the patient has undergone left orchifunicolectomy with inguino-scrotal toilet. The anatomical pathological examination has also shown the presence of nonspecific granulomatous inflammation compatible with Propionibacterium acnes infection. Conclusion. The onset of an intrascrotal abscess likely sustained by Propionibacterium acnes complicated by a possible systemic Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii suprainfection is an exceptional event that, in our case, has been resolved with surgical toilet...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionEnterocystoplasties are {{associated}} to complications. We developed a surgical technique for bladder autoaugmentation using autologous uterine flap in the rat, {{to try and}} improve the post-surgical evolution. Methods 36 female Wistar rats were randomly allocated into following groups: Group 1 : Control (n =  12) for analytical parameters, Group 2 : Sham-operation hysterocystorrhaphy (n =  12) and Group 3 : Bladder autoaugmentation with autologous uterine flap (n =  12). Two weeks after surgery ultrasound examination of the bladder was performed. At 8 weeks and 24 weeks, blood and urine samples were taken. Post-mortem evaluation was performed and <b>urogenital</b> <b>apparatus</b> removed for gross and microscopic examination. The statistical analysis was done using the Kruskall–Wallis and {{the extension of the}} Fisher's exact test. Significance was set at 5 % (p <  0. 05). ResultsSerum chemistry, blood count and peripheral blood smears, electrolytes and urinary parameters were all within the normal range for the rat. No abnormal findings were observed during ultrasound examination. There was no mortality or other surgical complications. Post-mortem evaluation revealed no dilation of bladder, uterus or upper urinary tract. Uroliths were not observed. Histology of the augmented area demonstrated an excellent union between the bladder and the protective uterine flap. A normal urothelial layer was maintained. ConclusionsThe use of autologous uterine flap to perform bladder autoaugmentation in the rat proved a safe and suitable surgical technique to augment the bladder. The major advantage is the avoidance of the complications observed in other surgical techniques for bladder augmentation, like enterocystoplasties, where gastrointestinal tract epithelium is incorporated into the urinary tract...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Opitz G/BBB {{syndrome}} is a genetic disorder characterized by developmental midline abnormalities, such as hypertelorism, cleft palate, and hypospadias. The gene {{responsible for the}} X-linked form of this disease, MID 1, encodes a TRIM/RBCC protein that is anchored to the microtubules. The association of Mid 1 with the cytoskeleton is regulated by dynamic phosphorylation, through the interaction with the α 4 subunit of phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A). Mid 1 acts as an E 3 ubiquitin ligase, regulating PP 2 A degradation on microtubules. Results In spite of these findings, the biological role exerted by the Opitz syndrome gene product is still unclear {{and the presence of}} other potential interacting moieties in the Mid 1 structure prompted us to search for additional cellular partners. Through a yeast two-hybrid screening approach, we identified a novel gene, MIG 12, whose protein product interacts with Mid 1. We confirmed by immunoprecipitation that this interaction occurs in vivo and that it is mediated by the Mid 1 coiled-coil domain. We found that Mig 12 is mainly expressed in the neuroepithelial midline, <b>urogenital</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and digits during embryonic development. Transiently expressed Mig 12 is found diffusely in both nucleus and cytoplasm, although it is enriched in the microtubule-organizing center region. Consistently with this, endogenous Mig 12 protein is partially detected in the polymerized tubulin fraction after microtubule stabilization. When co-transfected with Mid 1, Mig 12 is massively recruited to thick filamentous structures composed of tubulin. These microtubule bundles are resistant to high doses of depolymerizing agents and are composed of acetylated tubulin, thus representing stabilized microtubule arrays. Conclusions Our findings suggest that Mig 12 co-operates with Mid 1 to stabilize microtubules. Mid 1 -Mig 12 complexes might be implicated in cellular processes that require microtubule stabilization, such as cell division and migration. Impairment in Mig 12 /Mid 1 -mediated microtubule dynamic regulation, during the development of embryonic midline, may cause the pathological signs observed in Opitz syndrome patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In the {{management}} of cloaca, there is concern that dissection of the urogenital sinus in early childhood {{with the aim of}} total anatomical correction is hazardous. Avoiding such mobilization and providing mitrofanoff channel, when needed, till peripubertal period reduces complications and is technically easier. Materials and Methods: Forty-three cases of cloaca were managed in the period 2004 – 2016. Case records and radiology were reviewed retrospectively. The follow-up evaluation was done by looking into voiding history, bowel movements, and menstruation history. Results: There were three groups of children, namely, those with no reconstruction done elsewhere except a diverting fecal stoma (Group I, n = 25), those who had undergone anorectal correction elsewhere with no attempt at urogenital reconstruction (Group IIA, n = 13), and tho with attempted bowel and genitourinary reconstruction elsewhere (Group IIB, n = 5). The Group I children (one still awaiting reconstruction) underwent early rectal reconstruction followed by expectant management of the <b>urogenital</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The 18 referred cases had multiple problems, chiefly urogenital, of congenital or iatrogenic origin. While urinary reconstruction included bladder augmentation, ileal neobladder, bladder neck closure, and ureteric reimplantation, the foundation of urinary management was intermittent catheterization through mitrofanoff stoma and the avoidance of any dissection of the cloacal common channel. Surgery on the genital tracts included drainage of hydrocolpos, perineal surgery for low vaginae and abdominoperineal vaginoplasty for high vaginae in the peripubertal period with or without bowel supplementation. Spontaneous voiding was maintained in 17 of 25 (68 %) Group I girls (including one death later from intestinal complications), 7 of 13 (54 %), Group IIA girls, and 1 of 5 (20 %) Group IIB girls. Painless menstruation was noted in eight postpubertal girls, three through the cloacal channel (awaiting reconstruction) and five through the reconstructed vagina. Most of the children are on a bowel management program for fecal cleanliness with washouts through the neoanus or Malone's stoma. Conclusion: We report a nonconventional approach to cloaca based on avoiding dissection of or around the common channel for urethrovaginal reconstruction, opting for mitrofanoff stoma for intermittent catheterization, when needed, and late vaginal reconstruction. We believe this approach has reduced the overall need for intermittent catheterization...|$|E
