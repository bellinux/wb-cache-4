The mechanism by which acute pain may become chronic and refractory to treatment is poorly understood. Interventional pain therapies such as radiofrequency (RF) treatment and spinal cord stimulation (SCS) are directed towards interrupting the afferent nociceptive input or modulating the <b>upward</b> <b>transmission</b> of these signals within the dorsal horn {{at the level of}} the spinal cord. These technologies are efficacious in select neuropathic pain syndromes and in denervating arthritic joints although their precise mechanism of action is unclear. Recent pre-clinical research has implicated glial activation and neuroinimune mediators in the pathophysiology of chronic pain...|$|E

This paper examines the role {{of education in the}} reproduction of labour market inequalities through the mechanisms of class, gender, and race-ethnicity. Both functionalist and conflict perspectives will be applied to explain the purpose of formal schooling, and signaling theory will be used to explain the significance of academic qualifications in the labour market. Ultimately, the examination of these mechanisms demonstrates how the hidden curriculum of schooling lends itself to the reproduction rather than the <b>upward</b> <b>transmission</b> of social mobility. The ruling class maintains its privilege in the labour market through a system that falsely promotes the ideas of equal opportunity and meritocracy in education...|$|E

However, the TM 0 mode waves suffer geometrical attenuation causing the intensity at low latitude {{to be less}} than 10 percent of the source field (Kikuchi and Araki 1979). Because of the geometrical attenuation, the ionospheric currents depending on the ionospheric conductivity are too weak to cause the PI at low latitude (Fig.  10). However, the electric field is strong enough to be detected by the HF Doppler sounder (Kikuchi 1986). The electric field associated with the ionospheric currents is transmitted by the Alfven wave upward into the F-region ionosphere and the inner magnetosphere (Kikuchi 2014), which leads to the coherent variations of the ground magnetic field and ionospheric motion at the geomagnetic equator, as observed by the HF Doppler sounders (Abdu et al. 1988) and by the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar (Kikuchi et al. 2003). The <b>upward</b> <b>transmission</b> of the Poynting flux into the inner magnetosphere has been observed by the satellites (Nishimura et al. 2010), causing the quick development of the electric field in the inner magnetosphere (Nishimura et al. 2009), ring current (Hashimoto et al. 2002), and so on.|$|E
40|$|The flow {{of advice}} from parents to their {{children}} has been explored by developmental psychologists, producing important insights into child development and parent-child relationships (Barber, 1994; Tucker, Barber, & Eccles, 2001; McDowell, Parke, & Wang, 2003). Interestingly, the flow of advice in the opposite direction, from children to their parents, has not received attention from researchers. This study explores (a) the frequency of <b>upward</b> advice <b>transmission</b> and (b) the type of advice (solicited or unsolicited) that is transmitted. In particular, {{we look at the}} effects of gender-parent-gender and child-gender, as well as their interaction-on upward advice giving in family systems. Findings indicate a robust effect of parent-gender; adolescents and young adults gave significantly more advice to their mothers than to their fathers. No child-gender effect was found for frequency of upward advice giving; sons and daughters did not significantly differ in the frequency of advice giving to their parents. A trend approaching significance was found for the interaction of parent-gender and child-gender. Significantly more unsolicited advice was given to parents than solicited advice. No three-way interaction was found between child-gender, parent-gender, and type of advice. Implications of these findings for theories of (1) parent-child relationship, (2) individual development, and (3) the development of <b>upward</b> advice <b>transmission</b> in family systems are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Advice {{is often}} given by {{individuals}} who have greater experience, expertise, and wisdom, {{in order to help}} someone with less experience, expertise, or wisdom in decision making and problem solving. In many cases, the advisor also possesses formal authority, power, and position. In these cases, advice flows downwards from those with greater formal authority to those with less formal authority. In this paper, the opposite phenomenon is explored: <b>upward</b> advice <b>transmission.</b> The study of the flow of advice from a person with less formal authority to a person with greater formal authority-for example, a formal leader in an organization-provides an important new perspective on advice, particularly for those interested in empowerment in organizations. This paper reviews the empirical and theoretical literature addressing advice transmission and examines advice transmission in the context of formal hierarchical relationships. It then identifies and describes the key variables which research in related literatures suggests might be profitably studied to enhance the research and practical understanding of <b>upward</b> advice <b>transmission</b> in organizations. Variables in five categories-characteristics of the leader, characteristics of the follower, characteristics of the leader-follower relationship, characteristics of the advice, and organizational structural characteristics of the leader-follower relationship-are considered. Directions for research and applications to practice are discussed. ...|$|R

Few decisions in organizational contexts, however, are structured like juries. The need in organizational contexts for accountability and speed generally means that hierarchical authorities make decisions, typically after receiving input from a staff or subordinates or other informed parties (Humphrey, Hollenbeck, Meyer, & Ilgen, 2002). Given this context, the aim of this work redeems to giving a broad set of concepts related to a particular case of advice taking, which is <b>upward</b> advice <b>transmission</b> in organizations, which affects in performance feedback through mechanisms of self-defense, like self-enhancement. To achieve this, an extensive literature review is done from general terms to more particular ones, defining processes as Decision Making, Advice Transmission, the particular case of <b>Upward</b> Advice <b>Transmission</b> (UAT) and some mechanisms that may make this phenomenon more difficult to happen, essentially, the one described as self-enhancement. This work provides the theoretical bases for future research in a subject that has been undertaken and understudied, especially in a context where most organizations are interested in empowerment.

However, {{the degree of}} coupling of surface deformation and mantle flow is unclear. The use of SKS waves seismic anisotropy shows a coherence of mantle and surface deformation, but significant examples depart from this scenario. We review geological observations and present kinematic reconstructions of the Aegean and Middle East and 3 D numerical models to discuss the role of asthenospheric flow in crustal deformation. At {{the scale of the}} Mediterranean backarcs, lithosphere-mantle coupling is effective below the most extended regions as shown by the alignment of SKS fast orientations and stretching directions in MCCs. In the Aegean, the directions of mantle flow, crustal stretching and GPS velocities are almost parallel, while, below {{the main part of the}} Anatolian plate, SKS fast orientations are oblique to GPS velocities. When considering the long-term geological history of the Tethyan convergent, one can conclude that asthenospheric flow has been an important player. The case of Himalaya and Tibet strongly supports a major contribution of a northward asthenospheric push, with no persistent slab that could drive India after collision, large thrust planes being then decoupling zones between deep convection and surface tectonics. The African plate repeatedly fragmented during its migration, with rifting of large pieces of continents that had then been moving northward faster than Africa (Apulia, Arabia). This also suggests a dominant role of an underlying flow at large scale, dragging and mechanically eroding plates and breaking them into fragments, then passively carried. Mantle flow thus seems to be able to carry plates toward subduction zones, break-away pieces of plates, and deform backarc upper crust where the lithosphere is the thinnest. Most numerical models of lithospheric deformation are designed such that strain is a consequence of kinematic boundary conditions (push or pull on lateral sides), and rarely account for basal stresses due to mantle flow. On the other hand, convection models often treat the lithosphere as a single-layer stagnant lid with vertically undeformable surface. There is thus a gap between convection models and lithospheric-scale geodynamic models. We test different degrees of coupling using 3 -D lithospheric deformation models. Preliminary results suggest that lithosphere can be carried by asthenospheric flow, which may lead to plate fragmentation, especially if this flow is applied on a large surface and involves mantle upwelling. However, the presence of a ductile lower crust inhibits the <b>upward</b> <b>transmission</b> of stresses. A highly extended crust in a hot environment such as a backarc domain, with no lithospheric mantle and a ductile lower crust in direct contact with asthenosphere, is more prone to follow the mantle flow than a thick and stratified lithosphere...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 19 th century, the {{territorial}} presence of the French state administration has been embodied by the Prefect, heading an apparatus structured at the département level. However, the unity of that local government, personified by this high-ranking civil servant, is actually a legal fiction. In point of fact, the vertical integration of the French administration {{goes hand in hand with}} pronounced horizontal compartmentalization, the outcome of methodical, increasingly thorough segmentation of its action in the post-war decades, as its fields of intervention were extended. The state's territorial administration may in fact be seen as a complex whole comprised of executive branches, departments, agencies and agents, whose missions are a combination of authoritarian acts, checks on legality, political and economic regulation, production of public property and community service. This whole, peopled by the majority of government workers (with 966, 000 employees in 2007, not counting the huge Education department, or twenty times the central administration personnel) received little attention until recently from French political scientists, who viewed them as simple go-betweens in the downward transmission of national rules, uniformly applied to the entire French territory. This legalistic vision was demolished in the late sixties by sociologists from the Center for sociology of organizations led by Michel Crozier, who pointed up the interdependence between employees of the administration's local services, rooted in their territory, and local elected officials. The latter's action was entirely dependent on the resources controlled by the former, and in return, state bureaucrats needed the legitimacy afforded by the local elected officials so as to implement the policies entrusted to them and to maintain a degree of independence from their superiors. Until the 1982 - 83 decentralization laws, then, state field agencies played a pivotal role in political and social regulation by safeguarding a combination of the interests of the center and those of the periphery. The state's territorial administration, unsettled by those laws, had to adjust to the changed environment, and showed remarkable resiliency in doing so. The 1964 administrative reforms had structured it around regional administration services and broad département-level executive branches, and that structure had remained virtually unchanged for nearly a half-century. But, with the constant cuts in its resources (its authority, expertise, budgets, and so on), the mounting power of local authorities, the multiplication of participants in public action, and the development of new, complex public problems crossing the lines of administrative purviews, its role had changed substantially. These changes have deprived the Prefects and state field agencies of their central role in territorial governance. Nonetheless, deconcentrated administrative services have succeeded in holding their ground on the local scene by shifting to a dual function including the territorialization of national polices and the facilitating of local partnerships. This repositioning was made possible by the deconcentration policy implemented in 1992, which reinforced the autonomy of the state field agencies with respect to the central administration. Henceforth, rather than applying norms and rules defined disconnectedly, they could adjust them, systematically negotiating goals, types of action, and even the rules, with local actors, and above all with sub-national public authorities. Marginalized with respect to defining both the goals and the substance of public policies, the state's territorial administration has developed a new role, that of facilitator of cooperation between the numerous actors working in territorial communities, backed up by projects and contractual relations at that level, both of which replace the previous regime of implicit arrangements by explicit (if not to say open) negotiation between the prefects and local elected officials. At the same time, they have made for a degree of transverse integration of government policies around priorities as defined by local authorities. The organizational stability and functional lability previously characteristic of the state's territorial administration seem to be things of the past. Institutional reform in the 2000 s, with its more binding forms of inter-communal cooperation, more complete decentralization, budget reforms, and agencification, have accelerated the weakening of state's field agencies with respect to both local authorities and the central administration. This paved the way for a broad-based reform of these agencies, begun in 2008 with the Overall Revision of Public Policies (Révision générale des politiques publiques). This reform, motivated by the twofold objective of reducing public spending and reinforcing coordinated government action at the local level, reshapes the perimeter, organization and responsibilities of state's territorial administration. The respective missions of the regional and départemental levels are clearly defined, with priority given to the former, charged with steering government programs and managing deconcentrated budgets to do so. The powers of regional prefects are extended, particularly with respect to département prefects, now accountable to them. Last, a far-reaching program for merging state's field agencies has been implemented so as to structure the administration around eight regional poles and two or three directorates at the département level. These reforms are definite indication that the central reformers have won out. They are the people who have been trying to strengthen the regional level of the administration since 1964, but whose attempts have systematically met with resistance from both the prefectural corps and local elected officials. The current bolstering of the regional level, however noteworthy, is only relatively so, in relation to the département level formerly the basic echelon of territorial administration by the central government, and which has always been the most solidly structured, acting in collaboration with local actors to make government policies operational. This evolution unquestionably marks a major change in the French political and administrative system, possibly even foreshadowing the gradual elimination of the département level. As opposed to the aftermaths of the 1982 - 83 decentralization laws, drastic cuts are now being made in the personnel and facilities of all département-level executive branches. In the deconcentrated Equipment services for instance, the number of workers, which had remained stable between 1984 and 2005, dropped by one third between 2007 and 2009. However, the declining local presence of the central administration does not imply a loss of influence on the policies conducted there. Despite the risk that the central administration will cease to be central to public management of territorial communities, there is also the possibility that these reforms may revivify its ability to orient local policy. Because département-level executive branches were better at <b>upward</b> <b>transmission,</b> setting the projects of local elected officials ahead of central priorities, than the reverse. Now rid of those cumbersome go-betweens, the state elites can govern from afar - that is, from Paris - by delegating responsibility for implementing its programs and achieving coherence to local elected officials while steering their action precisely through new tools of government such as competitive bidding, financial incitement and sanctions, completed by systems of indicators, reporting, benchmarking, and the encouragement of good practices, all the more efficient in that they no longer rest on hierarchy or negotiation, but on freely conforming autonomous actors. Depuis le début du XIXe siècle, la présence de l'Etat dans les territoires s'incarne dans la figure du Préfet, placé à la tête d'une administration structurée à l'échelle départementale. L'unité de l'Etat local, personnifiée par ce haut fonctionnaire, relève cependant de la fiction juridique. L'intégration verticale de l'administration française s'accompagne en effet d'un fort cloisonnement horizontal, résultant d'une segmentation historique de son organisation et de son action qui s'est approfondie dans les décennies d'après-guerre à mesure de l'extension de ses domaines d'intervention. L'Etat local est constitué d'un ensemble complexe de directions, de services, d'agences et d'agents, dont les missions combinent des actes régaliens, de contrôle de légalité, de régulation politique ou économique, de production de biens publics et de prestations de services. Réunissant le gros des troupes étatiques (966 000 agents hors Education en 2007, soit vingt fois plus que les effectifs des administrations centrales), ces services chargés de mettre en œuvre des politiques publiques décidées à l'échelon central ont longtemps été au cœur du modèle républicain d'administration du territoire. Les lois de décentralisation de 1982 - 83 ont marqué la fin de ce modèle. Bien que fortement affaibli par les transferts opérés vers les collectivités (communes, départements, régions) et la disparition de la tutelle qu'il exerçait sur ces dernières, l'Etat local est parvenu à conserver un rôle important, sinon prééminent, dans la gestion publique des territoires au cours des décennies 1980 et 1990. L'Acte II de la décentralisation et les réformes néomanagériales du début des années 2000 ont fortement accéléré le mouvement de déclin amorcé vingt ans plus tôt. L'administration territoriale de l'Etat, dont l'organisation était restée pratiquement inchangée depuis les réformes administratives de 1964, est désormais engagée dans une vaste opération de réorganisation, dont on voit mal comment elle pourrait inverser une tendance à la résidualisation des services déconcentrés...|$|E

Downward irradiance spectra were variable near the surface, but with increases in depth transmission peaks at 510, 560 and 570 nanometres (nm) became apparent in Thingvallavatn, Myvatn-East Basin and Myvatn-South Basin respectively. <b>Upward</b> irradiance <b>transmission</b> maxima shifted from 480 to 500 nm with depth in Thingvallavatn, while in Myvatn they remained near 570 nm. An irradiance trough at 520 nm was noted in both the upward and downward spectra of Thingvallavatn. The importance of phytoplankton (chlorophyll) and gilvin in mcdiiing the underwater light climate of Myvatn is clearly demonstrated.

40|$|Climate {{variability}} in the tropical Atlantic Ocean is determined by large-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions, which particularly affect deep atmospheric convection over the ocean and surrounding continents 1. Apart from influences from the Pacific El Niño/Southern Oscillation 2 and the North Atlantic Oscillation 3, the tropical Atlantic variability {{is thought to be}} dominated by two distinct ocean–atmosphere coupled modes of variability that are characterized by meridional 4, 5 and zonal 6, 7 sea-surface-temperature gradients and are mainly active on decadal and interannual timescales, respectively 8, 9. Here we report evidence that the intrinsic ocean dynamics of the deep equatorial Atlantic can also affect sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall in the tropical Atlantic region and constitutes a 4. 5 -yr climate cycle. Specifically, vertically alternating deep zonal jets of short vertical wavelength with a period of about 4. 5 [*]yr and amplitudes of more than 10 [*]cm[*]s− 1 are observed, in the deep Atlantic, to propagate their energy upwards, towards the surface 10, 11. They are linked, at the sea surface, to equatorial zonal current anomalies and eastern Atlantic temperature anomalies that have amplitudes of about 6 [*]cm[*]s− 1 and 0. 4 [*]°C, respectively, and are associated with distinct wind and rainfall patterns. Although deep jets are also observed in the Pacific 12 and Indian 13 oceans, only the Atlantic deep jets seem to oscillate on interannual timescales. Our knowledge of the persistence and regularity of these jets is limited by the availability of high-quality data. Despite this caveat, the oscillatory behaviour can still be used to improve predictions of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} {{the results of the}} {{combined}} analyses of ocean bottom seismometer and multi-channel seismic reflection data collection offshore southwestern Taiwan, with respect to the presence of gas hydrates and free gas within the accretionary wedge sediments. Estimates of the compressional velocities along EW 9509 - 33 seismic reflection profile are obtained by a series of pre-stack depth migrations in a layer stripping streamlined Deregowski loop. Strong BSR is imaged over most of the reflection pro-file while low velocity zones are imaged below BSR at several locations. Amplitude versus angle analysis that are performed within the pre-stack depth migration processes reveal strong negative P-impedance {{near the bottom of the}} hydrate stability zone, com-monly underlain by sharp positive P impedance layers associated with negative pseudo-Poisson attribute areas, indicating the pres-ence of free gas below the BSR. Ray tracing of the acoustic arrivals with a model derived from the migration velocities generally fits the vertical and hydrophone records of the four ocean-bottom seismographs (OBS). In order to estimate the Poisson’s ratios in the shallow sediments at the vicinity of the OBSs, we analyze the mode-converted arrivals in the wide-angle horizontal component. P-S mode converted reflections are dominant, while <b>upward</b> P-S <b>transmissions</b> are observed at large offsets.

40|$|MSc (Clinical Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This is a {{secondary}} research study and {{is part of}} a broader project on the relational experiences between older persons and younger people. The focus of this study is on the nature of intergenerational transmission from the perspective of older persons. Intergenerational transmission is the process by which knowledge, resources and support are transferred between generations. In terms of the current study, a specific focus was not undertaken as it was the intention to determine what would emanate from the data. Transmission can take place through teaching, observation, modelling and story-telling. This process can take place both from the older to the younger generation (downwards) and from the younger to the older generation (upwards). Downward transmission from older to younger persons may serve to satisfy the need for generativity, according to the lifespan development theory. A generative need is associated with the desire to teach and mentor the younger generation and to pass on a positive legacy. Intergenerational transmission is also facilitated if generational members adopt the perspective of the generational other, according to generational intelligence theory. This research is motivated by the observation that previous studies had for the most part been conducted internationally, with little focus on intergenerational transmission. Effective intergenerational relationships and transmission have the potential to fulfil the needs both of the younger and the older generations and therefore merit investigation. Secondary data were used for this research. Data from an original study that focused on the relational experiences of older persons in relation to young adults were used. The orginal study included a sample of 18 (7 men and 11 women) older persons from the Service Centre in Potchefstroom. They were aged between 60 and 84 and were either Afrikaans- or English-speaking. Inclusion criteria also stated that the older persons had to function independently and not demonstrate any visible cognitive disability. Previous particpation in research on relational experiences with younger generations was an exclusion criterion. Data were obtained by means of the Mmogo-method®. This is a visual research method that is based on projection. Participants are provided with materials such as clay, straws and colourful beads. Based on an open-ended prompt, namely to show how they experience their relationships with persons younger than 25, visual and textual data were obtained. Secondary data analyses were conducted by using sequential and visual analysis to explore the nature of transmission from the perspective of older persons. Trustworthiness was ensured during data analysis by various methods. Conceptual coherence of the topic was ensured by using literature to support the research question and themes that emerged from the data analysis. The method of data gathering was chosen with the specific intention of attaining rich personal perspectives as well as a collective experience from participants, thus ensuring data saturation. The researcher also attempted to demonstrate integrity and transparency throughout the process by providing a clear and detailed audit trail. Both <b>upward</b> and downward <b>transmissions</b> were perceived by the older generation as being present. Both these transmissions were described as being conditionally dependent. Conditions included age, competency, regular contact, using a person-centred approach and transferring knowledge in a systematic manner. Specific commodities were transmitted from the older persons to the younger people and vice versa. The older persons transmitted skills, emotional and physical care, values and the teachings of their heritage. The older persons, in their turn, experienced young people as transferring knowledge about technology and new innovations as well as positive attitudes to their elders. Some of the older people described how they used prescriptive methods when transmitting to the younger generation whereas others felt that more faciltative methods were more effective. The older generation experienced the response of the younger generation to downward transmission as either receptive or resistant. Descriptions of their motivation for transmission to the younger generation indicated that it might be generativity or a feeling of obligation. Findings from this study could be used to facilitate programmes that promote intergenerational relationships and transmission. Findings may also be valuable in terms of stimulating further research enquiry. Master...|$|R
