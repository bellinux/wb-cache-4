5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Stalin {{repeatedly}} {{proposed a}} plan to unify East and West Germany <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations if the new Germany were {{to stay out of}} Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers.

Ikata's performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-15th century, organs had no stop controls. Each manual {{controlled}} ranks {{at multiple}} pitches, {{known as the}} Blockwerk. Around 1450, controls were designed that allowed {{the ranks of the}} Blockwerk to be played individually. These devices were the forerunners of modern stop actions. The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained grouped together <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Brazil in 1915, {{for the purpose of}} capturing more birds for the zoo. This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Each {{chemical}} element {{has a unique}} atomic number (Z) representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{there had}} been rapid {{political}} development in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and by 630, he had successfully united most of the Arabia <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> political authority. When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was elected Caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, when several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr, who declared war against the rebels. In {{what became known as}} the Ridda wars of 632–633, Abu Bakr managed to unite Arabia under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina.|$|E

5|$|Oswald {{was the son}} of Æthelfrith of Bernicia {{and came}} to rule after {{spending}} a period in exile. After defeating the British ruler Cadwallon ap Cadfan, Oswald brought the two Northumbrian kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira once again <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> ruler, and promoted the spread of Christianity in Northumbria. He was given a strongly positive assessment by the historian Bede, writing a little less than a century after Oswald's death, who regarded Oswald as a saintly king; it is also Bede who is the main source for present-day historical knowledge of Oswald. After eight years of rule, in which he was the most powerful ruler in Britain, Oswald was killed in the Battle of Maserfield.|$|E

In 1860, the British split the area into South Kanara and North Kanara, the former being retained in the Madras Presidency, while the latter was made a part of Bombay Province in 1862. Kundapur taluk was earlier included in North Kanara but was re-included in South Kanara later.|$|E
5|$|The Theban plays {{consist of}} three plays: Oedipus Rex (also called Oedipus Tyrannus or Oedipus the King), Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. All three plays concern {{the fate of}} Thebes {{during and after the}} reign of King Oedipus. They have often been {{published}} <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> cover. Sophocles, however, wrote the three plays for separate festival competitions, many years apart. Not only are the Theban plays not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative) but they are not even an intentional series and contain some inconsistencies among them. He also wrote other plays having to do with Thebes, such as the Epigoni, of which only fragments have survived.|$|E

When the Gulf Cartel's top leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested in early September 2012, Ramírez Treviño decided to step up for the job and become the undisputed leader of the cartel. In efforts to keep the Gulf Cartel <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> command structure, he ordered the assassination of high-ranking drug trafficker El Metro 4 on 15 January 2013 in Reynosa. His death, however, sparked a turf war.|$|E
5|$|Turan-Shah {{drove out}} the Hamdanid rulers of Sana'a, conquering the mountainous city in 1175. With {{the conquest of}} Yemen, the Ayyubids {{developed}} a coastal fleet, al-asakir al-bahriyya, which they used to guard the sea coasts under their control and protect them from pirate raids. The conquest held great significance for Yemen because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana'a) <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> power. However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in Yemen in 1176, uprisings {{broke out in the}} territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of Yemen.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of William, Lord of Glamorgan, his {{extensive}} holdings were eventually granted to Gilbert de Clare in 1217. The subjugation of Glamorgan, begun by Fitzhamon, was finally completed by the powerful De Clare family, but although Gilbert de Clare had now {{become one of the}} great Marcher Lords the territory was far from settled. Hywel ap Maredudd, lord of Meisgyn captured his cousin Morgan ap Cadwallon and annexed Glynrhondda in an attempt to reunify the commotes <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> native ruler.

5|$|A long-running {{dispute between}} the Archbishops of Canterbury and York flared up under Anselm's successor, Ralph d'Escures. Canterbury, {{traditionally}} the senior of the two establishments, had long argued that the Archbishop of York should formally promise to obey their Archbishop, but York argued that the two episcopates were independent within the English Church and that no such promise was necessary. Henry supported the primacy of Canterbury, to ensure that England remained <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> ecclesiastical administration, but the Pope preferred the case of York. The matter was complicated by Henry's personal friendship with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, and the King's desire that the case should not {{end up in a}} papal court, beyond royal control. Henry badly needed the support of the Papacy in his struggle with Louis of France, however, and therefore allowed Thurstan to attend the Council of Rheims in 1119, where Thurstan was then consecrated by the Pope with no mention of any duty towards Canterbury. Henry believed that this went against assurances Thurstan had previously made and exiled him from England until the King and Archbishop came to a negotiated solution the following year.|$|E

In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other {{to prevent them from}} starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.|$|E
5|$|Ashina Zhong, {{the brother}} of She'er, {{also served as a}} Turkic general of the Tang Dynasty, and was a {{participant}} in a military performance hosted by Emperor Gaozong in 655.

During his reign, the Turkic tribes were unified <b>under</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> leader. Emperor Gaozong, Taizong's successor, dispatched a military expedition in 657 against Helu, who had been raiding Tang settlements. The campaign was led by the general Su Dingfang and the Turkic commanders Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen, who were opposed to Helu. Helu was defeated and captured by the Tang forces, and the territories annexed from the Western Turks were placed under Tang governance through the Anxi Protectorate.|$|E
