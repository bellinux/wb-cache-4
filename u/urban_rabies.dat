40|$|Rabies is {{currently}} enzootic {{in many cities}} of southern Ontario. The Ministry of Natural Resources is utilizing two different tactics for the control of <b>rabies</b> in <b>urban</b> wildlife <b>rabies</b> vectors-oral immunization with baits (foxes) and vaccination by injection following live-capture (skunks and raccoons). Between 47 and 79 % of the skunks and 61 and 76 % of the raccoons were captured and vaccinated (Imrab) in a 60 -km 2 urban area of Metropolitan Toronto during 1987, 1989. Only three cases of rabies in skunks have been reported since control began in 1987. Population increases of 120 % for skunks and 40 % for raccoons were noted since the rabies control program was initiated.

Only 33. 5 % of the interviewees felt that people in the community had a role to play in controlling the stray dog population. Gender, age and educational status were significantly associated with rabies awareness.

40|$|The current rabies {{situation}} in Europe is probably unprecedented in history. Large parts of Western, Northern and Central Europe are officially recognized as free from terrestrial rabies. This achievement {{is the result}} of stepwise intensive efforts to control and eliminate both urban (canine) and sylvatic (wildlife-mediated) rabies. Although canine rabies was yet successfully controlled using strict implementation of hygienic measures in several European countries {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, Europe-wide elimination was accomplished by registration and mass vaccination of dogs in the 1970 s. In contrast, the emergence of fox rabies in the 1940 s as a result of a transition from <b>urban</b> to sylvatic <b>rabies</b> posed a new challenge and required fundamental changes in rabies control policies. Early attempts to control fox rabies aiming at a drastic decimation of the fox population to interrupt the infectious cycle failed and were suggested as counterproductive. The increasing rabies incidence required alternative rabies control methods. In 1970 s, the concept of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) offered a new perspective for rabies control in wildlife.

However, the effectiveness of culling free-roaming dogs to control <b>urban</b> <b>rabies</b> has not been evaluated. Objective to determine the effectiveness of free-roaming dog culling as a control measure of <b>urban</b> <b>rabies.</b> Source of data: We searched for articles on dog rabies control or <b>urban</b> <b>rabies</b> control in the databases of PubMed, Scopus and LILACS. The characteristics and results of the documents obtained were recorded. Eligibility criteria: We included original studies and reviews that have evaluated an effect of culling dogs in the transmission of RV. Data collection and evaluation: One of the authors (RCN) screened the articles found in the search based on their titles and abstracts. The data and results of the articles selected for full reading were evaluated by at least two authors. Results: 21 articles were eligible for full reading. 20 of 21 articles conclude that free-roaming dog culling is ineffective in reducing the transmission of RV and may even have unintended consequences that worsen the problem. We believe that the available evidence indicates that the sacrifice of free-roaming dogs is not effective to control <b>urban</b> <b>rabies.</b> In addition, the various negative consequences of free-roaming dog culling reported in other parts of the world suggest that the system of <b>urban</b> <b>rabies</b> is highly complex and all its components must be taken into account during the implementation of control activities.

40|$|Abstract. Twenty-eight {{samples from}} humans and {{domestic}} and wild animals collected in Mexico between 1990 and 1995 {{were characterized by}} using anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies and limited sequence analysis of the nucleoprotein gene. The variants of rabies viruses identified in these samples were compared with other isolates from Mexico {{and the rest of}} the Americas to establish epidemiologic links between cases and outbreaks and to increase the understanding of rabies epidemiology in the Western Hemisphere. Antigenic and genetic diversity was found in all samples from dogs and dog-related cases, suggesting a long-term endemic situation with multiple, independent cycles of virus transmission. Two isolates from bobcats were antigenically and genetically homologous to the rabies variant circulating in the Arizona gray fox population, indicating a wider distribution of this variant than previously reported. Rabies isolates from skunks were unrelated to any variant analyzed in this study and represent a previously unrecognized cycle of rabies transmission in skunks in Baja California Sur. Two antigenic and genetic variants co-circulating in southern and eastern Mexico were found in viruses obtained from cases epidemiologically related to vampire bats. These results serve as a baseline for the better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of <b>rabies</b> in Mexico. <b>Urban</b> and sylvatic <b>rabies</b> is an important public health and economic problem in Latin America.

40|$|Animal control {{measures}} in Latin America have decreased {{the incidence of}} <b>urban</b> human <b>rabies</b> transmitted by dogs and cats; currently most cases of human rabies are transmitted by bats. In 2004 - 2005, rabies outbreaks in populations living in rural Brazil prompted widespread vaccination of exposed and at-risk populations. More than 3, 500 inhabitants of Augusto Correa (Pará State) received either post-exposure (PEP) or pre-exposure (PrEP) prophylaxis. This study evaluated the persistence of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) annually for 4 years post-vaccination. The aim was to evaluate the impact of rabies PrEP and PEP in a population at risk living in a rural setting to help improve management of vampire bat exposure and provide additional data {{on the need for}} booster vaccination against rabies. This prospective study was conducted in 2007 through 2009 in a population previously vaccinated in 2005; study participants were followed-up annually. An RVNA titer > 0. 5 International Units (IU) /mL was chosen as the threshold of seroconversion. Participants with titers ≤ 0. 5 IU/mL or Equivalent Units (EU) /mL at enrollment or at subsequent annual visits received booster doses of purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV). Adherence of the participants from this Amazonian community to the study protocol was excellent, with 428 of the 509 (84 %) who attended the first interview in 2007 returning for the final visit in 2009. The long-term RVNA persistence was good, with 85 - 88. 0 % of the non-boosted participants evaluated at each yearly follow-up visit remaining seroconverted. Similar RVNA persistence profiles were observed in participants originally given PEP or PrEP in 2005, and the GMT of the study population remained > 1 IU/mL 4 years after vaccination. At the end of the study, 51 subjects (11. 9 % of the interviewed population) had received at least one dose of booster since their vaccination in 2005.

40|$|Known {{since the}} ancient times, the rabies is an acute {{infection}} of {{the central nervous system}} that affects mammals, caused by an RNA virus of the Rhabidoviridae family, Lyssavirus gender. Since the implantation of the <b>urban</b> area <b>rabies</b> control program in Brazil the number of cases in dogs and human have shown a decrease. In Cuiabá, the efforts to control the rabies, such as animal vaccination, focus isolation, capture of nomad animals and others realized by the Zoonosis Control Center has leaded to locking in the viral circulation in the canine species. Since 2008, zero cases of the disease in dogs were reported. In order to know the temporal distribution of canine rabies in Cuiabá - MT and identify the epidemiologic aspects of the rabies's infected dogs, and verify the canine rabies's profilatic actions of the Zoonosis Control Center of the city of Cuiabá, during the period of January, 2002 to December, 2008, the present study was performed. The historic data base from Cuiabá - MT was obtained at the Zoonosis Control Center and at the Animal Health Support Laboratory and used to perform the descriptive and observational study. During the performance of the study, 1021 samples of canine's brains were examined, 8, 71 % (89 / 1021) of them were positive and 91, 29 % (932 / 1021) of them were negative for the rabies test. The Months with higher incidence were January with 15, 05 % (14 / 93), February with 12, 5 % (9 / 72), March with 12, 5 % (9 / 72), April with 14, 14 % (9 / 72) and December with 13, 69 % (10 / 73).

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{incidence}} of human infection with rabies virus (RABV) spread by the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) increased considerably in South America, especially {{in remote areas}} of the Amazon rainforest, where these bats commonly feed on humans. To better understand the epizootiology of rabies associated with vampire bats, we used complete sequences of the nucleoprotein gene to infer phylogenetic relationships among 157 RABV isolates collected from humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, including bats, in Peru during 2002 – 2007. This analysis revealed distinct geographic structuring that indicates that RABVs spread gradually and involve different vampire bat subpopulations with different transmission cycles. Three putative new RABV lineages were found in 3 non–vampire bat species that may represent new virus reservoirs. Detection of novel RABV variants and accurate identification of reservoir hosts are critically important for the prevention and control of potential virus transmission, especially to humans. Rabies virus (RABV; family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus) is a bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negativesense RNA virus with a 12 -kb genome that encodes 5 structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein, matrix protein, glycoprotein, and polymerase (1). Over the course of its evolutionary history, RABV has established independent transmission cycles in diverse species of mesocarnivores and bats. Rabies disease remains a serious public health concern in several countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, where it is estimated that> 50, 000 fatal infections occur annually (2).

The dogs which consisted of 850 males and 628 females were presented at the Small Animal and Preventive Veterinary Medicine Clinics, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Ibadan between January 1993 and December 2002. Among the registered dogs, 155 (10. 5 %) with annual mean of 9. 1 + 9. 1 % were vaccinated. Although more females (83 or 13. 2 %) were vaccinated than male dogs (72 or 8. 5 %), {{the difference was not}} significant (p> 0. 05). Most vaccinated dogs (121 or 78. 1 %), were at the initial vaccination age of 3 months and had the highest vaccination coverage (51 dogs (males and females) or 44. 3 %) while 53 (males and females) dogs (43. 8 %) were adequately vaccinated. Also, 12 (35. 3 %) among 34 dogs with booster vaccination were adequately protected against rabies. The current study showed increase in registration of dogs and the cost of vaccination in the clinics. However declined vaccination and booster coverages were observed compared to the previous 5 – year observations of 36. 5 % vaccination and 59. 5 % booster coverages.

40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of rabies in dogs in Zimbabwe {{is described}} {{using data from}} 1950, when rabies was re-introduced after a 37 -year absence, to 1996. Dogs constituted 45, 7 % of all laboratory-confirmed rabies cases and were the species most frequently diagnosed with the disease. Slightly more cases were diagnosed from June to November than in other months. From 1950 to the early 1980 s, most dog cases were recorded from commercial farming areas, but since the early 1980 s most have been recorded from communal (subsistence farming) areas. This change appears {{to be due to}} improved surveillance in communal areas and not to any change in the prevalence of rabies. Dog rabies therefore appears to be maintained mainly in communal area dog populations, particularly the large communal area blocks. <b>Urban</b> <b>rabies</b> was not important except in the city of Mutare. Where dog rabies prevalence was high, the disease was cyclic with periods between peak prevalence ranging from 4 - 7 years. Dog rabies cases were, on the whole, independent of jackal rabies and rabies in other carnivores. There was a significant negative relationship between the annual number of rabies vaccine doses administered nationally to dogs and the annual number of dog rabies cases lagged by one year, indicating that the past levels of immunisation coverage have had a significant effect on the number of rabies cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Describe the {{epidemiology}} {{and the control}} effort for rabies in Ecuador. METHODS: This observational study included data from the Ecuadorian National Institute of Census and Statistics (INEC), and mortality and morbidity data reported by the Ministry of Public Health and the National Institute for Social Security. We conducted a phylogeny analyses to compare the N gene from the Challenge Virus Standard (CVS) vaccine strain used in Ecuador with published Cosmopolitan, Asian and Sylvatic strains. Descriptive and inferential statistics {{were used to determine}} the significance of the data. RESULTS: In 1996 Ecuador suffered the highest rate of rabies per capita in the Americas, with an incidence rate of 0. 56 cases per 100 000 people per year. Human and canine rabies showed a sharp decline until 2012. Between 1994 and 2014, we found a correlation of 0. 925 (p< 0. 01) between annual cases of dog and human rabies. In 2011, there was an epidemic of sylvatic rabies transmitted to people by vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in the Amazon region, specifically in Morona Santiago, leading to 11 fatalities. Phylogenetic analyses of the CVS vaccine N gene showed an association with urban canine rabies strains (the Cosmopolitan lineage and Asian strains), whereas sylvatic rabies, like those reported in the Amazon region, were found to be grouped in a different clade represented mainly by bat-derived strains. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first compilation of epidemiological data on rabies in Ecuador. The incidence of human and canine rabies, also known as <b>urban</b> <b>rabies,</b> has clearly decreased due to massive canine vaccination campaigns. Phylogenetic analysis of the prevailing vaccine used in the country showed a clear separation from bat-derived rabies, the source of recent rabies outbreaks.

40|$|Background: rabies is a fatal {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} a highly neurotropic RNA virus which causes neurological signs and that is distributed almost worldwide. Rabies affects domestic and wild animals {{and this is a}} disease transmitted by their bites, through which the virus present in the saliva is inoculated. In Brazil, Desmodus rotundus is the main hematophagous bat species that transmits rabies, especially to herbivores e equines. In equines, the clinical manifestation varies a lot, including both the paralytic and the furious form of the disease. The goal {{of this study is to}} describe a case of equine rabies in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Case: a six-year old male American Quarter Horse, which presented a clinical picture characterized by colic, depraved appetite and difficulty to move, was admitted to the Hospital de Clínicas Veterinárias of Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (HCV-UFRGS). The horse did not respond to treatment, therefore, it was submitted to exploratory laparotomy, when the moderate intestinal constipation and low intestinal motility was observed. A large colon enterotomy was performed and the intestinal contents were partially emptied. During recovery from anesthesia, the animal remained in lateral decubitus, not making any attempt to stand up. The animal did not show a favorable clinical evolution a few hours later, displaying weakness particularly in the hind limbs. Consequently, the animal underwent euthanasia. Samples of body organs were collected and fixed in formol 10 %, processed routinely for histological purposes and then stained by hematoxylin and eosin. The histopathological examination revealed nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis in the central nervous system, without the presence of Negri bodies. Due to the history of recent rabies cases in neighbor areas of the property from where the animal came, direct immunofluorescence (IFD) and immunohistochemical (IHQ) exams for rabies were requested. The result was negative in IFD and a positive immunolabeling was observed in IHQ, thus demonstrating a viral antigen labeling in neurons of the cervical spine, pons, mesencephalon and cerebellum. Discussion: intracytoplasmic inclusions, also known as Negri bodies, are important and pathognomonic findings that were not observed in this case. Its presence and concentration depend on the stage and course of the disease, and they are not present in up to 30 % of rabies cases, because certain virus strains do not produce Negri bodies. In equines, the occurrence of Negri bodies is less frequent than in bovines. IFD is the most adequate rabies diagnosis method, which is a highly sensitive technique (80 - 100 %). The result was negative for this case, being confirmed only by IHQ. The immunohistochemical test is an important laboratorial diagnosis tool of rabies, because it allows the solution of unspecific meningoencephalitis cases when Negri bodies are not present. The treatment of animals with rabies is not considered. Vaccination in endemic regions or in areas where a rabies case has occurred is necessary. Rabies cases near the property where the animal lived were reported, but a prophylactic vaccination was not carried out. Rio Grande do Sul had a peculiar epidemiological status regarding rabies, as <b>urban</b> <b>rabies</b> cases had not been reported for approximately 17 years. However, rabies transmitted by hematophagous bats is still endemic in rural areas. This case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a rabies vaccination schedule in equine properties...|$|E
