500|$|One of the company's first {{forays into}} {{healthier}} products was in 1983 with introduction of its salad bar. The salad bar met with light to moderate success, but the company's franchise holders complained of high operating costs and a poor return on investment. Part of the product, a pita salad, was quickly {{dropped from the}} salad bar, as were plans to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> unit to boost breakfast sales. In 1987 the company augmented its salad bar with a test line of prepackaged salads, including chef and garden salads. The salad bar was eventually eliminated in favor of packaged salads. In 1990, BK introduced a new salad line accompanied by a licensing agreement with Paul Newman's Newman's Own, Inc., whose salad dressings accompanied the products. Burger King revamped its salad line again in 2004, {{with the introduction of}} its Fire Grilled Salad products. Burger King sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings—a choice of grilled shrimp or broiled chicken—separately from the cold salad; this added the appearance of an additional layer of freshness. At one point in the United States, the salads are pre-made off-site. They are sold with two toppings and Ken's Foods Ken's Steakhouse brand salad dressing. Internationally, the salads vary in composition and style from market to market. In all markets, salads are one of the items targeted at female and health-conscious consumers.

5000|$|Water Heaters: Rob {{gives the}} teams {{a lesson in}} {{installing}} a water heater, connecting it to the water lines, and installing a GFCI outlet to power the heater. The Blue Team is given the option of sitting this challenge out since they are guaranteed {{to be in the}} final no matter what, but they decide that the opportunity to attempt the job in this setting is one they shouldn't pass up. The teams each have two hours to complete the job, and must use the spot marked by the experts. The Blue Team quickly become overconfident due to their immunity, and Jesse's carelessness when using the blowtorch results in him causing a small fire, forcing the crew to step in and extinguish it. Their build is immediately shut down, with the experts telling Jesse and Holly that had they not been immune, they would have faced some form of punishment. As for the teams actually competing in the challenge, the Pink Team have easily the most harmonious build, despite Danielle's confusion over the water connections. They finish on-time and the water heater itself works fine, but their shut-off valve turns out to leak. The experts note that it should be a simple fix, but Danielle and Tyler are worried that this small mistake could cost them. Fabian on the Red Team comes dangerously close to causing a fire himself, after getting frustrated while trying to solder the pipes together; nonetheless, their heater works perfectly, with no leaks or any other problems. After a build that is a little less stormy than usual (though Nicole's recommendation that they <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> top for soldering results in them making a huge mess of solder and flux), the Green Team's heater fails to power on. When Helder inspects the GFCI outlet it turns out that Nicole accidentally connected the electrical wires to the outlet's ground terminals. Both she and Jake are devastated by this, realizing that unless one of the other teams messed up even worse, this mistake has likely cost them their place in the competition.|$|E
30|$|The {{procedure}} {{was similar to}} that in Experiment 2, with the following exceptions. Observers were shown 16 pictures. For each, they were asked whether a specific object was inside and selected one of the following answer choices and then indicated their confidence: (1) yes, the object is inside and I can <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> to show you where it is; (2) yes, the object is inside but from the picture I cannot tell where it is; (3) from the picture I cannot tell whether the object is inside; or (4) no, the object is not inside. If Choice 1 was selected, they used the bar with inclinometer to indicate the location of the object. After they had made their selections for all pictures, they were told that the object was inside and asked to guess about the location by orienting the bar.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the nature and extent of {{voluntary}} disclosure of graphical information in the annual reports of 54 non-financial public listed companies in Malaysia using a longitudinal approach. The results show that the disclosure of graphical information in Malaysian companies’ annual reports has increased at an ‘average level’ over the thirty-year period. The majority of Malaysian companies prefer to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> graphs and the most frequently graphed variables are profit, turnover, earnings per share, and shareholders’ fund. The implications of this study are that: a) companies should be aware of the usefulness and advantages of providing graphical information for the benefit of various user groups; b) it may timely for the accounting regulatory bodies to propose a minimum/adequate level of graphical information using selected items of high importance to users of annual reports; and to formulate suitable guidelines in order to standardise the presentation of graphical information in annual reports of companies...|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} industries, {{especially}} the retail sector, <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Code System {{as a principal}} means of identifying items. In a Bar Code System, labels on items must be correctly positioned {{in order to be}} detected and identified by the reader. This often necessitates human intervention (thus effort and time) for the scanning process. The second particularity of this system is that the information we get when scanning labels is a set of data relative to the SKU level properties of the item, which means that actual traditional Bar Code System has often not the storage capacity to hold data on individual properties of each item but data is restricted to some generic product type characteristics (colour, weight, length, volume, etc…) : we know we are seeing a certain type of product but we don't know which product it is. This could be a big issue especially in situations where every product needs to be identified as an unique item. RFID is another technology that uses wireless microchips to create “intelligent tags ” or “electronic data tags”. In order to avoid manual scanning of items, readers can be used to automatically (without human intervention) monitor products every time they flow through them. Contrary to the Bar Code System, RFID tags can contain item level information o...|$|E
