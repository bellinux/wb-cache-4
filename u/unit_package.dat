40|$|The {{geostationary}} Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 1 /M {{series of}} spacecraft are geostationary weather satellites {{that use the}} latest in weather imaging technology. The inertial reference <b>unit</b> <b>package</b> onboard consists of three gyroscopes measuring angular velocity along each of the spacecraft's body axes. This digital integrating rate assembly (DIRA) is calibrated and used to maintain spacecraft attitude during orbital delta-V maneuvers. During the early orbit support of GOES- 8 (April 1994), the gyro drift rate biases exhibited a large dependency on gyro temperature. This complicated the calibration and introduced errors into the attitude during delta-V maneuvers. Following GOES- 8, {{a model of the}} DIRA temperature and drift rate bias variation was developed for GOES- 9 (May 1995). This model was used to project a value of the DIRA bias to use during the orbital delta-V maneuvers based on the bias change observed as the DIRA warmed up during the calibration. The model also optimizes the yaw reorientation necessary to achieve the correct delta-V pointing attitude. As a result, a higher accuracy was achieved on GOES- 9 leading to more efficient delta-V maneuvers and a propellant savings.

40|$|As our urban environments are densifying, it is {{essential}} to extend traditional cadastral systems that are based on two dimensional representation of ownership to support 3 D. With the need to define property ownership in vertical as well as horizontal dimensions becoming pertinent around the world, a practical solution to represent 3 D cadastral data is needed. The Land Administration Domain Model (LADM, ISO 19152) already covers such situations since the spatial unit defined in the Spatial <b>Unit</b> <b>package</b> in LADM can refer to a single volume of space (or multiple volumes of space) besides 2 D representations. LADM is a conceptual model that allows land administration objects and relationships to be described. The power of the model is the ability to describe different cadastral systems in different countries or regions in a consistent way. CityGML is an information model and data exchange standard for 3 D city model data. It does not contain specifics about land administration. The paper examines how the LADM conceptual model, the representation of legal spaces in particular, can be mapped to and encoded as a CityGML Application Domain Extension (ADE). The CityGML ADE implements a data exchange format but the underlying model could also be used as a starting point to create a database schema for data storage. The paper addresses the modelling issue of integrating different information models that define or refer to the same or overlapping concepts. The possibility to achieve greater integration between ISO 19152 and CityGML by including each others concepts in future versions is also discussed. Relating legal features to physical features, a common occurance in practice, is addressed from a data modelling perspective.

Historically, Delhi has been preferred as a capital by different rulers from various dynasties and invaders coming from different partTS 03 B_ezeomedo_igbokwe_ 6421 s of the world even before 15 th century. As in many densely populated areas even the early developments included 3 D solutions, both below and above the surface. In the early days these were rather exceptions, but the 3 D use of space has only been increased afterwards due to the continuously growing needs for space and the increased (civil) engineering and construction capabilities. In the early decades after gaining independence in 1947, Delhi rapidly began taking shape of a metro city due to large number of refugees coming from Pakistan who changed the landscape of entire Delhi. By the starting of 21 st Century, Delhi had started growing rapidly in terms of population and infrastructure development. This rapid expansion in Delhi and immediate neighbouring cities of Noida and Gurgaon found the land administration agencies of these cities unprepared to deal with this rapidly changing land market. Delhi is managed by various land management agencies. Some have a major role to play in planning and development of the land like Delhi Development Authority while others focus more execution and maintenance like municipal corporations. Delhi does have a long-standing system of Deed registration but have no central registry. In general, records of land held by governmental agencies are maintained by each individual agency. The current paper aims to study the multi-stakeholding urban area locations in Delhi and around where (infrastructural) changes are creating the complex land management situations for the authorities involved. Three cases, mainly related to buildings and apartments, are presented in brief to highlight the different aspects of 3 D spatial complexities involved while the forth case study is mode elaborated and focusing on multi-infrastructure (utility) networks in one single area.

40|$|Supporting the {{management}} of rights related to groundwater based on input from hydrogeology software is contributing to bridging {{the gap between the}} technical and administrative aspects of groundwater management. The research reported herein is focused on a specific example (or ‘use case’ in UML terminology), resulting from a court action by Kerala State in India, against the Coca-Cola company, on the overexploitation of the local groundwater aquifer. The use case reports on the economic and policy contexts conducing to the establishment of the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Plachimada, and the ensuing court actions, triggered by the local community assembly first, and then by Kerala State authority, {{on the grounds of the}} introduction of toxic waste into the groundwater, making the water unfit for human consumption, and the depletion of the aquifer. Considering the specifics of the use case, the ISO/TC 211 Land Administration Domain Model (LADM, DIS 19152) is used as a basis for the development of a specialized profile addressing the need to define laws and regulations with proper spatial and temporal dimensions, to represent the rights to groundwater use by the local communities. Two alternative scenarios are reported: the first is based in the consideration that all the different Property parcels are regulated by Private Law; the second, further develops on the consideration of groundwater as a Public Trust, thus regulating private use through the Public Law domain. The modelling here provided goes from a subset of the LADM conceptual classes to more specialized classes, and is reported through the use of class and instance level (object) diagrams. These build on the existing spatial <b>unit</b> <b>package</b> and the legal and administrative profile, demonstrating the flexibility which can be introduced by LADM. Specifically concerning the representation of spatial units, a previously proposed ‘Mixed 2 D/ 3 D’ spatial profile is further developed, addressing the needs of the use case. In combination with the ‘Level’ representation of LADM to organize spatial units, it can contribute to an easier reuse of existing, 2 D based, land parcels data, into the proposed 3 D and time based model architecture. Concluding, the modelling and architectural framework here reported contributes to a more informed decision in the choice of groundwater rights to be made by the law, policy and courts, taking into account societal needs and changes induced by new socio-economic contexts. The resulting institutional setting will be best informed with spatial and temporal data, and the legal solution chosen be it public or private law focused, can be recorded in a system based on the LADM standard; it allows for much flexibility and only a few specific classes need to be added and further specified in order to be implemented. system based on the LADM standard; it allows for much flexibility and only a few specific classes need to be added and further specified in order to be implemented.
