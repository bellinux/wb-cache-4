5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, a cross-section of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles <b>uncoil,</b> and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that marks the beginning of the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; their function having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E
25|$|IFs {{are rather}} {{deformable}} proteins {{that can be}} stretched several times their initial length. The key to facilitate this large deformation is due to their hierarchical structure, which facilitates a cascaded activation of deformation mechanisms {{at different levels of}} strain. Initially the coupled alpha-helices of unit-length filaments <b>uncoil</b> as they're strained, then as the strain increases they transition into beta-sheets, and finally at increased strain the hydrogen bonds between beta-sheets slip and the ULF monomers slide along each other.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of ammonite species feature planispiral, flat-coiled shells, but other species feature nearly straight (as in baculites) shells.

Some species' shells are even initially <b>uncoiled,</b> then partially coiled, and finally straight at maturity (as in Australiceras). These partially <b>uncoiled</b> and totally <b>uncoiled</b> forms began to diversify mainly during {{the early part of the}} Cretaceous and are known as heteromorphs.|$|R

40|$|The Barremian Leptoceratoidinae, a {{subfamily}} of small-sized heteromorph ammonites, are revised. Despite considerable {{differences in}} the mode of <b>uncoiling,</b> Leptoceratoidinae are considered to represent a monophyletic unit, defined by their small size, simplified suture-lines and ubiquitous Barremian age. Three evolutionary lines are recognized exhibiting,parallel trends of size increase: (1) Karsteniceras with crioconc <b>uncoiling</b> and a planispiral to trochospiral initial coil; (2) Hamulinites with an ancylocone type of <b>uncoiling</b> and a small planispiral initial coil; and (3) a line compromising Eoheteroceras gen. nov. with ancylocone <b>uncoiling</b> and a large trochospiral initial coil, as well as Manoloviceras gen. nov. with only one slightly curved arm and a large trochospiral initial coil. It is inferred that these evolutionary lines originated in Veveysiceras gen. nov. with hamitid-like <b>uncoiling.</b> Veleziceras, with a straight to gently curved shell, is tentatively included in the Leptoceratoidinae, but cannot yet be assigned to one of the three lines defined above. The following new species are described: Karsteniceras ibericum, K. beyrichoide, K. hoheneggeri, K. trinidadense and E. silesiacum, the type species of Eoheteroceras gen. nov. The origin of leptoceratoids remains obscure; they are not closely related to the Berriasian to Valanginian true leptoceratids. Presumably, Eoheteroceras gave rise to the large-sized Heteroceras. Due to the simplified suture-line formula ELUI and the type of <b>uncoiling,</b> the Leptoceratoidinae are included in the Ancyloceratidae. Their evolutionary centre was the southern (Tethyan) margin of the European Plate. From this area, Leptoceratoidinae migrated into the central North Atlantic and even the western Pacific. While Leptoceratoidinae presumably had a vagrant epibenthic mode of life, their dispersal was most probably achieved during their nearshore juvenile stage by the North Equatorial Current...|$|R

40|$|Storage {{of sperm}} inside the female genital tract is an {{integral}} phase of reproduction in many animal species. The sperm storage site constitutes the arena for sperm activation, sperm competition and female sperm choice. Consequently, to understand animal mating systems information on the processes that occur from sperm transfer to fertilization is required. Here, we focus on sperm activation in spiders. Male spiders produce sperm whose cell components are coiled within the sperm cell and that are surrounded by a proteinaceous sheath. These inactive and encapsulated sperm are transferred to the female spermathecae where they are stored for later fertilization. We analyzed the ultrastructural changes of sperm cells during residency time in the female genital system of the orb-web spider Argiope bruennichi. We found three clearly distinguishable sperm conditions: encapsulated sperm (secretion sheath present), decapsulated (secretion sheath absent) and <b>uncoiled</b> sperm (cell components <b>uncoiled,</b> presumably activated). After insemination, sperm remain in the encapsulated condition for several days and become decapsulated after variable periods of time. A variable portion of the decapsulated sperm transforms rapidly to the <b>uncoiled</b> condition resulting in a simultaneous occurrence of decapsulated and <b>uncoiled</b> sperm. After oviposition, only decapsulated and <b>uncoiled</b> sperm are left in the spermathecae, strongly suggesting that the activation process is not reversible. Furthermore, we found four different types of secretion in the spermathecae which might {{play a role in}} the decapsulation and activation process...|$|R
