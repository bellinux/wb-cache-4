40|$|Abstract — Recently in {{the field}} of bridges that are newly built or repaired, fast {{construction}} is required more than ever. For these reasons, precast prefabricated bridge that enables rapid construction is actively discussed and studied today. In South Korea, it is called modular bridge. <b>Cross</b> <b>beam</b> is an integral component of modular bridge. It functions for load distribution, reduction of bending moment, resistance of horizontal strength on lateral upper structure. In this study, the structural characteristics of domestic and foreign <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> types were compared. Based on this, alternative <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> connection types suitable for modular bridge were selected. And bulb-T girder specimens were fabricated with each type of connection. The behavior of each specimen was analyzed under static loading, and <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> connection type which is expected to be best suited to modular bridge proposed.

40|$|Abstract. A {{recently}} {{new construction}} and {{reconstruction of the}} bridge have been required to minimize traffic congestion, environmental disadvantage, to reduce the period of construction, and {{to improve the quality}} and workability during the construction. For this reason, the application of modular bridge system, which is assembly of the structural members, is necessary to prepare for near future. Fall of girders can occur at the moment to connect between precast girders during the construction, so appropriate <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> should be installed to solve the mentioned problem. In this study, understanding the structural characteristics and status of <b>cross</b> <b>beam,</b> alternative <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> system for modular bridge was developed. To inspect the structural characteristics of the alternative system, specimens were built and static loading test was performed. Afterward, the behavior of <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> in terms of joints and load distribution was observed. Experimental results were analyzed and compared with each data. Therefore, the appropriate <b>cross</b> <b>beam</b> system for modular bridge will be chosen and proposed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|It is also {{possible}} {{to lay out the}} traction current supply on special <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> right on the overhead wire pylons above the catenary wire. Because the overhead line pylons have a smaller cross section than traction current supply masts, the <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> cannot be too wide, so the standard arrangement of four conductor cables in one level cannot be used. In this case, a two-level arrangement is used, or with two electric circuits for double-railed lines the overhead line pylons for both directions are equipped with <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> for their own traction current system of two conductor cables each.|$|R

The cabins could also be spun in the horizontal plane using a central steering wheel, similar to a teacup ride.

50|$|In 1923, the decking was {{strengthened}} {{by adding a}} reinforced concrete slab. In 1990, tests showed the bridge was too weak for many heavy goods vehicles, and traffic was limited to a 7.5 ton maximum. This was increased to 17 tons after the bridge had been strengthened in 1992. The secondary members needed strengthening and this was effected by enhancing the shear strength of the transverse <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> by bonding steel plates to the web of the <b>cross</b> <b>beams.</b> The longitudinal cross-bracing was {{strengthened by}} using angle splints and {{the space between the}} splints and the cross-bracing was grouted. Additional transverse bracing was supplied by reinforcing the central spine of the arch, with one end bolted to steel sleeves, and the other end bolted to the <b>cross</b> <b>beams</b> {{at the top of the}} arch.|$|R
