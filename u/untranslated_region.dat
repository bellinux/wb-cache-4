5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region,</b> it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
5|$|An mRNA {{may contain}} {{regulatory}} elements itself, such as riboswitches, in the 5' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> or 3' untranslated region; these cis-regulatory elements regulate {{the activity of}} that mRNA. The untranslated regions can also contain elements that regulate other genes.|$|E
5|$|Most known RNA {{thermometers}} {{are located}} in the 5' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding heat shock proteins—though it has been suggested this fact may be due, in part, to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in genomic data.|$|E

5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is RNA {{that has}} a coding region {{that acts as a}} {{template}} for protein synthesis (translation). The rest of the mRNA, the <b>untranslated</b> <b>regions,</b> tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the <b>untranslated</b> <b>regions,</b> many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.|$|R
5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the brain of embryonic, but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following ligation of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E

5|$|The exosome is {{involved}} in the degradation and processing {{of a wide variety of}} RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it {{is involved}} in the turn-over of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the nucleolus is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{importance}} of these <b>untranslated</b> <b>regions</b> of mRNA {{is just beginning to}} be understood. Various medical studies are being conducted that have found connections between mutations in <b>untranslated</b> <b>regions</b> and increased risk for developing a particular disease, such as cancer. For example, associations between polymorphisms in the HLA-G 3′UTR region and development of colorectal cancer have been discovered. [...] Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms 3' UTR has also been associated with susceptibility to preterm birth. Mutations in the 3' UTR are also related to development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.|$|R
25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> (3'UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in the <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> (UTR) affect many post-transcriptional regulation. Distinctive {{structural}} {{features are}} required for many RNA molecules and cis-acting regulatory elements to execute effective functions during gene regulation.

25|$|In 29–66% of glioblastomas, DNA repair is {{deficient}} due to epigenetic methylation of the MGMT gene, {{which reduces}} protein expression of MGMT. However, for 28% of glioblastomas, the MGMT protein is deficient, but the MGMT promoter is not methylated. In glioblastomas without methylated MGMT promoters, {{the level of}} microRNA miR-181d is inversely correlated with protein expression of MGMT and the direct target of miR-181d is the MGMT mRNA 3'UTR (the three prime <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> of MGMT mRNA). Thus, in 28% of glioblastomas, increased expression of miR-181d and reduced expression of DNA repair enzyme MGMT may be a causal factor.|$|E
40|$|The {{crucial role}} of the non-coding portion of genomes is now widely acknowledged. In particular, mRNA <b>untranslated</b> <b>regions</b> are {{involved}} in many post-transcriptional regulatory pathways that control mRNA localisation, stability and translation efficiency. A review is given {{of the most recent}} research works on the functional characterisation of eukaryotic mRNA <b>untranslated</b> <b>regions.</b> In order to make possible a systematic and detailed sequence analysis of mRNA <b>untranslated</b> <b>regions</b> (UTRs), a non-redundant database of metazoan mRNA untranslated sequences annotated for the occurrence of specific functional elements, UTRdb, was devised. These elements, whose consensus structure has been devised on the basis of experimental assays and of comparative analyses, have been collected in the UTRsite database. A suitable pattern-matching software has been devised to search UTRsite patterns in user-submitted sequences, also assessing their statistical significance. Structural, compositional and evolutionary features of untranslated sequences of metazoan mRNAs have been investigated showing peculiar intra- and interspecific patterns...|$|R

25|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} is a genetic disorder which occurs {{as a result}} of a mutation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, most commonly an increase in the number of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> of FMR1. Mutation at that site is found in 1 out of about every 2000 males and 1 out of about every 259 females. Incidence of the disorder itself is about 1 in every 3600 males and 1 in 4000–6000 females. Although this accounts for over 98% of cases, FXS can also occur as a result of point mutations affecting FMR1.|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts {{have their}} own genome, which encodes a number of {{thylakoid}} proteins. However, {{during the course of}} plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial endosymbiotic ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the cell nucleus took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper stoichiometry and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, transcription of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by light. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by phosphorylation via redox-sensitive kinases in the thylakoid membranes. The translation rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by {{the presence or absence of}} assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis). This mechanism involves negative feedback through binding of excess protein to the 5' <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> of the chloroplast mRNA. Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain. The redox state of the electron carrier plastoquinone in the thylakoid membrane directly affects the transcription of chloroplast genes encoding proteins of the reaction centers of the photosystems, thus counteracting imbalances in the electron transfer chain.|$|E

500|$|MRNA rescue {{experiments}} {{can often}} restore the wild-type phenotype to the embryos and {{provide evidence for}} the specificity of a Morpholino. In an mRNA rescue, a Morpholino is co-injected with an mRNA that codes for the morphlino's [...] protein. However, the rescue mRNA has a modified 5'-UTR (<b>untranslated</b> <b>region)</b> so that the rescue mRNA contains no target for the Morpholino. The rescue mRNA's coding region encodes the protein of interest. Translation of the rescue mRNA replaces production of the protein that was knocked down by the Morpholino. Since the rescue mRNA would not affect phenotypic changes due to the Morpholino's off-target gene expression modulation, this return to wild-type phenotype is further evidence of Morpholino specificity. [...] In embryos, Morpholinos can be tested in null mutants to check for unexpected RNA interactions, then used in a wild-type embryo to reveal the acute knockdown phenotype (often more extreme than the mutant phenotype, in which effects of losing the null gene can be concealed by genetic compensation).|$|E
500|$|Gene {{expression}} of SFTPA2 is regulated {{at different levels}} including gene transcription, post-transcriptional processing, stability and translation (biology) of mature mRNA. One of the important features of human surfactant protein A mRNAs {{is that they have}} a variable five prime <b>untranslated</b> <b>region</b> (5’UTR) generated from splicing variation of exons A, B, C, and D. At least 10 forms of human SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 5’UTRs have been identified that differ in nucleotide sequence, length, and relative amount. Most SFTPA2 specific 5’UTRs include exon B. This 30-nucleotide long sequence has been shown to enhance both gene transcription and protein translation (biology), and {{plays a key role in}} the differential regulation of SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 expression. Both ABD and ABD’ are the most represented forms among SFTPA2 transcripts (~49% each), and experimental work has shown that this sequence can stabilize mRNA, enhance translation, and activate cap-independent eukaryotic translation. Exon B of SFTPA2 also binds specific proteins (e.g. 14-3-3) that may enhance translation, in a sequence- and secondary structure- specific way. While differences at the 5’UTR are shown to regulate both transcription and translation, polymorphisms at the 3’UTR of SP-A2 variants are shown to primarily, differentially affect translation efficiency [...] via mechanisms that involve binding of proteins [...] and/or [...] The impact of this regulation on SFTPA2 relative protein levels may contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to lung disease.|$|E
