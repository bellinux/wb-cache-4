6000|$|MISS HOWARD. In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. (Murray {{grunts and}} moves nervously on his chair.) What's the matter? Don't you like <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the Sanatorium? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she said, [...] "I {{begin to}} wish I'd adopted you myself. Perhaps, later on, {{we can find}} a husband for you, and you will marry and settle down near <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Silverdale, and then you can help me with the work." ...|$|E
60|$|The French army acts now wholly on the defensive, {{strongly}} fortified {{in their}} trenches, {{and the young}} French king sends overtures for a treaty of peace by the Duke of Mantua; which, {{because it is a}} matter of State that concerns <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> home, I shall speak no farther of it.|$|E
2500|$|... "Take {{the fight}} to the enemy {{overseas}} before they can attack <b>us</b> again <b>here</b> <b>at</b> home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let <b>us</b> stand <b>here</b> <b>at</b> {{the bottom}} of the steps talking," [...] said Mrs. Archibald. [...] "I must say I am very agreeably surprised." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{he would}}! {{he would be}} delighted, he is very fond of the English. I will answer for it {{that you will be}} welcome. Meet <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> seven o'clock this evening; he has hired a big room, and there will be two or three dozen of us there--all good fellows. Most of them have passed, and you will see the army and navy, the law and medicine, all represented." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very great}} deal," [...] Bella assured him. [...] "Since one's bound {{to meet with}} {{difficulties}} one can't foresee, it proves that one man has resource, resolution, and many other eminently useful qualities; but all this is getting too serious. I'd better point out that Lisle hasn't even promised to meet <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> any particular time." [...] She paused and laughed mischievously. [...] "Millicent merely sent for him, mentioning to-morrow as the day {{she would like to}} start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, friends, you'll please yourselves, of course--most people do; {{and if you}} are so {{determined}} to stick to the wilderness I would advise some of you to stop here. There's plenty of fun and fighting, if you're fond of that. What say you now, lad," [...] turning to March, [...] "to remain with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the Mountain Fort? I've ta'en a sort of fancy to your face. We want young bloods here. I'll give you a good wage and plenty to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{it would}} seem," [...] said Biarne, [...] "but {{it was more}} by good fortune than good planning, for I left you weak-handed; and if good luck had not brought <b>us</b> <b>here</b> just <b>at</b> the time we did, methinks {{there would have been}} heavy hearts among us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've about done it this time," [...] he said. [...] "By George! Let's {{clear out}} of this before Milly comes down. I shouldn't like her to know that we've been here all night. Poor little girl! She'd never forgive herself for letting <b>us</b> play <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all." ...|$|R
5000|$|Less {{impressed}} was {{film critic}} John Mosher of The New Yorker, who {{found in the}} film [...] "a bigger allotment of very British small talk and that special brand of British whimsy which makes <b>us</b> <b>here</b> think <b>at</b> times {{that at least one}} of the clouds over England is this particular kind of humor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{that was}} not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> six o'clock {{tomorrow}} evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be sure {{we shall}} before long, Skinner. They know well {{enough that we}} cannot stop here, but must {{move on to the}} water sooner or later; and knowing that, they would be fools if they were to give up their strong {{position}} to attack <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> <b>At</b> any rate I would rather be lying behind this wall than moving about as the general and his staff are doing. Major Dickson has just been shot through the knee, I hear. There! Look! there is another officer down. I wonder who he is. I do hope they won't pot Clinton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I looked idly {{enough to}} pass the time, and there I saw a tall man in a Moorish dress, and with him, for their arms were about each other, a woman. As I was turning my head away who {{did not wish to}} spy upon them thus, the woman lifted her face to kiss the man, and I knew her for that {{beautiful}} Inez who has visited <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> times, as a spy I think. Presently, too, the man, after paying her back her embrace, glanced about him guiltily, and I saw his face also, and knew it." ...|$|E
60|$|Ans. But {{what these}} {{opinions}} are, we hear not; nor how to shun them, you tell <b>us</b> <b>here</b> nothing <b>at</b> all. This I am sure, {{there are no}} men in this day have more opposed the light, glory, and lustre of the gospel of Christ, than those, as the Quakers and others, that have set up themselves, and their own humanity, as the essential parts of it.|$|R
6000|$|It was the Killigrew way, Lord Henry Goade assures <b>us,</b> pausing <b>here</b> <b>at</b> long {{length for}} one of those digressions into the history of {{families}} whose members chance to impinge upon his chronicle. [...] "They were," [...] he says, [...] "ever an impetuous, short-reasoning folk, honest and upright enough so far as their judgment carried them, but hampered by a lack of penetration in that judgment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody must {{suffer for}} every reform," [...] he said. [...] "It seems that a {{sacrifice}} is demanded, and the ban is upon <b>us</b> still. <b>Here,</b> <b>at</b> least, {{the cost of}} man's progress is the shedding of blood." [...] Then he made a little forceful gesture. [...] "They are arming in the bush. In another month or two there will be very grim doings at San Roque." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Mandragon, the Millionaire, I {{am happy}} to say, is dead; [...] He enjoyed a quiet funeral in a Crematorium shed. [...] And he lies there fluffy and soft and grey and {{certainly}} quite refined; [...] When he might have rotted to flowers and fruit with Adam and all mankind, [...] Or been eaten by wolves athirst for blood, [...] Or burnt on a good tall pyre of wood, [...] In a towering flame, as a heathen should, [...] Or even sat with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> food, [...] Merrily taking twopenny ale and pork with a pocket-knife; [...] But this was luxury not for one that went for the Simple Life.|$|E
6000|$|A {{carriage}} {{passed before}} {{him through the}} Cascine gates, and drove down the road next the river. He followed, and when it had got a little way it stopped at the roadside, and a lady and little girl alighted, who looked about and caught sight of him, and then obviously {{waited for him to}} come up with them. It was Imogene and Effie Bowen, and the young girl called to him: [...] "We thought it was you. Aren't you astonished to find <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> this hour?" [...] she demanded, as soon as he came up, and gave him her hand. [...] "Mrs. Bowen sent us for our health--or Effie's health--and I was just making the man stop and let us out for a little walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have spoken}} to you of the causes which {{in the past have}} led up to this Budget. I {{have spoken to}} you of its present justification. What of the future? If I had to sum up the {{immediate}} future of democratic politics in a single word I should say [...] "Insurance." [...] That is the future--Insurance against dangers from abroad. Insurance against dangers scarcely less grave and much more near and constant which threaten <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> home in our own island. I had the honour and opportunity a few days ago of explaining to the House of Commons our proposals for unemployment insurance. That is a considerable matter. It stands by itself. It is a much simpler question than invalidity insurance; but it is a great matter by itself. Indeed, I thought while I was explaining it to the House of Commons that I had not made such an important speech since I had the honour of explaining the details of the Transvaal Constitution.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well. I admit it's getting rather late in {{the evening}} for pure {{philosophical}} inquiry, and you are tired. Practically, then, it WAS wise to let them get away before they discovered two things. One, our exact relations here with these women; and the other, HOW MANY of <b>us</b> were <b>here.</b> <b>At</b> present they think we are three or four in possession and with the consent of the women." ...|$|R
60|$|Alicia--it {{used to be}} plain Alice {{when she}} lived at Thrush Hill and made her own dresses and trimmed her own hats--is my half-sister. She is eight years older than I am. We are both orphans, and Aunt Elizabeth brought <b>us</b> up <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Thrush Hill, the most {{delightful}} old country place in the world, half smothered in big willows and poplars, every one of which I have climbed in the early tomboy days of gingham pinafores and sun-bonnets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Barker," [...] said Buck, [...] "business may {{be lower}} than politics, but war is, as I {{discovered}} last night, a long sight more like business. You politicians are such ingrained demagogues that even {{when you have a}} despotism you think of nothing but public opinion. So you learn to tack and run, and are afraid of the first breeze. Now we stick to a thing and get it. And our mistakes help <b>us.</b> Look <b>here!</b> <b>at</b> this moment we've beaten Wayne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY VERY DEAR MARQUISE,--I do {{not doubt}} {{but that it}} will {{pleasure}} you to hear that I am on my way home, and that but for a touch of fever that has detained <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> La Rochette, I should be at Condillac {{as soon as the}} messenger who is the bearer of these presents. A courier from Paris found me a fortnight since in Milan, with letters setting forth that my father had been dead six months, and that it was considered expedient at Court that I should return home forthwith to assume the administration of Condillac. I am lost in wonder that a communication of this nature should have been addressed to me from Paris instead of from you, as surely it must have been your duty to advise me of my father's decease at the time of that untoward event. I am cast down by grief at this evil news, and the summons from Court has brought me in all haste from Milan. The lack of news from Condillac has been for months a matter of surprise to me. My father's death may be some explanation of this, but scarcely explanation enough. However, madame, I count upon it that {{you will be able to}} dispel such doubts as I am fostering. I count too, upon being at Condillac by the end of week, but I beg that neither you nor my dear Marius will allow this circumstance to make any difference to yourselves, just as, although I am returning to assume the government of Condillac as the Court has suggested to me, I hope that yourself and my dear brother will continue to make it your home for as long as it shall pleasure you. So long shall it pleasure me.|$|E
5000|$|He {{signed to}} Glasgow Warriors in 2005 on a three-month contract. He {{was signed by}} head coach Hugh Campbell who stated: [...] "We're delighted to welcome a player of Eddie's calibre to Hughenden. His try scoring record for his {{previous}} clubs speaks for itself {{and we hope that}} he'll be able to continue that form while on trial with <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Glasgow." ...|$|E
50|$|In SPIN’s November 1988 issue, writer Legs McNeil {{noted the}} compilation's appeal - “This LP makes <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> SPIN nostalgic for great slaughtered-teen tear-jerkers and gives us pause {{to wonder why}} there are not modernized {{versions}} of the genre” - and invited readers, “in the interest of resurrecting this vital aspect of rock’n’roll lore,” to submit ideas for “Teen Tragedy Update: Song Titles We’d Like to See.” The magazine offered as prizes five copies of the LP that inspired the contest.|$|E
6000|$|... "All about it" [...] {{proved to}} be disappointingly little, and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert's closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands {{together}} as {{he listened to the}} meagre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile weeks lay behind <b>us,</b> and <b>here</b> <b>at</b> last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it? I've {{often thought}} so. And I've often thought what a dreadful thing {{it would have}} been if Grandfather and Grandmother King had never got married to each other. I don't suppose {{there would have been a}} single one of <b>us</b> {{children}} <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all; or if we were, we would be part somebody else and that would be almost as bad. When I think it all over I can't feel too thankful that Grandfather and Grandmother King happened to marry each other, when there were so many other people they might have married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is how it}} must be done: Let them as {{come with}} Colonel Easton, stick to him; the Green Mountain Boys shall hang to the tail of Colonel Allen's coat, and the Stockbridge men may follow Colonel Arnold. That makes three bands of us. Now, mark you, lads, there are three sides to that 'ere fort--one apiece. Let <b>us</b> meet <b>here</b> <b>at</b> {{whatever}} hour you will, and then start on the minute, each troop taking a different course, an' them who arrive first an' capture the fortification, gets the credit." ...|$|R
5000|$|The channel {{closed on}} 15 June 2009, a {{statement}} on the website read, [...] "Unfortunately, as of the 15th of June 2009, Simply Movies {{will no longer be}} broadcast as {{we need to focus on}} our programme production and distribution. All of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Simply Movies would like to thank our valued viewers who have supported the channel since launch - the magic lives on at Simply Home Entertainment, where many of these movies shown and other classics are available to buy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Dodd, all of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> {{the policy}} making {{level of the}} {{foundation}} have {{at one time or}} another served in the OSS (the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA) or the European Economic Administration, operating under directives from the White House. We operate under those same directives… The substance of the directives under which we operate is that we shall use our grant making power to so alter life in the United States that we can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union.

5000|$|United CEO Oscar Munoz stated on April 10: [...] "This is an {{upsetting}} {{event to}} all of <b>us</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving {{with a sense of}} urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation." [...] Munoz's use of the word [...] "re-accommodate" [...] received particular attention and ridicule from social media and commentators.|$|E
60|$|Standing on the threshold, nay as yet {{outside the}} threshold, of a 'Chivalry of Labour,' and an immeasurable Future {{which it is}} to fill with fruitfulness and verdant shade; where so much has not yet come even to the rudimental state, and all speech of {{positive}} enactments were hazardous in those who know this business only by the eye,--let <b>us</b> <b>here</b> hint <b>at</b> simply one widest universal principle, as the basis from which all organisation hitherto has grown up among men, and all henceforth will have to grow: The principle of Permanent Contract instead of Temporary.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take {{you with}} her, pitiful changeling!' I exclaimed. 'You marry? Why, {{the man is}} mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you imagine that {{beautiful}} young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the notion that anybody, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband? You want whipping for bringing <b>us</b> in <b>here</b> <b>at</b> all, with your dastardly puling tricks: and--don't look so silly, now!
