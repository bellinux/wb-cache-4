[...] "If Psycho began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased <b>underbelly</b> <b>of</b> American Gothic", he writes, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre [...] "carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcock's film while refusing comforting closure".|$|E

In this paper, we show several characteristics about our algorithm: typical block size (2 ^(2 n- 1)), key-length (2 ^n), number of rounds (2 ^(n+ 1)).

500|$|One {{particular}} specimen – {{the remains}} of a [...] long prehistoric baleen whale (of an unknown Miocene taxon) – provided the first opportunity to quantitatively analyze its attack behavior. Unlike great whites which target the <b>underbelly</b> <b>of</b> their prey, megalodon probably targeted the heart and lungs, with their thick teeth adapted for biting through tough bone, as indicated by bite marks inflicted to the rib cage and other tough bony areas on whale remains. Furthermore, attack patterns could differ for prey of different sizes. Fossil remains of some small cetaceans, for example cetotheres, suggest that they were rammed with great force from below before being killed and eaten, based on compression fractures.|$|E

500|$|In most cultures, a war horse {{used as a}} {{riding animal}} was trained to be {{controlled}} with limited use of reins, responding primarily to the rider's legs and weight. The horse became accustomed to any necessary tack and protective armour placed upon it, and learned to balance under a rider who would also be laden with weapons and armour. Developing the balance and agility of the horse was crucial. The origins of the discipline of dressage came from the need to train horses to be both obedient and manoeuvrable. The Haute ecole or [...] "High School" [...] movements of classical dressage taught today at the Spanish Riding School have their roots in manoeuvres designed for the battlefield.

Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled Lyrics, which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: [...] "I don't have what you would call a philosophy or coherent world view so I shall have to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Perry is the Daddies' sole lyricist, {{and writes}} the {{majority}} of his songs in a fictional narrative format he credits as being influenced by Randy Newman, Ray Davies and Jarvis Cocker, often told about or through the unreliable perspective of downtrodden characters struggling against adversity.

Perry has also incorporated political themes into his music, most overtly on the Daddies' 2013 album White Teeth, Black Thoughts, which addressed issues relating to the 2008 financial crisis through a variety of American character perspectives. The Register-Guard has described Perry's lyrics as [...] "ribald [...] often despairing", [...] " [...] the <b>underbelly</b> <b>of</b> society, stabbing at oppressors such as...the pressure to conform", while The New York Times has lauded them as [...] "vivid poetry" [...] containing [...] "an inventiveness missing from the other swing bands' lyrics".|$|E

[...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels."
