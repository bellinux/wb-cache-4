40|$|Snake antivenoms are {{formulations}} of immunoglobulins, or immunoglobulin fragments, purified from the plasma of animals immunized with snake venoms. Their therapeutic success lies {{in their ability}} to mitigate the progress of toxic effects induced by snake venom components, when administered intravenously. However, due to diverse factors, such as deficient manufacturing practices, physicochemical characteristics of formulations, or inherent properties of heterologous immunoglobulins, antivenoms can induce <b>undesirable</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> Based on the time lapse between antivenom administration and the onset of clinical manifestations, the World Health Organization has classified these <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> as: 1 – Early reactions, if they occur within the first hours after antivenom infusion, or 2 – late reactions, when occurring between 5 and 20 days after treatment. While all late reactions are mediated by IgM or IgG antibodies raised in the patient against antivenom proteins, and the consequent formation of immune complexes, several mechanisms may be responsible for the early reactions, such as pyrogenic reactions, IgE-mediated reactions, or non IgE-mediated reactions. This work reviews the hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the mechanisms involved in these <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to antivenoms. The understanding of these pathogenic mechanisms is necessary for the development of safer products and for the improvement of snakebite envenomation treatment.

40|$|MS {{patients}} are often suffering from chronic pain. Pain is a debilitating symptom and treatment {{is associated with}} <b>undesirable</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> especially long-term treatment where tolerance and dependence issues are concerning. Therefore, antiepileptic drugs are frequently {{being used in the}} management of chronic pain. Antiepileptic drugs are among the most susceptible drugs to be involved in pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic interactions. MS patients often use several different types of CNS-active drugs, yet little research has been done to highlight potential polypharmacy issues. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the pharmacological treatment of MS patients at the rehabilitation centre for MS, Hakadal, Norway, with regards to current knowledge on polypharmacy, with particular focus on antiepileptic drugs. Medical records from 2009 to 2011 were reviewed and an overview of drug dosages and combinations used by patients at MSSH was created. The present study demonstrated that one third of MS patients used either an AED (antiepileptic drug) or TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) and that one fifth used two or more. There was no difference in age, gender or degree of disability of the patients using these drugs. Polytherapy was widespread, with up to 19 concomitant drugs in use. Although the AEDs are well-known for their pharmacokinetic interactions, this is not of particular concern for MS patients since they mainly used newer AEDs (pregabalin and gabapentin) with little propensity to interact. Pharmacodynamic interactions are of greater concern since more than half of the patients used an opioid, a benzodiazepine or baclofen in addition to their AED/TCA therapy. One third of the patients were elderly and careful considerations regarding pharmacokinetics and possible excessive <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> are of importance. More focus on individualisation of treatment by implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring of AEDs and TCAs and attention to potential pharmacodynamics interactions may be further treatment concerns...|$|R
40|$|Immunotoxins are {{chimeric}} proteins {{composed of}} an antibody domain that specifically directs {{the action of}} the toxic domain, resulting in the death of the targeted cells. Over recent years, immunotoxins have been widely studied and the number of different constructions has increased exponentially. Protein engineering has allowed the design of optimized versions of immunotoxins with an improved tumor binding affinity, stability or cytotoxic efficacy, although sometimes this has compromised the safety of the patient in terms of <b>undesirable</b> <b>adverse</b> secondary <b>reactions.</b> A triple mutant at three Trp residues (HtA 3 DW) of the ribotoxin hirsutellin A retains its specific ribonucleolytic activity, although cell internalization capacity is lacking. This toxin variant has been fused to the single chain variable fragment A 33 (scFvA 33). This immunoconjugate (IMTXA 33 HtA 3 DW) was produced in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and purified using nickelnitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Both target and toxic domains were characterized. The immunotoxin showed an exquisite specific binding against GPA 33 -positive culture cells, which results in the death of the targeted cells because of specific ribonucleolytic activity against ribosomes of the engineered hirsutellin A variant. IMTXA 33 HtA 3 DW represents a promising structure in the search for an improved immunotoxin without compromising the safety of patients...|$|R

A widely accepted pharmacodynamic mechanism underlying EPS includes {{an increase in}} striatal D 2 -receptor occupancy. However, less {{is known about the}} pharmacokinetic background of EPS. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze in-vivo possible pharmacokinetic patterns underlying biperiden-treated EPS in risperidone (RIS) -medicated patients. A large therapeutic drug monitoring database containing plasma concentrations of RIS and its metabolite 9 -hydroxyrisperidone (9 -OH-RIS) of 2293 adult inpatients and outpatients was analyzed. Two groups were compared: a group receiving RIS (n= 772) and a group comedicated with biperiden (n= 68). Plasma concentrations, dose-adjusted plasma concentrations (C/D) of RIS, 9 -OH-RIS, and active moiety (AM) (RIS+ 9 -OH-RIS) as well as ratios of concentrations for metabolite to parent drug (9 -OH-RIS/RIS) were computed. We compared the plasma concentrations of the different compounds between the two groups considering the prescription of biperiden as an indirect report of EPS. The daily dosage of RIS did not differ between groups. No differences were detected in case of plasma concentrations and C/D of RIS and active metabolite between the groups. However, plasma concentrations of the AM were significantly higher in the comedicated group (P= 0. 032) and showed a trend in terms of the active metabolite 9 -OH-RIS (P= 0. 053). Data indicate enhanced AM plasma concentrations of RIS in patients comedicated with biperiden as an EPS treatment. This might underscore an association between higher plasma concentrations of the AM and treatment-requiring EPS...|$|R
40|$|Cancer is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} in which abnormal cells grow and divide without control, with the potential to invade other parts of the body. Chemotherapy is a type of treatment that uses chemical agents to treat cancer. These drugs are toxic and produce <b>undesirable</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> due to their narrow therapeutic window and highly variable pharmacokinetics, thus, they need to be monitored to establish personalized treatment to achieve maximal efficiency and reduce drug toxicity. Nowadays, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is not routinely used for chemotherapy agents, however, TDM has the potential to improve the clinical benefit of chemotherapy drugs. Tegafur, a prodrug of 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU), {{is one of the main}} anti-cancer drugs used worldwide. Herein, a reproducible and sensitive indirect competitive ELISA has been developed and validated in plasma samples. The assay reports an IC 50 of 35. 6 nM, reaching a limit of detection of 2. 7 nM. It is highly reproducible and does not show cross-reactivity with any related compound. In summary, this assay provides a sensitive, accurate and high throughput analytical method for tegafur quantification in plasma, which fits TDM requirements. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Here we present data to frequency and type of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in a high-risk area such as the glabella, <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> due to the consecutive injection of more than one filler in one facial region, and the current knowledge of treatment. Methods:	The IFS - study is a partially population-based registry for <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to injectable fillers. Most data was analysed descriptively. Results: Type and frequency of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in the glabella do not differ significantly from those in other facial regions. Vascular complication are rare.

Glaucoma eye drops have hypotensive effects and like all other medications are associated with <b>adverse</b> effects. <b>Adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> may either result from the main agent or from preservatives used in the drug vehicle. The preservative benzalkonium chloride, is one such compound that causes frequent <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> such as superficial punctate keratitis, corneal erosion, conjunctival allergy, and conjunctival injection. <b>Adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> related to main hypotensive agents have been divided into those affecting the eye and those affecting the entire body. In particular, β-blockers frequently cause systematic <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> including bradycardia, decrease in blood pressure, irregular pulse and asthma attacks. Prostaglandin analogs have distinctive local <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> including eyelash bristling/lengthening, eyelid pigmentation, iris pigmentation, and upper eyelid deepening. No systemic <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> {{have been linked to}} prostaglandin analog eye drop usage. These <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> may be minimized when they are detected early and prevented by reducing the number of different eye drops used (via fixed combination eye drops), reducing the number of times eye drops are administered, using benzalkonium chloride-free eye drops, using lower concentration eye drops, and providing proper drop instillation training. Additionally, a one-time topical medication can be given to patients to allow observation of any <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> thereafter the preparation of a topical medication with the fewest known <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> can be prescribed.

40|$|The terms 'adverse drug effects' and 'adverse drug reactions' are {{commonly}} used interchangeably, but they have different implications. <b>Adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> arise when a compound (e. g. a drug or metabolite, a contaminant or adulterant) is distributed {{in the same place}} as a body tissue (e. g. a receptor, enzyme, or ion channel), and the encounter results in an adverse effect (a physiological or pathological change), which results in a clinically appreciable <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction.</b> Both the <b>adverse</b> effect and the <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> have manifestations by which they can be recognized: adverse effects are usually detected by laboratory tests (e. g. biochemical, haematological, immunological, radiological, pathological) or by clinical investigations (e. g. endoscopy, cardiac catheterization), and <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> by their clinical manifestations (symptoms and/or signs). This distinction suggests five scenarios: (i) <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> can result directly from adverse effects; (ii) adverse effects may not lead to appreciable adverse reactions; (iii) <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> can occur without preceding adverse effects; (iv) <b>adverse</b> effects and <b>reactions</b> may be dissociated; and (v) <b>adverse</b> effects and <b>reactions</b> can together constitute syndromes. Defining an <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> as "an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product" suggests a definition of an adverse drug effect: "a potentially harmful effect resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which constitutes a hazard and {{may or may not be}} associated with a clinically appreciable <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> and/or an abnormal laboratory test or clinical investigation, as a marker of an <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to iodinated contrast media has risen. The dearth of reports on {{reactions to the}} administration of iso- and low-osmolar contrast media should be addressed. We, therefore, studied the profile of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to iodinated contrast media; viz., (a) the body systems affected (b) causality, (c) severity, and (d) preventability. Objective: To study <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> (causes and severity) to iodinated contrast media at Srinagarind Hospital. Method: Between March and July, 2015, 1, 101 patients from the Department of Radiology were observed and interviewed for the occurrence of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> The patients were classified per Naranjo’s algorithm and through use of an <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> questionnaire. Results: A total of 105 cases (9. 5 %) reported <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> (57 % male; 43 % female); among whom 2 % were iso-osmolar vs. 98 % low-osmolar. Diagnoses included hepatoma and cholangiocarcinoma (24. 8 %), colorectal cancer (9. 5 %), breast cancer (5. 7 %), cervical cancer (3. 8 %), lung cancer (2. 9 %), bone cancer (1. 9 %), and others (51. 5 %). Underlying diseases included hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2. Mild, moderate, and severe <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> accounted for 92, 5 and 3 %, respectively. The respective groups of escalating symptoms included (a) mild urticaria, itching, rash, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache; (b) moderate hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, tachycardia and bronchospasm; and (c) severe laryngeal edema, profound hypotension, and convulsions. All reactions could be anticipated per Naranjo’s algorithm. Conclusion: Mild to moderate <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to low-osmolar contrast media were most common and these occurred immediately after administration. For patient safety and better outcomes, improving the identification of patients {{likely to have an}} <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> is essential...|$|R

Documented <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were assessed and analyzed for incidence, purpose of visit, types, drug classes, individual drug causing <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> type of cutaneous reaction, and various predisposing factors. Management and outcome of the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were also studied. <b>Adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were also assessed for causality, using Naranjo&#x 2032;s scale, severity, and preventability, using Hartwig et al. scale. <b>Adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> attributes to 77 &#x 0025; of the hospital visit. Incidence of reported cutaneous <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> were 2. 85 &#x 0025;. Majority of the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> (96 &#x 0025;) were of type B.
