5|$|Several {{key areas}} have been {{targeted}} for economic analysis and reform: the environmental effects of <b>unconstrained</b> economic growth; the consequences of nature being treated as an economic externality; {{and the possibility of}} an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves <b>unconstrained</b> balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The {{company now}} maintained its full inventory, making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively <b>unconstrained</b> by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} from San Francisco to Hawaii, possibly on a whaler, arriving in Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted {{a large segment}} of the population after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged the revival of Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, <b>unconstrained</b> by political factors.|$|E
5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are <b>unconstrained</b> by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} sources {{about the}} reign of Caligula, although he {{is described as a}} noble and moderate emperor during {{the first six months of}} his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the <b>unconstrained</b> personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania as a province.|$|E
5|$|To {{remember}} the Catholic victory, Claude de La Baume held a local festival {{that took place}} on 21 June, resulting in his promotion to cardinal by Pope Gregory XIII, and a pension of 1,000 ducats from Philip II of Spain. The citizens of Morteau, who stopped the troops from Neuchâtel, were made citizens of Besançon and received significant financial compensation. François de Lette, Baron of Aubonne, was forced into exile, and Paul de Beaujeu left the region and travelled to Switzerland. Following the battle, Protestantism in Besançon was repressed until {{the signing of the}} Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which allowed Protestants to live in the city <b>unconstrained.</b>|$|E

25|$|Constrained {{problems}} {{can often be}} transformed into <b>unconstrained</b> problems {{with the help of}} Lagrange multipliers. Lagrangian relaxation can also provide approximate solutions to difficult constrained problems.|$|E
25|$|Reduced {{gradient}} method (Frank–Wolfe) for approximate minimization of specially structured {{problems with}} linear constraints, especially with traffic networks. For general <b>unconstrained</b> problems, this method reduces to the gradient method, which {{is regarded as}} obsolete (for almost all problems).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} solve this problem with a {{numerical}} optimization technique, we must first transform this problem such that the critical points occur at local minima. This is done by computing the magnitude of the gradient of the <b>unconstrained</b> optimization problem.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the sphere}} has Euler {{characteristic}} 2, {{it follows that}} P = 12. That is, a soccer ball constructed in this way always has 12 pentagons. In principle, the number of hexagons is <b>unconstrained.</b> This result is also applicable to fullerenes.|$|E
25|$|For <b>unconstrained</b> {{problems}} with twice-differentiable functions, some critical points {{can be found}} by finding the points where the gradient of the objective function is zero (that is, the stationary points). More generally, a zero subgradient certifies that a local minimum has been found for minimization {{problems with}} convex functions and other locally Lipschitz functions.|$|E
25|$|The MBTA {{maintains}} its own 25-year capital planning document, called the Program for Mass Transportation, which is fiscally <b>unconstrained.</b> The agency's 4-year plan {{is called the}} Capital Improvement Plan; it is the primary mechanism by which money is actually allocated to capital projects. Major capital spending projects {{must be approved by}} the MBTA Board, and except for unexpected needs, are usually included in the initial CIP.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} the 2012 report identified seven {{countries that}} were at particular risk of suffering setbacks related to Internet freedom in late 2012 and in 2013: Azerbaijan, Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Rwanda, Russia, and Sri Lanka. At the time the Internet {{in most of these}} countries was a relatively open and <b>unconstrained</b> space for free expression, but the countries also typically featured a repressive environment for traditional media and had recently considered or introduced legislation that would negatively affect Internet freedom.|$|E
25|$|One of Fermat's theorems {{states that}} optima of <b>unconstrained</b> {{problems}} are found at stationary points, {{where the first}} derivative or the gradient of the objective function is zero (see first derivative test). More generally, they may be found at critical points, where the first derivative or gradient of the objective function is zero or is undefined, or on the boundary of the choice set. An equation (or set of equations) stating that the first derivative(s) equal(s) zero at an interior optimum is called a 'first-order condition' or a set of first-order conditions.|$|E
25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its vapor phase and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present. Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4% by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making <b>unconstrained</b> gasoline quickly flammable.|$|E
25|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} columns typically contain large diameter vertical rebar (reinforcing bars) {{arranged in}} a ring, surrounded by lighter-gauge hoops of rebar. Upon analysis of failures due to earthquakes, it has been realized that the weakness {{was not in the}} vertical bars, but rather in inadequate strength and quantity of hoops. Once the integrity of the hoops is breached, the vertical rebar can flex outward, stressing the central column of concrete. The concrete then simply crumbles into small pieces, now <b>unconstrained</b> by the surrounding rebar. In new construction a greater amount of hoop-like structures are used.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, the State Government {{announced}} that the new stadium would be built on the northern section of the Burswood Park golf course. It stated that the Burswood site was preferred because it was <b>unconstrained</b> by surrounding developments and had the additional benefit of being government-owned. It would also allow for a special events six-platform Stadium railway station to be built and could {{be connected to the}} CBD via a pedestrian bridge across the Swan River to East Perth. A car park will not be built to service the stadium, with visitors expected to either park in the city and walk across the bridge or use public transport.|$|E
25|$|The {{abundant}} {{painted turtle}} species is captured from the wild, primarily for pet use. Commercial harvesting is a small-scale industry that faces growing restrictions, but still occurs, {{in some cases}} <b>unconstrained.</b> Recreational harvesting, is generally allowed {{in much of the}} species range. However, it is prohibited in areas where the species is threatened and in a few non-threatened locations. Generally, turtles are captured by live trapping. Floating basking-style traps work better than staked, baited hoop-style traps, but both are employed. Because the turtles are long-lived, with lower replacement rates than typical game, concerns exist for over-harvesting. In this, they are similar to species such as snapping turtles, with late-aged sexual maturity, albeit not to the same extent.|$|E
25|$|This energy {{function}} only introduces probability biases {{for a spin}} having a value and {{for a pair of}} spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are <b>unconstrained</b> by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.|$|E
25|$|At some point, the Mona Lisa {{was removed}} from its {{original}} frame. The <b>unconstrained</b> poplar panel warped freely with changes in humidity, and as a result, a crack developed {{near the top of}} the panel, extending down to the hairline of the figure. In the mid-18th century to early 19th century, two butterfly-shaped walnut braces were inserted into the back of the panel to a depth of about one third the thickness of the panel. This intervention was skilfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture's theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth.|$|E
25|$|Hotels {{use this}} system in largely the same way, to {{calculate}} the rates, rooms and restrictions on sales in order to best maximize their return. These systems measure constrained and <b>unconstrained</b> demand along with pace to gauge which restrictions to implement, e.g. length of stay, non-refundable rate, or close to arrival. Yield management teams in the hotel industry have evolved tremendously over the last 10 years and in this global economy targeting the right distribution channels, controlling costs, and having the right market mix {{plays an important role}} in yield management. Yield management in hotels is selling rooms and services at the right price, at the right time, to the right people.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} {{derivative}} test identifies points {{that might be}} extrema, this test does not distinguish a point that is a minimum from one that is a maximum or one that is neither. When the objective function is twice differentiable, these cases can be distinguished by checking the second derivative or the matrix of second derivatives (called the Hessian matrix) in <b>unconstrained</b> problems, or the matrix of second derivatives of the objective function and the constraints called the bordered Hessian in constrained problems. The conditions that distinguish maxima, or minima, from other stationary points are called 'second-order conditions' (see 'Second derivative test'). If a candidate solution satisfies the first-order conditions, then satisfaction of the second-order conditions as well is sufficient to establish at least local optimality.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{experiences}} with Earth, {{the environment of}} a planet can be altered deliberately; however, the feasibility of creating an <b>unconstrained</b> planetary environment that mimics Earth on another planet {{has yet to be}} verified. Mars is usually considered to be the most likely candidate for terraforming. Much study has been done concerning the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and NASA has even hosted debates on the subject. Several potential methods of altering the climate of Mars may fall within humanity's technological capabilities, but at present the economic resources required to do so are far beyond that which any government or society is willing to allocate to it. The long timescales and practicality of terraforming are the subject of debate. Other unanswered questions relate to the ethics, logistics, economics, politics, and methodology of altering the environment of an extraterrestrial world.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Marjorie Garber {{argued that}} {{metamorphosis}} {{is both the}} major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform. Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. He was certain that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses {{on the story of}} the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and <b>unconstrained.</b> The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.|$|E
25|$|Quartz {{belongs to}} the {{trigonal}} crystal system. The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramids at each end. In nature quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has <b>unconstrained</b> growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached {{at the other end}} to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within gypsum. A quartz geode is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} source of manifolds in 19th century mathematics was analytical mechanics, as developed by Siméon Poisson, Jacobi, and William Rowan Hamilton. The possible states of a mechanical system {{are thought to be}} points of an abstract space, phase space in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of classical mechanics. This space is, in fact, a high-dimensional manifold, whose dimension corresponds to the degrees of freedom of the system and where the points are specified by their generalized coordinates. For an <b>unconstrained</b> movement of free particles the manifold is equivalent to the Euclidean space, but various conservation laws constrain it to more complicated formations, e.g. Liouville tori. The theory of a rotating solid body, developed in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gives another example where the manifold is nontrivial. Geometrical and topological aspects of classical mechanics were emphasized by Henri Poincaré, {{one of the founders of}} topology.|$|E
25|$|Between 1879 and 1886 Kemball {{became the}} Commissioner of the Sutherland Estates of the 3rd Duke of Sutherland; the estate {{was the largest}} in Britain and {{included}} most of the county of Sutherland. During his tenure as commissioner he was involved with a dispute concerning gold digging. In 1869 gold {{had been found in}} the Strath of Kildonan resulting in an influx of outside prospectors and the establishment of a company for exploitation; the financial returns were not favourable and digging was abandoned. However, in 1886, following a downturn in the local economy, villagers and crofters petitioned the Duke though Commissioner Kemball for permission to continue searching for gold; permission was not given, and the estate threatened government action if it carried-on. Following further unauthorised digging the estate took steps to stop it. Before the problem was resolved the turmoil surrounding <b>unconstrained</b> and persistent gold digging by locals had caused Kemball to resign as estate commissioner, and Lord Stafford, the local Sutherland parliamentary representative, to resign.|$|E
25|$|Bošković {{visited his}} {{hometown}} {{only once in}} 1747, never to return. He agreed {{to take part in}} the Portuguese expedition for the survey of Brazil and the measurement of a degree of arc of the meridian, but was persuaded by the Pope to stay in Italy and to undertake a similar task there with Christopher Maire, an English Jesuit who measured an arc of two degrees between Rome and Rimini. The operation began at the end of 1750, and was completed in about two years. An account was published in 1755, under the name De Litteraria expeditione per pontificiam ditionem ad dimetiendos duos meridiani gradus a PP. Maire et Boscovicli. The value of this work was increased by a carefully prepared map of the States of the Church. A French translation appeared in 1770 which incorporated, as an appendix, some material first published in 1760 outlining an objective procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters of the fitted model from a greater number of observations. An <b>unconstrained</b> variant of this fitting procedure is now known as the L1-norm or Least absolute deviations procedure and serves as a robust alternative to the familiar L2-norm or Least Squares procedure.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for first test flights in 2011, the independent {{analysis by the}} Augustine Commission found in late 2009 that due to technical and financial problems Ares I was not likely to have had its first crewed launch until 2017–2019 under the current budget, or late 2016 with an <b>unconstrained</b> budget. The Augustine Commission also stated that Ares I and Orion would have an estimated recurring cost of almost $1 billion per flight. However, later financial analysis in March 2010 showed that the Ares I would have cost $1 billion or more to operate per flight had the Ares I flown just once a year. If the Ares I system were flown multiple times a year the marginal costs could have fallen to as low as $138 million per launch. In December 2011, NASA administrator Charlie Bolden testified to congress that the Ares I would cost $4–4.5 billion a year, and $1.6 billion per flight. The Ares I marginal cost was predicted {{to have been a}} fraction of the Shuttle's marginal costs even had it flown multiple times per year. By comparison, the cost of launching three astronauts on a manned Russian Soyuz is $153 million.|$|E
