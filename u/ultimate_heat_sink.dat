40|$|In a {{pressurized}} {{heavy water}} reactor, following {{loss of the}} primary coolant, severe core damage would begin with the depletion of the liquid moderator, exposing the top row of internally-voided fuel channels to steam cooling conditions {{on the inside and}} outside. The uncovered fuel channels would heat up, deform and disassemble into core debris. Large inventories of water passively reduce the rate of progression of the accident, prolonging the time for complete loss of engineered <b>heat</b> <b>sinks.</b> The efficacy of available backup and <b>ultimate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sinks,</b> available in a CANDU 6 reactor, in mitigating the consequences of a prolonged station blackout scenario was analysed using the MAAP 4 -CANDU code.

40|$|A data {{acquisition}} research program, entitled "Ultimate <b>Heat</b> <b>Sink</b> Performance Field Experiments," {{has been brought}} to completion. The primary objective is to obtain the requisite data to characterize thermal performance and water utilization for cooling ponds and spray ponds at elevated temperature. Such data are useful for modeling purposes, but the work reported here does not contain modeling efforts within its scope. The water bodies which have been studied are indicative of nuclear reactor <b>ultimate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sinks,</b> components of emergency core cooling systems. The data reflect thermal performance and water utilization for meteorological and solar influences which are representative of worst-case combinations of conditions. Constructed water retention ponds, provided with absolute seals against seepage, have been chosen as facilities for the measurement programs; the first pond was located at Raft River, Idaho, and the second at East Mesa, California. The data illustrate and describe, for both cooling ponds and spray ponds, thermal performance and water utilization as the ponds cool from an initially elevated temperature. To obtain the initial elevated temperature, it has been convenient to conduct the measurements at geothermal sites having large supplies and delivery rates of hot geothermal fluid.

40|$|A {{process was}} {{developed}} to produce ultra-low chloride content on the industry standard strongly basic, gel -type anion resin employed in an equivalent mixture with companion cation resin in the deep bed condensate polishers at Dominion’s Millstone Power Station. The low chloride anion facilitated on-line conversion of the polisher resins to the amine chemical form, enabling an increase in secondary cycle amine concentration and pH {{for the purpose of}} minimizing general and erosion corrosion. This dissertation describes the research, testing, and full scale implementation of this unique application of ion exchange resins that led to an eighty percent reduction in secondary side iron dissolution and transport, a decrease in steam generator corrosion deposits of seven-hundred pounds per fuel cycle, an approximate $ 1. 3 million dollar savings in annual bulk chemical and production costs, and sixty-thousand fewer pounds per year of nitrogen loading of Long Island Sound.

50|$|The <b>ultimate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> was {{restored}} when the service seawater system pumps in the pump room were repaired in units 1, 2 and 4 starting March 13 restoring the normal ECCS and heat removal systems to operable status and cooling was {{switched to the}} Residual Heat Removal System (RHR) portion of the ECCS. The RHR systems were first activated to cool down the suppression pools (torus) and drywells to operable status, and water injections {{were made to the}} reactors using the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode as needed. When the suppression pool was cooled down to below 100 degrees, the RHR was switched to the shutdown cooling mode and brought the reactors to a cold shutdown. Coolant temperatures below 100 °C (cold shutdown) were reached in reactor 2 about 34 hours after the emergency shut down (SCRAM) restoring the ability to lower the pressure of the reactor via the torus.Reactors 1 and 3 followed at 1:24 and 3:52 on March 14 and Reactor 4 at 7:00 on March 15. By March 15, all four reactors of Fukushima II reached cold shutdown, which remained non-threatening.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{operators}} had {{to prepare}} an alternate injection line for each unit, as the RCIC can run indefinitely only {{while there is}} sufficient pressure and steam in the reactor to drive its turbine; once reactor pressure drops below a certain level, the RCIC shuts down automatically. The normal AC driven Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) were {{for the most part}} unavailable due to the loss of <b>ultimate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> and damage to some of the electrical infrastructure. Operators prepared for this and set up an alternate injection line using a non-emergency system known as the Makeup Water Condensate System to maintain water level which was an accident mitigation method TEPCO put in place at all its nuclear plants. The system was started and stopped in all 4 units, including unit 3, as needed to maintain the water level. The RCICs in each unit later shut down due to low reactor pressure. Operators had to also use the MUWC and the makeup water purification and filtering (MUPF) system to try to cool the suppression pool and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high. Operators were later able to restore the High Pressure Core Spray portion of the ECCS in unit 4 and switched emergency water injection for unit 4 from the MUWC system to the HPCS. While the water level was maintained in the three cores using emergency water injection, pressures in the containment vessel continued to rise due to lack of suppression pool cooling and the operators prepared to vent the containments making restoration of heat removal urgent. Unit 1 was prioritized as it had the highest drywell pressure.|$|E

40|$|In a {{postulated}} severe core damage {{accident in}} a PHWR, multiple failures of core cooling systems {{may lead to}} the collapse of pressure tubes and calandria tubes, which may ultimately relocate inside the calandria vessel forming a terminal debris bed. The debris bed, which may reach high temperatures due to the decay heat, is cooled by the moderator in the calandria. With time, the moderator is evaporated and after some time, a hot dry debris bed is formed. The debris bed transfers heat to the calandria vault water which acts as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> However, the questions remain: how long would the vault water be an <b>ultimate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> and what would be the failure mode of the calandria vessel if the heat sink capability of the reactor vault water is lost? In the present study, a numerical analysis is performed to evaluate the thermal loads and the stresses in the calandria vessel following the above accident scenario. The heat transfer from the molten corium pool to the surrounding is assumed to be by a combination of radiation, conduction, and convection from the calandria vessel wall to the vault water.
