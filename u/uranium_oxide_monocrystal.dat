40|$|International audienceThe Pan-African Lufilian belt (Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo) {{is known}} for its {{world-class}} copper and cobalt deposits. In addition, the Lufilian Copperbelt hosts several uranium occurrences concentrated within deformed siliciclastic rocks of the basal Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup. We report LA-ICPMS and EMP analyses of the rare earth element (REE) and yttrium (Y) abundances (designated as the REY signatures) of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> from two <b>uranium</b> mineralizing events of the Lufilian belt previously dated at 652 ± 8 Ma and 530 ± 6 Ma by the U–Pb method on uraninite. <b>Uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> dated at ca. 650 Ma from the External fold-and-thrust belt are characterized by (i) bell shape REE patterns centered on middle REE (MREE), (ii) positive europium (Eu) anomalies and (iii) relatively low Y contents. In contrast, <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> dated at ca. 530 Ma from the Domes region are characterized by (i) REE patterns but with a less pronounced light REE (LREE) fractionation, (ii) negative Eu anomalies and (iii) higher Y contents. Moreover, the External fold-and-thrust belt also contains uranium mineralization dated at ca. 530 Ma having the same characteristics as the ca. 530 Ma <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> from the Domes region (a moderately fractionated REE pattern and a negative Eu anomaly). As REY signatures are known to reflect mineralizing processes, the distinct geochemical signatures of the two <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> generations (ca. 650 Ma and ca. 530 Ma) provide meaningful information about the uranium cycle during the Pan-African orogeny. Compared to the REY signatures of the known worldwide uranium deposit types, the REY signature of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> dated at ca. 650 Ma of the External fold-and-thrust belt is similar to the REE patterns from unconformity-related U deposits (Athabasca in Canada and Kombolgie in Australia). <b>Uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> of the Domes region and some of the External fold-and-thrust belt display similar characteristics to syn-metamorphic U deposit (Mistamisk in Canada). Accordingly, we propose that the two stages of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> crystallizations within the Lufilian belt, at ca. 650 and ca. 530 Ma, occurred under distinct physico-chemical conditions. The first stage, at ca. 650 Ma, may be related to late diagenesis hydrothermal processes, at the basement/cover interface, with the circulation of highly saline basinal brines linked to evaporites of the Roan Group. This Pan-African unconformity-related uranium deposit is the youngest of this type described to date. The second stage may be connected to metamorphic fluid circulations, at about 530 Ma, during the Lufilian orogeny in the Domes region and also in the External fold-and-thrust belt...|$|R

On the other hand, no reaction was observed for ThO 2 up to 773 K. Similar results were obtained for the mixture of U 3 O 8 and ThO 2.
