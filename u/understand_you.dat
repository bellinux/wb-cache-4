The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E

We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we <b>understand</b> <b>you</b> waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Constable was {{a member}} of the Whig party, likely due to the close {{friendship}} of his father-in-law and Henry Clay. Due mainly to frustrations over how the Whig party had treated him, Constable decided to switch parties. He is quoted as saying, [...] "that the party was dominated by old fogies who are indifferent to younger men." [...] His inclination toward the Democratic Party almost led to a fistfight between himself and Lincoln in a tavern in Paris, Illinois. Lincoln was quoted as saying, [...] "Mr. Constable, I <b>understand</b> <b>you</b> perfectly, and have noticed for some time that you have been slowly and cautiously picking your way over to the Democratic party." [...] After this heated exchange, the men reconciled, but by 1856 Lincoln claimed that Constable had left the party. In 1858, Constable was the Illinois elector at-large for the election of President James Buchanan, a Democrat.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012, it was {{reported}} that Marcus Bachmann had registered for Swiss citizenship and after it was finalized, Michele Bachmann automatically became a citizen as well. The Bachmanns and their three youngest children were granted citizenship on March 19, 2012. They had been eligible for this under Swiss nationality law because Marcus Bachmann's parents were Swiss. Bachmann denied that she or her husband had recently applied for Swiss citizenship, saying that her husband had already been a dual citizen as the son of Swiss immigrants, and that she had automatically acquired Swiss citizenship under then-current Swiss law when she married him in 1978.
