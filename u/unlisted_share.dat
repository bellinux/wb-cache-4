State taxes commonly include payroll tax levied on businesses, a poker-machine tax on businesses that offer gambling services, land tax on people and businesses that own land and most significantly, stamp duty on sales of land (in every state) and other items (chattels in some states, <b>unlisted</b> <b>shares</b> in others, and even sales of contracts in some states).|$|R

50|$|The Stock Exchange Act 1988 {{established}} {{a small but}} thriving exchange which {{is run by the}} Stock Exchange of Mauritius Ltd (SEM), a private limited company. The act also established the Stock Exchange Commission (SEC), which controls and supervises stock exchange operations. Two markets operated: the Official List and the Over-The-Counter Market (for <b>unlisted</b> <b>shares).</b> There are around 40 companies listed on the Official List, and around eighty companies quoted in the Over-The-Counter Market. 10 companies are quoted for their debentures. The exchange has classified these companies into seven categories, namely: banks and insurance, industry, investments, sugar, commerce, leisure and hotels and transport. There are also two dual listed funds quoted both on the London Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Mauritius.|$|R
50|$|The IASB did {{not approve}} CMUCPP in 1989 as an {{inflation}} accounting model. CMUCPP by measuring financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power incorporates an alternative capital concept, financial capital maintenance concept and profit determination concept to the Historical Cost capital concept, financial capital maintenance concept and profit determination concept. CMUCPP requires all constant real value non-monetary items, e.g. issued share capital, retained income, all other items in Shareholders Equity, trade debtors, trade creditors, deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes payable and receivable, all items in the profit and loss account, etc. to be valued in units of constant purchasing power on a daily basis. Variable real value non-monetary items, e.g. property, plant, equipment, listed and <b>unlisted</b> <b>shares,</b> inventory, etc. are valued in terms of IFRS and updated daily.|$|R
50|$|CMUCPP was {{authorized}} in IFRS in the IASB's original Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, Par. 104 (a) in 1989. In {{terms of the}} original Framework, (1989) Par 104 (a) accountants choose CMUCPP to implement a financial capital concept of invested purchasing power, i.e. financial CMUCPP {{at all levels of}} inflation and deflation instead of the traditional HC concept of invested money. They thus implement a CPP financial capital maintenance concept by measuring financial capital maintenance in units of CPP instead of traditional HC nominal monetary units and they implement a CPP profit/loss determination concept in units of CPP instead of in real value eroding nominal monetary units under HCA. Examples of constant items are issued share capital, retained income, capital reserves, all other items in shareholders´ equity, trade debtors, trade creditors, provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities, all other non-monetary payables, all other non-monetary receivables, salaries, wages, rentals, all other items in the income statement, etc. Examples of variable items are property, plant, equipment, listed and <b>unlisted</b> <b>shares,</b> inventory, foreign exchange, etc. Variable items are valued in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) at for example fair value, market value, recoverable value, present value, net realizable value, etc. or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) during non-hyperinflationary periods.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to examine the performance of an equity based crowdfunding campaign, as well as seeking to describe the risks, complications and the opportunities {{that this kind of}} funding brings. The study was conducted by an empirical case study of a company that was about to initiate an equity based crowdfunding campaign. The conclusion is that the planning of an equity based crowdfunding campaign is time consuming and requires knowledge in many different areas. Therefore it is important to identify in which areas skills and resources already are available within the company, and where it must be obtained through a learning process. The report also highlights that equity based crowdfunding, because of legal restrictions surrounding the issue of <b>unlisted</b> <b>shares,</b> can not be marketed as other types of crowdfunding. This leads to the conclusion that those who invest in equity based crowdfunding do not necessarily belong to the crowd that crowdfunding is generally associated with. Arguments can be made that this crowdfunding model rather resemble traditional angel networks. A technical study was also made about the company's products. The result of the technical study can be used by customers to get a clearer understanding of the company's products, but also by the company itself as a good insight into how their products work in practice and to develop the existing products. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Asset {{restrictions}} are prudential regulations applied by regulators around the globe. In essence, they prescribe asset restrictions as a risk-control measure to establish appropriate capital requirements for regulated institutions. The aim of prudential regulations and standards {{is to protect}} consumers who acquire the products and services offered by these institutions. Pension funds in Namibia must comply with Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, 1956. Regulation 28 is the prudential regulation that governs investment limits for pension funds. The regulation prescribes maximum investment limits for all asset classes. In 2009, the government made a policy decision to amend Regulation 28 to prescribe a minimum investment in <b>unlisted</b> <b>shares</b> (private equity) that would be applicable to pension funds, long-term insurance companies and unit trusts. The objective of government is to use Regulation 28 as a macroeconomic tool to control capital flows and channel capital to domestic companies. The regulation will stimulate economic activities, local ownership, create employment and reduce poverty, which will eventually facilitate economic development. In addition, this objective {{has the potential to}} assist the development of the private equity sector in Namibia. The implication of this development is that retirement savings will be utilised to achieve macroeconomic objectives and develop an industry sector. Private equity has shown tremendous growth in developed economies and is beginning to grow in Africa as well. Private equity is a sector that has the potential to realise excellent returns for pension funds, provided the risks are adequately controlled and managed. The study proposes a regulatory framework for unlisted investments (private equity) by pension funds. The framework considers risks and proposes how to best manage and control them. The conclusion is to abolish a prescribed minimum and to increase the domestic asset requirement. Ultimately, regulators exist to protect consumers while the development of markets is a secondary priority...|$|R
40|$|In Korea, <b>unlisted</b> stock <b>shares</b> are {{accepted}} as payment for inheritance tax. In {{the case of}} insufficient cash, a taxpayer can pay the government with listed or unlisted stocks (hereinafter referred to as “tax payment in kind”). The drawback of this tax payment system is that receiving tax paid with stocks {{is subject to the}} valuation of the government and selling the stocks to an open market requires another valuation. The results of these two valuations show considerable differences, and, therefore, the selling price in the open market is very low. This study analyzes how taxpayers recognize the differences in the valuation results of these unlisted stocks and how the differences affect the pricing for repurchasing the stocks from the open market. Results show that high valuation of unlisted stocks in tax payment in kind drives buyers to lower the purchasing price in the open market. This finding implies a problem in the government’s valuation method of unlisted stocks collected as tax...|$|R
50|$|Foreign-exchange {{reserves}} are called reserve {{assets in the}} balance of payments and are located in the capital account. Hence, they are usually {{an important part of the}} international investment position of a country. The {{reserves are}} labeled as reserve assets under assets by functional category. In terms of financial assets classifications, the reserve assets can be classified as Gold bullion, Unallocated gold accounts, Special drawing rights, currency, Reserve position in the IMF, interbank position, other transferable deposits, other deposits, debt securities, loans, equity (listed and <b>unlisted),</b> investment fund <b>shares</b> and financial derivatives, such as forward contracts and options. There is no counterpart for reserve assets in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments. In the Central Bank’s Balance Sheet, foreign exchange reserves are assets, along with domestic credit.|$|R
