5|$|Msida Bastion – a {{polygonal}} asymmetrical bastion with a demi-bastioned retrenchment. A cemetery {{was built}} on its <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Stela 6 is {{slightly}} {{to the north of}} Stela5, bearing hieroglyphic text. This stela was damaged in antiquity when the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> was broken off and erected by an altar nearby.|$|E
50|$|The Brazilian tinamou is {{approximately}} 28 cm in length. It has reddish-brown <b>upper</b> <b>parts,</b> rufous throat, grey breast, whitish belly, and brown legs. The female {{has a distinct}} black barring and is ochraceous on its <b>upper</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{squirrel}} has bright chestnut-brown <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> {{with orange}} tips {{to some of}} the hairs and pale rufous underparts. It is pale fulvous {{on the top of the}} head, shoulders, and in a narrow streak in the middle of the <b>upper</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} most {{abundant}} in Pennsylvania, {{especially in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> of the Susquehanna River drainage.

5|$|The Mahanoy Creek {{watershed}} is 66 percent forested land, 21 percent agricultural land, 9 percent barren mined land, and 4 percent developed land. However, the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of Mahanoy Creek is 50 percent forested land, 44 percent mined land, 5 percent developed land, {{and less}} than 1 percent agricultural land. There are six boroughs in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the watershed. There are a total of 28 municipalities in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the main sequence {{in the region of}} class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars {{in this part of the}} instability strip that intersects the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} period some {{religious}} institutions displayed ancient Greek coins {{of the island}} of Rhodes as specimens of the Thirty Pieces of Silver. The obverses of these coins showed a facing head of the sun god Helios, with rays projecting around the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of it. These rays were interpreted as {{a representation of the}} Crown of Thorns.|$|E
50|$|The regal sunbird {{is a small}} species. The {{adult male}} has head and <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> an {{iridescent}} golden-green, dark wings and tail and a boldly-marked red and yellow breast and belly. The adult female has dull olive <b>upper</b> <b>parts,</b> with yellowish, faintly streaked underparts. The male is distinctive, but the female could {{be confused with the}} female Rockefeller's sunbird (Cinnyris rockefelleri), though this has a paler throat. The female Ruwenzori double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris stuhlmanni) and the female northern double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris reichenowi) are also similar, but these have greener <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> and yellower underparts; another similar species is the variable sunbird (Cinnyris venustus), but the regal can be recognised by the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> being more olive and the underparts a more uniform yellowish-olive.|$|R

5|$|Originally, the {{transept}} chambers {{would have}} been covered with one large (or several smaller) capstones, enclosing the chambers containing human remains. The earth covering and the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the cromlech have been removed, leaving the passageway and lateral chambers fully exposed. There is no record of a capstone having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|St. Peter and St. Paul Bastion – a two-tiered corner bastion on {{the eastern}} {{extremity}} of the land front. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> is now the Upper Barrakka Gardens, while the lower part contains the Saluting Battery. The 19th-century Fort Lascaris is located below the bastion.|$|E

5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, barrel-shaped {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur on the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> {{of its body}} that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands {{can be found in}} the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.|$|E
5|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{is hardly}} in proportion. Male raceme, 30 inches long, of which 20 are {{occupied by the}} flowers; <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> and flowers clothed with short rusty pubescence. Peduncles slender, simple or bifid. Fruiting raceme stout. Peduncles 1½ inches long, often bifid. Capsule, ¾ inch long, ⅓ broad, rather turgid, densely covered with rusty tomentum.|$|E
5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle {{but is not}} under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.|$|E

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its <b>upper</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Guianan {{streaked}} antwren has a maximum length of about 10 cm. The male is black with the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> streaked with white and two white wing bars. The underparts are whitish {{with a few}} black streaks. The female has a rufous-cinnamon head, black and white streaked <b>upper</b> <b>parts,</b> an orange-buff throat and pale buff underparts. This antwren's voice is an unmelodious rattle.|$|R
50|$|The middle {{portion of}} the {{movement}} lasts 48 bars and is also symmetrical in structure, made up of two fugal sections and a central episode in which the non-thematic material in the ritornello is heard again. The new fugue subject is five bars long and is first heard in the violin with a simple figured bass accompaniment in quavers. The subject is then taken up in the upper keyboard, while the violin part plays figures drawn from the continuo line, including characteristic quaver leaps in sixths. A two bar bridging passages with semiquaver scales in parallel thirds in the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> leads into the statement of the fugue subject in the bass line, while the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> develop the accompanying motifs in syncopated exchanges. At the close semiquaver scales in the bass merge into the semiquaver arpeggios from the second interlude in the ritornello, which is reprised in full with the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> exchanged. It {{is followed by a}} reprise of the first interlude, which leads directly into a repetition of the entire fugal section with the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> exchanged. This time at the close the semiquaver scales in the bass line are joined by parallel scales in the <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> for the final cadence that heralds the concluding rendition of the ritornello.|$|R

5|$|Between {{the mouth}} of Dry Hollow and {{the mouth of}} Bunnell Run, the waters of Hammersley Fork are a Rosgen type F and a Rosgen type C stream. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the stretch of the stream between Dry Hollow and Nelson Branch is a Rosgen type C stream. The middle part of the stretch is a Rosgen type B stream and the lower part is a Rosgen type F to D stream.|$|E
5|$|During archaeological {{investigation}} of the ballcourt a well-preserved tennoned ballgame marker was found placed on the western bench. Its original placement was indicated by {{a hole in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the ballcourt wall. The second marker that would have been placed directly opposite the first has never been found and the area of the ballcourt wall where it would have been had collapsed prior to excavations. Replicas of the ballcourt marker have been placed in both walls; the original is in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m). This {{generated}} a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted {{to the edge of}} the lake to explore the remains. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.|$|E
