However, these rules are relatively static and have been implemented differently based on different national understandings in a de-centralised, State-based manner. This article argues that greater global uniformity in maritime transport rules could be achieved through {{the framework of the}} World Trade Organization (‘WTO’). The WTO could update these rules dynamically, and could also enforce them. A WTO-based negotiating forum could generate substantive, uniform seaborne cargo rules in two ways. Through a selective referral approach, it could incorporate the existing rules — including the un-administered rules — within the WTO framework. It could also develop new uniform rules. The WTO also provides international communities with a quasi-judicial procedure — the WTO dispute settlement mechanism (‘dsm’) — which could also be used to protect and promote the global uniformity of seaborne cargo rules.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study optimal {{congestion}} pricing in a wage bargaining model. We first show that, {{compared to a}} competitive labour market environment, wage bargaining may lead to substantially different optimal transport taxes. Second, bargaining implies that exogenous increases in congestion levels and in transport taxes raise negotiated wages and reduce employment levels; the strength of these effects depends on the union's attitude towards transport issues. Third, we show that the optimal <b>uniform</b> <b>transport</b> tax positively depends {{on the impact of}} congestion on negotiated wages, and negatively on the wage effects of the congestion tax itself. Using a standard specification for union preferences, the optimal transport tax exceeds the marginal external congestion cost to the extent that transport flows include demand by people who have no employment. Finally, if taxes can be differentiated according to trip purpose, the tax structure implies shifting the tax burden away from the employed. Wage bargaining Congestion pricing Commuting...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{electrode}} configurations, such as coplanar grids, {{have been}} successful in mitigating the effects of poor hole transport in CdZnTe gamma-ray detectors. However, poor material uniformity remains a major problem preventing the widespread application of such detectors in gamma-ray spectroscopy. <b>Uniform</b> electron <b>transport</b> is critical for achieving good gamma-ray detection performance in the coplanar-grid configuration. The authors have investigated the use of alpha-particle response as a quick and simple electron transport uniformity screening technique for material selection, and as a method to study other spectral broadening mechanisms in coplanar-grid detectors. The method consists of uniformly illuminating, with an alpha-particle source, the cathode side of the CdZnTe crystal in either a planar or a coplanar-grid detector configuration. In the planar geometry, the variation in the measured pulse heights is dictated in large part by the uniformity of the electron transport. An alpha-particle spectrum that has a single sharp peak with little background indicates <b>uniform</b> electron <b>transport</b> and, consequently, that the CdZnTe crystal should result in a coplanar-grid detector with good gamma-ray detection performance. In the coplanar geometry, the measured pulse-height variation provides information on additional sources of spectral broadening.

Linear sorption in the fracture and matrix and radioactive decay are also treated. The solution is for steady, <b>uniform</b> <b>transport</b> velocities within the fracture and matrix, but allows for independent specification {{of each of the}} velocities. The problem is first solved in terms of the solute concentrations that result from an instantaneous point source. Superposition integrals are then used to derive the solute mass flux at a fixed downstream position from an instantaneous point source and for the solute concentrations that result from a continuous point source. Solutions are derived for cases with the solute source in the fracture and the solute source in the matrix. The analytical solutions are closed-form and are expressed in terms of algebraic functions, exponentials, and error functions. Comparisons between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations, as well as sensitivity studies, are presented.

We investigated to what extent repeat 3 D surface electrical resistance tomography (ERT) {{can be used to}} monitor transport of a salt-tracer plume under close to natural gradient conditions. The aim is to estimate {{groundwater flow}} velocities and pathways at a site located within a riparian groundwater system adjacent to the perialpine Thur River in northeastern Switzerland. Our ERT time-lapse images provide constraints on the plume's shape, flow direction, and velocity. These images allow the movement of the plume to be followed for 35 m. Although the hydraulic gradient is only 1. 43 parts per thousand, the ERT time-lapse images demonstrate that the plume's center of mass and its front propagate with velocities of 2 x 10 (- 4) m/s and 5 x 10 (- 4) m/s, respectively. These velocities are compatible with groundwater resistivity monitoring data in two observation wells 5 m from the injection well. Five additional sensors in the 5 - 30 m distance range did not detect the plume. Comparison of the ERT time-lapse images with a groundwater transport model and time-lapse inversions of synthetic ERT data indicate that the movement of the plume can be described for the first 6 h after injection by a <b>uniform</b> <b>transport</b> model.

40|$|A {{plan view}} {{geometric}} model for simple, parallel, differential displacements is presented. As an analogue for models of arcuate mountain belt formation {{we use the}} model to predict strain patterns produced by parallel displacement {{in front of a}} rigid versus deformable indenter. A rigid indenter is simulated by an irregular quadrilateral displaced a constant amount along its hinterland boundary. A deformable indenter is simulated by an irregular quadrilateral displaced along a hinterland boundary that is allowed to rotate. Some simple test cases show that the deformable indenter model leads to a pattern of strain very similar to that encountered in arcuate mountain belts. Short axes orientations are most deviated from the transport direction along the lateral edges of the model with minimum displacement and shortening and vary across the central domain, mirroring strain features with variable orientations from mountain belts such as fold trends and minor deformation features such as horizontal stylolite peaks. The rigid indenter model also generates short axes deviated from the transport direction but showing far less variation. Displacement–strain relationships from the Jura mountains (Switzerland and France) are quantified based upon a simplified version of the finite displacement field for the Jura fold–thrust belt of Philippe, Y. (1995) ["Rampes latérales et zones de transfer dans le chaines plissées". (Unpublished PhD thesis, Université de Savoie) ]. We find that the model short axis orientation pattern is very similar over at least the eastern and central Jura to the stylolite patterns from the region whilst the long axes closely match the fold axes trends. The model suggests that the Jura mountains could have formed {{as a result of a}} progressive deformation with <b>uniform</b> <b>transport</b> in a general northwest direction...|$|R
30|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} {{studies on the}} main determinants of the household’s decision to send children to work rather than to school can be grouped into two main veins: the demand for education, introduced by Becker (1964), {{and the one that}} focuses on the impact of various constraints affecting the supply of child labor, the demand for education, or both simultaneously. According to Becker (1964)’s theory, whether {{to send their children to}} school is the result of a trade-off between the expected returns and the cost of education (e.g., tuition, material, compulsory <b>uniform,</b> <b>transport,</b> and opportunity cost). It predicts that children may work because the net returns relative to alternative uses of time such as school attendance are low (compared with its cost) and the returns to work experience are relatively larger. The second vein highlights the effect of various constraints on the allocation of children’s time between school and work (Bhalotra 2007; Grimm 2011). Imperfections in the markets for labor and land (Bhalotra and Heady 2003), poverty (Jensen and Nielsen 1997; Basu and Van 1998), and credit market imperfections (Jacoby and Skoufias 1997; Ranjan 2001; Cigno and Rosati 2006) are the main set of constraints explaining the emergence of child labor and the concomitant fall-off in school attendance (Dammert 2010; De Vreyer et al. 2013; Senne 2014). All these constraints, in addition to the degree of altruism of the decision-taker in the household (Baland and Robinson 2000), drive the final decision about the child’s time allocation. This framework suggests how an external negative shock might affect the households’ decision in developing countries. In fact, even where incentives favor education over work, a household may be obliged by budget constraint to send a child to work. When poverty constraints are binding, the opportunity cost of studying is too high and parents are due to send children to work rather than to school. Moreover, when capital markets are imperfect, this model predicts that even altruistic parents may sacrifice investments in children’s education.|$|R
30|$|Prior to the earthquake, {{the country}} had already {{one of the poorest}} {{education}} systems in the world. Right after its independence (in 1804), the importance of education was recognized and the first Constitution, promulgated in 1805, noted explicitly that “education shall be free. Primary education shall be compulsory. State education shall be free at every level.” These principles were never put into practice. The education offered to Haitian children was, and still is, inadequate in terms of quality, quantity, and accessibility (Lunde 2010). Both the direct costs of attending school (e.g., tuition and other fees, mandatory <b>uniforms,</b> <b>transport,</b> books) and the opportunity costs, particularly in the form of lost labor for the household, remain barriers to achieving universal primary enrollment and completion. The private education system has grown by default and continuously, from 20 % in the 1959 – 1960 to 75 % in 1995 – 1996 (Salmi 2000). In 1997, the Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sport (MENJS) set out a National Education and Training Plan (PNEF) to reform the education system in Haiti. The reformed Haitian education system is used as reference here, even if some parts of the country, especially in rural areas, the traditional educational system still operates (Lunde 2010). In the reformed system, education comprises three core levels: (i) pre-school for 3 to 5 years old, not compulsory; (ii) primary education for 6 to 14 years old; and (iii) secondary education for 15 to 18 years old (see Table 7 in the Appendix). The legal age for admission to school is 6 years, and in the reformed system, children who go through normal progression complete primary at the age of 14. In fact, the last school census before the earthquake (2002 – 2003) highlighted that the average age of students in grade 6, for instance, was 16 years old, when the corresponding age for that grade should be 11 or 12 years old (Adelman and Holland 2015).|$|R
40|$|Monolith {{reactors}} are {{studied with}} models and simulations, with particular {{attention given to}} the catalytic converter. It is found that previously noted differences between one- and two-dimensional monolith reactor models are largely due to artifacts introduced into the two-dimensional models through the boundary conditions at the reactor entrance. These artifacts can be avoided by modeling a pre-entrance region. Difficulties have been encountered in previous studies which attempt to match two-dimensional catalytic combuster models to data from experimental systems, which are essentially three-dimensional in character. These difficulties can be resolved with {{a new approach to}} choosing parameters for two-dimensional models. Considering that the procedure for choosing parameters for one-dimensional model approximations to either two- or three-dimensional systems is well understood, it is recommended that parameters be chosen for two-dimensional models such that one-dimensional model approximations are preserved. In a related development, it is recommended that the merits of various passage shapes be evaluated by comparing reactors with identical one-dimensional approximation. Using this basis for comparison the inherent merits of various geometries are found to be far less than had previously been judged. An elementary analysis of a monolith reactor indicated that there is an optimal heat transfer coefficient at each point in the reactor. If a reactor is designed with an optimal heat transfer coefficient profile, the required amount of catalyst could be only one fourth of the minimum for any <b>uniform</b> <b>transport</b> rate profile. This result is not altered when detailed models and complex kinetics are considered. A simple way to approach this optimum is to use a graded cell monolith. Additional improvements may be achieved with complex geometries such as reactor passages with lips at the front. Finally, the usual conception that with increasing temperature, density, residence time, and conversion go down, is inaccurate. While density is decreasing, diffusivity is increasing at twice the rate. Higher temperatures lead to higher transport rates which usually means greater conversion. Incidental to this study it is found that the there is little radial convective transport in the neighborhood of a reaction zone...|$|R

As {{a result of}} the Beazley Defence review white paper in 1984, full military support was withdrawn from school based cadet units, now classed as Limited Support Units (LSU). Military support for LSUs was limited solely to the discretionary loan of equipment for Annual camps. <b>Uniforms,</b> <b>transport,</b> rations and personal equipment all had to be funded by the school, parents or community organisations such as the RSL. As a result, most government school based cadet units closed between 1984 and 1986. Instead, full military support was provided to cadet units based at existing Army depots, now classified as Regional Cadet Units (RCU). Some school based units in disadvantaged areas or located some distance from a military depot were given RCU status. Many RCUs attracted cadets from the nearby school based units recently closed down. In NSW, the first RCU formed was 20 RCU Ashfield, originally Punchbowl High School Cadets, and then based at the 2 Construction Group depot of RAE in Haberfield, Sydney in early 1984. By 1998, however all cadet units again received full support. During 1993, the Australian Cadet Corps was renamed the Australian Army Cadet Corps. Many cadet units were now re-equipped with DPCU uniforms replacing the older green uniforms. In 2001, the Australian Army Cadet Corps was renamed the Australian Army Cadets as part of major reforms brought about with the Topley review and during 2004, the title of Regional Cadet Unit (RCU) was dropped in favour of Army Cadet Unit (ACU).
