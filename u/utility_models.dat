25|$|In modern usage, {{the term}} patent usually {{refers to the}} right granted to anyone who invents any new, useful, and non-obvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or {{composition}} of matter. Some other types of intellectual property rights are also called patents in some jurisdictions: industrial design rights are called design patents in the US, plant breeders' rights are sometimes called plant patents, and <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> and Gebrauchsmuster are sometimes called petty patents or innovation patents.|$|E
25|$|A {{major reason}} why {{quantified}} models of utility are influential {{today is that}} risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory. Quantified <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies risk aversion. In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of prudence, which means convex marginal utility.|$|E
50|$|Most {{countries}} having <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> laws {{require that}} the invention be new.

Some countries exclude particular subject matter from <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> protection. For example, methods, plants and animals are normally barred from <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> protection.|$|R

25|$|However, many {{important}} neo-classical economists employed more sophisticated psychological explanations, including Francis Edgeworth, Vilfredo Pareto, and Irving Fisher. Economic psychology {{emerged in the}} 20th century {{in the works of}} Gabriel Tarde, George Katona, and Laszlo Garai. Expected utility and discounted <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> began to gain acceptance, generating testable hypotheses about decision-making given uncertainty and intertemporal consumption, respectively. Observed and repeatable anomalies eventually challenged those hypotheses, and further steps were taken by the Nobel Prize-winner Maurice Allais, for example, in setting out the Allais paradox, a decision problem he first presented in 1953 that contradicts the expected utility hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{has always}} been an {{important}} export market for Land Rovers of various models, but especially the <b>utility</b> <b>models.</b> 80-inch Series I models were sold to the Australian government in the late 1940s for work on civil engineering projects such as dams and road construction, which brought the vehicle to the buying public's attention. Large sales followed and in the 1950s Land Rover established factories in Australia to build CKD kits shipped from the Solihull factory. The Land Rover continued to sell well throughout the 1960s in Series II guise, commanding some 90% of the off-road market, and with practically every farm having at least one Land Rover.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Kawasaki {{proposed}} {{the development of}} a utility-orientated derivative of the OH-1 in response to the fledgling UH-X programme, which intended to replace the JGSDF's outdated fleet of Fuji-built Bell UH-1J Iroquois helicopters. This variant, which would have used the OH-1 as a base, would have featured a new cabin, avionics, transmission and engines, but would have also retained a high level of commonality between the observation and <b>utility</b> <b>models.</b> In 2006, the Japanese government approved a request to fund development of a more powerful variant of the OH-1’s Mitsubishi TS1-10 engine. In March 2007, Kawasaki was reportedly close to finalizing its plans for the utility-orientated OH-1 derivative of the OH-1. In 2012, a refreshed proposal for the UH-X requirement was made by Kawasaki, emphasizing its use of OH-1 technology. In July 2015, the Japanese Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced its decision to accept a rival bid made by Fuji/Bell to domestically produce {{a modified version of the}} Bell 412 to meet the UH-X requirement instead.|$|E
