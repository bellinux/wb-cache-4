It is possible that public pensions buffer access to healthcare in older persons during times of economic crisis, but to our knowledge, this has not been tested empirically in Europe. Methods We integrated panel data on 16 European countries for years 2004 – 2010 with indicators of public pension, unemployment insurance and sickness insurance entitlement from the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset and unmet need (due to cost) prevalence rates from EuroStat 2014 edition. Using country-level fixed-effects regression models, we evaluate whether greater public pension entitlement, which helps reduce old-age poverty, reduces the prevalence of <b>unmet</b> <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> in older persons and whether it reduces inequalities in <b>unmet</b> <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> across the income distribution.

RESULTS: We found that each 1 -unit increase in public pension entitlement is associated with a 1. 11 percentage-point decline in <b>unmet</b> <b>medical</b> <b>need</b> due to cost among over 65 s (95 % CI - 0. 55 to - 1. 66). This association is strongest for the lowest income quintile (1. 65 percentage points, 95 % CI - 1. 19 to - 2. 10). Importantly, we found consistent evidence that out-of-pocket payments were linked with greater unmet needs, but that this association was mitigated by greater public pension entitlement (β=- 1. 21 percentage points, 95 % CI - 0. 37 to - 2. 06).
