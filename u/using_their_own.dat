5|$|Oklahoma President David Boren wrote {{a letter}} to Big12 {{commissioner}} Kevin Weiberg asking for the loss to be erased from Oklahoma's record, something that Weiberg did not support.

5|$|Gyromancer is {{a puzzle}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by PopCap Games {{in collaboration with}} Square Enix. In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told {{through a series of}} cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.|$|E

During the Microsoft Press Conference at E3 2011, Ryse was announced as a Kinect-only title. The announcement entailed a prerendered trailer with minor gameplay footage. The gameplay footage featured players <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> body gestures to control the protagonist to fight against enemies, and perform actions like sword wielding, blocking attacks with a shield, and head-butting. The trailer served as a test for Crytek {{to see whether the}} general audience liked the Kinect features or not.|$|E
5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the game's 84 locations, deciding whether to ally themselves {{with one of the}} four factions or remain neutral. The game's plot concerns an apprentice Shaper and an Agent (whose name is Shanti), both members of a secretive sect of wizards who can create life by <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> life energy. They are sent on a mission to investigate a failing Shaper colony called Drypeak. When they arrive not all is well, the player becomes drawn into a four-way war which has been hidden from the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Apollo {{returns to}} Atlantis, the Asurans retaliate by {{launching}} a Stargate satellite that fires an energy beam, disabling the Apollo before {{zeroing in on}} Atlantis.

McKay (David Hewlett) and Zelenka (David Nykl) submerge the city {{to mitigate the effect}} of the beam, but this only buys them nine more hours before the city is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of the British landing force then {{separated from the}} main body and seized a third battery named laNeuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had come down from their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from Caroline, but the small French force was easily brushed aside by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the guns {{in the first two}} captured batteries and stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E
5|$|By the evening, a {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be stoned in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on the mob, which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between the soldiers and the mob. The fighting lasted for several hours, with the soldiers being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The soldiers brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob's cannons, soldiers charged one cannon's position, only to be knocked off their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.|$|E

5|$|Geneforge 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Sounds is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band N.E.R.D released June 10, 2008 on Star Trak Entertainment and Interscope Records in the United States. After ending their contract with Virgin Records in 2005, the band felt their previous album Fly or Die (2004) was too consistent. <b>Using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> money, the band recorded the album in Florida and California. The album was produced solely by record production duo The Neptunes, consisting of Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, with additional assistance by rock band Spymob and was mainly written by Williams. The album's title, {{as well as its}} content, revolves around the neurological phenomenon of synesthesia, the mixing of sensory modalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{episodes of}} the British {{documentary}} Meerkat Manor first premiered on Animal Planet International in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005. The programme was originally created by Caroline Hawkins, executive producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for Animal Planet International by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild. The original episodes are narrated by Bill Nighy. The Australian and American channels redubbed the episodes <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> narrators. the Australian episodes are narrated by Mike Goldman. In the US, episodes {{for the first}} three series were narrated by Sean Astin. For the fourth series, Astin was replaced with Stockard Channing.

30|$|One {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} is {{that it was impossible to}} assess whether the residents <b>used</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> prevalence beliefs to the right extent. Such an analysis would require assessing the residents’ beliefs about the likelihood of each disease producing the particular constellation of symptoms; these likelihoods are hard to quantify. Simpler cases in which the likelihood ratios can be quantified, such as making pre-post diagnostic judgments before vs. after a diagnostic test, suggest that medical professionals do not <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> pretest beliefs enough. Researchers in another study found that laypeople do not <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> base rate beliefs enough in a Bayesian updating task (Evans, Handley, Over, and Perham, 2002). Though we cannot specify, on the basis of the present study, whether the physicians <b>used</b> <b>their</b> prevalence beliefs as much as they ought to, the study demonstrates that they did <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> prevalence beliefs in a complicated task with many possible diagnoses.|$|R
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after {{appearing on the}} verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966. The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.|$|E
5|$|Carlos Menem {{ran for a}} {{new term}} as {{president}} in 2003, and Eduardo Duhalde tried to prevent it. Instead of holding primary elections within the PJ, the 2003 elections used {{a variant of the}} Ley de Lemas. All the Peronist candidates were allowed to run in the general election, <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> tickets. Although Kirchner ran for president with Duhalde's support, he was not the president's first choice. Trying to prevent a third term for Menem, Duhalde approached Santa Fe governor Carlos Reutemann and Córdoba governor José Manuel de la Sota; Reutemann declined, and De la Sota did not run because he was insufficiently popular. Duhalde also unsuccessfully approached Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá, and Roberto Lavagna, all of whom refused to run. Duhalde initially resisted supporting Kirchner, fearing that Kirchner would ignore him if elected. Kirchner run on the Front for Victory ticket, one of the several fronts put up by the PJ. Since Kirchner was identified with the centre-left, Duhalde appointed the centre-right Daniel Scioli as his vice-presidential candidate. Only a handful of Peronist governors supported either candidate; most remained neutral, awaiting the election to forge a relationship with the victor.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Wellington {{felt that}} the {{remainder}} of the day's events should be cancelled following the accident at Parkside, and proposed to return to Liverpool. However, a large crowd had gathered in Manchester to see the trains arrive, and was beginning to become unruly. Wellington was persuaded to continue to Manchester. By the time the trains reached the outskirts of Manchester the crowd had become hostile and was spilling onto the tracks. With local authorities unable to clear the tracks, the trains were obliged to drive at low speed into the crowd, <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> momentum to push people out of the way. Eventually they arrived at Liverpool Road railway station in Manchester to be met by a hostile crowd, who waved banners and flags against the Duke and pelted him with vegetables. Wellington refused to get off the train, and ordered that the trains return to Liverpool. Mechanical failures and an inability to turn the locomotives meant that most of the trains were unable to leave Manchester. While the Duke of Wellington's train left successfully, only three of the remaining seven locomotives were usable. These three locomotives slowly hauled a single long train of 24 carriages back to Liverpool, eventually arriving 6 hours late after having been pelted with objects thrown from bridges by the drunken crowds lining the track.|$|E
