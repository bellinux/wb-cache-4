The tax on the <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> begins by {{recognising}} and franking all past increment. We look only to the future; and for the future we say only this: that the community shall be the partner in any further increment above the present value after all the owner's improvements have been deducted. We say that the State and the municipality should jointly levy a toll upon the future <b>unearned</b> <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>land.</b> A toll <b>of</b> what? Of the whole? No. Of a half? No. Of a quarter? No. Of a fifth--that is the proposal of the Budget. And that is robbery, that is plunder, that is communism and spoliation, that is the social revolution at last, that is the overturn of civilised society, that {{is the end of}} the world foretold in the Apocalypse! Such is the increment tax about which so much chatter and outcry are raised at the present time, and upon which I will say that no more fair, considerate, or salutary proposal for taxation has ever been made in the House of Commons.|$|R

It is plain enough that in many other directions the same principles may be applied. The rectification of the ownership <b>of</b> <b>land</b> so as to eliminate the haphazard gains of the speculator and the <b>unearned</b> <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> wealth created by the efforts of others, is an obvious case in point.

6000|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} these objects {{there must be}} a [...] "Revolution in National Finance." [...] The present method of raising funds is denounced; and it is pointed out that only one quarter of the colossal expenditure made necessary by the war has been raised by taxation, and that the three quarters borrowed at onerous rates is sure to be a burden on the nation's future. The capital needed, when peace comes, to ensure a happy and contented democracy must be procured without encroaching on the minimum standard of life, and without hampering production. Indirect taxation must therefore be concentrated on those luxuries of which it is desirable that the consumption be discouraged. The steadily rising <b>unearned</b> <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> urban and mineral land ought, by appropriate direct taxation, to be brought into the public exchequer; [...] "the definite teachings of economic science are no longer to be disregarded." [...] Hence incomes are to be taxed above the necessary cost of family maintenance, private fortunes during life and at death; while a special capital levy must be made to pay off {{a substantial portion of the}} national debt.|$|R

Studies conducted in every plot includes the species composition and soil fertillity. The results showed that: (1) Tree composition in early and middle AF is dominated by woody tree (Sengon), while in advance AF is dominated by non-timber forest product (clove), (2) Low soil fertility in the study area is caused by high intensity of biomass harvesting and low fertilization dosage applied, (3) The <b>increment</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> productivity could be achieved by increasing the biomass input to the soil from organic fertilizer and crop waste...|$|R

40|$|The whole farm {{financial}} effects <b>of</b> laser <b>land</b> forming were analysed using a {{two stage}} modelling procedure.

In the second stage, the profit-maximising activity mixes with and without an increment became inputs into a spreadsheet model designed to undertake discounted cash flow analysis of investment in the increment. The transition over time of yields to the achievable levels for land formed layouts was accounted for in the spreadsheet model, as were the effects of taxation (including taxation concessions for land forming) and access to concessional credit from the Special Conservation Scheme of the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority. The analysis suggests that land forming the full area of a typical MIA rice farm is warranted, but that priority in allocating a limited capital budget {{should be given to}} areas requiring relatively low volumes of earth to be moved. A financial analysis of 'topsoiling' (replacing topsoil on areas from which it has been 'heavy cut' during land forming) showed it to generate considerably lower rates <b>of</b> return than <b>land</b> forming.
