40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LED) are a {{new source}} for replacing traditional light sources including under water illumination. As traditional <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> sources operate under a radiative transfer model, the luminous intensity is dispersed evenly at each emission angle, with the scattering factors included in the attenuation coefficient. By contrast, LED light sources are characterized by being highly directional, causing underwater luminous energy to vary with different emission angles. Thus, the traditional theory of underwater optical transfer becomes inapplicable when an <b>underwater</b> LED <b>lighting</b> module is designed. Therefore, to construct an underwater transfer model for LED light sources, this study employed the average cosine of the <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> field, the method for light scattering probability, the LED {{luminous intensity distribution curve}} (LIDC) and axial luminous intensity. Afterwards, an underwater LED fish-attracting lamp was designed.

40|$|Inter-tidal macro-algae {{communities}} often exhibit consistent broad {{vertical distribution}} patterns of species. The factors {{that set the}} distribution limits of these patterns have long intrigued marine ecologists, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon; however, no general conclusion has yet been drawn. Of all the factors limiting the occurence and development of photosynthetic organisms in aquatic environments, light is the most crucial and variable, {{and its role in}} the zonation of intertidal macro-algae is an unresolved issue. This thesis addresses the problem of whether the characteristics of the <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> field available to intertidal macro-algae could influence species distribution. Semi-diurnal in situ measurements of the <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> field were carried out at three sites on the south-west coast of England (United Kingdom)); the Hamble Estuary, Southampton Water and Swanage Bay. The tide is shown to significantly affect the water optical properties, and the tidal range and water transparency combine to produce important intensity and spectral fluctuations of the <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> field available to intertidal macro-algae. To circumvent the limitations of in situ field studies a mathematical model was developed to investigate the effect of tidal features on the availability of <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> to intertidal macro-algae across the compete tidal cycle. The results reveal the importance of the range and phase of the tide, and identify two significant zones within the intertidal zone which might depict where certain macro-algae flourish. Finally, the effect of vertical height of "transplanted" macro-algae in the intertidal zone and their pigment content was studies in situ. The results of this study were inconclusive but produce the foundation for future work. This study demonstrated that intertidal macro-algae are subjected to major intensity and spectral fluctuations in underwater irradiance, and there are two major zones within the intertidal zone which could potentially affect the zonation of some species.

40|$|A {{method is}} presented, using {{calculations}} of the <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> field, to examine viability of phytoplankton at depth. For this study, viability {{is defined as}} the ability of phytoplankton to harvest, and efficiently convert enough photons into primary production to overcome metabolic demands. How the available light field influences the production environment is examined. Changes in water column constituents, such as chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration, alter the spectral quality and quantity of the light field at depth. Certain species with specialized survival strategies, such as assemblages of photoprotective and light-harvesting accessory pigments, may be better-suited to 2 ̆ 7 making a living 2 ̆ 7 at depth in response to the spectral quality of the <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> field. Stations for study were identified from various cruises off the West Florida Shelf that exhibited variations in chlorophyll and/or CDOM concentration, including an optically complex, red-tide station.

In this study we examine the impact of varying loads of mineral particles and colored dissolved organic materials (CDOM) on water-leaving SSF signals using Hydrolight radiative transfer simulations.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>Underwater</b> <b>light</b> {{fields of}} two Icelandic lakes of {{volcanic}} origin and differing trophic status, Thingvallavam (oligotrophic) and Myvatn (eutrophic), were investigated. Gilvin and turbidity depth profiles were also measured. Diurnal variation in {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR) reached almost 3 orders of magnitude. Downward irradiance spectra were variable near the surface, but with increases in depth transmission peaks at 510, 560 and 570 nanometres (nm) became apparent in Thingvallavatn, Myvatn-East Basin and Myvatn-South Basin respectively. Upward irradiance transmission maxima shifted from 480 to 500 nm with depth in Thingvallavatn, while in Myvatn they remained near 570 nm. An irradiance trough at 520 nm was noted in both the upward and downward spectra of Thingvallavatn. The importance of phytoplankton (chlorophyll) and gilvin in mcdiiing the <b>underwater</b> <b>light</b> climate of Myvatn is clearly demonstrated. The mean downwelliig and upwellii imuiiance curves for Thingvallavam coincide very well with the spectral sensitivities of resident adult arctic charr.
