25|$|The next boat {{to receive}} the Italian {{attention}} was MTB 316, only 50 yards away from Scipione Africanos port side. The motor torpedo vessel caught fire and blew <b>up</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few seconds after the cruiser's salvos struck home. The craft, commanded by lieutenant Richard Adams and with a crew of eleven, sank with all hands. The explosion took place {{so close to the}} cruiser that pieces from MTB 316s machinery and hull fell aboard Scipione Africano. The analysis of these remains produced some controversy, when Italian sources claimed to have sunk MTB 305, not at the Mediterranean theatre at the time, on the basis of an inscription from a recovered wooden panel.|$|E

25|$|Stoke, however, made a poor {{start to}} 2013 picking <b>up</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> point in January and a {{frustrating}} transfer window saw just two new arrivals American winger Brek Shea and England goalkeeper Jack Butland. Performances and results remained poor in February and Pulis came under heavy criticism from supporters after a uninspiring home defeat against West Ham. Victories against Queens Park Rangers and Norwich City saw Stoke avoid {{the threat of}} relegation and they finished the 2012–13 Premier League season in 13th position. It was a season of little progress at Stoke, and Pulis left the club on 21 May 2013 after a meeting with club chairman Peter Coates. Speaking after his departure, Pulis revealed that he was disappointed by Coates' decision but accepted his reasons. He was replaced by another Welsh manager, Mark Hughes.|$|E
25|$|The {{percentage}} of the Brussels population using French in public life was between 5 and 10 percent in 1760, increasing to 15 percent in 1780. According to authenticated archives and various official documents, it appears that a fifth of municipal declarations and official orders were written in French. Twenty years later this rose to a quarter; however, {{over half of the}} official documents in French originated in the French-speaking bourgeoisie, who made <b>up</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> tenth of the population. In 1760 small businesses and artisans wrote only 4 percent of their documents in French; by 1780 this had risen to 13 percent. In private life, however, Dutch was still by far the most-used language. For the Austrian Habsburg administration French was the language of communication, although the communiqué from the Habsburgs was seldom seen by commoners of Brussels.|$|E

Although they again picked <b>up</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> point, Wenger {{believed it was}} a useful one: [...] "Provided Bolton keep playing like that, we will look back at this result and feel very happy. They {{are as good as}} a team as we have played." [...] On Boxing Day, Henry scored twice for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three days later, the team played Southampton. The only goal of the match came in the first half: Henry's through pass found Pirès [...] "who slid the ball beneath the exposed Antti Niemi". The win meant Arsenal had gone half the season without losing and the team according to The Times had begun to [...] "establish an aura of invincibility". Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, with 45 points from 19 matches. They were one point behind leaders Manchester United and three ahead of Chelsea.|$|E

[...] No arrangement was therefore made, and as all the other ladies were in the drawing-room before Lizzie came down, she had to give him his welcome in the midst of the family circle. She did it very well. Perhaps she had thought of it, and made her arrangements. When he came forward to greet her, she put her cheek <b>up,</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little, so that he might see that he was expected to kiss it;--but so little, that should he omit to do so, there might be no visible awkwardness. It must be acknowledged on Lizzie's behalf, that she could always avoid awkwardness. He did touch her cheek with his lips, blushing as he did so. She had her ungloved hand in his, and, still holding him, returned into the circle. She said not a word; and what he said was of no moment;--but they had met as lovers, and any of the family who had allowed themselves to imagine that even yet the match might be broken, now unconsciously abandoned that hope.
