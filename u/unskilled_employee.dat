In the context of regional autonomy era, the BUMD will be playing a very important role in increasing of financial contribution to the real regional income of the region. The problems are, how will this mission be achieved, and what is the business strategy for improving the regional enterprise performance? By aligning human resource strategy, to business strategy, these problems will be analyzed. Strategic business goals should never be considered without linking them with human resource strategy. Based on human resource perspective, the BUMD will therefore be successful to achieve the mission, when it is managed by professional managers and skilled employees.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The topics of motivation and job satisfaction have been of interest to researchers over the past decades. Many researchers and practitioners have studied the driving factors to motivate staff in the workplace, but no specific findings have shown correlation between motivation and job satisfaction. Problems of motivation and job satisfaction have continued to plague many developing countries like Malaysia. This study {{is an attempt to}} improve the understanding of the human contribution to variability in manufacturing industries and the focus areas are work motivation, satisfaction and performance as well as relationships with learning behaviours of employees in the workplace. The research work can be categorized into three parts. The first part consists of pilot study which was conducted to determine the practicality and validity of method/instruments used in the research. The pilot study also helped to correct the flaws/weaknesses of the method before employing it in the full-scale research study. Secondly, an experimental study was carried out to identify the motivation, satisfaction, performance and learning behaviour of <b>unskilled</b> and skilled <b>employees</b> doing simple or complex tasks individually or in group. The final part was an industrial study conducted with 356 employees from various positions and backgrounds in selected manufacturing industries in Malaysia. Based on the findings, {{it has been shown that}} <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> preferred doing complex tasks in a group rather than doing simple tasks and skilled employees preferred doing complex tasks individually rather than in a group. It increased their work motivation, satisfaction and performance. It was found that task identity (simple tasks) and learning behaviours (individual learning of <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees)</b> can be the reason for employees to leave in the future. The task identity (task complexity) can be an important factor in job design in organisations and it is significant in the learning process of <b>unskilled</b> and skilled <b>employees</b> in manufacturing industries, particularly in Malaysia. It was also found that learning in a team (group) appears to be a very significant factor in workplace learning for both <b>unskilled</b> and skilled <b>employees.</b> The study has shown that there are relationships between motivational and learning behaviours of skilled and <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> and this knowledge is expected to be useful for employers and policy makers in organisations especially in manufacturing industries in Malaysia...|$|R

30|$|The article shows {{evidence}} that permanent (open-ended contract) workers, {{the sum of}} skilled and unskilled, display a higher long-run elasticity to real wage than temporary ones (see Table  1). This finding {{is in line with}} the substitution between temporary and permanent labour during the sample period. Skilled permanent and temporary workers have lower real wage elasticities than the respective <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees.</b> Under the conditional specification of labour demand, the temporary unskilled workers show an own-price elasticity of −[*] 0.438 and the skilled of −[*] 0.256. This elasticity for unskilled workers with open-ended contracts is −[*] 1.109 while for skilled workers it is −[*] 0.682.

The lowest estimate for temporary unskilled workers (Fig.  6 d) is found in Medellín (0.619) and the highest in Manizales (4.047).

The empirical analysis is carried out on both firm- and individual-level data. A key finding is that industry, region, and notably human capital explain {{only a small part of}} the foreign-domestic ownership wage differential. Both white and blue collar workers as well as skilled and <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> obtain a foreign ownership wage premium.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} argued that the effects of inward FDI on skill {{upgrading}} and wage inequality depend on the outcome of specialisation according to comparative advantages. However, predicting the overall impact of FDI on wage inequality is complex depending on country specific effects, namely how large are differences in skilled and unskilled wages and the skill intensity of employment in foreign-owned firms compared to domestic ones, as well as the relative size of employment in domestic and foreign-owned firms (Zulfiu-Alili, 2014). Hence, the effect of foreign ownership on relative wages and skill intensity will vary between sectors, across countries and over time. The effect of FDI on the skill intensity of employment in transition economies is analysed using the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) undertaken in three waves 2002, 2005 and 2009. The question to be addressed is whether foreign-owned firms employ a more educated and skilled workforce in comparison to domestic-owned firms. Results suggest that foreign-owned firms have a better educated labour force but have a lower share of skilled and <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> compared to domestic firms...|$|R
40|$|The US {{labour market}} is {{characterized}} by a high skill wage mark-up and low unemployment, while the German labour market has a low skill wage mark-up and a high, mainly unskilled unemployment rate. This paper adds an innovative labour supply explanation to the discussion how these distinct labour market equilibria could arise. Skill-biased technological change induces training needs for the employees willing to work in the skilled labour market and increases relative skill demand. In a simple general equilibrium model, this paper shows that skilled insiders in the USA enjoy higher rents and increase the skilled wage mark-up stronger than in Germany in the wake of skill-biased technological change. The reason is that the unskilled outsiders in the USA do not possess a powerful credible threat to improve their position. This is a consequence from higher training and education costs in the USA for <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> and unemployed. In Germany, the lower skill wage mark-up leads to an increased relative skill demand which is not matched by the skill supply and therefore mis-match unemployment arises.

Historically, blacks were confined to non- or semi-skilled jobs. [...] While this can be partially attributed to lack of proper qualifications, [...] Duke’s Vice President in charge of Business and Finance, Charles B. Huestis, openly admitted that Duke “practice wholesale racial discrimination in its hiring policies.” [...] The salaries of these non-skilled workers reflected additional inequality, as maids and janitors, all who were black, received wages between $1.15-1.50 per hour— well below the minimum wage of $1.60. [...] Workers were also disadvantaged in other regards, as the University had no grievance procedure, policy for summer layoffs, or job classification system. Furthermore, the University ignored the seniority system in terms of job advancement and firing procedures. Suppressing workers’ voices in the formation of workplace policies, Duke encouraged <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> to simply make complaints, which their superiors then ignored. [...] Thus, the poor working conditions, low wages, racism, and desire to secure more authority and control in the workplace provided sufficient fuel for Duke workers to consider forming a union.|$|R
40|$|Based on merged {{data from}} the IAB-establishment panel survey and the {{historic}} files of the employment statistics register, a translog cost system was estimated for six qualification groups (blue- and white-collar workers stratified into unskilled, skilled and highly skilled employees) for West German production industries for the year 1995. Substitution possibilities between differently qualified employees are investigated at the establishment level. The derived substitutional relationships within the blue-collar workers were {{very similar to those}} within the white collar workers. Skilled employees and, to a lesser extent, highly skilled employees are substitutes for the unskilled. This could at least partly explain the rise in unemployment amongst the unskilled. In contrast, the demand for skilled workers does not depend on the wage of the highly skilled employees and vice versa. The frequently cited results that the own-wage demand elasticity decreases with skill, can be confirmed between skilled and highly skilled employees, but not between skilled and <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees.</b> The elasticities of substitution between blue collar and white collar workers are relatively low; unskilled, skilled and highly skilled blue collar workers are found to be complements to the analogue group of white-collar workers.

40|$|Employees in many {{countries}} increasingly complain about high and rising levels of stress at work. As stress levels have increased, employers have faced rising medical bills, more accident insurance claims, increased absenteeism, and declining morale. Most corporate efforts to handle the problem {{have focused on the}} symptoms of stress, with, for example, therapy, counselling, gym memberships, and in-house exercise facilities. Professor Robert Karasecc recommends a different approach based on work re-design for greater job enrichment.

Our study tests Karaseck’s theory using a sample of employees from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

We also find that some stress symptoms decline as work demands decrease, even if authority and skill levels are high.

40|$|Introduction Sickness absence is a {{major public}} health problem. Research on {{sickness}} absence focuses on interventions aimed at expediting return to work. However, {{we need to know}} more about sustaining employees at work after return to work. Therefore, this study investigated the recurrence of sickness absence according to diagnosis. Methods We analyzed the registered sickness absence data of 137, 172 employees working for the Dutch Post and Telecom. Episodes of sickness absence were medically certified, according to the ICD- 10 classification of diseases, by an occupational physician. The incidence density (ID) and recurrence density (RD) of medically certified absences were calculated per 1, 000 person-years in each ICD- 10 category. Results Sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders had the highest recurrence (RD = 118. 7 per 1, 000 person-years), followed by recurrence of sickness absence due to mental disorders (RD = 80. 4 per 1, 000 person-years). The median time to recurrent sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders was 409 days after the index episode. Recurrences of sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders accounted for 37 % {{of the total number of}} recurrent sickness absence days. For recurrences of sickness absence due to mental disorders this was 328 days and 21 %, respectively. <b>Unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> with a short duration (< 5 years) of employment had a higher risk of recurrent sickness absence.

40|$|Health {{promotion}} {{and the practice}} of health-promotive behaviors are significant factors in longevity and personal wellness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between an individual's meaning of health {{and the practice of}} health-protective behaviors. Theoretical rationale was based on Pender's (1987) Health Promotion Model. Health promotion lifestyle was measured by the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) (Walker,Sechrist, & Pender, 1985). Individual definition of health was measured by the Meaning of Health instrument (Wieseke, 1990 a). The sample included skilled and <b>unskilled</b> <b>employees</b> of a 300 -bed regional hospital located in the Triad area of North Carolina. Interviews were conducted with a random sample of the respondents to obtain information on themes of the expressed meanings of the Health Concept. Significance of this study lies in determining individuals' motivation to practice health-protective behaviors and also in determining individuals' definition of health. Identification of lifestyle and health behaviors will help nurses and other health care workers determine what motivates an individual to perform health-protective behaviors. The results revealed a significant (p<. 05) relationship between the level of overall functioning of all six subscales of the HPLP. Participation in health promoting behaviors was significantly related to physical sensation overall with a level of significance at p<. 05. Participation in health-promoting behaviors was significantly related to emotional level overall with a level of significance at p<. 01. There was no significance between age group and the HPLP. The conclusions drawn from this study were that the subjects were self-actualized and emotionally stable. The subjects take responsibility for health but do not take advantage of opportunities to monitor health. School of NursingThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
