5|$|In January 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows. The law also seeks to {{encourage the use of}} public transportation and reduce air pollution. According to the law, revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for public transportation and non-motorized modes of locomotion (such as walking and cycling), and to finance public subsidies to transit fares.

There are two districts that are administered by MBKT. They are Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus.

5|$|The North Circular Road {{forms the}} {{northern}} part of a ring-road around Central London. It has seen substantially more investment than its counterpart, the South Circular Road, and consequently runs on more purpose-built road than urban streets, often coupled with demolition of existing houses and <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Although the route has alternative names at some points, it is generally referred to as the North Circular throughout for route planning purposes. The route is mostly grade-separated dual carriageway from the A40 at Hanger Lane to the A13 in Beckton except for the Drury Way/Brentfield Road junction, the Golders Green Road/Brent Street junction, Henlys Corner and the section from Bounds Green to Green Lanes. In areas where improvements made slowest progress and upgrades are unlikely, the original names such as Gunnersbury Avenue and Bowes Road are used.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{consensus that the}} existing system of production and consumption is ecologically unsustainable and inequitable. The global economy depends {{on the use of}} 60 billion tons of material resources and 500 exajoules of energy annually. It is these flows that are responsible for resource depletion, negative environmental impacts and social injustice in many developing countries where these resources are extracted. However, the bulk of these resources are used, consumed and disposed of as wastes within cities. More specifically, the way <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are configured determines how these resource flows are conducted through cities. It follows that these flows could be reconfigured if existing <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> were retrofitted or new ones designed to ensure the more sustainable use of these resources in cities. The result would be a shift from unsustainable urbanism to a more sustainable urbanism. Inclusive and splintered urbanism are reviewed as dominant forms of unsustainable urbanism {{as a result of the}} way <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are configured, while green urbanism and slum urbanism are reviewed as possible alternatives. A conception of 'liveable urbanism' is proposed as a way of thinking about urban development that restores ecosystems and promotes sufficiency. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to expose the {{importance}} of observing cultural systems present in a territory as a reference for the design of <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in the new cities and regions of rapid development. If we accept the idea that architecture is an instrument or cultural system developed by man to act as an intermediary to the environment, it is necessary to understand the elemental interaction between man and his environment to meet a satisfactory design. To illustrate this purpose, we present the case of the Eurasian Mediterranean region, where the architectural culture acts as a cultural system of adaptation to the environment and it is formed by an ancient process of selection. From simple observation of architectural types, construction systems and environmental mechanisms treasured in mediterranean historical heritage we can extract crucial information about this elemental interaction. Mediterranean architectural culture has environmental mechanisms responding to the needs of basics habitability, ethnics and passive conditioning. These mechanisms can be basis of an innovative design without compromising the diversity and lifestyles of human groups in the region. The main fundament of our investigation is the determination of the historical heritage of domestic architecture as holder of the formation process of these mechanisms. The result allows us to affirm that the successful introduction of new <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in an area need a reliable reference and it must be a cultural system that entailing in essence the environmental conditioning of human existence. The <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> must be sustainable, understood and accepted by the inhabitants. The last condition is more important when the <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are implemented in areas that are developing rapidly or when there is no architectural culture...|$|R

25|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>infrastructure</b> {{involves}} various physical {{networks and}} spaces necessary for transportation, water use, energy, recreation, and public functions. Infrastructure carries a high initial cost in fixed capital (pipes, wires, plants, vehicles, etc.) but lower marginal costs and thus positive economies of scale. Because {{of the higher}} barriers to entry, these networks have been classified as natural monopolies, meaning that economic logic favors control of each network by a single organization, public or private.|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{flows of}} cities {{have to be}} reduced. Thus far, efforts have been mainly directed to providing the city with renewable resources, diminish resource consumption, and/or reuse the wastes and emissions. The dense fabric of <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> does not only provide {{a high level of}} services. By the proximity of infrastructures symbiosis might be created between them. This urban symbiosis might lead to a considerable reduction of resource consumption and/or carbon- and other emissions of all systems involved. However, developing symbiosis between <b>urban</b> <b>infrastructures</b> implies that the owners/operators of the infrastructures are able to align their interests too. This might be problematic as infrastructure operators developed a culture of autonomy. Moreover, they are nowadays owned by various public and private entities that pursue different agendas. The top down planning model of infrastructures appears to be {{at the end of its}} life cycle; citizens, businesses and NGO’s request participation. Early participation, using future methods and workshops might contribute to align actors for promising urban symbiosis options. The paper analyses barriers in developing urban symbiosis and sketches strategies how to deal with them.
