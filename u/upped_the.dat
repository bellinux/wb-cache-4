5|$|A large monsoon trough was {{anchored}} {{south of}} Guam {{towards the end}} of July. By July21, three areas of disturbed weather had formed. Although the westernmost disturbance dissipated, the easternmost two continued to develop, one of which would later become Typhoon Andy. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the easternmost system at 1900UTC on July21 as sea level pressures fell and convection increased within the vicinity of the disturbance. After becoming better organized, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Later on July22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the same system as it developed rainbands and a further increase in thunderstorm activity. Initially, the JTWC correctly predicted the low to move northwest. Hurricane Hunters indicated that the low and mid-level centers were not vertically aligned. On July23, both the JMA and JTWC <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> depression into a tropical storm. Bess then began to intensify. At 0600UTC on July24, Bess was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA. After the formation of an eye, both agencies classified Bess as a typhoon.|$|E

5|$|The writers {{intended}} to play off {{the idea of}} a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie—on whose birthday the episode would be set—absent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that her head was in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake; they noted that the prop cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing in a way they do not in the final version.|$|E

The Cougars got the tying goal in the 34th minute, when MSU was called for a handball in the box, and Ledbetter nailed his third penalty kick of the season. The game then became a typical Valley defensive struggle, as both offenses pushed, but both defenses pushed back harder. Late in regulation time, the Bears turned away a Cougar corner kick, but McHugh sent it back in to Ledbetter, who headed it toward the goal and McLean. who scored his second game-winner with only {{a minute and a}} half left on the clock.

Lee left after an 11-over stand with Gilchrist which had yielded 37 runs, but Stuart MacGill <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> ante with Gilchrist, and the pair hit {{at more than}} five an over in a ninth-wicket partnership worth 59. When MacGill went for 29 off 21 balls, Gilchrist then shielded McGrath from the strike, as the No. 11 faced twelve balls in his half-hour innings worth one run, and though Gilchrist eventually gloved a ball to the keeper, he had made 86 runs and helped cut the deficit to 92.|$|E

It did not matter, as Arnold and Jayawardene treated the spinners with disdain, plundering 125 runs in 20 overs and accelerating the scoring to a point where India could not keep up. Nehra tried, and his variations gave him more wickets - he finished with the second six-wicket-haul of his career, the first coming against England in the 2003 World Cup, but a returning Vaas helped himself to 18 not out and <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> total to 281 for 9. An interesting feature of the scorecard was that no Indian bowler apart from Nehra got wickets - six for him, the other three were run outs.|$|E

Lair and Vang Pao decided that if they parachuted in training equipment to the obscure village of Ban Padong, it would take three days for communist troops to show up. A three-day curriculum was set up. After receiving palleted supplies sufficient for 300 trainees, instruction by PARU Team D began on 17 January 1961. Day one centered on the use of small arms. Lair's supplied weaponry leaned heavily toward the M1 carbine, which he felt suited to the Hmong stature. However, many trainees preferred the larger, more powerful M1 Garand; Lair increased the proportion of Garands in future supply drops. Day two featured training in laying ambushes with a squad or platoon. The final day <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> ambush practice to company level, and added on some instruction on booby traps.

The news came as a surprise and set off another round of news stories about Clinton donors and supporters concerned about the campaign's strategy. It was particularly striking in contrast to Obama's announcement that he had raised a record-high $32 million in January, tapping 170,000 new contributors. It became clear that Obama's financial advantage had allowed him to organize and compete in a broader set of states on Super Tuesday, an advantage likely to continue in the coming weeks and months. Clinton's supporters responded by raising $6 million online in 36 hours, but Obama's campaign <b>upped</b> <b>the</b> ante, announcing their own total of $7.5 million in 36 hours and starting a new goal of reaching 500,000 new contributors in 2008 by the end of February.|$|E

After Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager, Heenan placed a $25,000 bounty on Orndorff, payable to anyone who could injure him.
