5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court <b>upholds</b> since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{evolutionary}} dynamics to {{show how}} rules converge into norms. Individuals {{play a game of}} <b>upholding</b> or rejecting a rule, and the more they <b>uphold</b> the rule, the more it becomes established as a norm. We find that when individuals are rational, the initial state determines whether the rule converges into a norm; when individuals are boundedly rational, convergence occurs only if <b>upholding</b> rules is a risk-dominant strategy. This suggests why big-bang reforms that affect only the initial state can fail, while gradualist approaches that can sustain the risk dominance of <b>upholding</b> rules may be more effective. ...|$|R
