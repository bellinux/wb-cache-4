The aims {{of this study is to}} assess the risk of obesity in hormonal contraceptive users in the District of Kulon Progo, Jogjakarta, Indonesia. A cross sectional study was used to determine the prevalence <b>of</b> obesity among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> contraception. A systematic cluster random sampling, using villages as clusters, was used to choose 647 <b>users</b> <b>of</b> contraception in Kulon Progo.   A hundred and two obese cases and 102 control, matched-for-age and socioeconomic status, controls were included in the case control study used to evaluate the risk <b>of</b> obesity among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> hormonal contraception. The prevalence <b>of</b> obesity among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> contraception in Kulon Progo was 15. 9 %. <b>Users</b> <b>of</b> hormonal contraception has a increased risk for obesity, OR: 9. 4 (95 % CI: 1. 1 – 81. 5). <b>Users</b> <b>of</b> combination pills faced the highest risk, followed by <b>users</b> <b>of</b> injected progesterone depot, while the risk in implant users was the same as that in <b>users</b> <b>of</b> non-hormonal contraception. The risk of obesity was significantly higher after 7 years of hormonal contraception use. The risk of obesity was neither related to energy intake nor expenditure. The increased risk <b>of</b> obesity in <b>users</b> <b>of</b> hormonal contraception was still significant after controlling for age, parity, initial weight, socioeconomic status, energy intake and expenditure, and parental obesity.

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios.

This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E

Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the <b>user</b> <b>of</b> the error.

In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E
40|$|With the aim to {{characterize}} patterns in toxicological profile and manner {{of death in}} deceased <b>users</b> <b>of</b> anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), a retrospective autopsy protocol study <b>of</b> 52 deceased <b>users</b> <b>of</b> AAS was undertaken. The AAS users were compared to 68 deceased <b>users</b> <b>of</b> amphetamine and/or heroin who were consecutively tested and found to be negative for AAS. Use of AAS was {{in the majority of}} cases (79 %) associated with concomitant use of psychotropic substances. AAS-related deaths differed in several respects from deaths among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> heroin or amphetamine, most strikingly with regard to: (a) the median age at death, which was significantly lower for AAS users (24. 5 years) than for <b>users</b> <b>of</b> heroin and/or amphetamine (34 and 40 years, respectively); (b) the manner of death, with AAS users dying significantly more often from homicide or suicide than <b>users</b> <b>of</b> other drugs; and (c) the body mass index (BMI), with AAS users exhibiting significantly higher BMI than <b>users</b> <b>of</b> other drugs. These results support the earlier reported association between use of AAS and use of other psychoactive substances. In addition, the data suggest that AAS users are more likely to become involved in incidents leading to violent death and have a higher risk of dying at a younger age than <b>users</b> <b>of</b> other drugs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> emergency department (ED) services use more or fewer primary care services than other ED patients. DESIGN: Population-based, observational, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Province of Ontario in 1997 - 1998. PARTICIPANTS: Frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> EDs, defined as people {{with at least}} 12 ED physician assessments yearly, were compared with those with one to 11 assessments yearly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of general practitioner and family physician (GP/FP) office visits and number of GP/FPs visited; diagnoses made during office visits; referrals by GP/FPs to specialists. RESULTS: Three quarters <b>of</b> frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> EDs visited GP/FPs at least six times yearly, {{and more than half}} visited at least 12 times yearly. Although frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> EDs saw many GP/FPs (4. 2 vs 1. 6 in the control group, P <. 001), they received, on average, 73 % of their primary care from the GP/FPs whom they saw most frequently. Frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> EDs also had more referrals to specialists (4. 0 vs 1. 0). Frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> EDs were more likely to live in low socioeconomic neighbourhoods and to be diagnosed with psychosocial conditions (24. 1 % vs 11. 1 %). CONCLUSION: Most frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> EDs have periodic contact with primary care physicians. Communication and coordination of care between EDs and primary care settings could be easier than anticipated, because in most cases, frequent <b>users</b> <b>of</b> EDs seek most of their care from one main ED and one primary care physician...|$|R

5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single <b>user</b> <b>of</b> ice in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y.

Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) for semi-trailer trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A <b>user</b> <b>of</b> {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for semi-trailers, depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems. The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
