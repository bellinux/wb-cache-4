50|$|People of African, Japanese and Chinese descent {{are rarely}} diagnosed; this {{reflects}} {{a much lower}} prevalence of the genetic risk factors, such as HLA-B8. People of Indian ancestry {{seem to have a}} similar risk to those of Western Caucasian ancestry. Population studies also indicate that a large proportion of coeliacs remain undiagnosed; this is due, in part, to many clinicians being unfamiliar with the condition and also due to the fact it can be asymptomatic. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men. A large multicentre study in the U.S. found a prevalence of 0.75% in not-at-risk groups, rising to 1.8% in symptomatic people, 2.6% in second-degree relatives (like grandparents, aunt or uncle, grandchildren, etc.) of a person with coeliac disease and 4.5% in first-degree relatives (siblings, parents or children). This profile is similar to the prevalence in Europe. Other populations at increased risk for coeliac disease, with prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 10%, include individuals with Down and Turner syndromes, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease, including both hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (<b>underactive</b> <b>thyroid).</b>|$|E
50|$|Because Helen Reichert and her {{siblings}} were all centenarians (her younger sister, Leonore Kahn Reichart, {{who was born}} May 25, 1903, died on February 18, 2005, {{at the age of}} 101), researchers have been studying them to see if longevity is correlated to genetics. Geneticist Nir Barzilai, a researcher who studied the biology of aging for over a decade, included the Kahn siblings and other Ashkenazi Jews in his research. He asked the pool about the details of their living habits: nutrition, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, sleep, education, status, and spirituality. Barzilai and the team of researchers at Einstein's Institute for Aging Research discovered three genes common to the centenarians that may be the key to their long life. The first is a gene that increases the amount of good cholesterol HDL (High-density lipoprotein) to two to three times higher than average, which Barzilai believes {{is part of the reason}} for the siblings’ mental acuity at an old age. The second is a gene that slows metabolism as a result of a mildly <b>underactive</b> <b>thyroid.</b> The last is a mutation in axis, a human growth hormone that could possibly protect against age-related diseases, such as cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts {{father died}} in November 1971 {{at the age of}} 68; her mother died six months later at the same age. In early 1982 Roberts spent a month in the {{hospital}} for severely <b>underactive</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland, protruding eyes and double vision, an almost total hearing loss, a slight anemia, budding bedsores—and a hospital-caused staph infection. [...] She recovered to an extent, but died {{two and a half years}} later in 1984, having been bedridden with severe arthritis—like her mother—for the final year and a half of her life. Roberts had spent 504 consecutive days in a hospital in Elmira, N.Y. The immediate causes of her death were a combination of protein depletion, osteomyelitis, and soft-tissue infections. These conditions arose out of her long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. (Butts believed for some 15 years that in Roberts case, at least, the young girls psychological conditioning was far more important—far more damaging, in those terms—than any physical tendency to inherit the disease.) Roberts was cremated the next day, in a process she and Butts had agreed upon several years earlier. After Roberts’ death, lovingly recorded in The Way Toward Health (1997), Butts continued his work as a guardian of the Seth texts and continued to supervise the publication of some of the remaining material, including The Early Sessions, and making sure that all of the recordings, manuscripts, notes, and drawings related to the extraordinary encounters with Seth would be given to the Yale Library. Butts remarried, and his second wife, Laurel Lee Davies, supported his work during the more than twenty years that they were together. (Davies had moved to Elmira from California in 1985 at Butts request to help answer mail and proofread manuscripts. They did not actually marry until 1999.) Butts died of cancer on May 26, 2008. Jane Roberts Butts and Robert F. Butts Jr. are interred together in the Wayne County, NY, Furnaceville cemetery; however, there is another gravestone with their names on it in the Sunnyside cemetery in Tunkhannock, PA. The vitality of the teachings they helped to bring to the world continues. A number of groups have compiled anthologies of quotes from Seth, summarized sections of his teachings, issued copies of Seth sessions on audio tape, and further relayed the material via classes and conventions.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This paper reports work {{undertaken}} to design two new condition-specific questionnaires {{for use in}} hypothyroidism: the Underactive Thyroid-Dependent Quality of Life Questionnaire (ThyDQoL) and the <b>Underactive</b> <b>Thyroid</b> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ThyTSQ). Methods: Semi-structured interviews exploring quality of life (QoL) and experiences of treatment were conducted with 30 women and 8 men with hypothyroidism, (mean age 51. 9, range 29 - 79 years), 37 / 38 treated with thyroxine, recruited from hospital clinics and primary care. Results: Despite thyroxine treatment, most interviewees reported negative impact of hypothyroidism on QoL, particularly on energy, physical capabilities, motivation, physical appearance and weight. The newly designed ThyDQoL has 18 domains covering these {{and other aspects of}} life affected by hypothyroidism. It is an individualised measure of patients' perceived impact of hypothyroidism on their QoL, which takes into account the importance of personally applicable life domains to the patient. A 7 -item measure of satisfaction with current treatment was designed (ThyTSQ-Present) but interviews also indicated the need for seperate 4 -item section measuring satisfaction with past treatment around the time of diagnosis (ThyTSQ-Past). Conclusions: The ThyDQoL and ThyTSQ questionnaires have good face validity and content validity for adults with hypothyroidism. They are now ready for use in clinical research and psychometric evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is part of}} the {{endocrine}} system and has a widespread function that controls multiple organ systems and processes. The main function of the thyroid gland is to produce and secrete two different thyroid hormones: triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4), both of which help to meet the metabolic demands of the entire body. When the thyroid gland fails to produce T 3 /T 4 hormones (primary gland failure) or is not activated successfully by the pituitary gland (by the release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)), or hypothalamus, this results in low levels of circulating thyroid hormone. As low levels of the circulating thyroid hormones continue, an overall slowing of the person’s metabolism occurs. This <b>underactive</b> <b>thyroid</b> disease is called hypothyroidism (Chiasera, 2013). Although there are several causes for hypothyroidism, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis (HT) is {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism in United States and is thought to be associated with genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. HT is a chronic autoimmune disease and can present itself in an aggressive form or a mild form such as silent thyroiditis or postpartum thyroiditis leading to an undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Regardless of the virulence of the disease, HT can become serious if left untreated (Davies, 2015) ...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSubclinical {{hypothyroidism}} {{has been}} associated with hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, so screening and treatment have been advocated to prevent cardiovascular disease. ObjectivesClarification of cardiovascular risk of subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients and Methods 300 patients were admitted with coronary heart disease and data collected for demographic characteristics, baseline TSH and T 4 levels., baseline cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, blood pressure, smoking, LDL and HDL-cholesterol serum levels, baseline used drug therapy. The 300 patients were divided into two groups; Gr. (1) : 160 patients with coronary heart disease and subclinical hypothyroidism. Gr. (2) 140 patients with coronary heart disease and euthyroidism. Statistical correlation between coronary heart disease events and different TSH-serum levels was followed. Results: As regards to age, sex and FT 4 serum levels, there were no statistical differences. Actually, we noticed that patients whatever with unstable angina (50 %), revascularization (21. 25 %), or presented with acute myocardial infarction (15 %), had TSH serum level 4. 5 or greater and less than 20 mIU/L with normal serum levels of l-thyroxine, which undergo what is known as <b>underactive</b> <b>thyroid</b> or subclinical hypothyroidism. ConclusionSubclinical hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease especially in those with higher TSH levels and significantly elevated in adults with TSH levels of 10 mIU/L or greater. The results of our present study may help in refining a TSH threshold at which larger clinical benefits of thyroxine replacement would be expected...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the impact of different quantities and forms of iodine in ration dairy cows on the concentration of hormones of the thyroid in the blood plasma. The experiment was done with a herd of Red cows breeding in the conversion to breed in the breeding of Holstein dairy cows in Klatovy. Iodine was given in both inorganic and organic form. Before experimenting, the value of total and free forms of hormones was very low. During the experiment, increased concentrations of hormones in connection with the intake of inorganic iodine, the significant deviations showed free forms of thyroid hoemones. Nevertheless, the addition of organic iodine was not fully substituted for the reduction of inorganic iodine content. The thesis also discusses the assessment of the thyroid status by Czech red cattlebreeding on the school farm. The aim was to compare the activity of the thyroid gland in high-yield dairy cows breeding in a barn environment and cattle on pasture reared cattle. For red cattle reared on pasture, there were characteristically higher concentration levels of total and free hormones compared with high yield dairy cows. Nevertheless, in comparison with the reference value,there was a concentration of TT 4 for Czech red cattlelower, it coresponded well as dairy cows, rather lower iodine supply. In connection with the rise (higher content) TT 4, possibly fT 4, there was a similar tendency for the TT 3 and fT 3, so we can´t assume a deeper state of iodine deficiencies and its associationwith an <b>underactive</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis article {{reports the}} psychometric {{properties}} of two new condition-specific questionnaires: 1) the 18 -item Underactive Thyroid-Dependent Quality of Life Questionnaire (ThyDQoL) individualized measure of perceived impact of hypothyroidism on quality of life (QoL); and 2) the 15 -item <b>Underactive</b> <b>Thyroid</b> Symptom Rating Questionnaire (ThySRQ), in which patients rate symptom bother. MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted of 110 adults with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, 103 treated with thyroxine. Patients, the majority of whom (81 %) were women, were recruited from primary care (57 %) and from hospital clinics (43 %). The mean age of patients was 55. 1 (SD 14. 3) years. Respondents rated personally applicable ThyDQoL life domains for importance and impact of hypothyroidism, and ThySRQ symptom bother. ResultsCompletion rates were high (> 98 %). All 18 ThyDQoL domains were rated as negatively impacted by hypothyroidism and important for QoL. The ThyDQoL had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 949 [N = 97]), factor analysis indicated that applicable domains could be combined into an overall Average Weighted Impact score, for which the sample mean, − 3. 11 (2. 2), showed considerable negative impact of hypothyroidism on QoL (maximum possible range − 9 to + 3). There is good preliminary evidence to justify shortening the ThyDQoL to 14 domain-specific items. For the ThySRQ Cronbach's alpha was 0. 808 (N = 95). Highest symptom bother ratings were for hair problems, weight gain, depression, cold, and tiredness. ConclusionsBoth the ThyDQoL and ThySRQ are highly acceptable to patients with hypothyroidism and have good internal consistency reliability. Their sensitivity to change now needs to be evaluated in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} <b>Underactive</b> <b>thyroid</b> {{function}} during pregnancy {{and its effects}} on offspring intelligence, general cognition and behaviour have long been researched and reported on. Some of the differences found for the offspring are so apparent, that is has warranted authors to suggest universal thyroid function screening during pregnancy. The current study was the world’s first randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of treatment for suboptimal gestational thyroid function (SGTF) on offspring. The aims of this thesis are, 1) to re-analyse the intelligence scores for the offspring at age 3 years, 2) to clarify any SGTF effects by cognitive testing and behavioural questionnaires completed at offspring age 9, and 3) compare and contrast wave one and two findings. Methods and analysis 1) Data was previously collected for this analysis. Treated and untreated SGTF groups were compared by unadjusted and adjusted models. 2) I conducted the intelligence, additional cognitive testing, and collection of the completed behavioural questionnaires. All data were analysed separately (per chapter) by multivariate analysis models. 3) Comparison of intelligence results were explored by correlations and a repeated measures multivariate analysis. Results and conclusions Re-analysis of the age 3 intelligence scores revealed that the untreated SGTF group performed worse compared to the treated SGTF group (p =. 008 for scores below 85). No age 9 differences in intelligence or additional cognitive tests were found. The behavioural questionnaires revealed that treatment for SGTF may have had a detrimental effect for the offspring. Intelligence score comparisons revealed no differences between the groups. These results suggest that any intelligence effects from the mother not being treated for SGTF may be present at age 3 but have disappeared by age 9. However, treatment for SGTF appeared to significantly increase behaviour problems for offspring at age 9; though not clinically significant...|$|E
40|$|Background Disease-specific patient-reported outcome {{measures}} (PROMs) {{have been developed}} as important research tools {{in the study of}} various diseases. For hypothyroidism there exist three validated disease-specific questionnaires in English: the Thyroid-Dependent Quality of Life Questionnaire (ThyDQoL), the <b>Underactive</b> <b>Thyroid</b> Symptom Rating Questionnaire (ThySRQ) and the Thyroid Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ThyTSQ). We report psychometric properties of new German versions of the questionnaires including construct validity from two independent samples. Methods 230 envelopes with ThyDQoL, ThySRQ and ThyTSQ were given out to patients receiving levothyroxine for diagnosed hypothyroidism. Reliability and factor analyses were performed, correlations and hypothesised subgroup differences calculated to assess psychometric properties. Independently, 18 patients with treated hypothyroidism for autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s disease) and 18 healthy control subjects were enrolled in a clinical study. Participants filled in the above questionnaires alongside well-known generic PROMs, e. g. the Beck Depression Inventory, the 12 -item Well-Being Questionnaire and the Short-Form- 36. Two blood samples were taken. Groups were compared and correlations between disease-specific and generic instruments analysed. Relationships between PROMs and biochemically determined thyroid hormone status were investigated. Results 102 patients returned completed questionnaires (response rate 44 %). The newly translated questionnaires had satisfactory psychometric properties. Cronbach’s alpha was 0. 92 for ThyDQoL, 0. 81 for ThySRQ and 0. 86 for ThyTSQ. For each of the questionnaires, a single factor structure explained the data best. Adequately treated patients with thyroid stimulating hormone levels in the upper normal range reported more symptoms in the ThySRQ. Those with autoimmune hypothyroidism reported being more bothered by depressive symptoms. Within the clinical sample, correlation with well-known generic instruments revealed good construct validity. In the clinical sample patients reported more symptoms in the ThySRQ, being more bothered by tiredness, higher depression and reduced well-being despite biochemically adequate treatment. Correlations between PROMs and biochemical thyroid hormone status revealed moderate though consistent associations. Conclusions Psychometric properties including construct validity of German versions of the ThyDQoL, ThySRQ and ThyTSQ are satisfactory. Feasibility and sensitivity in a clinical sample could be shown. We encourage the use of disease-specific PROMs in future studies as important additions to generic instruments in clinical research on hypothyroidism...|$|E
40|$|Lack {{of iodine}} makes goiters— {{enlargement}} of the thyroid gland in the neck—common {{in some parts of}} the world. In the United States, salt is enriched with iodine, so the condition is far less common. When goiters do occur, it is typically due to other factors, such as Graves’ disease (overactive thyroid) or Hashimoto’s disease (<b>underactive</b> <b>thyroid),</b> as well as an individual’s anatomy or family history. And when goiters go untreated, they can grow down into the chest, spreading behind the breastbone and collarbone; in some cases, they grow all the way down to the arch of the aorta. These substernal goiters tend to grow slowly and steadily—sometimes with symptoms, sometimes without. Because of how and where they grow, substernal goiters can be very difficult to remove, with increased risk of complications. In his practice, Alliric I. Willis, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery, observed that substernal goiters seemed to occur more frequently among minority patients, older patients and patients who perhaps lacked access to care because of their insurance. “The condition also appeared to be relatively more common with men, even though women make up the majority of thyroid surgery patients whether for goiter or malignancy,” he says. “I became interested in trying to find out: Does this condition have particular demographic risk factors or disparities?” To explore that question, Dr. Willis collaborated with Dylan P. Thibault, MS, and Allison W. Willis, MD, MSCI, (also his wife) from the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania. He was also assisted by Ambria S. Moten, MD, a surgical resident (PGY 1 and 2) that he mentored at Temple University. The team used data from the National Inpatient Sample—a federally funded dataset that provides insights into about 20 percent of the population and thus can form the basis of a national sample. The data showed that 110, 889 patients underwent thyroidectomy for goiter from 2000 to 2010. Of those, 5, 525 (5 %) were substernal goiters. Their analysis confirmed that Dr. Willis’ clinical observations were, in fact, accurate. Patients with substernal goiters were indeed older, more likely to be Black or Hispanic and to have Medicare insurance. In addition, they had a higher comorbidity index (meaning they had other conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and/or obesity) and were more likely to be admitted on an emergency basis. “We also found that these patients were more likely to have postoperative complications, and most alarmingly, we found that substernal thyroidectomy patients had 73 percent increased odds of death during admission compared to those patients undergoing a nonsubsternal thyroidectomy,” Dr. Willis explains. He also notes that insurance seems to play an especially significant role, with privately insured patients far less likely to have a substernal goiter. These findings emphasize the importance of early referral of goiter patients for surgical evaluation and an increased appreciation of the challenges associated with substernal goiter operations. With Dr. Willis as principal author, the findings were published in The American Journal of Surgery. This study builds on similar research Dr. Willis has conducted around the role of demographics in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers of the breast, rectum and stomach. “It’s an interesting field that is becoming increasingly appreciated as we talk about quality and outcomes,” he says. “We can’t just look at the big picture. We have to focus at the individual patient level, including those who may not be achieving great outcomes. As clinicians, we can ask the right questions, team up with good epidemiologists and biostatisticians, and do analyses to figure out what’s significant—and what we can do to make outcomes better for everyone. ...|$|E
