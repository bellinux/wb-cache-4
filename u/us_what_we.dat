[...] After spending the majority of his career signed to Sony, and later, Sony BMG, Arjona signed a long-term recording deal with Warner Music Latina in September 2008. This departure made Quien Dijo Ayer the last album the artist directly released on his former label.|$|E

500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought we were on a trip when we made it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E

[...] He further stated that it was [...] "an album that begun as an experiment, with a dose of informality, and suddenly, when I realized of what the producers were achieving with the songs I worked many years ago, the album finished as being very complicated." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{many years}} in England, there had been {{controversy}} over bowling actions; several bowlers were believed to throw rather than bowl the ball, which was contrary to the Laws of Cricket. Lancashire had a particularly poor reputation among other county teams for using bowlers who threw: by the early 1880s, up to four of Lancashire's main bowlers were judged to be unfair, including John Crossland who bowled very quickly. By the mid-1880s, several teams refused to play Lancashire on account of their bowling attack. Mainly through the actions of Lord Harris, many of the suspect bowlers were forced out of cricket, and bowling actions became more legitimate. However, some players continued to bowl with questionable actions, including members of the Lancashire team. The issue intensified in 1896 when two of the Australian touring team, Ernie Jones and Tom McKibbin, seemed {{to throw the ball}} regularly; Sydney Pardon, the editor of Wisden, wrote: [...] "The mortifying fact was that the illegal bowling was due entirely to our own weakness in not having the laws of the game carried out. The Australians only did against <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had over and over again done against them." ...|$|E
500|$|Yeezus {{continues}} West's {{practice of}} eclectic samples: he employs an obscure Hindi sample on [...] "I Am a God", and {{a sample of}} 1970s Hungarian rock group Omega on [...] "New Slaves". [...] "On Sight" [...] interpolates a melody from [...] "Sermon (He'll Give <b>Us</b> <b>What</b> <b>We</b> Really Need)" [...] by the Holy Name of Mary Choral Family, although the track originally sampled an old vocal track from the original recording. As late as a week prior to release, lawyers were forced {{to track down the}} choir director and members of the choir on the South Side of Chicago in order to get clearance for such a sample. Def Jam executives were significantly worried enough the deal would not be in place in time for the record's deadline, and producers re-recorded the vocals with a new choir as the sample could not be cleared in enough time. [...] "Bound 2" [...] features heavy soul music samples and has been described as the only song on Yeezus which recalls the sound of West's early work. [...] "Bound", a 1971 song by American soul group Ponderosa Twins Plus One from their album 2 + 2 + 1 = Ponderosa Twins Plus One, serves as the primary sample used in West's track.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the band was set to perform at Summersault in August 2000, about eight songs, {{including}} [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", had been recorded as demos while the band {{was on the road}} touring. Guitarist Turner noted: [...] "After we were done we brought them in for the record company to hear, with an eye to making plans for next year. They heard what we were doing and said, 'Well, let's finish the album you're working on.' And we thought, 'Album? We're just demoing.' But they told <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had was great, so we went back into the studio with Arn and did just that." [...] Over the next two months, the band worked to complete the album with Arnold Lanni at Arnyard Studios in Toronto as well as Avatar Studios in New York City. Rumors had surfaced that, while in New York, Our Lady peace had dropped Lanni as producer to work with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. These rumors were later debunked by Maida. The first songs to be played live were [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", which debuted during Summersault in August 2000 shortly after they were first recorded. In an August 2000 interview with Chartattack Raine revealed that a song titled [...] "Yesterday" [...] (later to become [...] "Middle of Yesterday") was almost guaranteed to be the first single for Spiritual Machines.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> {{more or less}} deserve from a Batman story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1934, the Austrian philosopher Hans Kelsen {{continued}} the positivist tradition {{in his book}} the Pure Theory of Law. Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with [...] "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive [...] "is" [...] statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway is €500); law tells <b>us</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> [...] "should" [...] do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (Grundnorm) instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, Carl Schmitt, rejected both positivism and the idea {{of the rule of law}} because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions. Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception (state of emergency), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.|$|E
