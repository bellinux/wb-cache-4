40|$|From February to July 1951, 8, 000 New Zealand watersider {{workers were}} locked-out and 7, 000 miners, seamen and {{freezing}} workers {{went on strike}} in support. These workers {{and those who were}} dependent on their income, had to survive without wages for five months. The dispute was a family event as well as an industrial event. The men were fathers, husbands, brothers and sons, and their lack of wages affected the family that they lived with and their wider kin networks. The thesis examines families in order to write a gendered social history of the 1951 waterfront dispute. The discussion starts by exploring the relationship between waterfront work and watersiders' families before the lockout. Then it turns to examine the material support that families received and the survival strategies used during the dispute. It examines the decisions union branches made about relief and other activities through the lens of gender and explores the implications of those decisions for family members. The subsequent chapters examine the dispute's end and long-term costs on families. The study draws on a mixture of <b>union</b> <b>material,</b> state archives and oral sources. The defeat of the union has meant that <b>union</b> <b>material</b> has largely survived in personal collections, but the state's active involvement in the dispute generated significant records. The oral history of 1951 is rich; this thesis draws on over fifty existing oral history interviews with people involved in the dispute, and twenty interviews completed for this project. The thesis both complicates and confirms existing understandings of 1950 s New Zealand. It complicates the idea of a prosperous conformist society, while confirming and deepening our understanding {{of the role of the}} family and gender relationships in the period. It argues that union branches put considerable effort into maintaining the gender order during the dispute and set up relief as a simulacrum of the breadwinner wage. Centring workers' families opens the dispute outwards to the communities they were part of. Compared to previous historical accounts, the thesis describes a messier and less contained 1951 waterfront dispute. This study shows that homes were a site of the dispute. The domestic work of ensuring that a family managed without wages was largely women's and was as much part of the dispute as collective union work, which was often organised to exclude women. The thesis argues that homes and families were the sharp edges of the 1951 waterfront dispute, the site of both its costs and crises...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim was {{to clarify}} the {{occurrence}} of delayed union after surgical treatment of mandibular fracture and investigate whether an association exists between perioperative use of dexamethasone and delayed <b>union.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: Thirty-seven patients were included in a prospective randomized study. Of these patients, 19 (51. 4 %) were randomized to receive a total dose of 30 mg of dexamethasone and 18 (48. 6 %) served as controls. Patients underwent clinical and radiological investigation immediately, one month, three months and six months postoperatively. Radiographs were evaluated by an experienced, blinded senior oral radiologist. Results: Delayed fracture union was found in 9 patients (24. 3 %). It was associated significantly with angle fractures (p= 0. 012). Delayed union occurred more frequently in patients who received dexamethasone (36. 8 %) than in {{those who did not}} (11. 1 %) (p= 0. 068). The association of infection with delayed union was significan t (p= 0. 027). Moreover, dexamethasone was significantly (p= 0. 019) associated with delayed fracture union with concomitant infection. Gender, age group, smoking habit, treatment delay and duration of surgery were not associated with delayed union. Conclusions: Infection was associated with delayed union. Short-term high-dose dexamethasone predisposed to complicated fracture union, especially in patients with angle fractures. The relationship between dexamethasone and delayed bone healing without infection remains unresolve...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the results of surgical treatment of clavicle non-union after failure of conservative treatment. Our hypothesis was that stable fixation with bone graft derived from local bone stock (fracture site) or the iliac crest was essential to achieve bone <b>union.</b> <b>Material</b> and methodsTwenty-one patients with a symptomatic middle-third clavicle non-union after failure of initial conservative treatment {{were included in the}} study. Delay between the initial fracture and surgery for non-union was 27 months (6 – 144). In five cases, the non-union was hypertrophic and bone graft was obtained locally from the callus. In 16  patients, the non-union was atrophic. Bone was harvested from the iliac crest as cortico-cancellous graft (7  patients) and cancellous graft (8 patients). One patient refused bone grafting. A 3. 5 -mm plate with non-locking screws was placed anterior in 12 and superior in 9  patients. ResultsAt 41 months average follow-up (minimum of 12 months), 20  patients were available for review. Bone healing was obtained initially in 15  cases. Six complications required a revision procedure: 3 for infection and 3 for mechanical failure. At last follow-up, 19  patients were satisfied with the surgery. Average Constant score was 84 ± 26  points (7 – 100), and Quick DASH score 17 ± 22  points (0 – 91). Radiographic bone healing was obtained in 19 of the cases. ConclusionTreatment of middle-third clavicle non-union after initial failure of conservative treatment with stable fixation and bone graft is a reliable, well-suited and effective treatment. Our hypothesis was verified. Preoperative evaluation of appearance of the non-union X-rays can be used to determine the type of bone graft needed, but the final decision is often taken during surgery.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the antecedents and consequence of trade union commitment in Nigerian trade unions. Data obtained from 512 unionised employees in Nigeria was analysed using mainly correlation and regression analysis. From the results, the {{significant predictors of}} union commitment were factors associated with union characteristics and perception namely union instrumentality perception, satisfaction with union leadership and early union socialisation experience. Sector was a significant moderator in the model: union commitment was greater {{in the public sector}} while union participation was greater in the private sector. Males participated significantly more in union activities than females although there was no significant gender difference in union commitment. Factors associated with union attitudes were found to moderate the relationship between union commitment and union participation. Union commitment was also found to predict union participation in the overall model as hypothesised. The qualitative study involved personal interviews as well as content analysis of relevant <b>union</b> <b>materials</b> including logbooks. The results confirmed the relevance of the unions' settings and specific individual experiences to the quantitative findings. The overall findings provided limited support for the view that antecedents of union commitment differ across countries or contexts.
