40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>villages</b> are {{the primary}} form of urban {{informal}} settlements in China. They emerge from the ongoing process of extensive rural-to-urban migration. While <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> provide more readily available and affordable housing options for new urban migrants, their overloaded population and poor living environment have become {{a problem in the}} city. The existing official solution of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> is to remove them and to replace them with new developments. This solution {{takes a long time to}} complete and neglects the social role of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> in the city. This project focuses on solving the inland flooding problem that occur regularly in the summer monsoon season in the <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> of Beijing, and proposes to use a green infrastructure (GI) approach, instead of conventional infrastructure, to control and manage stormwater on-site more effectively and in an environmentally-friendly way. By comparing the <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> in Beijing with informal settlements in Mumbai and Sao Paulo, this project recognizes the specific physical environment in each city and evaluates their upgrading plans from a landscape architect 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. Learning from that comparative assessment, the project selects two adjacent <b>urban</b> <b>villages,</b> Dayouzhuang and Saoziying in Beijing. Based on the site analysis of those two villages, the project study creates a toolbox of GI techniques and proposes a stormwater management system with appropriate GI tools from the toolbox. In terms of the different degrees of intervention, two alternatives are created. One is a limited removal of existing buildings with lower cost; another is a medium-level removal with higher cost. By proposing GI alternative in the <b>urban</b> <b>villages,</b> the project gives a prospective view of improving urban hydrology by regenerating <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> with GI techniques in Beijing...|$|R
40|$|Possessing {{different}} {{land rights}} and distinct landscapes, and {{separated from the}} rest of the city by invisible institutional boundaries, China's <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> are unusual enclaves for landless farmers, rural migrants and other urban hukou (citizenship rights) holders in a period of rapid urbanization. Although <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> are well known for their disorder and unruliness, they provide temporary livelihood for indigenous villagers and inexpensive shelter for migrants and other <b>urban</b> residents. <b>Urban</b> <b>villages</b> are typically perceived as homogeneous low-income neighbour- hoods characterized by low quality and high density housing. In fact, housing differentiation has emerged in <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> among residents who possess different quantities and types of capital, rights/entitlements, skills and other assets. This paper aims to understand the social groups and the housing differentiation among them in the Chinese <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> from an institutional perspective. It is based on a large-scale household survey in 11 <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> in six Chinese cities. Empirical data show evidence of significant housing differentiation within these enclaves: indigenous villagers have become a petty rentier class; rural migrants pay the highest rents while enduring the lowest housing conditions; and housing conditions for urban hukou holders lie between those of the other two groups. Regression analysis suggests that <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> share similar dynamics of housing differentiation as wider urban spaces, i. e. the combination of strong institutional constraints and emerging market influences leads to housing differentiation and inequality. Residents in <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> are also highly mobile. The inflows and outflows of population form an important part of the urban socio-spatial restructuring process. © 2010 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Their evolution is driven by the planning and development of the formal city and its resulting social and spatial diversity, and is also linked to their location in the urban fabric. Five major findings have been identified. First, the physical and socioeconomic development of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> is the natural and logical response of the indigenous village population and the rural migrants in facing rapid economic development and social transition. Second, the development process of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> follows a general trajectory characterised by three distinct but overlapping phases (expansion, densification and intensification). Third, their growth is spatially clustered and their growth centres shift over time, following the diffusion of employment. Fourth, the development of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> is driven by the provision of jobs and accessibility to job locations, but it is also confined by physical and institutional constraints such as diminishing land availability and environmental protection plans. Fifth, land use of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> evolves and the resulting land use diversity reflects different local conditions for economic activities and development. These processes are found to be faster and more advanced in the central city than in the outer districts.

This paper tests the hypothesis that the driving factors of this built intensity are analogous to factors that drive land prices in the formal city. Results of multivariate regression models of the built intensity of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> across the city of Shenzhen show a remarkable resemblance to hedonic models of land prices elsewhere.

These so-called “urban villages” provide migrants with affordable housing and fundamental utilities. Since <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> are constructed and maintained on the basis of self-help in the absence of formal regulations, they are often associated with squalor, overcrowding and social problems.

25|$|Arlington {{during the}} 1960s was {{undergoing}} tremendous change after the huge {{influx of newcomers}} in the 1950s. The old commercial districts did not have ample off-street parking and many shoppers were taking their business to new commercial centers, such as Parkington and Seven Corners. Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar {{to what happened in}} other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the Washington Metro, which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City and Pentagon City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as Little Saigon, and now is a vibrant <b>urban</b> <b>village.</b> Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.|$|E

30|$|The {{redevelopment}} of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> has aroused academic attention {{since the}} mid- 1990 s. Most early scholarly works viewed <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> {{as a social}} place, which was characterized by social networks based on migrants’ places of origin (Liu and Liang 1997; Ma and Xiang 1998 and Zhang 2001). Recent research is more focused on examining the conflict between redevelopment and inhabitants. Hao et al. (2011) studied the development and redevelopment of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> in Shenzhen. In the absence of government help, <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> have evolved in many cities to provide adequate and affordable housing for the rural migrants. However, the <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> are rejected by policy-makers and face aggressive demolition-redevelopment programs to replace them with formal urban neighborhoods. Hao et al. (2011) explores different dimensions of the development and redevelopment of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> in Shenzhen. By linking to the development practice of the city, the physical and socio-economic evolution of <b>urban</b> <b>villages</b> {{is found to be}} a result of the natural and logical response of the indigenous village population and the rural migrants in facing rapid economic development and social transition. Therefore, the demolition-redevelopment approach adopted by the government would be devastating not only for the rural migrants but also for the city’s economy which is largely based on labor-intensive sectors. There is a complex relationship between cultural heritage and poverty. This relationship is particularly evident in the depletion of historical centers. In addition, when considered along with the impact of the intertwined forces of urbanization and modernization, it may result in the dangerous threatening of the cultural tracts, social structure and urban patterns of the poor living in historical centers. Razzu (2005) analyzed this complex relationship as it is manifested in Ga Mashie and its impacts on the poor indigenous population. Razzu (2005) also suggests some policy recommendations, in particular, the fact that urban redevelopment projects of dilapidated historical districts have to genuinely consider the delicate and peculiar environment in which they are based. The financial elements of the intervention, for instance, might have to be differentiated from the typical ones used in peripheral slum upgrading projects, opening new rooms for a substantial redistribution of wealth.|$|R
