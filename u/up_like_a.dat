He also is associated with the Smithsonian and served as chairman of the International Astronomical Union’s Planet Definition Committee, which was charged with updating the astronomical definition of planet to reflect recent discoveries such as Eris.|$|E
25|$|Those who sail {{up along}} the coast of Norway to trade or to fish, all tell the {{remarkable}} story of how a serpent of fearsome size, 200 feet long and 20 feet wide, resides in rifts and caves outside Bergen. On bright summer nights this serpent leaves the caves to eat calves, lambs and pigs, or it fares out to the sea and feeds on sea nettles, crabs and similar marine animals. It has ell-long hair hanging from its neck, sharp black scales and flaming red eyes. It attacks vessels, grabs and swallows people, as it lifts itself <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> column from the water.|$|E
25|$|They {{are dressed}} in {{colorful}} clothes, usually in an eccentric version of traditional Japanese clothes. Women may be dressed <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Geisha, with heavy make up. Men usually have their hair in a top knot, although nowadays they are usually wigs, and some may wear fancy hats. They parade through the streets playing various instruments, including both traditional Japanese instruments and western instruments. Usually, one person carries a combined instrument consisting of a small gong (giving the chin sound in chindon'ya) and two small drums (giving the don sound in cindonya). Additional instruments by other performers may include a larger drum and a woodwind instrument, as for example a clarinet, a trumpet or a saxophone. They often play traditional Japanese tunes, military marches, or jazz.|$|E

25|$|Without warning, {{there was}} a large {{deafening}} explosion at 3.25 p.m. just aft of the engine room where the whole after section or {{about a third of the}} vessel had disappeared and the vessel settling by the stern. The explosion resulted in timber and debris being shot into the air as well as oil from the fuel tanks spurted <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> geyser. Luckily the oil didn't catch fire. And seconds later the survivors found themselves in the calm sea struggling around grasping bundles of plywood six feet long and three feet wide which were scattered over a fairly wide expanse of sea. The bundles of plywood acted as life rafts as there had been no chance of even getting near the life-boats, let alone launching any of them. There had been no chance of sending out a wireless distress call.|$|E
25|$|The {{court was}} set <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> magistrate's court, with a {{barrister}} presiding {{as a judge}} and another barrister acting as a permanent prosecutor. The judge would hold temporary military rank, and would normally act as the sole decider of both fact and sentence; if the potential sentence was more than two years, up to five other officers would also sit as judges. The defendant could be represented by any legal counsel, British or German, and the court could work in both the English and German languages. The court heard 4,295 cases between 1919 and 1925, with possible sentences for minor offences including fines and prison sentences of between seven and fourteen days, normally served in a standard German prison. Most cases were about possessing weapons illegally, straying onto British property, occupying carriages in trains reserved for British officers, reckless driving and possessing British Government property. The courts were well attended by German civilians, and German lawyers also attended to make a study of British legal procedure.|$|E
25|$|Most sieve {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet sieving. This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry sieving process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further sieving process impossible. A wet sieving process is set <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed on the top sieve. Above the top sieve a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the sieving process additionally to the sieving motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the sieves have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet sieving it is very important not to change the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).|$|E

500|$|There {{is hidden}} content within the game, {{including}} Easter eggs, messages, hidden objects, and weapons. The most well {{known of the}} hidden content are the skulls hidden on every level. The skulls, which can be picked <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> weapon, are located in hard-to-reach places. Many are exclusive to the Legendary mode of difficulty. Once activated, each skull has a specific effect on gameplay. For example, the [...] "Sputnik" [...] skull found on the Quarantine Zone level alters the mass of objects in the game; thus resulting in explosions being able to launch these objects across larger distances. Skull effects can be combined to provide various new levels of difficulty and/or novelty.|$|E
