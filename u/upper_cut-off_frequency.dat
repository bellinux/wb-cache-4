5000|$|An {{upper bound}} for the {{attainable}} modulation efficiency is given by the Nyquist rate or Hartley's law as follows: For a signaling alphabet with M alternative symbols, each symbol represents N = log2 M bits. N is the modulation efficiency measured in bit/symbol or bpcu. In the case of baseband transmission (line coding or pulse-amplitude modulation) with a baseband bandwidth (or <b>upper</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency)</b> B, the symbol rate can not exceed 2B symbols/s in view to avoid intersymbol interference. Thus, the spectral efficiency can not exceed 2N (bit/s)/Hz in the baseband transmission case. In the passband transmission case, a signal with passband bandwidth W {{can be converted to}} an equivalent baseband signal (using undersampling or a superheterodyne receiver), with <b>upper</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> W/2. If double-sideband modulation schemes such as QAM, ASK, PSK or OFDM are used, this results in a maximum symbol rate of W symbols/s, and in that the modulation efficiency can not exceed N (bit/s)/Hz. If digital single-sideband modulation is used, the passband signal with bandwidth W corresponds to a baseband message signal with baseband bandwidth W, resulting in a maximum symbol rate of 2W and an attainable modulation efficiency of 2N (bit/s)/Hz.|$|E

The continuous distribution of frequency modes of the bosonic bath exhibits a spectral gap over low frequencies. The bath energy shows oscillatory behaviors around the asymptotic value and information is alternatively lost and gained by the open system.

40|$|Coloration {{detection}} thresholds (CDTs) {{were measured}} {{for a single}} reflection {{as a function of}} spectral content and reflection delay for diotic stimulus presentation. The direct sound was a 320 -ms long burst of bandpass-filtered noise with varying lower and <b>upper</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The resulting threshold data revealed that: (1) sensitivity decreases with decreasing bandwidth and increasing reflection delay and (2) high-frequency components contribute less to detection than low-frequency components. The auditory processes that may be involved in coloration detection (CD) are discussed in terms of a spectrum-based auditory model, which is conceptually similar to the pattern-transformation model of pitch (Wightman, 1973). Hence, the model derives an auto-correlation function of the input stimulus by applying a frequency analysis to an auditory representation of the power spectrum. It was found that, to successfully describe the quantitative behavior of the CDT data, three important mechanisms need to be included: (1) auditory bandpass filters with a narrower bandwidth than classic Gammatone filters, the increase in spectral resolution was here linked to cochlear suppression, (2) a spectral contrast enhancement process that reflects neural inhibition mechanisms, and (3) integration of information across auditory frequency bands. 12 page(s...|$|R

The extent of this dependence is critically dependent {{on the size of the}} stimulus. Our results suggest a process whereby low spatial frequency motion information is masked by the presence of high spatial frequencies in the same region of the field, analogous to phenomena occurring in the perception of static form (e. g. the Abraham Lincoln effect). The effects of stimulus size on dmax, found for broad-band stimuli by ourselves and others, result from a loss of high frequency sensitivity at increased retinal eccentricities; this loss reduces the masking effect of high frequencies, as stimulus size increases...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} Green's {{functions of}} parallel-plate structures, where one plate has a smooth conducting {{surface and the}} other an artificial surface realised by a one-dimensional or two-dimensional periodic metamaterial-type texture. The purpose of the periodic texture is to provide cut-off of the lowest order parallel-plate modes, thereby forcing electromagnetic energy to follow conducting ridges or strips, that is, to form a gap waveguide as recently introduced. The Green's functions are constructed by using the appropriate homogenised ideal or asymptotic boundary conditions in the plane-wave spectral domain, thereby avoiding {{the complexity of the}} Floquet-mode expansions. In the special case of a single ridge or strip, an additional numerical search for propagation constants is needed and performed in order to satisfy the boundary condition on the considered ridge or strip in the spatial domain. The results reveal the dispersion characteristics of the quasi-transverse electromagnetic modes that propagate along the ridges or strips, including their lower and <b>upper</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies,</b> as well as the theoretical decay of the modal field in the transverse cut-off direction. This lateral decay shows values of 50 - 100 dB per wavelength for realisable geometries, indicating that the gap waveguide modes are extremely confined. The analytical formulas for the location of the stopband of the lowest order parallel-plate modes obtained by small-argument approximation of the dispersion equation are also shown. To verify the proposed analysis approach, the results are compared with the results obtained with a general electromagnetic solver showing very good agreement...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{contrast}} matching function (CMF) is {{the reciprocal}} of test contrast that perceptually matches {{the contrast of}} standard pattern, measured {{as a function of}} test spatial frequency (SF). Achromatic CMFs usually flatten as the contrast of the standard is raised, and are broader than the achromatic, bandpass, contrast sensitivity function (CSF). This report investigates whether chromatic CMFs have similar characteristics. For this purpose, the red–green color channel was defined using minimum flicker and hue cancellation techniques. Spatially localized (D 6), vertical, equiluminant patterns (SFs: 0. 063 – 8 cpd; contrast: 3 – 80 %) were used to measure the CSF and CMF of isoluminant patterns presented with a temporal Gaussian envelope. CMFs were measured using a randomized double-staircase procedure and the two-interval forced choice technique. Two color-normal observers, whose task was to select the interval that had higher color contrast, participated in experiments. Results show that: (a) the color CMFs are lowpass functions of SF at low standard contrasts (3 – 12. 5 %), broad-bandpass at intermediate contrasts (6. 25 – 60 %), and near-flat at high contrasts (80 %); and (b) isoluminant CMFs have higher <b>upper</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequencies</b> than isoluminant CSFs. It is concluded that: (i) color-contrast-constancy (CMF independent of SF) is partly achieved at high contrasts because color CMFs flatten as contrast increases; (ii) the information processing at suprathreshold levels is different from that at the threshold levels; and (iii) the model that explained achromatic CMFs using achromatic threshold mechanisms could not explain chromatic CMFs using chromatic threshold mechanisms...|$|R

The intensity ratio of the second harmonics to the fundamentals exhibits a two-fold nature, with both a linear and a quadratic relationship. Further data analyses also revealed that the second harmonic waves of AKR, which propagate in the X-mode, are generated from a source that is identical to that of the fundamental waves that propagate in the O-mode. These results suggest that the mechanism of AKR harmonic structure generation should allow the coexistence of different AKR emission processes...|$|R
40|$|Maximal length {{sequence}} {{spread spectrum}} techniques {{have been identified}} as an attractive means of networking a number of fibre optic sensors, since they provide a means of increasing the mean launch power of the interrogating signal while retaining sufficient measurand bandwidth. In such applications it is important to minimise the crosstalk between sensors, while maximising the number of sensors supported. The paper considers and presents formally the coupling requirements of such a system and the impact upon system performance.

The presence of the low-frequency gap with <b>upper</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>frequency</b> ω_g produces over the time scale 1 /ω_g an infinite sequence of time intervals over which information backflow appears. Such time intervals are generally irregular but, under certain conditions, exhibit the following bounds: the nth backflow has certainly started at the instant π(1 + 2 (n- 1)) /ω_g, and certainly ended at the instant 2 π n/ω_g, for every n= 1, 2, [...] The intervals become regular over long times, tend to the asymptotic length π/ω_g as supremum value, and are described analytically {{in terms of the}} structure of the spectral density near the cut-off frequency.

40|$|International audienceThe VLF-wave {{frequency}} modulation efficiency {{as a function}} of magnetosphere plasma parameters under the weak pitch-angle diffusion regime is studied. The study is based on the VLF growth-rate modulation both in the magnetosphere equatorial plane and after integrating along the magnetic field line. It is shown that for the typical quiet magnetosphere plasma parameters the relative shift of the maximum intensity frequency ?? m /? m is approximately equal to relative disturbance of the magnetic field in the magnetosphere equatorial plane, but may exceed it when both electron temperature anisotropy and the parameter ?? ? are small; here ? is the total-to-warm electron content ratio and ? ? is the electron parallel beta. It is also shown that relative shift of the maximum intensity frequency ?? m /? m after integrating along the field line is not less than 50 % from its value at the equatorial plane, which allows the use of the equatorial-plasma-parameter data to estimate the VLF {{frequency modulation}} on the ground.

40|$|Following Sakharov's and Puthoff's {{idea of an}} induced gravity, I {{consider}} a pair of harmonic oscillators coupled by the Coulomb and the electrokinetic potential, which decreases as 1 /r. Their dynamic coupling is allowed in the near field, that is, for frequencies roughly below ~ c/r. I treat the problem using Planck's and Post's ensemble description of harmonic oscillators. It is found that the correlated interacting modes have lower eigenfrequencies and positive zero-modes, their anticorrelating counterparts having higher eigenfrequencies and negative zero-modes. Moreover, the former tend to induce coherent states over large ensembles whereas the latter cannot. This applies to all the modes of the near field, {{as well as to}} the transverse radiant modes for which a retarded interacting correlation can be defined within absorber theory. As a result, an attractive long-range potential is found in all the zero-modes of the near field.

40|$|Oscillations and {{propagating}} {{waves are}} commonly seen in high-resolution observations of filament threads, i. e., the fine-structures of solar filaments/prominences. Since {{the temperature of}} prominences is typically {{of the order of}} 10 ^ 4 K, the prominence plasma is only partially ionized. In this paper, we study the effect of neutrals on the wave propagation in a filament thread modeled as a partially ionized homogeneous magnetic flux tube embedded in an homogeneous and fully ionized coronal plasma. Ohmic and ambipolar magnetic diffusion are considered in the basic resistive MHD equations. We numerically compute the eigenfrequencies of kink, slow, and Alfven linear MHD modes, and obtain analytical approximations in some cases. We find that the existence of propagating modes is constrained by the presence of critical values of the longitudinal wavenumber. In particular, the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>cut-offs</b> of kink and Alfven waves owe their existence to magnetic diffusion parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field lines, respectively. The slow mode only has a lower <b>frequency</b> <b>cut-off,</b> which is caused by perpendicular magnetic diffusion and is significantly affected by the ionization degree. In addition, ion-neutral collisions is the most efficient damping mechanism for short wavelengths while ohmic diffusion dominates in the long-wavelength regime.
