50|$|Where the res vendita {{comprises}} <b>unascertained</b> <b>goods,</b> {{the seller}} must appropriate {{them to the}} contract and ensure that the quantity and description {{and quality of the}} goods thus appropriated are in accordance with the terms of the contract.|$|E
50|$|Rule 5: in a sale of <b>unascertained</b> <b>goods,</b> the {{property}} will pass following an unconditional appropriation of goods or, where the sale {{is from a}} specified bulk, following ascertainment by exhaustion (i.e. removal of all the goods in the bulk but those destined for the buyer).|$|E
50|$|<b>Unascertained</b> <b>goods</b> may {{form the}} subject matter of a valid {{contract}} of sale. Such sales may be termed generic sales, or emptio generis. Future goods, or goods that do not yet exist, may also be the subject of a valid sale. Such a sale may take one of two forms.|$|E
50|$|Sections 16 to 26 concern a contract's effects, and in {{particular}} the transfer of property and title. Under section 16, property (ownership) cannot pass unless the goods are ascertained (the actual goods to be sold are identified). Section 18 provides presumptions to determine when property will pass, both for specific goods (ascertained {{at the time of the}} contract) and <b>goods</b> <b>unascertained</b> at the time of contracting. These 'rules' can be excluded by contrary implication or express agreement.|$|R
50|$|Patent defects are defects {{obvious to}} the naked eye: easily discoverable by the buyer {{at the time the}} goods are received. An example would be a scab on a sheep. Where {{specific}} goods are identified, or <b>unascertained</b> <b>goods</b> are appropriated by the seller to the contract, and the goods suffer from a patent defect, the seller may be sued for breach of contract by defective performance. The remedies are therefore contractual; consequential damages may be claimed.|$|E
50|$|Where {{the sale}} is of <b>unascertained</b> <b>goods,</b> the buyer may reject {{the goods and}} once again treat the seller as {{if there had been}} no {{delivery}} at all (whether the breach is major or not), provided the damage is not trifling. Where, however, the purchaser accepts the res vendita, but claims damages, the damages are estimated {{on the basis of the}} difference between the value of the sound goods and the value of the damaged goods delivered. The buyer may also claim any wasted necessary expenditure.|$|E
50|$|While the {{situation}} envisaged {{in respect of}} <b>unascertained</b> <b>goods</b> is analogous to that above, the price is usually ascertained, but the res vendita is not. The subject matter {{has not yet been}} appropriated to the contract: for example, 100 bags of maize at R55 per bag from a warehouse containing 10,000 bags. Risk in the res vendita does not pass until goods answering the description in the contract have been appropriated to the contract. For appropriation to occur, there must be some overt act by the seller, such as a setting aside or marking of the relevant goods.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{traditional}} equitable doctrine, which protected the rights of a prepaid buyer of future or <b>unascertained</b> <b>goods,</b> was wrongly perceived as being overruled by the judgment of a single Court of Appeal judge. What followed, however, was considerable judicial reluctance by English courts to remedy this error. The article examines various legislative and judicial approaches from major common law jurisdictions {{around the world that}} purport to lessen the potential for injustice created by this judicial caution. Yet despite legislative intervention in England to provide limited remedies, there has been a marked reluctance elsewhere to produce the necessary radical reform suggested by the Law Reform Commission of Ontario. The position in Ireland is examined and the authors note that the time may be ripe for a reconsideration of the current statutory provisions in that jurisdiction. PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|E
