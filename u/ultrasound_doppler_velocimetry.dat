We carried out different measurements, including temperature and velocity investigations. Due to turbidity, the latter cannot be performed easily by using common techniques like laser Doppler anemometry or Particle Image Velocimetry. Therefore the measurements are carried out with the <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>Velocimetry</b> technique.

40|$|Pulsed <b>ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> {{proved to}} be capable of {{measuring}} velocities accurately (relative error less than 0. 5 percent). In this research, the limitations of the method are investigated when measuring: in channels with a small thickness compared to the transducer diameter, at low velocities and {{in the presence of a}} flow reversal area. A review of the fundamentals of pulsed <b>ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> reveals that the accuracy of the measured velocity field mainly depends on the shape of the acoustic beam through the flow field and the intensity of the echo from the incident particles where the velocity is being measured. The ultrasonic transducer turned out to be most critical component of the system. Fundamental limitations of the method are identified. With ultrasonic beam measurements, the beam shape and echo intensity is further investigated. In general, the shape of the ultrasonic beam varies depending on the frequency and diameter of the emitter as well as the characteristics of the acoustic interface that the beam encounters. Moreover, the most promising transducer to measure velocity profiles in small channels is identified. Since the application of pulsed <b>ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> often involves the propagation of the ultrasonic burst through Plexiglas, the effect of Plexiglas walls on the measured velocity profile is analyzed and quantified in detail. The transducers ringing effect and the saturation region caused by highly absorbing acoustic interfaces are identified as limitations of the method. By comparing measurement results in the small rectangular channel to numerically calculated results, further limitations of the method are identified. It was not possible to determine velocities correctly throughout the whole channel at low flow rates, in small geometries and in the flow separation region. A discrepancy between the maximum measured velocity, velocity profile perturbations and incorrect velocity determination at the far channel wall were main shortcomings. Measurement results are improved by changes in the Doppler angle, the flow rate and the particle concentration. Suggestions to enhance the measurement system, especially its spatial resolution, and to further investigate acoustic wave interactions are made. M. S. Committee Member: Cyrus K.

40|$|SummarySince {{the initial}} {{description}} of laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) in 1979, many reports {{of this technique}} have been published worldwide. The indications for LM have grown in line with improvements in laparoscopic techniques and instruments over the last decade. LM offers several benefits to patients but remains a challenging technical procedure {{that is associated with}} high surgical morbidity and a high incidence of blood transfusion. LM procedures include excision of the myoma(s), repair of myometrium, and removal of the myoma from the abdomen. The control of operative blood loss is crucial, {{especially in the case of}} large intramural fibroids. Different studies have found wide variations in the incidence of recurrence after LM. <b>Ultrasound</b> imaging and <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> can be used to assess uterine scars after LM. Uterine rupture during pregnancy is a serious concern after LM, and all published cases report the occurrence of rupture before the start of labor.

The peak flow velocities in the descending aorta were significantly higher in the patients than in the control subjects {{and there was a}} close correlation with the systolic blood pressure gradient. Since there was no overlap of flow velocities between the patients and the control subjects the Doppler technique enables coarctation confidently to be excluded as well as demonstrating its presence and severity. The method is simple, rapid, independent of the condition of the aortic valve, and is applicable to neonates in whom the diagnosis of coarctation may otherwise be difficult. In older children it is useful for detecting recoarctation and following its progress, particularly in patients in whom a reliable estimate of the systolic blood pressure gradient cannot be obtained...|$|R

A case-control study of eight infants who developed ICH during ECMO was conducted. Plasma samples collected daily after ECMO insertion were assessed for S 100 B and compared with those obtained from eight infants supported by ECMO who did not develop ICH. Cerebral <b>ultrasound</b> and <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> waveform patterns in the middle cerebral artery (MCA PI) were also recorded {{at the same time as}} blood sampling. S 100 B blood concentrations were significantly higher in the group of infants with ICH 72 h before any signs of haemorrhage could be detected by ultrasound (ICH: 2. 91 +/- 0. 91 microg/L vs. control: 0. 53 +/- 0. 15 microg/L), reaching their peak at day 6, when cerebral ultrasound scan patterns were suggestive of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH: 3. 50 +/- 1. 03 microg/L vs. control: 0. 66 +/- 0. 27 microg/L) (p < 0. 05, for both). The highest S 100 B levels were observed in the three ICH infants who expired during the ECMO procedure (3. 43 microg/L, 4. 0 microg/L, 4. 12 microg/L, respectively). MCA PI values in the ICH group were also significantly higher, but only 24 h before any ultrasound pattern of bleeding was detected (ICH: 2. 31 +/- 0. 22 vs control: 1. 81 +/- 0. 24) (p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{pressure-driven}} flow of {{a suspension}} of spinning particles in a rectangular channel is studied using an acoustic method. The suspension {{is made of}} insulating particles (PMMA) dispersed in a slightly conducting oil (Ugilec + Dielec) and is subjected to a DC electric field. In such a case, the particles are polarized in the direction opposite {{to that of the}} electric field and begin to rotate in order to flip their dipoles in the field direction. Such a rotation of the particles is known as Quincke rotation and is responsible for an important decrease of the effective viscosity of the suspension. Indeed, due to the electric torque exerted on the particles, the stress tensor in the suspension is not symmetric anymore and a driving effect arises from the anti-symmetric part. When such a suspension flows through a rectangular channel, the velocity profile is expected to deviate from the usual Poiseuille flow.

40|$|Objectives: Adrenomedullin (AM) is a newly {{discovered}} vasodilator peptide that {{participates in the}} regulation of cerebral blood flow. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether circulating AM was increased in infants with prenatal asphyxia who developed intraventricular hemorrhage (WIT). Design and methods: A case-control study was performed on 40 fall-term asphyxiated newborns: 20 developed IVH (group A) and 20 did not (group 13). Forty term healthy newborns represented the control group. Biochemical laboratory parameters, neurological patterns, cerebral <b>ultrasound</b> scanning, and <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> were assessed at 12 and 72 h from birth. Plasma AM concentration was measured at 12 h from birth by means of a specific RIA. Results: AM levels were significantly higher in group A (20. 2 +/- 5. 2 fmol/ml) than in group B (8. 4 +/- 2. 1 fmol/ml) or controls (9. 3 +/- 2. 6 fmol/ml). In asphyxiated newborns, AM concentration was correlated with middle cerebral artery P 1 value only in group B. Conclusions: Increased concentration of AM at 12 h from birth in asphyxiated newborns who later developed IVH suggests that this peptide may participate in the loss of cerebral vascular autoregulation in response to hypoxia and could be useful to discriminate, among newborns at risk, those with an adverse neurological outcome.

The PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane and LILACS databases were searched for articles published in English until 2014 using the following keywords: “Gestational trophoblastic disease AND Ultrasonography, Doppler. ” Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria and were separated into the 4 following groups according to the aim of the study. (1) <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> {{does not seem to be}} capable of differentiating partial from complete moles, but it might be useful when evaluating pregnancies in which a complete mole coexists with a normal fetus. (2) There is controversy in the role of uterine artery <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> in the prediction of development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. (3) <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> is a useful tool in the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia because abnormal myometrial vascularization and lower uterine artery Doppler indices seem to be correlated with invasive disease.

Fluid flow in the liquid electrodes can enhance mass transfer and reduce the formation of localized intermetallics, and fluid flow can be promoted by careful choice of the locations and topology of a battery's electrical connections.

40|$|Experimental {{study of}} the {{influence}} of protection structures on avalanches and impact pressures Abstract: In the frame of snow avalanche protection, the optimisation of defence structure design depends on the understanding of the flow dynamics and on a exhaustive knowledge of the flow-obstacle interaction. The study presented here utilises a mainly experimental approach. Small-scale laboratory tests were combined with field measurements and observations. Dense snow avalanches are modelled by granular materials. Dry cohesionless and mono-dispersed glass beads are released down an inclined channel. Reference tests (with no obstacles) were carried out in order to characterise the flow dynamic properties, and an obstacle was then mounted and force measurements were taken. The geometry of two obstacles was tested: a large wall spanning the whole width of the flow and a narrower wall allowing lateral flows. Results showed that an influence zone forms uphill from the obstacle and {{plays an important role in}} the flow dynamics. An analysis of this zone was carried out, together with precise measurements of the flow depth (laser technique), surface velocity (PIV) and impact forces (force sensors). In relation to density currents, powder snow avalanches are modelled by a dyed salt solution flowing down an inclined channel immersed in a water tank. We investigated the influence of two different catching-dam-type obstacles on the flow behaviour with respect to reference conditions. The maximum flow height and its front and core velocity were measured by means of image processing and <b>ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry.</b> Results mainly showed the higher effectiveness of a dam with vertical uphill face rather than inclined and underscored the importance of the velocity norm in the computation of the total incoming flow velocity. In-situ full-scale measurements complement small-scale laboratory tests. A new full-scale experimental site was implemented on the existing avalanche defence system of Taconnaz (Chamonix, France). Three breaking mounds were equipped with velocity and pressure sensors. The reference event, the rough site conditions, the need for data synchronization and remote access defined the design constraints. In December 2010, the first event was recorded, which proved that the conceived system works effectively and also provided the first set of data. Preliminary results showed very high pressure peaks with high impact pressures even for low velocity regimes and thus a drag coefficient which increases when the Froude number decreases. Isolated rocks or ice blocks struck the sensors, contributing significantly to the total energy released by the avalanche. This work provided effective inputs for numerical and analytical models and enhanced the current knowledge of avalanche dynamics in order to optimise the future design guidelines for avalanche protection structures.

Placental volume and vascular indices, including vascularization, flow, and vascularization flow indices, were measured by three-dimensional ultrasound using a rotational technique and {{compared to a}} previously described nomogram. The observed-to-expected placental volume ratio for gestational age and observed-to-expected placental volume ratio for fetal weight were calculated. Placental parameters correlated with the <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> results of uterine and umbilical arteries. RESULTS: The mean uterine artery pulsatility index was negatively correlated with the observed-to-expected placental volume ratio for gestational age, vascularization index and vascularization flow index.

The uterine artery blood velocimetry {{seemed to be a}} good predictor of perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies and a complement to umbilical artery velocimetry. The fetal middle cerebral artery blood velocimetry might be an early sign of fetal hypoxia. In pregnancies with decreased perception of fetal movements, the non stress test seemed to be a better predictor of outcome than Doppler velocimetry. Ductus venosus blood velocimetry seems to be a poor indicator of adverse perinatal outcome. Fetal splenic artery vascular resistance decreased after 33 weeks of gestation in normal pregnancy and high-risk pregnancies usually have normal vascular resistance. The Color Doppler Velocity (CDV) technique has become a "mile stone" in ultrasound. The recent Color Doppler Energy (CDE) technique has further improved visualization of fetal organ blood perfusion. Computer analysis of CDE images has shown a reliable reproducibility. The CDE signal intensity is influenced by fluid flow felocity, depth and different instrument settings. In normal pregnancies, placental and fetal kidney, liver and lung CDE signals indicated increasing intensity until 33 weeks, with a decrease thereafter. Fetal splenic CDE signal in normal pregnancies increased until 33 weeks, being constant thereafter. The fetal CDE brain shown exponentially increasing CDE values at the end of normal pregnancy. A decrease in fetal organs perfusion, with increased fetal brain perfusion might indicate centralization of fetal circulation in normal pregnancy at term, as a response to decreased placental perfusion. High-risk pregnancies had less placental and fetal organs signal intensity, and increased brain and splenic signal intensity, suggesting more pronounced centralization of fetal circulation.

A better understanding of ﬂow behaviour of pulp-ﬁbre suspension is essential for improving the efficiency of unit processes in {{pulp and paper}} industry. Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) offers {{a powerful tool for}} simulating the ﬂow of pulp-ﬁbre suspension in industrial processes.

The objective of this thesis is to present a new experimental method for measuring a ﬂow ﬁeld of turbulent pulp-ﬁbre suspension wall jet. In order to validate the CFD simulation approach used in this work, the measurements were compared with the results obtained from CFD simulations. A novel experimental jet chamber was designed and built in Tampere University of Technology to measure the opening angle and penetration depth of pulp-ﬁbre suspension jet discharging from a round pipe next to a wall. Photography was used to visually measure the jet spread and penetration depth, while Pulsed <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>Velocimetry</b> (PUDV) was used to obtain the velocity proﬁle of the jet. Open-source CFD toolbox OpenFOAM was used to simulate the ﬂow ﬁeld inside the jet chamber.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} observation of magnetically-induced instabilities that occur from a preexisting hydrodynamically turbulent background. We claim these instabilities are the first direct observation of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). An extensive body of theoretical and numerical research has established the MRI {{is important in the}} theory of accretion disks: magnetic fields destabilize otherwise stable astrophysical flows, causing turbulence and an increased angular momentum transport needed for accretion. Our instabilities occur in liquid sodium between differentially rotating concentric spheres (spherical Couette flow) where an external field is applied parallel to the axis of rotation. Our experiments are also the first known spherical Couette flow in an electrically conducting fluid, and only the second experiment, in any fluid, at an aspect ratio of 2, the same of the Earth's core. We describe the development of a Hall probe array that measures the field at 30 points outside the sphere and is used to perform a spherical harmonic decomposition (up to l= 4) of the induced field. We present measurements taken with this array, along with measurements of torque needed to spin the inner sphere and of the flow velocity using <b>ultrasound</b> <b>doppler</b> <b>velocimetry.</b> Our experiment is consistent with prior theory, even though our instabilities occur in the presence of preexisting hydrodynamic turbulence (the theory starts with an initially laminar flow). This result may be particularly relevant in light of an ongoing debate on whether accretion disks are hydrodynamically unstable independent of external fields. The most important contribution of our experiments, however, may be in providing data with which to benchmark the many numerical and theoretical studies of the MRI and the codes used to simulate the Earth's core...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates liquid metal flows {{driven by}} rising gas bubbles in a static magnetic field, {{the direction of}} which is either vertical or horizontal, respectively. Using <b>ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> (UDV), we measure the velocities of the gas and liquid phases in model experiments based on the melt GaInSn. The results disclose different magnetic damping influences on the flow depending on {{the direction of the}} magnetic field. Chapter 1 consists of three parts: a short introduction to the research background; a brief review on the fundamentals of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that are relevant for the current work; as well as some descriptions of the model experiments using low-temperature melt in the laboratory. Chapter 2 reviews ultrasound Doppler methods for the measurements of fluid flow. We focus on an ultrasound device DOP 2000, whose capability is tested especially for the mea-surements of bubble-driven flows. Chapter 3 is concerned with the flow of a single bubble rising in a bulk of stagnant melt, which is exposed to a vertical or a horizontal field. We measure the velocity of the bubble as well as the bubble-induced liquid motion, and compare the influence of the magnetic damping as the field direction is changed. Chapter 4 is focused on liquid metal flows driven by a bubble plume inside an insulating vessel. We obtain velocity fields of the liquid phase, as well as the distributions of void fraction, of the flow in a vertical and a horizontal magnetic field, respectively. The results are compared and discussed. Chapter 5 summarizes the current work and presents the main conclusions based on the current results. The relevance of the current research work to the real industrial applications is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypoxia {{in utero}} {{can lead to}} {{stillbirth}} and severe perinatal injury. While current prenatal tests can identify fetuses that are hypoxic, none can determine the severity of hypoxia/acidemia. We hypothesized a hypoxic/acidemic fetus would up-regulate and release hypoxia-induced mRNA from the fetoplacental unit into the maternal circulation, {{where they can be}} sampled and quantified. Furthermore, we hypothesized the abundance of hypoxia induced mRNA in the maternal circulation would correlate with severity of fetal hypoxia/acidemia in utero. We therefore examined whether abundance of hypoxia-induced mRNA in the maternal circulation correlates with the degree of fetal hypoxia in utero. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of two cohorts: 1) longitudinal study of pregnant women undergoing an induction of labor (labor induces acute fetal hypoxia) and 2) pregnancies complicated by severe preterm growth restriction (chronic fetal hypoxia). For each cohort, we correlated hypoxia induced mRNA in the maternal blood with degree of fetal hypoxia during its final moments in utero, evidenced by umbilical artery pH or lactate levels obtained at birth. Gestational tissues and maternal bloods were sampled and mRNAs quantified by microarray and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Hypoxia-induced mRNAs in maternal blood rose across labor, an event that induces acute fetal hypoxia. They exhibited a precipitous increase across the second stage of labor, a particularly hypoxic event. Importantly, a hypoxia gene score (sum of the relative expression of four hypoxia-induced genes) strongly correlated with fetal acidemia at birth. Hypoxia-induced mRNAs were also increased in the blood of women carrying severely growth restricted preterm fetuses, a condition of chronic fetal hypoxia. The hypoxia gene score correlated with the severity of <b>ultrasound</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> abnormalities in fetal vessels. Importantly, the hypoxia gene score (derived from mRNA abundance in maternal blood) was significantly correlated with the degree of fetal acidemia at birth in this growth restriction cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Abundance of mRNAs coding hypoxia-induced genes circulating in maternal blood strongly correlates with degree of fetal hypoxia/acidemia. Measuring hypoxia-induced mRNA in maternal blood may form the basis of a novel non-invasive test to clinically determine the degree of fetal hypoxia/acidemia while in utero.

40|$|Abstract Objective: Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) is {{a common}} complication in human pregnancy. It is often caused by placental-insufficiency and can be diagnosed with <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> measurements in the umbilical and middle cerebral arteries. To study the effects, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} IUGR a animal model is necessary. In this study the possibility of using <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in pig fetuses is examined. Methods: Twelve 3 - 5 th parity sows between 55 - 110 days of gestation were scanned. In each sow two fetuses were recorded for 2 - 5 minutes. These recordings were observed and the percentage of fetal movement was calculated. Five 3 - 5 th parity sows between 70 - 94 days of gestation were scanned 1 - 2 times a week for 3 weeks. With color flow Doppler the arteries were located in two fetuses per sow. Results: The percentage of fetal movement decreases with advanced gestation. However, no <b>Doppler</b> flow <b>velocimetry</b> measurements could be done due to constant fetal movement. Discussion: During the study it became clear that measuring <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> in pig fetuses is quite a challenge. To determine if the pig fetus is an accurate animal model which we can use to diagnose and treat intrauterine growth restriction in human fetuses, more research has to be done...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the expression of some non collagenous extracellular matrix proteins, in particular tenascin, in human placentas of intrauterine growth restricted fetuses with abnormal umbilical <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry.</b> Study Design: Study group (group A) consisted of 23 pregnant women with intrauterine growth restricted fetuses, with or without preeclampsia. Control group (group B) consisted of 10 pregnant women with appropriate fetal weight for gestational age. Placental specimens were collected from biopsies obtained after cesarean delivery. Umbilical artery <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> was performed within four hours from delivery in all patients. Tenascin expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques. Results: A difference in birth weight and placental weight was found in the two groups, being lower in the study group. Umbilical artery <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> showed abnormal patterns in the study group and normal findings in the control one. Tenascin was strongly expressed in placentas from growth restricted fetuses, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by RT-PCR, while it was almost absent in placentas from group B. Conclusion: A relationship between abnormal Doppler patterns and tenascin distribution in growth restricted fetuses has been observed. The presence of tenascin might be considered as a placental compensatory mechanism in FGR fetuses with abnormal umbilical artery <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{investigate}} orbital vascular {{resistance by}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> {{in patients with}} steady-state sickle cell anemia, {{as well as to}} characterize its relationship with biomarkers of hemolysis. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of two groups: 71 outpatients with sickle cell anemia; and 32 age- and gender- matched, healthy subjects (control group). All participants underwent <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> of the orbital arteries and laboratory tests. Results: All biochemical laboratory markers were abnormal in the sickle cell anemia patients (p < 0. 0001 vs. controls). In the patient group, <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry</b> revealed increased flow velocities in the ophthalmic artery and reduced flow velocities in the central retinal artery, as well as high values for the resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) in both arteries (p < 0. 0001 vs. controls). Biomarkers of hemolysis were found to correlate significantly with the RI and PI indices. In the ophthalmic artery, the reticulocyte count showed a moderate direct correlation with RI and with PI. In the central retinal artery, hemoglobin showed a strong inverse correlation with RI and with PI. Conclusion: Orbital vascular resistance, as evaluated by <b>Doppler</b> <b>velocimetry,</b> is elevated in patients with steady-state sickle cell anemia and shows a significant correlation with biomarkers of hemolysis...|$|R
