500|$|One {{character}} who {{was cut from}} the pilot episode was an unpleasant, racist, wheelchair-bound old woman named Mrs. Littlefield, supposedly a regular customer of Cheers, who {{was intended to be}} a recurring character. Her lines were filmed as part of a rough cut of the pilot. However, the producers decided to cut the character out of the episode, as they found her character did not mesh with other characters or with the overall tone of the show. Nevertheless, the uncredited actress who played her can still be seen as a background performer in a few scenes. [...] Some sources credit this actress as Elaine Strich, although the <b>unidentified</b> <b>actress</b> who is still seen on camera looks nothing like Stritch. In answer to a question about the actress, Cheers writer/producer Ken Levine has stated on his blog [...] "that was not Elaine Stritch" [...] The producers ultimately decided to eliminate Mrs. Littlefield completely from the show from that point forward, necessitating changes to some yet-to-be-filmed scripts for the first few episodes.|$|E

Longoria had previously appeared on the soap operas The Bold and the Beautiful and General Hospital.

2500|$|Margaret Sinclair Edwards (born 1877, New York City – died January 14, 1929, New York City), {{known on}} the stage as [...] "Daisy Sinclair", {{appeared}} with the theatrical companies of Edward Harrigan, Eddie Foy, and Gus Edwards, among others. Her husband, John Edwards, an invalid, died the same year she did (1929). She appeared as Marguerite Edwards in A Physical Culture Romance in 1914, and in Weber's Sunshine Molly in 1915.

50|$|Charlie (Charlie Chaplin) takes {{a job as}} {{a janitor}} in the home of Colonel Nutt (unidentified actor), a munitions manufacturer. As the butler (unidentified actor) {{introduces}} Charlie to the ill-tempered cook (Billy Armstrong), Colonel Nutt demonstrates his new wireless explosive device to his daughter (<b>unidentified</b> <b>actress).</b> Meanwhile, agents of the Pretzelstrass meet with the Count (Leo White) to devise a plan to get at Colonel Nutt's device. Charlie carelessly dumps garbage all over the maid (Edna Purviance) and her newly clean floor. He takes the trash can and dumps it over the fence, inundating the Count in the process. Back in the kitchen, the maid scolds Charlie, but then becomes emotional, and he comforts her. The Count enters the house, and is hit by a wet rag thrown by the maid, intended for Charlie. The Count tosses it off to the side, and it winds up hitting the cook also, and when the cook begins to act cruelly towards the maid in return, Charlie sticks up for her. The Count makes his way to the Colonel, who rejects his offers and has the Count ejected by way of the butler.|$|E
50|$|On {{the set of}} a dark war time drama at an {{old movie}} studio, a young director, Toshio Murai (Yanagi), is trying to {{complete}} his debut film. The two starring actresses, Hitomi Kurokawa and Saori Murakami, play sisters in his film. Murai has a crush on Hitomi (Shiroshima), the seasoned leading actress, and keeps a photo of her by his bed. The younger and less experienced actress, Saori (Ishibashi), is annoying and likes to have recess on the set. The production of the movie is consistently interrupted by strange occurrences and {{the cast and crew}} begin to get spooked. When Murai reviews the shoot, he is shocked to see that scenes from an unreleased (and presumed destroyed) drama from years earlier are intermingled with his negatives. As Murai is watching his footage, the scene is interrupted by a film within a film of an <b>unidentified</b> <b>actress</b> on a movie set, with something that looks like a woman behind her, long black hair, pale skin, out of focus, laughing hysterically. Murai is fascinated with the freaky footage, as it looks strangely familiar. The production shuts down for a formal investigation. Murai has only three days left to find out what is going on and finish the shoot. Murai looks into his own past, and finds a frightening connection between the film he is shooting and the strange footage he has uncovered.|$|E
