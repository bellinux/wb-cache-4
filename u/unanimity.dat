5|$|Mountfort was a Freemason and {{an early}} member of the Lodge of <b>Unanimity,</b> the main {{building}} of which he designed in 1863. The Lodge of <b>Unanimity</b> was the first Masonic Lodge in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that six-member juries are {{sufficient}} and that five-member juries are not. Verdict <b>unanimity</b> {{is not required}} for twelve-member juries, but is required for six-member juries.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 had also significant legal consequences. Up to that time, the {{election of}} the new Pope required <b>unanimity</b> among the electors, which led to the schism when the existence of factions in the Sacred College made the <b>unanimity</b> impossible. To avoid the schism in the future, the Third Lateran Council in 1179 promulgated the decree Licet de evitanda discordia, which established the rule that the Pope is elected with a majority of two thirds of the cardinals participating in the election.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unanimity</b> was {{required}} for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members. This requirement was {{a reflection of the}} League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for <b>unanimity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both rivals {{together}} with their adherents defended the legality of their elections. In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects. The “Alexandrine” manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals, while that of Victorine faction only by five. Supporters of Victor IV, admitting {{that they were in}} minority, justified their action {{by the fact that the}} opposite faction broke the rule of <b>unanimity</b> and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of <b>unanimity</b> had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial faction, who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College.|$|E
5|$|The hall {{continued}} to be let out for various social functions, and is currently home to nine lodges of the Freemasons; <b>Unanimity</b> & Sincerity Lodge, Lodge of St George, Taunton Deane Lodge, Queens College Lodge, Old Aluredian Lodge, Taunton School Lodge, Richard Huish Lodge, Vivary Lodge and the Emergency Services Lodge.|$|E
5|$|General sejm was {{the highest}} organ of {{collective}} and consensus-based state power. The Sejm's supreme court, presided over by the king, decided the most serious of legal cases. During {{the second half of}} the 17th century, for a variety of reasons, including abuse of the <b>unanimity</b> rule (liberum veto), sejm's effectiveness had declined, and the void was being increasingly filled by sejmiks, where in practice the bulk of government's work was getting done.|$|E
5|$|Its {{decisions}} are made by qualified majority voting in most areas, <b>unanimity</b> in others, or just simple majority for procedural issues. Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the ordinary legislative procedure applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new EU law itself.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1822, St George's Chapel served Taunton's growing Catholic {{community}} for over 35 years, before {{they moved to}} a larger church which was completed in 1860. After being rented out for a time, when it was known as St George's Hall, the building was then sold in 1878 to a company {{acting on behalf of}} a group of Freemasons, who purchased it to provide a home for the <b>Unanimity</b> & Sincerity Lodge. It now hosts nine different Lodges of the Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|The Council {{votes in}} one of three ways; <b>unanimity,</b> simple majority, or {{qualified}} majority. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by qualified majority voting, meaning that there must be a minimum of 55% of member states agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% of the EU population. A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of the EU population.|$|E
5|$|The {{meetings}} of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the Secretary General of NATO and, when decisions have to be made, action is agreed upon {{on the basis of}} <b>unanimity</b> and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{passengers}} and crew of both vessels consulted on whether to continue southwards or turn back and await better weather. According to one source, missionary W.P. Crook aboard Integrity, there was <b>unanimity</b> for continuing the voyage except for Captain Houstoun, who wished to turn back. As Houstoun was the nominal commander of the voyage his view prevailed and Integrity and Contest returned to Port Jackson together, arriving on 13 July.|$|E
5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or <b>unanimity</b> with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} sejm {{proceedings}} was formalized in the 17th century. The lower chamber would {{do most of}} the statute preparation work. The last several days were spent working together with the Senate and the king, when the final versions were agreed upon and decisions made; the finished legislative product had to have the consent of all three legislating estates of the realm, the Sejm, the Senate, and the monarch. The lower chamber's rule of <b>unanimity</b> had not been rigorously enforced {{during the first half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than <b>unanimity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of <b>unanimity,</b> and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
5|$|Joy Smith, Member of Parliament (MP) for Kildonan—St. Paul {{with the}} Conservative Party, put forward motion C-153 in February 2007 {{to put in}} place a Canada-wide action plan to combat human trafficking, and the House of Commons passed the motion unanimously. Thomas Axworthy of the Toronto Star said that the <b>unanimity</b> of this {{decision}} demonstrated that the Harper government was just as dedicated to opposing human trafficking as was Barack Obama, President of the United States. Early promoters of a Canadian anti-trafficking action plan hoped for up to $100 million in funding, which they argued would turn Canada into a world leader in the fight against human trafficking. World Vision Canada began lobbying for a national human trafficking action plan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 {{and the subsequent}} schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections. The decree Licet de evitanda discordia issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of <b>unanimity</b> in favour {{of the rule of}} the majority of two thirds. The decree confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the decree In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the <b>unanimity</b> of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E
5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require <b>unanimity</b> before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E
25|$|The {{aims of the}} CFSP are {{to promote}} both the EU's own {{interests}} {{and those of the}} international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The CFSP requires <b>unanimity</b> among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The <b>unanimity</b> and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The <b>unanimity</b> Procedure - section 41. The {{amendment}} must {{be passed}} by the House of Commons, Senate, and all provincial legislative assemblies.|$|E
25|$|The European Council, after {{consulting}} the European Parliament and the Commission, votes {{to adopt a}} decision amending Part three {{on the basis of}} the proposals by <b>unanimity.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther and John Calvin {{denied the}} sacramentality of marriage. This <b>unanimity</b> was broken at the , the quadrennial {{meeting of the}} {{worldwide}} Anglican Communion—creating divisions in that denomination.|$|E
25|$|A new {{language}} standardization process {{began at the}} 2003 Scheme workshop, {{with the goal of}} producing an R6RS standard in 2006. This process broke with the earlier RnRS approach of <b>unanimity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The court {{acts as a}} collegial body: {{decisions}} {{are those of the}} court rather than of individual judges; no minority opinions are given and indeed the existence of a majority decision rather than <b>unanimity</b> is never suggested.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{ordinary}} legislative procedure (see below), the negative opinion from the Commission also forces the Council to vote by <b>unanimity</b> rather than majority. There are also limited instances where the Commission can adopt legislation on its own initiative (See below).|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 2007, Juan Luna {{was found}} guilty of all seven counts of murder. He was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole on May 17. The state had sought the death penalty, which was {{available}} at the time, but the jury's vote of eleven-to-one in favor of the death penalty fell short of the required <b>unanimity</b> to impose it.|$|E
25|$|Nicolas Sarkozy (Union for a Popular Movement) {{proposed}} a simplified European treaty {{which would be}} ratified by the French Parliament instead of being submitted to a referendum. He also declared himself against the rule of <b>unanimity</b> in European decisions and opposed the accession of Turkey to the European Union. Furthermore, {{he said he would}} argue in favour of revaluing the euro, increasing the European defence budget and creating a European Foreign Affairs Minister.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the <b>unanimity</b> of the three court decisions, Roosevelt became distressed and irritable, regarding the opinions as personal attacks. The Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey's Ex. particularly stunned the administration. Only nine years earlier, in Myers v. United States, the Taft Court had held the President's power to remove executive officials was plenary. Roosevelt and his entourage viewed Sutherland's particularly vicious criticism {{as an attempt to}} publicly shame the President and paint him as having purposefully violated the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Ware, Lutyens, and Baker met for {{a second}} time to discuss {{cemetery}} planning at the IWGC headquarters in London on 21 September 1917. They were joined by Arthur William Hill, then the assistant director of Kew Gardens. Both Baker and Lutyens presented draft designs for various types of cemeteries, but no agreement was reached on any design principles. After Ware informed him about the lack of <b>unanimity</b> among his advisors, the Prince of Wales advised Ware to keep news of any disagreements out of public view.|$|E
25|$|Twelve jurors decide by a {{qualified}} majority of two-thirds whether {{the defendant is}} guilty or not. A tied vote results in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty - 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by <b>unanimity,</b> reverse the majority to 'not guilty'. The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges. As a result of the Taxquet ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{example of}} the {{relations}} with Portugal illustrated that De Witt's diplomatic gifts were necessary as much within the Republic, as without. He always had to make internal deals to accompany the external deals he made with foreign powers. In {{the case of the}} Hague treaty, Zeeland at first refused to ratify (and the requirement of <b>unanimity</b> in cases of peace and war in the Union of Utrecht made its position strong). De Witt persuaded the Zeeland States to acquiesce by giving the Zeeland salt-refiners {{the best part of the}} business of refining the salt that Portugal paid as its indemnity.|$|E
25|$|Halay (Azerbaijani: Yalli) propagates <b>unanimity,</b> {{unity and}} collectiveness. It {{is a very}} old and very custom dance in Azerbaijan. At first times, it was {{performed}} in form of traditional celebration of fire, which was source of heat, light, and warm food. In this traditional celebration, dancers worship fire as a goddess. Yally starts with a slow speed and finishes in the fast mode with fast steps in form of running. There are many kinds of Yally in Azerbaijan. This dance is performed {{by a group of}} people and in ancient times whoever didn't dance properly was fined by the chieftain who makes him sing a song or dance another dance.|$|E
25|$|The Council was {{composed}} of one national minister from each member state. However the Council met in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture was being discussed, the Council would be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represented their governments and were accountable to their national political systems. Votes were taken either by majority (with votes allocated according to population) or <b>unanimity.</b> In these various forms they share some legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament. Since the 1960s the Council also began to meet informally {{at the level of}} national leaders; these European summits followed the same presidency system and secretariat as the Council but was not a formal formation of it.|$|E
25|$|Prominent changes {{included}} {{the move from}} <b>unanimity</b> to qualified majority voting in at least 45 policy areas in the Council of Ministers, a change in calculating such a majority to a new double majority, a more powerful European Parliament forming a bicameral legislature alongside the Council of Ministers under the ordinary legislative procedure, a consolidated legal personality for the EU {{and the creation of}} a long-term President of the European Council and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The Treaty also made the Union's bill of rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding. The Treaty for the first time gave member states the explicit legal right to leave the EU and the procedure to do so.|$|E
