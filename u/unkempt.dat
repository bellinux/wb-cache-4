5|$|Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun, the <b>unkempt</b> {{and highly}} excitable {{scientist}} {{in charge of}} research at Area 51. Dr. Okun {{appeared to have been}} killed by an alien but returned in the sequel, where it was revealed that the character had merely been in a coma. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on Stargate.|$|E
5|$|Historically, East Asian {{cultures}} viewed {{long hair}} {{as a sign}} of youth and aesthetic beauty. Long hair is associated with private life and sexuality. East Asian cultures see long, <b>unkempt</b> hair in a woman {{as a sign of}} sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually their hair is tied up. Lay Buddhists have long hair, while Buddhist monks have shaved heads.|$|E
5|$|They {{contain a}} wide array of physiognomical representations. Van Gogh's mental and {{physical}} condition is usually apparent; he may appear <b>unkempt,</b> unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and <b>unkempt</b> yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E
5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an <b>unkempt</b> state. A search of his cabin {{revealed}} a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found {{what appeared to be}} the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future. By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E
5|$|John Watson, {{whose wife}} Mary is now visibly pregnant, finds an <b>unkempt</b> Sherlock Holmes {{living in a}} crack house under the {{influence}} of drugs. John attempts to force him to rehabilitate, but Sherlock insists that he was undercover for a case. Mycroft confronts Sherlock about the drug use and realises that Sherlock is investigating Charles Augustus Magnussen, a newspaper owner who blackmails people. Sherlock has been enlisted by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood to negotiate the return of stolen letters written by Smallwood's husband. Mycroft warns Sherlock not to go after Magnussen, which Sherlock ignores.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The <b>unkempt</b> fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{conflicts}} {{have sometimes}} {{made it impossible}} for the Commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether. Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was <b>unkempt</b> after the end of World War II and until the German reunification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005. The Six-Day War and War of Attrition resulted in the destruction of Port Tewfik Memorial and Aden Memorial, and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery. During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|The Green was not {{maintained}} at first; after being cleared, it was <b>unkempt</b> and ragged, sloping sharply towards a swamp {{in the southwest}} corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as {{to the future of}} the plot, considering using it for a variety of purposes. In 1828, the Board of Trustees finally voted to plow, seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately; the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836. The main road from Hanover to the northward Lyme, New Hampshire had previously led diagonally across the Green, and due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while <b>unkempt,</b> dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, <b>unkempt</b> hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, {{who has not been}} seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of the}} family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and <b>unkempt</b> appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the State of Connecticut paid $550,000 {{to acquire}} the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park. The land was {{acquired}} from the estate of Carmine Belardo and returned a beach to public service {{that had been a}} private resort for 60 years. The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits. Concerns included littering, <b>unkempt</b> toilets, swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers. The problems with trash problems and portable toilets ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group, Friends of Gardner Lake, and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, then Prime Minister Tony Blair {{unveiled}} {{a statue of}} Donald Dewar {{at the top of}} Glasgow's Buchanan Street, a street in Glasgow City centre. In keeping with his famous <b>unkempt</b> appearance, it showed Dewar wearing a slightly crushed jacket.|$|E
25|$|Brennan {{was writing}} {{consistently}} and productively {{in the late}} 1960s. By the time her first books were published, however, she was showing signs of mental illness. Her previously immaculate appearance became <b>unkempt.</b> Her friends began to find her eccentricities disturbing rather than entertaining. She became obsessive.|$|E
25|$|A {{mycorrhizal}} species, Amanita vaginata grows singly or numerous in both coniferous and hardwood forests. It {{has also}} been noted to occur frequently in grassy areas {{at the edge of}} forests, <b>unkempt</b> lawns, and suburban area where the ground has been recently disturbed. A widely distributed and common species, it fruits from the spring to the fall.|$|E
25|$|After being a {{fugitive}} for eight years, Schillaci {{was arrested in}} the town of San José de Gracia, Michoacán on June 5, 2008 without incident. When approached by the FBI and Mexican authorities, he confirmed his identity. He was living in what was described as an <b>unkempt</b> shack. Schillaci did not face any child pornography charges in Mexico, although Mexican authorities could still charge him.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{known for}} coming to council {{meetings}} in blue jeans with <b>unkempt</b> hair, Layton worked to change his image {{to run for mayor}} in the 1991 civic election. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning his glasses, and traded in his blue jeans for suits. In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent Art Eggleton. In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.|$|E
25|$|To his neighbors, Berdella was {{considered}} a flamboyant, yet helpful and civic-minded individual, despite the generally <b>unkempt</b> state of his property, and his somewhat haughty attitude. Beginning in the late 1970s, Berdella would assist in the organizational activities of the South Hyde Park Crime Prevention and Neighborhood Association; becoming their chairman in the early 1980s and encouraging neighborhood‑watch patrols. (He remained active in this association until the mid-1980s, when he relinquished his position within the organization.) Berdella would also represent his neighborhood at fundraising events for a local public television station, although he would also disengage himself from these events by the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|Burgundy wine has {{experienced}} much {{change over the}} past 75 years. Economic depression during the 1930s {{was followed by the}} devastation caused by World War II. After the War, the vignerons returned home to their <b>unkempt</b> vineyards. The soils and vines had suffered and were sorely in need of nurturing. The growers began to fertilize, bringing their vineyards back to health. Those who could afford it added potassium, a mineral fertilizer that contributes to vigorous growth. By the mid-1950s, the soils were balanced, yields were reasonably low and the vineyards produced some of the most stunning wines in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the village}} houses on the hill are still {{standing}} and have been incorporated into an Israeli hospital {{for the mentally ill}} that was established on the site. Some houses outside the fence of the hospital grounds are used for residential and commercial purposes, or as warehouses. Outside the fence, there are carob and almond trees and the stumps of olive trees. Several wells are located at the southwestern edge of the site. The old village cemetery, southeast of the site, is <b>unkempt</b> and threatened by debris from a ring road that has been constructed around the village hill. One tall cypress tree still stands {{at the center of the}} cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Early {{graphic art}} {{of all kinds}} often {{depicted}} Black characters in a stylized fashion, emphasizing certain physical features to form a recognizable racial caricature of Black faces. These features often included long <b>unkempt</b> hair, broad noses, enormous red-tinted lips, dark skin and ragged clothing reminiscent of those worn by Black slaves. These characters were also depicted as speaking accented English. In the early 20th century United States, these kinds of representations were seen frequently in newspaper comic strips and political cartoons, {{as well as in}} later comic magazines, and were also present in early cartoons by Disney and Looney Tunes. In comics, nameless Black bystanders (see right) and even some notable heroes and villains were developed in this style, including Ebony White, sidekick of The Spirit (see below) and Steamboat, valet of Billy Batson.|$|E
25|$|Fred first {{encountered}} Rosemary Letts in early 1969 (shortly after her 15th birthday). The pair first met at Cheltenham bus station. Initially, Rose was repulsed by Fred's <b>unkempt</b> appearance, and deduced {{he was a}} tramp, although she quickly became flattered by the attention Fred continued to lavish upon her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop. Reportedly, Rose twice refused to accompany Fred upon a date, although she agreed {{to allow him to}} accompany her home. In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose had never had a boyfriend, she was overtly promiscuous. He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, fashion had {{moved away from}} the <b>unkempt</b> hippie look and overdressed disco style of the late 1970s. Athletic clothes were more popular than jeans during this period, as were more subdued colors. Popular colors were black, white, indigo, forest green, burgundy, and {{different}} shades of browns, tans, and oranges. Velour, velvet, and polyester were popular fabrics used in clothes, especially button-up and v-neck shirts. Looser pants remained popular during this time, being fairly wide but straight, and tighter shirts were especially popular. The general public, at this time, wanted to wear low-maintenance clothing with more basic colors, as the global recession going on at the time kept extravagant clothes out of reach. Also worn were striped tube socks sometimes worn with the top folded over worn with shorts. It was not uncommon to see parents especially fathers wearing these along with their kids.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} after Hindley's return, Heathcliff and Catherine walk to Thrushcross Grange to spy on Edgar and Isabella Linton, who live there. After being discovered, they try to run away but are caught. Catherine is injured by the Lintons' dog and taken into the house to recuperate, while Heathcliff is sent home. Catherine stays with the Lintons. The Lintons are landed gentry and Catherine is {{influenced}} by their elegant appearance and genteel manners. When she returns to Wuthering Heights, her appearance and manners are more ladylike, and she laughs at Heathcliff's <b>unkempt</b> appearance. The next day, knowing that the Lintons are to visit, Heathcliff, upon Nelly's advice, tries to dress up, {{in an effort to}} impress Catherine, but he and Edgar get into an argument and Hindley humiliates Heathcliff by locking him in the attic. Catherine tries to comfort Heathcliff, but he vows revenge on Hindley.|$|E
25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its <b>unkempt</b> riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a Priest and Chorus Girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He Will Not Go Without A Friend").|$|E
25|$|Edward III's first coinage, between 1327 and 1335, is {{very similar}} to the Edward I and II pennies, with the {{inscription}} EDWAR ANGL DNS HYB around a front-facing bust of the king; these pennies were minted in London, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, York, and Berwick upon Tweed. No more pennies were minted until his third, or florin, coinage in 1344–1351 (so-called because the dies were made by two craftsmen from Florence). In this coinage the king's hairstyle appears to be much longer and more <b>unkempt.</b> These coins were produced in London, Canterbury, Durham, Reading, and York. During the period of Edward's fourth coinage (1351–1377) politics affected the inscription on most coins, but to a lesser extent on the penny than on the larger coins, {{due to the lack of}} available space. Edward claimed the throne of France, but the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360 granted him land in France; on some coins, but not the penny, his overlordship of Aquitaine is recognised. After the treaty was repudiated by the French in 1369 the claim to France was reinstated and England and France went to war again, though England lost most of its French possessions except Calais and Bordeaux. Pre-treaty pennies were minted in London, Durham and York, with the obverse legend EDWARDUS REX ANGLI. During the Treaty period the Durham and York mints continued to mint pennies with that inscription, while ones produced by the London and Calais mints were inscribed EDWARD ANGL R DNS HYB. During the post-treaty period the Durham and York mints became ecclesiastical mints, under the authority of the local bishop or archbishop, and thus a source of money for the Church. Typical inscriptions of this period are EDWARD R ANGL FRANC, EDWARDUS REX ANGLIE FR, EDWARD REX ANGL FR – Edward King of England and France.|$|E

500|$|Maple {{described}} Pickingill as [...] "a tall, <b>unkempt</b> man, solitary and uncommunicative. He {{had very}} long finger-nails, {{and kept his}} money in a purse of sacking". He also noted that he {{had worked as a}} farm labourer and that he was a widower with two sons.|$|E
500|$|Wills' {{physical}} appearance had deteriorated; gaining weight, balding and generally <b>unkempt,</b> with [...] "an alcoholic blush of his cheeks", he looked {{older than his}} years. Describing his body as [...] "stiff" [...] during a cricket match in 1870, he hinted, for the first time, that his talent was fading.|$|E
500|$|He {{was known}} in Lolol as [...] "the Hippie", because of his [...] "intentionally <b>unkempt</b> look, with beard and long hair," [...] {{possibly}} inspired in the looks of Jesus Christ. Some Lolol residents have told the media that López may {{have been part of}} a satanic sect. He was also a user of marijuana, which he reportedly also sold.|$|E
500|$|To his shock, Wilson discovers House {{alive and}} well having faked his death and House asks Wilson how he wants to spend his last five months. [...] Sometime later, an <b>unkempt</b> Wilson and House are seen in the {{countryside}} on motorcycles, Wilson having presumably quit his job to spend his last five months as he wants. [...] He asks House about {{what they will do}} when the cancer gets bad, but House simply tells him that [...] "cancer is boring" [...] and they ride off together.|$|E
500|$|Biko's {{given name}} [...] "Bantu" [...] means [...] "people"; Biko {{interpreted}} {{this in terms}} of the saying [...] "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" [...] ("a person is a person by means of other people"). As a child he was nicknamed [...] "Goofy" [...] and [...] "Xwaku-Xwaku", the latter a reference to his <b>unkempt</b> appearance. He was raised in his family's Anglican Christian faith. In 1950, when Biko was four, his father fell ill, was hospitalised in St. Matthew's Hospital, Keiskammahoek, and died, making the family dependent on his mother's income.|$|E
500|$|The curve-billed thrasher {{generally}} measures [...] long, and {{is immediately}} {{recognized as a}} thrasher by its long tail and short wings. It is also recognized for its sickle-shaped bill, {{almost as long as}} its head width and brownish black in color. The body is compact with a large head, short wings and long tail. However, the tail is short relative to other thrasher species. The chest is grayish brown with circular brown-gray spots. The eyes are generally orange, shading to golden in adulthood. Juveniles are lacking in pale tips, retrices, abdominal feathers are <b>unkempt</b> and upper parts and chest are washed rufously.|$|E
500|$|The first {{permanent}} {{settlement was}} in 1876, when Thomas F. McMillan built a cabin {{at the base}} of Mars Hill {{on the west side of}} town. During the 1880s, Flagstaff began to grow, opening its first post office and attracting the railroad industry. The early economy was based on timber, sheep, and cattle. By 1886, Flagstaff was the largest city on the railroad line between Albuquerque and the west coast of the United States. A circa 1900 diary entry by journalist Sharlot Hall described the houses in the city at the time as a [...] "third rate mining camp", with <b>unkempt</b> air and high prices of available goods.|$|E
