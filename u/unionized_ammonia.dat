Two runs of static 96 h bioassays were conducted to determine the median lethal concentration (LC 50) of <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia</b> (NH 3) to milkfish fry. Test concentrations were based on exploratory 24 h and 48 h bioassays and were made in three replicates.

40|$|International audienceAmmonia is {{a natural}} {{component}} of sediments and {{has been identified as}} a common contributor to toxicity in marine sediment, elutriate and porewater testing. In our study, the role of ammonia as a possible toxicant in sediment toxicity tests was evaluated using larvae of the surf clam,. Elutriates were prepared and tested using six baseline sediment samples. Ammonia was then purged from aliquots of the baseline sediment samples prior to elutriate preparation. Finally, ammonia was spiked into aliquots of the purged elutriates to mimic ammonia concentrations measured in the baseline elutriates. Toxicity was present in all of the baseline samples and was removed in the ammonia purged samples. In most cases, toxicity was comparable in the ammonia spiked samples to levels measured in the baseline samples. Water only toxicity tests revealed that larvae of the surf clam are one of the more ammonia sensitive marine species.

40|$|In 1995, a TMDL {{addressing}} nitrogen, ammonia, and {{dissolved oxygen}} in the Laguna was completed by the North Coast regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Water Board) (Morris, 1995). The TMDL {{took the form of}} the Waste Reduction Strategy for the Laguna de Santa Rosa (Waste Reduction Strategy) and it addressed the reduction of nitrogen loading from point and nonpoint sources. The 1995 TMDL established both concentration-based and mass-based loading capacities and seasonal allocations for both total nitrogen (TN) and total ammonia-N (NH 3 -N). Excessive nitrogen loading can contribute to instream toxicity through conversion to the ammonia form of nitrogen. The term total nitrogen includes all forms of nitrogen: nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and organic. Ammonia-nitrogen, a major component of the nitrogen cycle, is formed by chemical and bacterial decomposition or breakdown of animal wastes, principally urea and other protein-bearing materials.

One bass and 15, 30, 60 or 120 mosquitofish were placed in each of 13 150 liter aquaria, designed with uniform cover for the prey, and allowed to interact for ten days. These prey densities were maintained by restocking every 24 hours, thus providing a wide range of food availability for the predators. Experiments were first run without adding ammonium chloride in order to establish baseline responses of both predators and prey. The system was then exposed to a range of toxicant concentrations from 0. 13 mg/l to 0. 86 mg/ 1 NH₃. Responses of predators and prey were measured and compared to the baseline data. Consumption and growth rates of the unexposed bass increased with increasing prey densities. Consumption rates ranged from one to ten percent of mean dry weight of bass per day, growth rates from a loss of two percent to a gain of three and one-half percent of mean dry weight of bass per day. Exposure to low levels of NH₃ had no observable effect on the interactions. When exposed to toxicant concentrations higher than 0. 34 mg/l NH₃, substantial decreases in consumption and growth rates were found for bass in experiments with prey densities above 15.

Fish were acclimated for 2 weeks. Fish experimental protocol and handling was performed {{with regard to the}} ethical committee of veterinary medicine faculty and local Mansoura university rules. The fish were placed 20 fish /aquarium in duplicate aquaria per each group (40 fish/group). The experimental groups were: control negative group without zoospores exposure; infected group exposed to 2 × 104 zoospores of S. ferax per liter of water (spore/L) and KMnO 4 group is the infected group treated after one week with 2.5 ppm of KMnO 4; by adding 150 mL of the stock solution to each treated tank, FCA group is the infected group treated after one week with intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml of FCA and both groups lasted for 2 weeks after, and control positive group exposed to 2 × 104 spore/L for the 3 weeks experimental period. Fish in all groups were descaled on different regions on the body using sharp scalpel then, 2 × 104 spore/L were added to all groups except the control negative one. All aquaria were covered to minimize contamination. Water changed once a week during the treatment period with replacing the concentration of the KMnO 4 to be at the same exposure level for group 2. The aquaria were checked daily after the challenge for two weeks, and dead and moribund fish were removed for examination. Skin scrapings, gill and fin biopsies of removed fish were examined. S. ferax infection was confirmed via identification of broad aseptate hyphae, sporangia and encysted zoospores with light microscopy.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{treatment}} and flow rate on young Atlantic cod juveniles {{was investigated in}} a 36 -days experiment. Four different flow rates (10, 20, 40, and 70 times the effective tank volume per day) were set up in triplicate tanks within each of three rigs with recirculated, UV-radiated, and untreated water, respectively. Each of the 36 tanks was stocked with 200 weaned cod juveniles at a mean weight of 0. 048 g. Fish mortality was recorded daily in all tanks, and growth (wet weight) was determined {{at the end of}} the experiment. The microflora in the rearing water was investigated by means of PCR-DGGE and flow cytometry. Observed mortality was significantly higher at low flow rates while otherwise unexplained mortality (presumed to be due to cannibalism) was lowest in the recirculation system. No correlation was found between survival and growth. Growth was significantly affected by both water exchange rate and treatment, as the juveniles from high flow rates and the UV-treatment showed elevated growth rates. Both growth and survival scaled in accordance with metabolic factors like oxygen saturation and <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia.</b> Bacterial concentrations increased in all tanks and treatment from the beginning of the experiment to the end. The UV-treated and untreated water started at typical seawater concentrations (0. 5 − 1 × 10 'raised to the sixth power' mLˉ¹) and increased five to tenfold during the experiment. The recycled water tanks started with bacterial concentrations 2 – 5 times higher than the UV- and untreated experiments at the time of fish transfer, and ended up with 10 times higher concentrations in the end. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles separated the recirculation tanks, including the respective inlet water, from the flow-through systems, with one exception (the highest flow rate). Eighty-five% of the sequences clustered within the Gammaproteobacteria, further divided into four distinct clusters. One of the clusters was only detected in the recirculation system, and showed highest affiliation to bacteria belonging to the Alteromonas/Pseudoalteromonas genera. In contrast, bacteria belonging to the family Vibrionaceae were detected in the flow-through systems...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Presentation date: 1996 - 12 - 03 Decision {{support systems}} (DSS) {{have been used}} to a very limited extent in pond aquaculture. This study {{documents}} the development of a DSS (POND) which allows representation of an entire pond aquaculture facility, and provides analysis capabilities in the form of simulation models and an economics package. Simulation tools in POND include temperature, water budget, fertilization, and fish bioenergetics models. Verification of the water temperature model at sites in Thailand, Honduras and Rwanda indicated that it would accurately predict daily temperatures over entire seasons or diurnal temperatures over one day intervals if complete input weather datasets are available. Similarly, adequate estimates of water requirements can be obtained from the water budget model. Sensitivity analysis with the former model, and results obtained from the latter, indicate that input weather datasets should include air temperature, relative humidity, short-wave solar radiation, precipitation and wind speed measurements. The fertilization model estimates fertilizer application rates on the basis of nutrient concentrations, gross primary productivity and nutrient recycling processes. Model output was more conservative compared to rates used in Honduras, Thailand and the Philippines, suggesting that responsive fertilization strategies which account for ambient pond water conditions are more efficient than fixed input strategies. The bioenergetics model accounts for the effects of size, water temperature, photoperiod, dissolved oxygen and <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia</b> on fish growth. The model was calibrated and validated for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Model experiments generated useful information regarding supplemental feed initiation and fish feeding rates. A resource substitution function was also used in this model to analyze the consumption of endogenous and exogenous food resources by Nile tilapia. This function suggests that adding supplemental feed to tilapia ponds may increase phytoplankton biomass because feed is preferentially consumed. A genetic algorithm-based technique was developed to automatically calibrate the bioenergetics model. This technique generates best-fit parameters by comparing results of multiple model runs to observed data. In general, results obtained from all the models suggest that POND should be a useful tool for managers, planners and researchers involved with pond aquaculture...|$|E
30|$|This section {{discusses}} {{the importance and}} mechanisms of PN to elucidate the process. PN occurs via AOB according to Eq.  1, but activated sludge is a mixed culture containing both AOB and NOB. As such, researchers have carried out BNR via nitrite by adjusting the environmental and operational parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and substrate concentrations) to limit the growth of NOB and enrich AOB, which cause nitrite accumulation (Dosta et al. 2007; Blackburne et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2010). Savings of 25  % in aeration costs using low concentrations of dissolved oxygen only to enrich AOB and a reduction of 40  % of the external carbon source needed during denitrification by limiting NOB in PN have been reported (Ruiz et al. 2003). Free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid are inhibition parameters that play key roles in PN. The values of both substrates depend on the total ammonia concentration, pH, and temperature (Grunditz and Dalhammar 2001; Whang et al. 2009). Previous studies have shown the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of FA and HNO 2 on AOB and NOB in PN (Chen et al. 2010). Blackburne et al. (2008) investigated the role of high-concentration FA in inhibiting Nitrobacter and Nitrospira activities and found that Nitrospira species are much more sensitive to low concentrations of FA than Nitrobacter species. In addition, NOB {{were found to be}} inhibited at concentrations higher than 0.1 – 1  mg NH 3  L− 1 and/or 0.2 – 2.8  mg HNO 2  L− 1, whereas AOB were inhibited by <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia</b> concentrations higher than 10 – 150  mg NH 3  L− 1. These findings suggest that enrichment of nitrifying bacteria can enhances the nitrification rate. For example, Zheng et al. (2004) examined the high activity of AOB in a pure culture (6 – 8  g NH 4 −-N g− 1 VSS per day). Moreover, Chen, et al. (2010) investigated the enrichment of high nitrifier activity with the aim of enhancing the performance of the PN process and reported a specific ammonium oxidation rate (2.78  g NH 4 +-N g− 1 VSS per day) higher than previously reported values (0.6  g NH 4 +-N g− 1 VSS per day (Ciudad et al. 2007), 1.54  g NH 4 +-N g− 1 VSS per day (Kim et al. 2009), and 2.76  g NH 4 +-N g− 1 VSS per day (Jianlong and Ning 2004)).|$|E
40|$|This study embraces {{two aspects}} of closed system culture: (a) a {{comparative}} study of four different biological filtration treatments, and (b) a quantitative determination of the nitrogen flow in a particular biological filtration system. Twenty 0, 5 g juvenile Penaeus indicus Milne Edwards were cultured for approximately two months in four different kinds of sea water recirculatory systems with bacterial filtration, algal filtration, algar plus bacterial filtration and water exchange (25 % every 3 days). Growth was comparable to that {{found in the literature}} for P. indicus. Nitrification occurred in all systems irrespective of the type of biological filtration employed. Ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels were reduced by the algae, but nitrate accumulated to approximately 30 mg NO¯³ -Nℓ¯¹ in those systems without algae. Depletion of trace elements (Cu, Fe, Zn, Hn and Co) by the algae did not occur due to trace metal replenishment from the addition of food. No marked changes occurred in the concentrations of the major cations (Ca⁺⁺, Mg⁺⁺, Na⁺ and K⁺), but a small increase in Ca⁺⁺ levels was detectable in those systems with oyster shell chips in the filtration medium. Only minor changes occurred in oxygen or pH values in the various systems tested. Inorganic carbon levels showed major increases in the algal filtration systems, while a slight drop occurred in the bacterial filtration systems. The increase in the algal filtration systems was thought to be due to the formation of carbonates and bicarbonates by the reaction of respiratory CO₂ with <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia</b> and water. Suggestions are made as to how closed systems can be improved upon. By determining the rate of excretion of P. indicus as related to size and temperature, its faecal production, and the nitrogen content of P. indicus, its food and faeces, the nitrogen flow within a system could be calculated. P. indicus was found to have an assimilation efficiency of 88, 93 % and a food conversion ratio of 3, 49 : 1. Of the total dietary nitrogen input into the system, P. indicus ingested 69, 02 % - 19, 80 % of which was used for growth, 41, 58 % excreted and 7, 64 % lost as faeces. The remaining 30, 98 % of the total nitrogen input can be regarded as excess food nitrogen. The total nitrogen loading on the biological filtration system was found to be 80, 20 % of the total input of dietary nitrogen. The ability of various types of filamentous algae to remove these nitrogen compounds was determined.

40|$|AbstractA model partial-reuse {{system is}} {{described}} that provides {{an alternative to}} salmonid production in serial-reuse raceway systems and has potential application in other fish-culture situations. The partial-reuse system contained three 10 m 3 circular ‘Cornell-type’ dual-drain culture tanks. The side-wall discharge from the culture tanks was treated across a microscreen drum filter, then the water was pumped {{to the head of}} the system where dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2) stripping and pure oxygen (O 2) supplementation took place before the water returned to the culture tanks. Dilution with make-up water controlled accumulations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). An automatic pH control system that modulated the stripping column fan ‘on’ and ‘off’ was used to limit the fractions of CO 2 and <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia</b> nitrogen (NH 3 N). The partial-reuse system was evaluated during the culture of eight separate cohorts of advanced fingerlings, i. e., Arctic char, rainbow trout, and an all female brook trout × Arctic char hybrid. The fish performed well, even under intensive conditions, which were indicated by dissolved O 2 consumption across the culture tank that went as high as 13 mg/L and fish-culture densities that were often between 100 and 148 kg/m 3. Over all cohorts, feed conversion rates ranged from 1. 0 to 1. 3, specific growth rates (SGR) ranged from 1. 32 to 2. 45 % body weight per day, and thermal growth coefficients ranged from 0. 00132 to 0. 00218. The partial-reuse system maintained safe water quality in all cases except for the first cohort—when the stripping column fan failed. The ‘Cornell-type’ dual-drain tank was found to rapidly (within only 1 – 2 min) and gently concentrate and flush approximately 68 – 88 % (79 % overall average) of the TSS produced daily within only 12 – 18 % of the tank’s total water flow. Mean TSS concentrations discharged through the three culture tanks’ bottom-center drains (average of 17. 1 mg/L) was 8. 7 times greater than the TSS concentration discharged through the three culture tanks’ side-wall drains (average of 2. 2 mg/L). Overall, approximately 82 % of the TSS produced in the partial-reuse system was captured in an off-line settling tank, which is better TSS removal than others have estimated for serial-reuse systems (approximately 25 – 50 %). For the two cohorts of rainbow trout, the partial-reuse system sustained a production level of 35 – 45 kg per year of fish for every 1 L/min of make-up water, which is approximately six to seven times greater than the typical 6 kg per year of trout produced for every 1 L/min of water in Idaho serial-reuse raceway systems...|$|E
40|$|Submarine ocean outfalls are {{commonly}} used for the disposal of partially treated effluents in coastal cities. Typically, the greatest environmental risk caused by toxic substances occurs in the near field of the outfall discharge. The ecological impact of the effluent varies greatly under different discharge and environmental conditions that are characterized by both regular and stochastic variations. For a comprehensive environmental risk assessment of a coastal discharge, {{it is necessary to}} determine both the likelihood and severity of the adverse effects on the biological community. We present the first integrated stochastic (Monte Carlo) environmental risk assessment of a major coastal sewage outfall discharge - the Stonecutters Island outfall of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS) in Hong Kong. <b>Unionized</b> <b>ammonia</b> (NH 3) is used as the target pollutant. To accurately envisage the ambient concentrations of NH 3, a Lagrangian jet model (JETLAG/VISJET) is used to analyze pollutant concentrations in the nearfield of the outfall. The environmental conditions are simulated from 3 D hydrodynamic model simulations over a 4 month period for typical wet and dry seasons. Statistical characteristics of the effluent discharge and receiving water temperature are derived from field data. The probability distribution of predicted exposure concentrations (EC) is generated from this integrated simulation. A species sensitivity distribution, which represents a statistical distribution of threshold sublethal effects levels or benchmark concentrations (BC) for various marine organisms is constructed using available chronic toxicity data. The environmental risk of NH 3 on the marine community is characterized by computing statistical distributions of Hazard Quotient (HQ = EC/BC) using Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that the probability of HQ > 1 for HATS Stage 1 (1. 6 million m 3 /day sewage treated with chemically enhanced primary treatment) is around 0. 11 for wet season but just about 0. 06 for the dry season. The risk increases by about 10 % to 0. 08 - 0. 13 with additional sewage loads of 0. 8 million m 3 /day at the same level of treatment (HATS Stage 2 A). With an upgrade to secondary treatment (HATS Stage 2 B), the probability will be reduced to 0. 03 - 0. 05. Compared to the use of "worst case" scenarios or point pollution threshold estimates, the present method offers a more holistic ecological assessment, and is much less sensitive to arbitrary choice of model parameters. The present risk assessment approach can be readily extended to the accurate determination of mixing zones based on statistical evaluation of ecological risks. © 2009 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} hypoxic {{conditions}} and elevated ammonia concentrations on {{the viability of}} embryos and newly hatched larvae of the red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) were investigated. In all experiments, tested levels of hypoxia or ammonia concentrations were applied to embryos and unfed newly hatched larvae from three different spawns. Exposures began at 1 h post fertilization (pf) and lasted until all individuals in a group had expired. Survival rates were monitored daily in duplicates for each spawn in each treatment. Fertilized eggs exposed to 2 mg L− 1 dissolved oxygen (29 % saturation) showed complete mortality before hatch while 81 % of embryos in control groups (> 85 % saturation) hatched and subsequently maintained high survival until 5 days pf. Exposure to a moderate hypoxia (target 3 mg L− 1, 43 % saturation) reduced significantly the hatch rate and subsequent survival rates; {{the magnitude of the}} difference in survival rate between control and exposed groups increased from 10 % at hatch to 45 % at 5 days pf. When oxygen concentration was maintained high (83 % saturation) until 36 h pf and then progressively reduced to reach 3 mg L− 1 at 2 days pf, the survival of exposed embryos and larvae did not differ significantly from those recorded in control groups, although potential delayed or cumulative effects of the treatment after 4 days pf could not be evaluated in this experiment. Embryos exposed to 10 mg L− 1 total ammonia (TA-N), which corresponded to <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia</b> (UIA-N) concentrations ranging between 0. 307 and 0. 468 mg L− 1 in the conditions of the experiment, exhibited significantly reduced hatch rates and complete mortality between 3 and 4 days pf; the latter period corresponds to the onset of exogenous feeding of red snapper. In contrast, control groups (TA-N < 0. 26 mg L− 1, UIA-N < 0. 006 mg L− 1) maintained high survival rates beyond 5 days pf indicating potential to successfully initiate exogenous feeding. Exposure to 1 mg L− 1 TA-N (0. 020 mg L− 1 < UIA-N < 0. 054 mg L− 1) did not alter significantly survival with respect to control groups. Significant interactions between the spawn and the tolerance to hypoxia or elevated ammonia were detected in both experiments, indicating that variations among spawns need to be accounted for when determining safe levels for hatchery production. Statement of relevance Achieving a reliable supply of high quality eggs and larvae {{is one of the main}} challenges of the developing marine aquaculture industry. Most studies to date have focused on maternal determinants of egg quality but the viability of embryos and newly hatched larvae can be impacted after fertilization if environmental conditions become unfavorable due to intensive hatchery conditions; this topic is poorly documented in marine fishes to date. This study provides data on the effects of two major stressors acting under high density culture (hypoxia and elevated ammonia concentration) on embryos and newly hatched larvae of the red snapper; the results highlight the importance to consider variations among spawns/parents when determining safe levels for hatchery production and also the high sensitivity of red snapper to these stresses, suggesting that this topic should be investigated in other marine offshore species.

40|$|Biological {{surveys are}} {{routinely}} {{used throughout the}} United States to identify localized impairments in aquatic ecosystems. This approach however, has had limited acceptance for in situ assessment situations in determining specific sources or causes of observed impairments as required under Section 303 (d) of the Clean Water Act. While the best approach for determining the effect of urban impacts on streams is to directly compare biological data before and after urban impacts this approach is rarely used {{because of the lack}} of historical or pre-disturbance data. Traditionally, the source-cause investigation focused on using aquatic life chemical criteria as benchmarks, resulting in a "violation perspective" methodology that emphasizes specific water quality criteria being exceeded. Relying solely on this approach can be problematic since not all environmental stressors will have established criteria (e. g., sediment criteria are lacking) and those having criteria may not be sufficiently protective of portions of the aquatic resource (e. g., ammonia). This violation perspective assumes that intermittent chemical sampling and analysis will eventually discover the variables (contaminants) causing the impairment and emphasizes a select few water quality criteria exemplifying the “pollutant” focused approach as opposed to a broader and more comprehensive pollution focused approach. Furthermore, chemical water quality criteria are further removed from the designated use, which is more directly measured by the biota and minimizes type I and II assessment errors that would otherwise be more frequent. Evaluating aquatic systems using the violation perspective becomes increasingly more problematic due to increasing water samples collection costs, increased analysis costs for possible chemical stressors, and determining the identity among the thousands of possible stressors. Imperative to this discussion is that slightly elevated contaminant concentrations, synergistic effects, or sporadic spikes could adversely affect fish assemblage structure. As a result, these factors can potentially result in a biological impairment without the occurrence of specific chemical criteria violations. Nationally, the perception of causality for biologically impaired systems has shifted from point-source influences to more diffuse non-point source influences. Difficulty in tracking these pervasive non point-source impacts, combined with the lack of pre-determined signatory relationships with biological assemblage patterns creates a more complex problem. One way of increasing our knowledge of signatory relationships is through multivariate analysis utilizing the definable relationships between aquatic assemblage structure and quantifiable environmental stressors. The purpose of this research was multifaceted. We investigated the relationship between stressor response models associated with an urban landscape, multiple assemblage response, and fish assemblage nutrient response. Essentially the study area for this research encompassed data collected from across the State of Indiana. The nature of the analysis performed resulted in this volume of data being compartmentalized into discreet spatially driven subsets that were analyzed independently. To determine the responsiveness of fish assemblages to stressors associated with an urban landscape we targeted the Salt Creek Watershed. Salt Creek is a Lake Michigan tributary in Northwest Indiana, USA, which drains a watershed experiencing rapid urbanization as part of the expansion of the Greater Chicago metropolitan area. The watershed supports a managed coldwater fishery comprised principally of the introduced Skamania strain of the steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The sustainability of this watershed depends on the proper management of warm water tributaries and salmonid water in the Salt Creek mainstem. Twenty-three fish species were collected in the Salt Creek watershed and were numerically dominated by creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) both of which are tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions. Habitat quality, measured using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), showed that the watershed was generally degraded and scores ranged from 12 - 69. Fourteen parameters were significantly correlated with reach scale ecological health and biological integrity. Factor analysis found three factors explained 69 % of the contributed variance in the watershed fish assemblage. The first factor included habitat measures comprised of the QHEI score and three of its metrics (i. e., channel, riparian and instream cover scores) and explained 36 percent of data variability. The second factor was comprised of two contaminants (i. e., TDS and Chloride) and one local-scale land-use variable (Agriculture) that explained an additional 20 percent of the variability. The third factor was comprised of two local scale land-use variables (i. e., riparian zone and water) explaining 13 percent of the variability. To evaluate the responsiveness of multiple aquatic assembles to watershed stress we target the Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge. The Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge encompasses the northern 51, 000 acres of the former Jefferson Proving Ground (JPG) which was used from 1940 - 1995 as a munitions testing facility. Since 2000 the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has utilized the northern 51, 000 acres of JPG for ecosystem-based management in conjunction with continued use by the U. S. Department of Army and Indiana Air National Guard for air-to-ground training. An investigation of factors that explained the variance in fish, crayfish, and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and function was based on catchment and reach-scale land use, habitat, contaminants, and water quality. Habitat quality, measured using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), showed that scores ranged from 25 to 85 (average 61. 36 + 10. 08). The substrate score, instream cover, riffle-run score, and channel score were the primary factors contributing to declining QHEI scores. Factor analysis found four factors explained 69 percent of the contributed variance in the fish assemblage, two factors accounted for 56 percent of the total variance in macroinvertebrate assemblages, and two factors explained 49 percent of the cumulative variance in crayfish assemblages. Overall drivers of assemblage structure were associated with broad scale issues of wastewater treatment, ground water, and land-use. Our results show that fish, macroinvertebrate, and crayfish assemblages respond to similar broad scale stimulus; however, the specific physical/chemical constituent responsible for the stress may vary, and the realized magnitude of the overall stress on the system may be expressed by each organismal group differently. Our data suggest that varying organismal groups can respond independently and stress reflected in one assemblage may not necessarily be observed in another. Finally, we evaluated nutrient response in fish assemblages targeting a large data set collected from the Indiana portion of the Corn Belt Plain Ecoregion. Due to the complex interactions between the various forms of Nitrogen and Phosphorus within respective cycles, Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) cycling interactions can no longer be accepted as sole limiting factors in either marine or freshwaters. This study is conducted as part of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) desire to development regional nutrient thresholds. The first objective of this study is to develop a biotic model capable of determining the contributions of various nutrients, including Nitrogen components and TP, in streams using fish assemblages. The second objective is to establish an approach for designating defensible nutrient biotic index (NBI) score thresholds and corresponding nutrient concentrations, above which fish assemblages show alterations due to increasing nutrient concentrations. Sampling within Indiana’s portion of the Corn Belt and Northern Great Plain Nutrient Ecoregion occurred from 1996 - 2007 at 1274 sites. Nutrient data were reviewed for outliers and then sorted into three groups relative to drainage class. Each group was arranged into 15 ranges or “bins” using the Jenks optimization method in Arc GIS 9. 3. Next, sites were assigned to each bin relative to observed concentrations. These bin assignments were used to populate the species occurrence model for nutrient optima calculation. Nutrient optima were calculated by dividing the sum of the weighted proportion of times a species occurred in each bin by the un-weighted proportion of times a species occurred in each bin. The derived nutrient optima were divided into eleven equal ranges, by nutrient, and tolerance scores (0 - 10) assigned with respect to each species derived optima. Nutrient tolerance scores were used to calculate Nutrient Biotic Index (NBI) scores for each sampling site by summing the number of individuals of a given species at the site and multiplying times that species tolerance value then dividing by the total number of individuals at the site. A single break point was observed for <b>unionized</b> <b>ammonia,</b> which showed an NBIUnionized Ammonia score shift between 0. 003 and 0. 03 (mg/L). The mean NBIUnionized Ammonia scores were 3. 09 and 3. 29, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexUnionized Ammonia scores were significantly correlated with IBI score and IBI integrity class. Three break points were observed for Nitrogen, Nitrate+Nitrite, demonstrating a significant NBINitrate+Nitrite score shift at mean concentrations of 0. 13 mg/L, 1. 09 mg/L, 3. 15 mg/L and 6. 87 mg/L respectively. The mean NBINitrate+Nitrite scores were 5. 58, 5. 37, 5. 82 and 6. 25, respectively. The observed relationship produced a convex curve suggesting an enrichment signature. Nutrient Biotic IndexNitrate+Nitrite scores were significantly correlated with IBI score and IBI integrity class. Two break points were observed for Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), which were significant. The mean concentrations of TKN were 0. 4 mg/L, 0. 68 mg/L, and 1. 27 mg/L, respectively. The mean NBITKN scores were 2. 73, 3. 10, and 3. 37, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexTKN scores were significantly related to IBI score and IBI integrity class. Two break points observed for TN were significant at concentrations of 0. 56 mg/L and 3. 30 mg/L. The mean NBITN scores were 4. 60 and 4. 85, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexTN scores were not significantly related to IBI score or IBI integrity class. Two significant break points were observed for TP. The mean concentrations of TP were 0. 07 mg/L and 0. 32 mg/L, respectively and mean NBITP scores were 3. 43 and 3. 58, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexTP scores were significantly related to IBI score and IBI integrity class. Two break points were observed for Chlorophyll a (periphyton), which were significant. Mean concentrations were 10. 15 mg/m 2 and 134. 14 mg/m 2, respectively. Mean NBIPeriphyton scores were 3. 75 and 4. 20, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexPeriphyton scores were not significantly related to IBI score, but were significantly related to IBI integrity class. Four break points were observed for Chlorophyll a (phytoplankton), which occurred at Chlorophyll a (phytoplankton) concentrations of 2. 33 μg/L, 10. 98 μg/L and 49. 13 μg/L, respectively. The mean NBIPhytoplankton scores were 3. 43, 3. 85 and 5. 02, respectively. Nutrient Biotic IndexPhytoplankton scores were significantly related to IBI score and IBI integrity class. Nutrient criteria concentration was interpreted for NBI and IBI integrity class relationships to establish protective nutrient concentration benchmarks. Proposed mean protection values are 3. 0 μg/L for <b>Unionized</b> <b>Ammonia,</b> 130 μg/L for Nitrogen, Nitrate+Nitrite, 40 μg/L for TKN, 70 μg/L for TP, and 2. 33 μg/L for Chlorophyll a (phytoplankton). Criteria established at or below these benchmarks should protect for both biological integrity of fish assemblages in Indiana as well as nutrient loadings into the Gulf of Mexico. Charles C.
