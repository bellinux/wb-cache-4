2500|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation (BNF, {{performed by the}} organisms called diazotrophs) is a very old process that probably originated in the Archean eon when the primitive atmosphere lacked oxygen. [...] It is only carried out by Euryarchaeota and just 6 {{of the more than}} 50 phyla of bacteria. Some of these lineages co-evolved together with the flowering plants establishing the molecular basis of a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. BNF is carried out in nodules that are mainly located in the root cortex, although they are occasionally located in the stem as in Sesbania rostrata. The spermatophytes that co-evolved with actinorhizal diazotrophs (Frankia) or with rhizobia to establish their symbiotic relationship belong to 11 families contained within the Rosidae clade (as established by the gene molecular phylogeny of rbcL, a gene coding for part of the RuBisCO enzyme in the chloroplast). This grouping indicates that the predisposition for forming nodules probably only arose once in flowering plants and that it can be considered as an ancestral characteristic that has been conserved or lost in certain lineages. However, such a wide distribution of families and genera within this lineage indicates that nodulation had multiple origins. Of the 10 families within the Rosidae, 8 have nodules formed by actinomyces (Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Coriariaceae, Datiscaceae, Elaeagnaceae, Myricaceae, Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae), and the two remaining families, <b>Ulmaceae</b> and Fabaceae have nodules formed by rhizobia.|$|E

2500|$|Nodule {{formation}} is common throughout the leguminosae, {{it is found}} in the majority of its members that only form an association with rhizobia, which in turn form an exclusive symbiosis with the leguminosae (with the exception of Parasponia, the only genus of the 18 <b>Ulmaceae</b> genera that is capable of forming nodules). Nodule {{formation is}} present in all the leguminosae sub-families, although it is less common in the Caesalpinioideae. All types of nodule formation are present in the sub-family Papilionoideae: [...] indeterminate (with the meristem retained), determinate (without meristem) and the type included in Aeschynomene. The latter two are thought to be the most modern and specialised type of nodule as they are only present in some lines of the Papilionoideae sub-family. Even though nodule formation is common in the two monophyletic subfamilies Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae they also contain species that do not form nodules. The presence or absence of nodule-forming species within the three sub-families indicates that nodule formation has arisen several times during the evolution of the leguminosae and that this ability has been lost in some lineages. For example, within the genus Acacia, a member of the Mimosoideae, A. pentagona does not form nodules, while other species of the same genus readily form nodules, as is the case for Acacia senegal, which forms both rapidly and slow growing rhizobial nodules.|$|E

Dorsal, lateral and ventral vascular bundles are more developed in S. communis and fiber caps on the phloem in the lateral bundles {{have an important role}} on the mericarp separation. The endocarp derives from the adaxial meristem and its oblique and tangentially elongated cells become lignified. The wings originate from a more active meristem – at the ovarian edges – and by intense divisions of ovarian mesophyll in this region. Fruit of U. <b>ulmacea</b> can represent a transition state between the samaroid schizocarp formed by Serjania and the septifragal capsule produced by Cardiospermum. ...|$|R

40|$|Land-use {{change is}} {{a major threat to}} forest {{ecosystems}} worldwide. Therefore, understanding the effects of human forest modification on biodiversity is an important task for conservation ecologists. The main objective of my dissertation was to evaluate how different intensities of forest modification contribute to the maintenance of species diversity and ecosystem functionality in a human-modified landscape. For this purpose, I based my studies in a heterogeneous landscape around two nature reserves, Vernon Crookes and Oribi Gorge, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. I selected six most representative types of scarp forest modification – ranging from continuous forest and natural forest fragments in nature reserves to fragments within plantations and agricultural matrix, forested gardens, and secondary forest. In a total of 36 study sites, I assessed flower-visiting insects using insect traps and recorded local bird assemblages with point counts. Further, I observed flower visitation and seed removal on the native and widespread tree Celtis africana (<b>Ulmacea)</b> to analyse whether forest modification affects pollination and seed dispersal services. To assess how forest configuration affects the dispersal of animals, I carried out an in-depth study on the movement behaviour of bird assemblages within and among forest patches in the Vernon Crookes region. By means of direct observations and bird mist-netting, I followed up bird movements across nine forest fragments belonging to three different forest types. In all these three projects I give special attention to the responses of the different functional groups of a species community. The richness of flower-visiting insects, community composition and flower visitation on C. africana differed significantly among the different forest types and between two study seasons in 2009 and 2010. Both flower visitor richness and flower visitation rates were strongly enhanced in the human-modified forests. This could be explained by a high abundance of large-bodied pollinators in these sites. In particular, feral honey bees (Apis mellifera) {{played a major role in}} the pollination of C. africana trees located in forest fragments within plantations and agriculture, forested gardens and secondary forests. However, effective fruit set of C. africana was not enhanced by an increase of flower visitation, possibly due to the tree’s capability of wind pollination. This implies that even though forest modification can strongly alter insect assemblages, pollination services for trees with unspecialized flowers may remain resilient at a landscape scale. Bird species richness was not significantly different among forest types. However, I found a significant increase in bird abundance in modified forests. In particular, fragments within agriculture, forested gardens, and secondary forests attracted a large number of forest generalists, shrubland and open country species. The abundance of forest specialists however, was much lower in modified forests. Changes in the composition of bird functional groups were also confirmed by multivariate analysis, which clearly separated bird communities by forest type. I found the highest abundance of frugivores visiting C. africana in natural forest fragments, fragments within agriculture, forested gardens and secondary forests. That was also true for the estimated total fruit removal per C. africana tree, even though the differences among the forest types were not significant. In summary, I could show that overall bird abundance and seed removal services can be enhanced in modified forests. However, the results also underline the importance of protected natural forest for bird specialist species sensitive to human disturbance. I found a very high movement activity of the overall bird community among the nine forest fragments that was significantly structured by bird functional groups. Especially, frugivorous birds, forest specialists and large-bodied species showed the highest dispersal abilities across the landscape. These results might be facilitated by overall high fragment quality, providing food and shelter, as well as the close proximity among the forest fragments within the landscape. Yet, a fourth-corner analysis revealed that even though modified forests were rather attractive to frugivores, forest specialists as well as large-bodied species, there was still a high affinity of the latter functional groups to natural forest fragments, close canopy cover and large fragment size. Only a small proportion of the overall bird community was recorded to steadily persist in the forest fragments. In particular, patches in the agricultural landscape were frequently used by resident insectivores and forest generalists. Ultimately, these findings suggest that remnant forest fragments may represent valuable stepping-stones as well as permanent habitat for many forest birds and thus, will help to maintain regional bird assemblages in human-modified landscapes. Overall, my results strongly suggest that modified forests contribute to the maintenance of species diversity and ecosystem functionality in a human-modified landscape. With respect to a vast increase of human-modified forests worldwide, evidence of a high conservation potential of these habitats is encouraging news for conservation managers. In particular, modified forests that are located in close proximity to protected areas have high conservation priority as they may expand buffer zones around natural forests in human-modified landscapes. Generalizations, however, should be considered with caution. My findings strongly emphasize that human-modified forests do not completely compensate for the overall loss of natural habitat. High sensitivity of forest specialist species and overall changes in local community composition demonstrate that natural forests are essential to maintain species diversity at a larger scale. Additionally, high flexibility towards habitat changes of many species in the study region might be based on the patchy historic distribution of scarp forest that has strongly been determined by terrain and orographic conditions of the environment. Thus, it is possible that an evolutionary adaptation has lessened the vulnerability of the region’s fauna and flora to the present anthropogenic forest fragmentation. Ultimately, most of the forest types in the study region are characterized by high habitat quality, including for example resource availability, structural heterogeneity and close proximity to further forest patches, so that altogether, they contribute to the high species diversity. Consequently, the maintenance of structurally rich forest habitat is essential to maintain species diversity and ecological functionality in human-modified landscapes...|$|R
