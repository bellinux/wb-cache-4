40|$|Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} of sexual <b>reproductive</b> <b>systems</b> supported the evolutionary pathway from hermaphroditism to dioecy via gynodioecy in {{different groups of}} angiosperms. In this study, we explore the evolution of sexual <b>reproductive</b> <b>systems</b> in Daphne laureola L. (Thymelaeaceae), a species with variation in <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> among population. Sequences from the ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal cistron and two plastid markers (psbA-trnH and ndhF) were analyzed and used to map the population <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> along the molecular phylogeny. Our results support D. laureola as a monophyletic lineage with three different clades within the Iberian Peninsula. The hermaphroditic populations belong to two different clades, whereas gynodioecy is ubiquitous but characteristic of the third clade, which grouped together all the North-Western Iberian populations sampled, including the apparently oldest haplotype sampled. Gynodioecy appears as the most likely basal condition of the 13 analyzed populations, but different evolutionary transitions in <b>reproductive</b> sexual <b>system</b> were traced within each D. laureola clade. Both ecological conditions and (meta) population dynamics may help explain plant <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> evolution at the microevolutionary scale.

40|$|Vitamin E {{is known}} as {{important}} antioxidant to protect the <b>reproductive</b> <b>system.</b> The free radicals are continuously produced in last few years due to metabolic and nutritional deficiencies.

40|$|The main {{types of}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> structure, {{development}} and functions in cephalopods are described from personal observations {{and use of}} the literature. There is one type in males and three in females which are order specific. These have provided a basis for examining possible evolutionary trends in <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> development and in reproductive strategies within coleoid cephalopods and for developing a general scale for maturity staging for males and females. Development of the cephalopod <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> consists of two main phases. The first includes sexual cell differentiation, growth and maturation (i. e. juvenile phase and physiologi-cal maturation). The second begins after maturation of sexual cells. It includestheirtransportand accumulation {{in different parts of the}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> and their conversion into spermato-phores in males and eggs with protective coverings in females (i. e. physiological maturity, func-tional maturation and maturity).

A general scale of seven maturity stages for cephalopods was developed. Distinct characteristics of each stage are described and supple-mented with a generalized drawing of gonad structure. In the first phase of <b>reproductive</b> <b>system</b> development, maturity stages are distinguished by the degree of development of the gonad and accessory glands.
