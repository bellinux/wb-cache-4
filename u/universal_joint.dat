25|$|A {{dynamically}} tuned gyroscope (DTG) is a rotor {{suspended by}} a <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> with flexure pivots. The flexure spring stiffness {{is independent of}} spin rate. However, the dynamic inertia (from the gyroscopic reaction effect) from the gimbal provides negative spring stiffness proportional to {{the square of the}} spin speed (Howe and Savet, 1964; Lawrence, 1998). Therefore, at a particular speed, called the tuning speed, the two moments cancel each other, freeing the rotor from torque, a necessary condition for an ideal gyroscope.|$|E
25|$|The trams were {{equipped}} with two Hägglund-built H-bogies. They had an outer frame with the motor axles {{parallel with the}} wheel axles. Each axle had four rubber suspensions as its primary suspension. The carriage rested on the bogie on rubber plates. Later the bogies were supplemented with a shock absorber. The motors were connected to the wheel axles via a <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> and a gear. The wheels were rubber suspended, but were later replaced with steel-suspended axle boxes which required less maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Edwin Link had {{developed}} a passion for flying in his boyhood years, but {{was not able to}} afford the high cost of flying lessons. So, upon leaving school in 1927, he started developing a simulator, an exercise which took him 18 months. His first pilot trainer, which debuted in 1929, resembled an overgrown toy airplane from the outside, with short wooden wings and fuselage mounted on a <b>universal</b> <b>joint.</b> Organ bellows from the Link organ factory, the business his family owned and operated in Binghamton, New York, driven by an electric pump, made the trainer pitch and roll as the pilot worked the controls.|$|E
25|$|German Orientalist, mathematician, inventor, poet, and {{librarian}} Daniel Schwenter {{wrote in}} his 1636 book Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae about an instrument that a man from Pappenheim had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball {{as big as a}} fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF). This <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> mechanism was later called a scioptric ball.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 27 A major {{chemical}} company has implemented a cost reduction and performance enhancement via <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> on a melt pump application. The melt pump {{is used to}} push molten polyethylene through a die to produce pellets. The pump takes material at 30 psig and 200 C (390 F) and discharges at 3000 psig. Misalignment between the gearbox and melt pump gear centers is approximately one degree. The authors jointly studied the existing {{problems associated with the}} gear spindles (high angle gear coupling) : primarily reduced life, high maintenance, and high repair costs {{due in large part to}} high operating temperatures and the seal design of gear spindle at high misalignment, and proposed block style <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> to solve the problems. The <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> replaced the gear spindles supplied originally by the pump manufacturer. This paper demonstrates the block style <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> were able to: ?	Significantly reduce plant downtime. ?	Eliminate high repair costs associated with gear spindles, for the chemical company. ?	Reduce wear and tear on the melt pump compared to gear spindles. ?	Improve yield (or production) through superior performance and reliability. ?	Reduce noise levels. These block type <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> have been running for over five years now and have been inspected once after 24 months of operation with only general wear and tear from normal operation.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was a high-wing monoplane, with the pilot sitting below the wing.

2500|$|The {{designer}} of the Pirate was the experienced Harold Boultbee, who had recently produced the Civilian Coupé, and construction began early in 1935. The high wings were straight edged, but tapered, slightly swept {{on the leading edge}} and fully slotted. [...] The trailing edge carried differential ailerons and interacting flaps. A pair of V shaped lift struts ran from the two wing spars down to the lower fuselage side where there was a <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> to facilitate wing folding. [...] The folding mechanism was unusual: unlocked, the wings slid forward and tipped leading edge down, so that when the front spar was released from its fitting the wings could fold rearwards and downwards about the rear spar. [...] Because of the initial forward movement, the folded length was less {{than it would have been}} with conventional geometries.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing.
