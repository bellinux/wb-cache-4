500|$|Hill {{recorded}} her solo record The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{from late}} 1997 through June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica. The title {{was inspired by}} the book The Mis-Education of the Negro by Carter G. Woodson and The Education of Sonny Carson, a film and autobiographical novel. The album featured contributions from D'Angelo, Carlos Santana, Mary J. Blige and the then-unknown John Legend. Wyclef Jean initially did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered his production help; Hill turned him down. Several songs on the album concerned her frustration with the Fugees; [...] "I <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Love</b> Him" [...] dealt with the breakdown of the relationship between Hill and Wyclef Jean. Other songs such as [...] "To Zion" [...] spoke about her decision to have her first baby, even though many at the time encouraged her to have an abortion so to not interfere with her blossoming career. Indeed, Hill's pregnancy revived her from a period of writer's block.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E
500|$|... "Homecoming" [...] {{serves as}} a heartfelt tribute to West's {{hometown}} of Chicago, Illinois. Using an extended metaphor that personifies {{the city as a}} childhood sweetheart named 'Windy' (a reference to Chicago's nickname of the 'Windy City'), West rhymes about his love for Chicago and his guilt over leaving [...] "her" [...] to pursue his musical dream. The song's opening lines lyrically paraphrase [...] "I <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> <b>Love</b> H.E.R.", a similarly metaphoric hip-hop song made by West's close friend and labelmate Common, who later appeared in the single's music video. West dedicated [...] "Big Brother" [...] to Jay Z, whom he feels so close to that he sees him as a brother. Within the song, West dually details his love and admiration as well as his envy and antagonism towards Jay Z, metaphorically equating their relationship to that of a sibling rivalry. West also uses the song's chorus as a subsidiary dedication to his mentor No I.D., who first taught him how to produce music. Similar to its musicality, the songwriting characteristics of the album-closing track, [...] "Good Night" [...] alludes to West's next musical progression. The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother Donda West less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fiancée Alexis Phifer, the trace amounts of melancholy found scattered throughout Graduation would all but envelop West's next studio album, 808s & Heartbreak.|$|E

Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly felt the song's [...] "hyper-personal lyrics" [...] were [...] "immediate and affecting". Immediately following its release, Maeve McDermott from USA Today awarded the track [...] "Song of the Week" [...] in October, further adding that [...] "he song's spiritual sibling {{is another of}} Stefani's best works: 1996's No Doubt classic 'Don't Speak'," [...] but noting that [...] "this time around, coming from a more mature artist with fewer things to prove, the pain feels dizzyingly fresh." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator praised {{the fact that the}} singer was [...] "stepping away from the pumped-up vibes of previous tracks like 'Spark The Fire' & 'Baby Don’t Lie', also noting that [...] "eartache is immediately relatable (just ask Adele) and Gwen is often praised for her underrated slow songs , so it is refreshing to witness her jumpstart this current album era with a new vibe." [...] Alex Kritselis of Bustle called it [...] "a fantastic 'comeback single' — a tremendous improvement over 'Baby Don't Lie'," [...] praising that [...] "when she repeatedly sings, 'I don't know why I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you,' during the climax, you feel it." [...] Music Times Carolyn Menyes agreed, noting that [...] "we haven't heard a breakup anthem from this girl since her Tragic Kingdom days. After a series of less-than-stellar singles, it's safe to say Stefani is back." [...] In a later review of the parent album, Menyes stated she was [...] "impressed with the vulnerability [...] displayed", comparing it to Stefani's previous singles [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Ex-Girlfriend". Menyes concluded by saying the potential on This Is What the Truth Feels Like is evident on tracks like [...] "Used to Love You".|$|E
500|$|... "Used to Love You" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem; Rotem {{is also one of}} the song's producers. [...] The song is a {{vulnerable}} and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, having a [...] "driving piano melody", with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Spins James Grebey wrote that the song [...] "largely showcases her passionate, conflicted vocals over restrained, electropop-leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] is a break-up anthem, where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani's divorce from Gavin Rossdale, after a 13-year marriage. In an interview for Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, claiming: [...] "I’ve never put a record out where I’m actually going through things in real time. his is like, I wrote that song like a couple weeks ago." [...] According to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone that could be seen in the lines of the chorus, [...] "I don't know why I cry / But I think it's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you." [...] In other poignant lyrics, she sings, [...] "I guess nobody taught you, nobody taught you how to love." [...] Kreps further compared the lyrical content of [...] "Used to Love You" [...] to [...] "Dreaming the Same Dream", a song from No Doubt's sixth album Push and Shove. Alex Kritselis of Bustle claimed that the song [...] "recalls some of [...] best ballads, like 'Cool', 'Early Winter', and '4 in the Morning'." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{a rating of}} three-out-of-five-stars, Rob Sheffield wrote for Rolling Stone that the album [...] "has a rushed feel – a likable but low-personality version of her {{familiar}} bubble-pop solo mode". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found the album [...] "a bit of mess" [...] since [...] "there's {{a lot of ground}} for her to cover". He also noted that, [...] "By pursuing the twin inclinations to spill her heart while pushing musically forward, Stefani often mangles the mood." [...] However, Erlewine noted that despite the [...] "moments of emotional bloodletting or thirsty appeals {{to the top of the}} charts," [...] the album [...] "manages to be as fleet, giddy, and charming as Gwen Stefani ever is". Patrick Ryan of USA Today felt that [...] "espite the album title and Stefani's refreshingly candid press tour, it's sometimes hard to believe this is what her truth actually sounds like. But even if she's not being totally honest here, it's still more so than many of her pop peers." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media criticized the songs she perceived were tailor-made for Top 40 radio, calling them [...] "unremarkable" [...] saying they [...] "fail to match the unique specificity of her early solo hits". But she praised [...] "the ones in which she is audibly upset—sometimes pissed off, sometimes sad, but best-case scenario, both. [...] t's the fleeting moments like this—where she reminds us why we <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> her—that redeem 'This Is What the Truth Feels Like'." [...] In a mixed review, Theon Weber of Spin commented, [...] "n creating a schism between her punkish pep and her new-wave nostalgia, it leaves the former stranded and the latter generic." [...] Kate Hutchinson of The Guardian gave the album a rating of 2 out of 5 stars feeling the album to be [...] "calculated" [...] and a [...] "little more than careerist chart fodder".|$|E

It is a concept comparable <b>to</b> true <b>love,</b> a term which is more frequently <b>used</b> <b>to</b> describe <b>love</b> between lovers.
