5|$|Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha’s sister, soon {{arrives on}} Wisteria Lane {{to find out}} what {{happened}} to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alice’s house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, but Paul is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach that she knew him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely: Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alice’s suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive and one night a woman named Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), a heroin addict whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela knew they had to leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night as nothing. Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdre’s body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicia’s house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdre’s child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|Because the Israelites saw no shape when God {{spoke to}} {{them out of the}} fire at Horeb, Moses warned them not to make for {{themselves}} a sculptured image in any likeness whatever — the form of a man, woman, beast, bird, creeping thing, or fish. And when they looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> sun, moon, stars, and heaven, they were not to be lured into bowing down to them or serving them, for God allotted those things to other peoples, but God took the Israelites and brought them out of Egypt to be God's very own people.|$|E
25|$|During {{one of the}} National Air Tours, Schneider {{had taken}} off in his Cessna with the Warner Scarab engine, from Chicago bound for the balloon races in Cleveland. He saw the crowd scatter below, looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> 40-foot left wing of a twenty {{passenger}} Burnelli transport plane directly over him. Passengers in the Burnelli scrambled {{to the other side}} of the cabin to tilt the wing back up. Schneider sent his plane diving just as the Burnelli's wing scraped his plane's wing. A crash was averted by his dip. The officials said his quick action in dipping his plane close to the ground and then pulling clear of the grandstand had probably averted the most serious accident in the races.|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> last {{remnant of}} the sun's disk was just disappearing beneath the horizon. The victory was won! ...|$|R
60|$|Both looked <b>up</b> hurriedly <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{wild man}} {{standing}} on the highest of the rocks. He had his arms folded and was glaring at them sternly.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy looked <b>up</b> sharply, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{flush of}} color in her cheek, and that the blood had crept into his comrade's face. His own grew {{suddenly}} hot.|$|R
2500|$|... "we had two of {{the three}} horses loaded, having put three bushels on each horse...when I looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Soldiers {{approaching}} from the south. [...] I said to the Indian boys, 'Here comes the Toquashes (Shoshone for U.S. Soldiers) maybe, you will all be killed. [...] They answered 'maybe the Toquashes will be killed too,' but not waiting for the third horse to be loaded, they quickly jumped upon their horses and led the three horses away, disappearing in the distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 1999, Oates {{remained}} {{devoted to}} running, {{of which she}} has written, [...] "Ideally, the runner who's a writer is running through the land- and cityscapes of her fiction, like a ghost in a real setting." [...] While running, Oates mentally envisions scenes in her novels and works out structural problems in already-written drafts; she formulated the germ of her novel You Must Remember This (1987) while running, when she [...] "glanced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> ruins of a railroad bridge", which reminded her of [...] "a mythical upstate New York city in the right place".|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{roofs of}} Bourne shining {{white in the}} moonlight.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a changed}} voice that spoke. Betty looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> eyes that met hers were very soft. She {{moved quickly to}} the old woman's side.|$|R
60|$|Hal looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> engine, {{pulled by}} three fiery horses, was close at hand. He started {{to return to}} the curb. As he did so the elderly gentleman slipped and went down flat on his back.|$|R
60|$|He glanced <b>up,</b> unaware, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> bride <b>and</b> {{her father}} {{standing}} on the path above him. A queer, startled look went over his face. He hesitated for a moment. Then he gathered himself together for a leap, to overtake her.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> evil face of Hank Griswold {{peering down}} into the well.|$|E
60|$|Stuyvesant {{did not say}} a word, but {{pointed to}} the place. Phonny looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> squirrel.|$|E
60|$|He glanced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> second {{apprentice}} disappear {{with amazing}} swiftness {{from behind the}} goods in the window.|$|E
60|$|I lifted <b>the</b> paper <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> {{chest was}} divided into two compartments. Lying {{on the top of}} one was a small, square, inlaid box. This Mrs. DeLisle took <b>up</b> <b>and</b> carried to the window. Lifting up the cover she laid it in my lap.|$|R
6000|$|Jessie stood <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> through <b>the</b> window a {{depressed}} {{head and shoulders}} {{over the top of}} the back of a garden seat. She moved towards the door. [...] "While you have tea, mother," [...] she said, [...] "I must tell Mr. Hoopdriver of our arrangements." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{with a roar}} {{of horror}} the executioners fell on him and he died. When there was silence I looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> king, who had turned a dirty yellow hue with fright, for he was very superstitious, was {{trembling}} and wiping {{the sweat from his}} brow.|$|R
60|$|I looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Doctor passing us, {{enjoying his}} cigar. He bowed; eyed my pretty {{companion}} with a malicious smile; and passed on.|$|E
60|$|I looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> monk whom I {{had spoken}} {{with at the}} inn. He put down his sack and sat by my side.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> girl {{watching}} him. He {{dared not}} think that the expression he caught was one of sympathy, for it changed instantly.|$|E
60|$|The {{man looked}} <b>up</b> sharply, <b>and</b> she <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> little glow in his eyes, which, however, faded {{out of them}} again.|$|R
60|$|The {{appearance}} of Merrick {{had put a}} damper on the breaking up of the party, and the Rovers were rather silent as they went back to the school. It was too late to speak to Captain Putnam that night, but Dick was <b>up</b> early <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> master of the Hall before breakfast.|$|R
60|$|He peered <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>the</b> {{intervals}} of the rotation, dark and dim, {{the face and}} shoulders of a man regarding him. Then a dark hand was extended, the swift vane struck it, swung round and beat on with a little brownish patch {{on the edge of}} its thin blade, and something began to fall therefrom upon the floor, dripping silently.|$|R
60|$|Festing looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> danger; {{but if the}} log fell {{it would}} not stop until it and the tackle plunged into the rapid below.|$|E
60|$|Yet, somehow, {{he could}} never tell why, he looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> tavern in front of him, which he thought was miles, and miles, and miles away.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked slowly}} away, and passing {{the windows of}} Lucy, looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> white {{curtains}} closely drawn, the white-cottage profoundly still, and a white saddle-horse tied before the gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't until to-day," [...] said young Corey, with {{a little}} {{heightening}} of his colour. [...] "But I was walking down street this afternoon, and happened to look round at a new house some one was putting <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> whole family in the window. It appears that Mr. Lapham is building the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, {{sit down}} upon the slag, and answer loud and high The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die." [...] <b>And</b> Tomlinson looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> against <b>the</b> night The belly of a {{tortured}} star blood-red in Hell-Mouth light; And Tomlinson looked down <b>and</b> down, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> beneath his feet The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hell-Mouth heat.|$|R
60|$|As his companions, {{whom the}} {{sculptor}} {{supposed to be}} close by him, made no response to his fanciful musing, he looked <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> them at <b>the</b> head of the bier. He advanced thither himself.|$|R
60|$|It chanced {{that the}} soldier looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{questioning}} glance which the young clerk threw upon him. He raised his flagon and drank to him, with a merry flash {{of his white}} teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pat ’em yourself," [...] {{said the}} cook brusquely, {{as he looked}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> delight of {{the crew of the}} Endeavour, who were leaning over their vessel’s side {{regarding}} the proceedings with much interest.|$|E
6000|$|She {{told him}} to say his prayers, guiding the {{confession}} and thanksgiving that she feared he did not fully follow. As he rose <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> tears on her cheeks, he whispered, 'Mamma, did it make you so?' ...|$|E
60|$|Leonard advanced, {{striking}} a match as he came. Presently it burned <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> man Otter {{lying on his}} back, his legs and arms bound firmly with rimpis of hide, his face and body a mass of contusions. Drawing his hunting-knife Leonard cut the rimpis and brought the man from out the cave, carrying rather than leading him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, {{sit down}} upon the slag, and answer loud and high [...] The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die." [...] <b>And</b> Tomlinson looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> against <b>the</b> night [...] The belly of a {{tortured}} star blood-red in Hell-Mouth light; [...] And Tomlinson looked down <b>and</b> down, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> beneath his feet [...] The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hell-Mouth heat.|$|R
50|$|Those {{changes were}} quickly {{followed}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> 1987 <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{publication of a}} new Flash comic, initially written by Mike Baron. These stories focused {{not only on the}} Flash's superhero exploits, but the state of Wally's wealth. West won a lottery, bought a large mansion, and began dating beautiful women. The character's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until Flash vol. 2, #62, when his fortunes stabilized.|$|R
