5|$|Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the <b>Underclass</b> is a {{collection}} of essays written by British writer, doctor, and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple and published in book form by Ivan R. Dee in 2001. In 1994, the Manhattan Institute started publishing the contents of these essays in the City Journal magazine. They are about personal , the mentality of society as a whole, and the troubles of the <b>underclass.</b> Dalrymple had problems in finding a British publisher to help him turn his individual essays into {{a collection}}, so he eventually turned to American companies for publication.|$|E

40|$|This {{book was}} passed as a PhD thesis at Bayreuth University, Germany. The author {{challenges}} African Biblical scholars and Christian leaders to premise Biblical interpretation on {{the experiences of}} the often neglected <b>underclasses.</b> The author argues that from a comparative historical, cultural and material methodological point of view, {{the experiences of the}} Zimbabwean <b>underclasses</b> whose collective ordeal is represented by the experiences of domestic workers are strikingly similar to those suffered by slaves among other <b>underclasses</b> in the biblical world. In the same way religion was appropriated by the elite to validate oppression of the <b>underclasses</b> in the biblical world, the author shows that since the colonial era, Christianity in Africa, through biblical interpretation among many other tactics has been an influential force {{on the side of the}} dominant class to advance their racial, class and gender interests. To date, in Zimbabwe for example, the Bible (and religion in general) is manipulated by the dominant minority to justify and entrench the exploitation of the majority <b>underclasses.</b> On the other hand, the author observes that the history of ancient Israel, Roman colonial Palestine and colonial Zimbabwe evidences that when religion is appropriated (and/or the Bible is read and interpreted) from the historical cultural and material conditions of the <b>underclasses,</b> it can be a valuable resource not only for their mobilization to overthrow oppressive systems but also for justifying their resistance tactics.

5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the <b>underclass</b> and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and wealth that the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal <b>underclass.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical anarchist interpretation, others have {{analysed}} the character as a Marxist (opposite to Batman's capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom. The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking, while eliminating any that oppose him. In The Killing Joke, the Joker is an abused member of the <b>underclass</b> who is driven insane by failings of the social system. The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in Batman #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham's wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison. Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able to triumph through his own innovations.|$|E
5|$|By 1935, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} {{several hundred}} men—the figures range from 200 to 800—organized in cells of five men, and arranged military training for peasants. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which {{they used to}} raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British-constructed rail lines. Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban <b>underclass,</b> al-Qassam's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force, Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.|$|E

2500|$|In Cuba the afrocubanismo zarzuelas of Ernesto Lecuona (María la O; El cafetal), Eliseo Grenet (La virgen morena) and Gonzalo Roig (Cecilia Valdés, {{based on}} Cirilo Villaverde's classic novel) {{represent}} a brief {{golden age of}} political and cultural importance.

5000|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, an {{increasing}} emphasis on giving {{a voice to}} the voiceless and writing {{the history of the}} <b>underclasses,</b> whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of social history or the more postmodern assessments of cultural history, also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, [...] "disdained politicalhistory as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Cuban society was highly stratified, {{consisting}} of a Spanish creole ruling class of tobacco, sugar, and coffee plantation owners, a middle class of black and Spanish plantation workers, and an <b>underclass</b> of black slaves. The upper echelons of society were also deeply divided between the creoles and Spaniards (known as peninsulares), with the Spaniards benefiting greatly from the colonial regime. Cuba was a colony of Spain, although there were movements for independence, integration into the U.S., and integration with Spain. The roots of anarchism were first seen in 1857, when a Proudhonian mutualist society was founded. After being introduced to the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon by José de Jesus Márquez, Saturnino Martínez (an Asturian immigrant to Cuba) founded the periodical La Aurora in 1865. Directed at tobacco workers, it included the earliest advocation of cooperative societies in Cuba. By the Ten Years' War, the insurgents against Spain included expatriates from the Paris Commune, and others influenced by Proudhon, including Salvador Cisneros Betancourt and Vicente García.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{years later}} in 1963, Srintil (Prisia Nasution) and Rasus (Nyoman Oka Antara) are fast friends. Rasus also has romantic {{feelings}} for her. With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng, Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng, capable of saving the hamlet from starvation. He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng. She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja (Slamet Rahardjo), the hamlet's ronggeng caretaker and his wife (Dewi Irawan) by dancing at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, the hamlet's founder. Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk. Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party, saying that the Communist party {{are the only ones}} who can help save the wong cilik (<b>underclass)</b> of Dukuh Paruk and their starved hamlet.|$|E

50|$|In the past, the Boston University Office of Housing {{was criticized}} for reserving a certain {{percentage}} of each dormitory for <b>underclasses.</b> This caused complaints from upperclassmen who were relegated to living in substandard housing due to spots in prime housing being taken by freshmen and sophomores, squeezing the upperclassmen out of the already crowded, at the time, housing system.
