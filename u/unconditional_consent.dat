A Yagan Steering Committee was established to co-ordinate the repatriation, and Colbung's application was allowed to proceed. [...] In January 1995 the Home Office advised Colbung that it was unable to waive the requirement to obtain next of kin consent for the exhumation. It contacted the five relatives whose addresses were known, and received <b>unconditional</b> <b>consent</b> from only one. Accordingly, on 30 June 1995, Colbung and the other interested parties were advised that the application for exhumation had been rejected.|$|E

5000|$|An [...] "irregular" [...] {{marriage}} {{was one that}} took place either away from the home parish of the spouses (but after banns or licence), or at an improper time. [...] "Clandestine" [...] marriages were those that had an element of secrecy to them: perhaps they took place away from a home parish, and without either banns or marriage licence. It is often asserted, mistakenly, that under English law, a marriage could be recognized as valid if each spouse had simply expressed (to each other) an <b>unconditional</b> <b>consent</b> to their marriage. These [...] "common-law marriages" [...] as they might be termed today were the exception. Nearly all marriages in England, including the [...] "irregular" [...] and [...] "clandestine" [...] ones, were performed by ordained clergy.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "victim theory" [...] {{has been}} fully rejected, at lest {{at the level}} of the supreme organs of government. Nobody has doubted the will of Vranitzky and Klestil, but sceptics doubted if the Austrian nation was ready to share their position. Conservative {{politicians}} have not urged to join the new ideology, the influence of FPÖ has swiftly increased. The unification of the lefts and rights happened only in 2000 during another crisis in foreign politics caused by the FPÖ's electoral victory to the Parliament. This time Austria got under the pressure not much of the USA and Jewish organisations but the EU. Unexpectedly for the Austrians the integrated to the EU country appeared to be more vulnerable than in 1980s. Politicians had to make concessions again: under the insistence of Klestil the leaders of the parliamentary parties signed another declaration on the Austrian responsibility and approved a new roadmap of satisfying the claims of real Nazis' victims. The work of the Austrian Historical Commission (Österreichische Historikerkommission) resulted in admission of the economical [...] "aryaisation" [...] of 1938-1941 as a part of the Holocaust (that was equal to <b>unconditional</b> <b>consent</b> for the restitution); Under the Washington Agreement signed with Austrian government and industry Austria admitted Jew's debt ($480 mln) and Ostarbeiter's debt ($420 mln). For the first time in history this programme of the restitution was fulfilled in within the shortest possible time.|$|E
