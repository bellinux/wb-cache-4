5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
