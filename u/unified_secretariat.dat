Politically it is Trotskyist and is the Italian affiliate of the <b>Unified</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of the Fourth International (USFI). Bandiera Rossa is a left wing current.

5000|$|Bensaïd and {{the current}} of Trotskyism {{represented}} by the <b>Unified</b> <b>Secretariat</b> of the Fourth International have come under attack from more orthodox Trotskyists for the strategy they have advanced of entering the [...] "new social movements"; in particular, for seeing reform and revolution as a false dichotomy, and proposing the formation of [...] "broad parties," [...] rather than forming parties of the traditional Leninist type. In one such critique, Luke Cooper criticised Bensaïd for arguing that—in certain specific circumstances—it maybe permissible to enter a capitalist government, and seek to use the existing state {{as an instrument of}} revolutionary transformation. Bensaïd also debated revolutionary strategy with other Fourth International members, and the British Socialist Workers Party's International Secretary Alex Callinicos.|$|E
