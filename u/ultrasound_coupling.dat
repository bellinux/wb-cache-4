40|$|ABSTRACT Nosocomial infections {{develop in}} {{hospitals}} leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound equip-ment comes into {{direct contact with}} patients and practitioners during scanning procedures, enabling {{it to be a}} potential vehicle for the spread of nosocomial infections. The aim of the present study is to assess the microbiological contamination of the ultrasound probes and to formulate effective decontamination guidelines for the ultrasound probes. The swabs were taken from unclean probe of two ultrasound machines over a period of two months at the Department of Radiology and were processed in the Microbiology department. The above procedure was repeated after single and double paper wipe cleaning of the probe. The isolates were identified using standard techniques and antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out as per CLSI guidelines. The potential for the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupling</b> gel to serve as a culture medium for bacterial growth was also investigated. Out of 50 swabs, 36 (72 %) were culture positive and 14 (28 %) were bacteriologically sterile. A total of 37 bacterial isolates were recovered from the 36 culture positive patients. Klebsiella species(93. 75 %) constitutes the predominant isolate followed by Acinetobacter species (6. 25 %). The average CFU transmitted by the unclean probes was 74. 56, for the probes cleaned by single paper wipe was 6. 71 and for the probes cleaned by double paper wipe was 0. 76. There is a statistical significant difference (P < 0. 001) between unclean probes and after single and double paper wipe cleaning procedure. The potential for the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupling</b> gel to serve as a culture medium for bacterial growth was evaluated and found that the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupling</b> gel can support bacterial growth. The results of our study indicate that our minimal standard of probe decontamination consists of wiping the probe with soft paper after each procedure unti...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A broad {{overview}} of laser-ultrasonics, {{which is a}} technique for non-contact generation and detection of ultrasound is presented. The principles of generation and detection are outlined, stressing a few key characteristics of laser-ultrasonics: the material is actually the emitting transducer and transduction is made by light, thus allowing generation and detection at a distance. These features carry both advantages and limitations that are explained. Another feature, which has been an impediment, is actually {{the complexity of the}} “laser-ultrasonic transducer”, but in spite of this complexity, it can be made very reliable for use in severe industrial environments. It also can be very cost effective for a number of applications. Applications that have been transitioned to the industry are presented as well as many other potential industrial applications. Introduction: A main constrain of piezoelectric-based ultrasonics is the need of contact or fluid medium for <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupling</b> to the tested part. Others are the limited bandwidth of piezoelectric transducers and the sensitivity to the phase of the ultrasonic wavefront across the transducer element, which makes the inspection of parts with acute curvature difficult. As recognized by researchers for many years, these limitations could be eliminated by using lasers and light for generating and detecting ultrasound, so calle...|$|E

The supercritical and subcritical CO 2 fluids are both new technologies having good industrial {{applications such as}} cleaning with the advantages of no residue, recyclability and so on.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the potential use of colonoscopy and endoluminal ultrasonic biomicroscopy (eUBM) {{to track the}} progression of mouse colonic lesions. METHODS: Ten mice were treated with a single azoxymethane intraperitoneal injection (week 1) followed by seven days of a dextran sulfate sodium treatment in their drinking water (week 2) to induce inflammation-associated colon tumors. eUBM was performed simultaneously with colonoscopy at weeks 13, 17 - 20 and 21. A 3. 6 -F diameter 40 MHz mini-probe catheter was used for eUBM imaging. The ultrasound mini-probe catheter was inserted into the accessory channel of a pediatric flexible bronchofiberscope, allowing simultaneous acquisition of colonoscopic and eUBM images. During image acquisition, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and kept in a supine position over a stainless steel heated surgical waterbed at 37 &#x 2005; 0;C. Both eUBM and colonoscopic images were captured and stored when a lesion was detected by colonoscopy or when the eUBM image revealed a modified colon wall anatomy. During the procedure, the colon was irrigated with water that was injected through a flush port on the mini-probe catheter and that acted as the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupling</b> medium between the transducer and the colon wall. Once the acquisition of the last eUBM/colonoscopy section for each animal was completed, the colons were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Colon images acquired at the first time-point for each mouse were compared with subsequent eUBM/colonoscopic images of the same sites obtained in the following acquisitions to evaluate lesion progression. RESULTS: All 10 mice had eUBM and colonoscopic images acquired at week 13 (the first time-point). Two animals died immediately after the first imaging acquisition and, consequently, only 8 mice were subjected to the second eUBM/colonoscopy imaging acquisition (at the second time-point). Due to the advanced stage of colonic tumorigenesis, 5 animals died after the second time-point image acquisition, and thus, only three were subjected to the third eUBM/colonoscopy imaging acquisition (the third time-point). eUBM was able to detect the four layers in healthy segments of colon: the mucosa (the first hyperechoic layer {{moving away from the}} mini-probe axis), followed by the muscularis mucosae (hypoechoic), the submucosa (the second hyperechoic layer) and the muscularis externa (the second hypoechoic layer). Hypoechoic regions between the mucosa and the muscularis externa layers represented lymphoid infiltrates, as confirmed by the corresponding histological images. Pedunculated tumors were represented by hyperechoic masses in the mucosa layer. Among the lesions that decreased in size between the first and third time-points, one of the lesions changed from a mucosal hyperplasia with ulceration at the top to a mucosal hyperplasia with lymphoid infiltrate and, finally, to small signs of mucosal hyperplasia and lymphoid infiltrate. In this case, while lesion regression and modification were observable in the eUBM images, colonoscopy was only able to detect the lesion at the first and second time-points, without the capacity to demonstrate the presence of lymphoid infiltrate. Regarding the lesions that increased in size, one of them started as a small elevation in the mucosa layer and progressed to a pedunculated tumor. In this case, while eUBM imaging revealed the lesion at the first time-point, colonoscopy was only able to detect it at the second time-point. All colonic lesions (tumors, lymphoid infiltrate and mucosal thickening) were identified by eUBM, while colonoscopy identified just 76 % of them. Colonoscopy identified all of the colonic tumors but failed to diagnose lymphoid infiltrates and increased mucosal thickness and failed to differentiate lymphoid infiltrates from small adenomas. During the observation period, most of the lesions (approximately 67 %) increased in size, approximately 14 % remained unchanged, and 19 % regressed. CONCLUSION: Combining eUBM with colonoscopy improves the diagnosis and the follow-up of mouse colonic lesions, adding transmural assessment of the bowel wall...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{the most}} common route for vaccine {{delivery}} is by intramuscular injection with a needle and syringe. Injection has number of disadvantages, such as risk of infection at the i njection site, needle prick injuries, and needle phobia that leads to significant levels of patient non-compliance. Therefore, {{the focus of this}} thesis is the development of an alternative ultrasound-assisted transdermal vaccine delivery system. To do so, we target immunological Langerhans cells in the epidermal layer of the skin that efficiently provoke an immune response. The stratum corneum (SC) is a barrier that prevents conventional transdermal vaccine delivery. Methods such as microneedles, iontophoresis and thermal ablation are presented in literature for the permabilisation of this layer. Sonophoresis is the use of ultrasound to transport molecules through a medium. Previous studies have demonstrated that the key underpinning mechanism is inertial cavitation, which leads to permeabilisation of the SC and facilitates transdermal delivery. Most studies to date have pre-exposed the skin to ultrasound prior to delivery of a vaccine in liquid form as a droplet placed on the skin. This approach is not practical for widespread use, but more importantly fails {{to take advantage of the}} potential of cavitation-mediated micro streaming to enhance active transport of molecules beyond the permeabilised skin. The focus of the present work is the development of a complete system that enables storage of the vaccine in a readily useable gel form whilst promoting and monitoring cavitation activity to simultaneously permeabilise the skin and enhance transdermal vaccine transport. Through initial in vitro studies, we first demonstrated that inertial cavitation can be exploited to promote the active transport of molecular entities such as vaccine molecules from a gel into a biological medium. A gel vaccine dosage formulation is utilised in order to mimic current clinically approved and established clinical <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupling</b> gel formulations. By comparing the effects mediated at two ultrasound frequencies (0. 256 MHz vs 1 MHz) which preferentially promote cavitational microstreaming or acoustic streaming, ultrasound parameters most conducive to producing high levels of inertial cavitation were identified as 0. 256 MHz and peak rarefactional pressures on the order of 1 MPa. Three vaccine loaded gels were then formulated with either micro- or nano-sized cavitation nuclei and assessed for the optimal acoustic and chemical characteristics at the predetermined ultrasound parameters. Nano-sized nuclei were shown to be most effective at lowering the inertial cavitation threshold, as well as instigating the highest and most sustained levels of inertial cavitation as indicated by broadband acoustic emissions at the ultrasound focus, without causing any structural damage to the vaccine molecules themselves. Ex vivo data has shown that nanoscale-nucleated inertial cavitation at the skin surface delivered a model vaccine Ovalbumin (OVA) to depths of 500 μm into porcine skin. Novel nanoparticles produced in-house used to enhance and instigate cavitation at lower pressures penetrated to depths of up to 700 μm, due to their small size and unique ability to self-propel. Delivery profiles were obtained using multi-photon microscopy of skin sections immediately after treatment. Analysis of acoustic emissions from the focus showed substantial correlation between high delivery dose and depth, and significant amounts of inertial cavitation (i. e. broadband acoustic emissions from the focus). In vivo studies showed that the delivery achieved to murine skin was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in the nanoparticle-assisted ultrasound transdermal vaccination group than the chemical penetration enhancer (positive control) group, with delivery of doses up to 1 μg /treatment, compared to 400 ng in the positive control group. This dose was sufficient to trigger an antigen-specific immune response. Specific anti-OVA IgG antibody levels in the ultrasound-assisted vaccine delivery group were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than in all other control groups, and substantially higher than the current gold standard in transdermal delivery â chemical penetration enhancers. Although a low level antibody response was observed transdermally compared to the subcutaneous injection group (indicative of 100 % delivery response), it is believed that optimisation of this system will lead to a viable and non-invasive delivery platform for vaccines that can be used both in a primary care setting, and eventually for self-vaccination at home. </p...|$|E

Methods: Spontaneous indices of baroreflex regulation are obtained from normal volunteers non-invasively in the time (Baroreflex Slope) and frequency domains (index and SAP-RR transfer Gain) as well as using an exogenous autoregressive causal model (A. XAR); carotid mechanical properties are approximated using advanced <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupled</b> with arterial pressure measures. Multivariate analysis and linear modeling provide an estimate of the link between mechanical measures and spontaneous baroreflex indices. Results: subjects are divided in five age groups (from 20 to 60 yrs, mean 44 ± 13). Spontaneous baroreflex indices are reduced with advancing age (BRS from 31. 2 to 16. 3; index from 27. 4 to 13. 6; RR-SAP Gain at HF from 31 ± 3. 0 to 14 ± 3. 0 msec/mmHg all P<< 0. 001); carotid intima media thickness (IMT: from 0. 53 to 0. 69 mm; p<< 0. 001) and local Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV: from 4. 0 to 6. 9 m/sec) increase with age (both p<< 0. 001). A significant correlation is present between spontaneous indices of baroreflex sensitivity and carotid mechanical properties, particularly PWV (r = - 0. 328, p<< 0. 001). After correcting for age and gender, a significant correlation remains between RR-SAP gain and PWV and between A. XAR and IMT. Factor analysis and automatic linear modeling corroborates the notion that mechanical carotid properties are strong predictors of the age-related reduction of spontaneous baroreflex. Conclusions: a significant correlation between spontaneous baroreflex indices and local carotid mechanical properties supports the idea that they should also be factored in the physiology of baroreflex regulation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{describe}} and evaluate the traditional methods for effective ink removal during the recycling of printed papers. Additionally, novel techniques {{for dealing with the}} newer “difficult to deink” inks such as toners from photocopiers, UV-cured ink films and liquid toner suspensions or Electroinks® are to be evaluated. Design/methodology/approach – High intensity ultrasound was applied to pulps derived from papers printed with these newer inks in order to evaluate its effectiveness in detaching the inks from paper and establishing the resultant ink particle size distributions. Findings – When exposed to ultrasound at a frequency of 20 ?kHz, it was found that “difficult to deink” pulps did exhibit significant ink detachment. In the case of toners, temperature did have an effect on particle breakdown with larger numbers of particles produced at temperatures well below the softening point which was attributed to a greater brittleness of the toner at lower temperatures. Electroinks® can be effectively de-inked by exposure to <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupled</b> with washing under neutral conditions. With all the inks investigated, exposure to ultrasound resulted in the detached ink having particle size distributions that can be removed by conventional flotation and washing techniques.

A future development would be to use a continuous flow system incorporating an annular ultrasound horn. Practical implications – Introducing ultrasound exposure into a conventional deinking plant, all post-consumer printed waste paper could be deinked without the use of deinking chemicals.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the 3 D muscle fascicle architecture in human triceps surae muscle at different contraction levels and muscle lengths. Six male subjects were tested for three contraction levels (0 %, 30 % and 60 % of MVC) and four ankle angles (- 15 °, 0 °, 15 ° and 30 ° of plantar flexion), and the muscles were imaged with B-mode <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupled</b> to 3 D position sensors. 3 D fascicle orientations were represented in terms of pennation angle relative to the major axis of the muscle and azimuthal angle (a new architectural parameter introduced in this study representing the radial angle around the major axis). 3 D orientations of the fascicles, and the sheets along which they lie were regionalized in all the three muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius and the soleus) and changed significantly with contraction level and ankle angle. Changes in the azimuthal angle were of similar magnitude to the changes in pennation angle. The 3 D information was used for an error analysis to determine the errors in predictions of pennation that would occur in purely 2 D studies. A comparison was made for assessing pennation in the same plane for different contraction levels, or for adjusting the scanning plane orientation for different contractions: there was no significant difference between the two simulated scanning conditions for the gastrocnemii; however, a significant difference of 4. 5 ° was obtained for the soleus. Correct probe orientation is thus more critical during estimations of pennation for the soleus than the gastrocnemii due to its more complex fascicle arrangement. 25 2...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupled</b> with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for automated or semi-automated classification of myositis. Eighty subjects comprised of 19 with inclusion body myositis (IBM), 14 with polymyositis (PM), 14 with dermatomyositis (DM), and 33 normal (N) subjects were included in this study, where 3214 muscle ultrasound images of 7 muscles (observed bilaterally) were acquired. We considered three problems of classification including (A) normal vs. affected (DM, PM, IBM); (B) normal vs. IBM patients; and (C) IBM vs. other types of myositis (DM or PM). We studied {{the use of an}} automated DL method using deep convolutional neural networks (DL-DCNNs) for diagnostic classification and compared it with a semi-automated conventional ML method based on random forests (ML-RF) and "engineered" features. We used the known clinical diagnosis as the gold standard for evaluating performance of muscle classification. The performance of the DL-DCNN method resulted in accuracies ± standard deviation of 76. 2 % ± 3. 1 % for problem (A), 86. 6 % ± 2. 4 % for (B) and 74. 8 % ± 3. 9 % for (C), while the ML-RF method led to accuracies of 72. 3 % ± 3. 3 % for problem (A), 84. 3 % ± 2. 3 % for (B) and 68. 9 % ± 2. 5 % for (C). This study demonstrates the application of machine learning methods for automatically or semi-automatically classifying inflammatory muscle disease using muscle ultrasound. Compared to the conventional random forest machine learning method used here, which has the drawback of requiring manual delineation of muscle/fat boundaries, DCNN-based classification by and large improved the accuracies in all classification problems while providing a fully automated approach to classification...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{described}} in this doctorate thesis has been to study {{the potential of the}} non-contact and non-destructive test (NDT) method, thermography, to detect glue deficiency beneath a thin laminated layer of wood. The technological applications can for example be found in the parquet flooring industry. The thesis is presented as a monography mainly based on five appended papers. The aim of the theoretical part, based on a literature survey, was to understand how thermal phenomena coupled to thermography theoretically can be described, how different factors and thermography methods affect the results of a thermography measurement and to know the status of delamination detection with thermography. The principal aim of the experimental measurements was to determine penetration depth, resolution, inspection time and repeatability for pulse, heating-up, and lock-in thermography. Using image thresholding as defect classification method, a method comparison has also been performed. Furthermore, the performances of another NDT method, air <b>coupled</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> was briefly investigated. Finally, the contrast detected by the two NDT methods has been validated with the crack test as a destructive reference test method. The results have showed/confirmed {{that it is possible to}} detect glue deficiency in laminated wood products with pulse, heating-up and lock-in thermography. Whenever time is not limiting, lock-in thermography should be used for each defect depth and is capable of detecting defects which are 4 times wider than the defect depth with at least a 2. 0 mm thick surface layer. Provided the signal to noise ratio (SNR) can be increased, pulse thermography is suitable for defect depths of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm in an on-line application where inspection time is a critical parameter and lies around a few seconds. If the SNR cannot be sufficiently increased for pulse thermography, heating-up thermography is an alternative and should be used for defect depths between 0. 5 - 1. 4 mm. For air <b>coupled</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in transmission mode, the contrast and resolution did not decrease with defect depth down to 2 mm, which qualitatively makes it a competetive alternative to thermography. However, its inspection time is proportional to the scanned surface and might be very long if a good resolution is needed. The glue deficiency pattern of the fracture surfaces corresponded very well to the contrast pattern detected by thermography and air <b>coupled</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> Thereby, contrast detected by thermography and air <b>coupled</b> <b>ultrasound</b> can be regarded as being able to indicate reduction of the mechanical resistance of the glue line.

40|$|The {{effects of}} thermosonication (high {{intensity}} <b>ultrasound</b> <b>coupled</b> with thermal treatment), on {{the reduction of}} thermophilic spore-forming microorganisms {{and its effects on}} the solubility index in reconstituted skim milk powder (RSMP) were evaluated. Thermosonication was applied to RSMP at various solids concentrations, temperatures, and lengths of time based on commercial milk powder processing conditions. Microbial counts were determined prior to and after treatments to determine the log reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilusvegetative cells and spores. Log reductions were recorded, and data were analyzed by response surface analysis. The log reductions induced by temperature and time without high intensity ultrasound (HIU) were compared to reductions observed with HIU. Thermosonication was also applied to RSMP to determine effects on solubility using a continuous flow cell system. Thermosonication yielded a significantly higher level of microbial destruction for both vegetative cells and spores than heat treatment alone. For experiments involving vegetative cells, the interaction of treatment time and temperature proved to have the greatest influence on microbial inactivation. In comparison, the interaction of total solids content and length of HIU treatment demonstrated the greatest effect on the increased log reductions for spores. The solubility of RSMP treated with HIU did not significantly differ from the solubility of RSMP not treated with HIU. Further data showed the implementation of HIU, or thermosonication, during milk powder processing would be most effective before and after the evaporation stage when the total solids content of product is 9. 2 % and 50 % at 75 °C and 60 °C, respectively. Based on preliminary data, it is assumed HIU applied for 10 s at these two locations would produce an additive effect, thereby reducing overall microbial counts by 5. 76 log and 0. 51 log for G. stearothermophilus vegetative cells and spores, respectively, in the product prior to entering the drying stage. All research findings and observations suggest HIU, or thermosonication, to be a successful method for reducing microbial populations during milk powder processing without sacrificing skim milk powder solubilit...|$|R
