5|$|The prince {{began to}} be {{perceived}} as a <b>unifier</b> towards the middle of the 19th century. Such an interpretation is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E
5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a <b>unifier).</b> The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{establishment}} of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the education system resulted in over 50 schools being divided by among ethnic lines, primarily in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. The OSCE highlighted the Central Bosnia Canton and the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton as areas where local authorities remain particularly reluctant to merge schools. The Office of the High Representative (OHR), a body meant to implement peace agreements in Bosnia and Herzegovina, made certain efforts to unify the educational system in related areas, but with little success. Some Croats oppose unification of the schools claiming they would lose their ethnic identity in schools with mixed ethnicities. Some Bosniaks support unification claiming that segregated schools would cause hatred among ethnicities which could destroy Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 12 June 2003, the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) invited the Federal Ministry of Education to implement unification of 'two schools under one roof' before the next school year. A 2003 law on primary and secondary education was supposed to act as an administrative and legal <b>unifier</b> of schools, it has been difficult to implement in Bosnia’s complex education system. The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the main Croatian party, stopped the implementation of unification laws in the cantons they had significant influence, especially in Central Bosnia Canton. As a result, High Representative Paddy Ashdown imposed a fine of 20,000 euros ($21,980) on the Croatian Democratic Union party. On 8 July 2005, Paddy Ashdown removed Nikola Lovrinović from the position of the Minister of Education in Central Bosnia Canton for failing to implement laws designed to integrate schools.|$|E

They contrast with unification procedures by deciding unification problems of infinitary nature, which might have infinitely many most general <b>unifiers.</b> Unification procedures for these subclasses return {{a complete set of}} these <b>unifiers</b> and do not terminate. The common practice in automated deduction for higher-order logic is to utilize unification procedures and to force their termination by restricting the size of the generated <b>unifiers.</b> The unifiability algorithms, which are complete for certain sub-classes, allow us to have a more semantical approach. In this paper we claim that the standard resolution calculi for higher-order automated deduction do not take full advantage of the strengths of these algorithms and suggest a new calculus. We prove that this calculus can have an exponential speed-up over the traditional calculi. ...|$|R
