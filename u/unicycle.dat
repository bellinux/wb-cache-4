5|$|McGary's {{father is}} a Chesterton High School alumnus and his mother worked there as the school treasurer. McGary entertains his {{teammates}} with rapping {{on and off the}} court. McGary's older brother Ryan bought him a <b>unicycle</b> for his 12th birthday and McGary quickly became proficient, eventually delivering newspapers on unicycles with his childhood friend Spencer who had a paper route and also had a <b>unicycle.</b> According to his AAU basketball coach, Wayne Brumm, McGary is said to have thrown a baseball in the mid to high 80 miles per hour range. McGary is an avid skateboarder, with a set of skateboard ramps built by his father in his backyard.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{designing}} distributed control laws making a group of dynamic <b>unicycles</b> converge to a common circle of prespecified radius, whose centre is stationary but dependent on the initial conditions, and travel around the circle in a desired direction.

40|$|Abstract — The {{feasibility}} {{problem is}} studied of achieving a specified formation {{among a group}} of autonomous <b>unicycles</b> by local distributed control. The directed graph defined by the information flow plays a key role. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for formation stabilization of multiple <b>unicycles</b> to a point and a line. A similar result is given for for-mation stabilization to more general geometric arrangements with the condition that a group of <b>unicycles</b> have a common sense of direction. I...|$|R

25|$|A <b>unicycle</b> is {{a vehicle}} that touches the ground with only one wheel. The most common {{variation}} has a frame with a saddle, and has a pedal-driven direct drive. Unicycling is practiced professionally in circuses, by street performers, in festivals, and as a hobby. Unicycles have also been used to create new sports such as <b>unicycle</b> hockey. In recent years, unicycles have also been used in activities similar to mountain biking or trials.|$|E
25|$|Giraffe, a {{chain-driven}} <b>unicycle.</b> {{use of a}} chain {{or multiple}} wheels in a gear-like configuration can make the <b>unicycle</b> much taller than standard unicycles (note that multi-wheel unicycles {{can be described as}} giraffes). Standard unicycles don't have a chain, which limits the seat height based on how long the rider's legs are, because there the crank is attached directly to the wheel axle. Giraffe unicycles can range in heights from 3 feet to over 10 feet high.|$|E
