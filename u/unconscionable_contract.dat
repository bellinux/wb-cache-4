50|$|Unconscionability (sometimes {{known as}} unconscionable dealing/conduct in Australia) is a {{doctrine}} in contract law that describes {{terms that are}} so extremely unjust, or overwhelmingly one-sided {{in favor of the}} party who has the superior bargaining power, that they are contrary to good conscience. Typically, an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>contract</b> is held to be unenforceable because no reasonable or informed person would otherwise agree to it. The perpetrator of the conduct is not allowed to benefit, because the consideration offered is lacking, or is so obviously inadequate, that to enforce the contract would be unfair to the party seeking to escape the contract.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, {{attorney}} Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, {{claiming that}} it had illegally deprived him of access to his account after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below reserve. Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred {{as a result of}} the case, including a court ruling that parts of the Second Life Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>contract</b> of adhesion. [...] The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement. As such, a settlement created no precedent and thus left users with confusion as to what legal rights they truly had with respect to their virtual land, items, and account. Many of Bragg's legal arguments rested on the claim—advertised on Linden Lab web site—that virtual land within Second Life could be [...] "owned" [...] by the purchasing user, which was removed shortly after the settlement, leading to speculation that this was part of the reason for the settlement.|$|E
40|$|Comparative Law {{means not}} only {{travelling}} in space, but travelling in time as well. It’s {{the essence of}} legal evolution: Law undergoes changes in different countries at different times. The story of inequality of exchange serves as a good example. Inequality in exchange as a legal figure of the old Roman laesio enormis {{has long been a}} popular topic for comparative studies. However, the comparison was mostly limited to the French, German and English legal systems, even though they form model solutions for their legal families. In the historical perspective, it meant tracing the legal evolution of laesio enormis and the unfair advantage (<b>unconscionable</b> <b>contract)</b> until the implementation of the German BGB in 1900 only. But it is not how the whole story goes. This paper aims at showing how Comparative Law has served to shape the legal consequences of unfair advantage in the 20 th century. Its modern “legal geography” is a perspective of so called “derived legal systems”: the Swiss, the Polish, the Italian and the Dutch. Each of them marks a new stage in the legal evolution of the institution of unfair advantage. The path of development starts from the Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911 and proceeds gradually towards the soft law of the 21 st century. Its main feature is the striving for more flexibility meaning favour of private autonomy and certainty of contractual relations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a mixed {{approach to the}} theme of the instrumentality of law by both analysing the goal of a legal transformation and the techniques adapted to achieve it. The correct recognition of a certain practical necessity has lead the Swiss Federal Tribunal to an intriguing judgement “Fussballclub Lohn-Fall” of 1997. The legal remedies provided for cases of unfair advantage have been then creatively modified praeter legem. The adaptation was strongly influenced by foreign legal patterns. The Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911 provides a norm in art. 21 on unfair advantage (<b>unconscionable</b> <b>contract),</b> prescribing that if one party takes unjustified advantage over the weaknesses of another in order to receive an excessive benefit, such a contract is avoidable. Its wording has been shaped over a hundred years ago and still remains intact. However, {{over the course of the}} 20 th century the necessity for a more efficient protection has arisen. The legal doctrine and jurisprudence were constantly pointing out the incompleteness of the remedies provided by art. 21 of the Code of Obligations. In the “Fussballclub Lohn-Fall” (BGE 123 III 292) the Swiss Federal Tribunal finally introduced the possibility to modify the contract. Its decision has been described as “a sign of the zeitgeist, spirit of the time”. It was the Swiss legal doctrine that has imposed the new measure under the influence of the German “quantitative Teilnichtigkeit” (quantitative partial nullity). The historical heritage of the Roman laesio enormis has also played its role...|$|E
40|$|Arbitration clauses in {{contracts}} require {{consumers to}} waive {{their rights to}} bring litigation in court. The clauses are often unavoidable because firms include arbitration clauses in contracts of adhesion. In recent years, firms have begun to load their arbitration clauses with unconscionable terms unrelated to arbitration itself. For example, firms insert terms that shorten statutes of limitations, reduce damages, or prohibit injunctive relief. These contract terms are considered unconscionable – and, thus, unenforceable – in many states. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Federal Arbitration Act (the FAA) to require judicial deference to arbitration clauses. Consequently, many courts allow firms to bootstrap unenforceable contract terms into an enforceable arbitration clause {{in order to make}} those <b>unconscionable</b> <b>contract</b> terms enforceable. The Supreme Court has invoked the legislative intent of the 1925 Congress in order to assert that the FAA applies to consumer contracts. Courts have further suggested that Congress intended arbitration clauses to be enforced as written and that this requires deference to anti-consumer terms that would otherwise be found unconscionable under state law. Finally, the Supreme Court has asserted that the FAA preempts all state efforts to police arbitration clauses, including basic notification requirements. This Article examines the actual legislative history of the FAA and explains that Congress never intended the FAA to apply to consumer contracts. Congress was exclusively concerned with the enforceability of arbitration agreements between sophisticated businesses in commercial disputes. Congress never considered the possibility that retailers would impose mandatory arbitration clauses on their customers, let alone that these arbitration clauses would be structured to limit damages, to truncate statutes of limitation, or to otherwise remove procedural protections from consumers. The congressional intent that courts should enforce anti-consumer terms in arbitration clauses is an imagined one. The Article concludes that courts should stop asserting that the FAA mandates enforcement of unconscionable terms so long as they reside in an arbitration clause. When confronting unconscionable terms in arbitration clauses, courts can take one of three actions: enforce the unconscionable terms; sever the unconscionable terms; or strike the arbitration clause as a whole because it is so overrun by unconscionable terms. The Article explains why only the latter two options are consistent with Congressional intent and good public policy...|$|E

One is to require a return that {{is equal to the}} benefit received, but to limit the use of that requirement in special cases. Bankruptcy rules are in part designed to prevent downward, irrecoverable spirals of debt while still exacting a considerable penalty. Similarly, there are rules for rescinding <b>unconscionable</b> <b>contracts,</b> preventing unjust enrichment, and dealing with cases in which contractual obligations have become impossible to perform.

40|$|Abstract: Unreasonable, <b>unconscionable</b> {{and oppressive}} <b>contract</b> terms {{have for a}} long time been a subject of concern. In South Africa, the matter enjoyed the {{attention}} of the South African Law Commission and their recommendations regarding unreasonable, <b>unconscionable</b> and oppressive <b>contract</b> terms had the potential to adddress some of the concerns associated with these terms. However, instead of implementing the recommendations of the Commission in toto, the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 was implemented in April 2011 and addressed only a number of concerns raised by the Law Commission. Against this background, this dissertation outlines the developments of the South African Consumer Protection Act in comparison with the Ausralian Consumer and Competition Act specifically in respect of unreasonable, <b>unconscionable</b> and oppressive <b>contract</b> terms. The dissertation compares the South African Law Commission’s recommendations with the Australian Productivity Commission’s recommendations, (both Commissions compiled reports regarding their respective country’s consumer law and focused on unfair terms) and investigates how these recommendations were accepted and implemented by each country’s legislatures. It is argued that the South African Consumer Protection Act should have considered including more of the recommendations made by the South African Law Commission than it did. Fundamental aspects pertaining to any debate on unreasonable, <b>unconscionable</b> and oppressive <b>contract</b> terms is fairness and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. There is a body of academic work dedicated {{to the role of the}} Constitution in law of contract and how it should be used to infuse fairness into contracts. Ultimately, the reluctance of the courts to apply the Constitution in the realm of contract law re-iterates the need to have dedicated legislation that addresses recurring issues pertaining to unreasonable, <b>unconscionable</b> and oppressive <b>contract</b> terms. There is a great deal of emphasis placed by both countries’ Commissions on the need for substantive fairness and not merely procedural fairness and this aspect is elaborated on in this disseration. In the final instance, this dissertation discusses South Africa’s more conservative approach to unfair terms in consumer law in comparison to Australia’s approach and concludes with a thought on whether the South African legislature could have prevented some of the current lacunae pertaining to unfair contract terms. In comparison with Australian law, it is submitted that there were in fact ways in which the South African [...] . LL. M. (Commercial Law...|$|R

The ACL is incorporated as Sch. 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (CCA). This is a single national framework for the protection of consumers, and by extension consumer guarantors, against unfair business conduct and practices and is a national product safety regime.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} whether contract design {{can influence}} the post- formation behavior of the non-drafting party. If it can, contract preparers {{may be able to}} obtain significant transactional advantages. This Article suggests that several contractual features can be explained in terms of their ability to exploit the cognitive biases of, and to induce particular “advantageous” emotions from, the non-drafting party after the contract has been executed. These features may include arbitration provisions, disclosures in capital letter or bold face type, “reliance” language, and language framing possible losses in particular ways. Contracts can encourage individuals to feel shame, to blame themselves, to believe that contracts are sacred promises that should be specifically performed, to utilize faulty judgment heuristics when determining contract costs, and to rely on misperceived social norms with respect to challenging or breaching contracts. This may influence them not to breach or challenge an otherwise uneconomical, <b>unconscionable,</b> or illegal <b>contract.</b> Consequently, contract preparers may be able to enjoy the benefits of promises that often would not be realized if the non-drafting party were profit-maximizing like the contract preparer...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{starts with}} the {{proposition}} that most American contracting is consumer contracting, posits that consumer contracting has particular and even peculiar doctrinal features, and concludes that these features dominate the lay understanding of contract law. Contracts of adhesion constitute the bulk of consumer experience with contract law. It {{is not hard to}} see that someone discerning the nature of contract law from a sample composed almost entirely of boilerplate terms and conditions would come quickly to the conclusion that contract law is highly formal. Within the realm of potentially enforceable deals (i. e., those that are supported by consideration and not illegal or <b>unconscionable),</b> modern <b>contract</b> doctrine upholds agreements when the parties have objectively manifested assent. This is the contract law of the first‐year Contracts course, and it is, more or less, why contracts existed in the cases Hadley v. Baxendale, Hawkins v. McGee, and Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co. These three canonical cases each involve oral manifestations of assent: respectively, the contracts are based on the carrier 2 ̆ 7 s promise that the crankshaft would be delivered by noon the next day; the doctor 2 ̆ 7 s promise of a one‐hundred percent good hand; and the employer 2 ̆ 7 s response to his anxious employee, “You 2 ̆ 7 re alright. Go get your men out. ” For everyone who knows the doctrine of assent, these are relatively easy cases for finding contracts, because the evidence suggests that the parties, in fact, communicated to each other their agreement. However, these cases might startle {{a large percentage of the}} nonattorney population, for the simple reason that they are oral and not written contracts. What accounts for this misperception of contract law? Americans are not contract naïfs. On the contrary, most people enter into numerous legally binding agreements every year, if not every month or week. These are the agreements we make with Amazon, PayPal, Comcast, Apple, AT 2 ̆ 6 T, and Visa, to name a few—in other words, these are the contracts we enter into regularly as consumers. Consumer contracts share key features: they are formal, assent is memorialized (either by signature or by clicking “I agree”), parties neither negotiate nor read their terms, and they are almost universally enforceable and, when litigated, enforced. This is the contract law that individuals encounter every day. As such, perhaps we should not be surprised that this is what most people think that contract law is. Emerging evidence indicates that most people think contracting means signing the paperwork and that contract law is about the form of consent rather than the content to which parties are consenting. This “intuitive formalism” deserves our empirical and normative attention because it has real implications for how consumers behave in their deals and how they interact with their legal system...|$|R
40|$|Lawrence Cunningham {{has written}} an {{insightful}} and persuasive article calling on courts {{to apply the}} contract-law doctrine of unconscionability in evaluating executive compensation. According to Cunningham, this additional doctrinal tool will allow courts to engage in genuine and meaningful oversight of excessive compensation. He argues that such oversight is valuable because existing corporate-law doctrine too often prompts courts to defer too much and too often to management’s decisions. Cunningham’s argument is modest yet impactful. It is modest in that it simply proposes that courts take account of a well-established area of contract law to analyze and evaluate the compensation contracts of corporate executives. It is impactful in that, as he points out, courts applying the doctrine of unconscionability will find that sometimes, some compensation contracts will be set aside. Perhaps courts will only find the worst of these <b>contracts</b> <b>unconscionable.</b> But {{that is more than}} zero, the number we can expect courts will find offensive to corporate-law norms as presently understood and adjudicated. This Essay will put Cunningham’s argument {{in the context of the}} larger debate over the dominant metaphors of corporate law. One way to tell the intellectual history of corporate law is to describe a battle between those who believe the dominant metaphor for the field is contract and those who believe it is property. In the contract metaphor, duties derive from voluntary agreements between and among parties to a deal. In the property metaphor, duties flow from status or rights, despite the absence of agreements or the existence of agreements to the contrary. One might think that Cunningham’s article fits squarely within the contract metaphor—he is, after all, calling on courts to use contract-law doctrine to evaluate corporatelaw questions. In my view, however, Cunningham’s argument fits within the larger movement away from the simplistic contractarian norms that have dominated the corporate-law field for the last generation. Cunningham’s argument in favor of contract doctrine is, in fact, best viewed as a celebration of property-law principles. Ironically, Cunningham’s article, arguing for an analysis based in contract law, is yet another attack on the dominance of contract reasoning in the theory and doctrine of corporate law...|$|R
