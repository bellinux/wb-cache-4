The lifecycle operation of these <b>ultracapacitors</b> is simulated using custom-built, dynamic simulation code constructed in Matlab.

40|$|A unique safety flasher {{powered by}} {{photovoltaic}} cells and <b>ultracapacitors</b> has been developed. Safety flashers are used wherever there are needs to mark actually or potentially hazardous locations. Examples of such locations include construction sites, highway work sites, and locations of hazardous operations. Heretofore, safety flashers have been powered by batteries, {{the use of}} which entails several disadvantages: Batteries must be kept adequately charged, and must {{not be allowed to}} become completely discharged. Batteries have rather short cycle lives, and their internal constituents that react chemically to generate electricity deteriorate (and hence power-generating capacities decrease) over time. The performances of batteries are very poor at low temperatures, which often occur in the circumstances in which safety flashers are most needed. The disposal of batteries poses a threat to the environment. The development of the present photovoltaic/ultracapacitor- powered safety flasher, in which the <b>ultracapacitors</b> are used to store energy, overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages of using batteries to store energy. The <b>ultracapacitors</b> in this flasher are electrochemical units that have extremely high volumetric capacitances because they contain large-surface-area electrodes separated by very small gaps. <b>Ultracapacitors</b> have extremely long cycle lives, as compared to batteries; consequently, it will never be necessary to replace the <b>ultracapacitors</b> in the safety flasher.

50|$|The {{presence}} of the <b>ultracapacitor</b> integrated in the UltraBattery acts to limit the formation of hard sulfation inside the cell.

Research continues into the reasons why the {{presence of}} the <b>ultracapacitor</b> reduces sulfation so successfully. Experimental results show that the presence of carbon within VRLA cells has some mitigating effect but the protective effects of the parallel-connected <b>ultracapacitor</b> within the UltraBattery are much more significant. Hund et al., for instance, found that typical VRLA battery failure modes (water loss, negative plate sulfation, and grid corrosion) are all minimized in the UltraBattery. Hund’s results also showed that the UltraBattery, used in a high rate partial state of charge application, exhibits reduced gassing, mimimized negative plate hard sulfation, enhanced power performance and minimized operating temperature compared with conventional VRLA cells.|$|E
