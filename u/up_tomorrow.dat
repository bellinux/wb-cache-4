2500|$|On November 30, 2003, Zuckerberg told Cameron Winklevoss in {{an email}} {{that he did}} not expect {{completion}} of the project to be difficult. Zuckerberg writes: [...] "I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality <b>up</b> <b>tomorrow</b> night." [...] The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. [...] "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional." [...] On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: [...] "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set." [...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway." [...] A week later: [...] "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E

They will have to go north, where labor is the fashion,--the universal custom; and tell me, now, is there enough Christian philanthropy, among your northern states, to bear with the process of their education and elevation? You send thousands of dollars to foreign missions; but could you endure to have the heathen sent into your towns and villages, and give your time, and thoughts, and money, to raise them to the Christian standard? That's what I want to know. If we emancipate, are you willing to educate? How many families, in your town, would take a negro man and woman, teach them, bear with them, and seek to make them Christians? How many merchants would take Adolph, if I wanted to make him a clerk; or mechanics, if I wanted him taught a trade? If I wanted to put Jane and Rosa to a school, how many schools are there in the northern states that would take them in? how many families that would board them? and yet they are as white as many a woman, north or south. You see, Cousin, I want justice done us. We are in a bad position. We are the more obvious oppressors of the negro; but the unchristian prejudice of the north is an oppressor almost equally severe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Then the confederated Israelites {{went up to}} {{the house}} of God. They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. (The ark of the {{covenant}} of God was there in those days, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it.) And the Lord said, [...] "Go <b>up,</b> for <b>tomorrow</b> I will deliver them into your hand.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the mean}} time I {{confidently}} {{appeal to the}} reader's imagination {{with the fact that}} there are several men of letters among us who are such good men of business that they can command a hundred dollars a thousand words for all they write. It is easy to write a thousand words a day, and, supposing one of these authors to work steadily, it can be seen that his net earnings during the year would come to some such sum as the President of the United States gets for doing far less work of a much more perishable sort. If the man of letters were wholly a business man, this is what would happen; he would make his forty or fifty thousand dollars a year, and be able to consort with bank presidents, and railroad officials, and rich tradesmen, and other flowers of our plutocracy on equal terms. But, unfortunately, from a business point of view, he is also an artist, and the very qualities that enable him to delight the public disable him from delighting it uninterruptedly. [...] "No rose blooms right along," [...] as the English boys at Oxford made an American collegian say in a theme which they imagined for him in his national parlance; and the man of letters, as an artist, is apt to have times and seasons when he cannot blossom. Very often it shall happen that his mind will lie fallow between novels or stories for weeks and months at a stretch; when the suggestions of the friendly editor shall fail to fruit in the essays or articles desired; when the muse shall altogether withhold herself, or shall respond only in a feeble dribble of verse which he might sell indeed, but which it would not be good business for him to put on the market. But supposing him to be a very diligent and continuous worker, and so happy as to have fallen on a theme that delights him and bears him along, he may please himself so ill with the result of his labors that he can do nothing less in artistic conscience than destroy a day's work, a week's work, a month's work. I know one man of letters who wrote to-day and tore <b>up</b> <b>tomorrow</b> for nearly a whole summer. But even if part of the mistaken work may be saved, because it is good work out of place, and not intrinsically bad, the task of reconstruction wants almost as much time as the production; and then, when all seems done, comes the anxious and endless process of revision. These drawbacks reduce the earning capacity of what I may call the high-cost man of letters in such measure that an author whose name is known everywhere, and whose reputation is commensurate with the boundaries of his country, if it does not transcend them, shall have the income, say, of a rising young physician, known to a few people in a subordinate city.|$|E

[...] My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. [...] The sudden blood of these men! at a word-- [...] Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too.

[...] Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: [...] 115 [...] But all the play, the insight and the stretch-- [...] Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? [...] Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, [...] We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! [...] Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think-- [...] 120 [...] More than I merit, yes, by many times. [...] But had you--oh, with the same perfect brow, [...] And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, [...] And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird [...] The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare-- [...] 125 [...] Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!

[...] 130 [...] Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!" [...] I might have done it for you. So it seems: [...] Perhaps not. All is as God overrules. [...] Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; [...] The rest avail not. Why do I need you? [...] 135 [...] What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? [...] In this world, who can do a thing, will not; [...] And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: [...] Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat, too, the power-- [...] And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, [...] 140 [...] God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. [...] 'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict, [...] That I am something underrated here, [...] Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. [...] I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, [...] 145 [...] For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. [...] The best is when they pass and look aside; [...] But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. [...] Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, [...] And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! [...] 150 [...] I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, [...] Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, [...] In that humane great monarch's golden look-- [...] One finger in his beard or twisted curl [...] Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, [...] 155 [...] One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, [...] The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, [...] I, painting proudly with his breath on me, [...] All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, [...] Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls [...] 160 [...] Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts-- [...] And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, [...] This in the background, waiting on my work, [...] To crown the issue with a last reward! [...] A good time, was it not, my kingly days? [...] 165 [...] And load you not grown restless ... but I know-- [...] 'Tis done and past; 'twas right, my instinct said; [...] Too live the life grew, golden and not gray, [...] And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt [...] Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. [...] 170 [...] How could it end in any other way? [...] You called me, and I came home to your heart.

[...] Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, [...] 175 [...] You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine!

I am glad to judge [...] 180 [...] Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows [...] My better fortune, I resolve to think. [...] For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, [...] Said one day Agnolo, his very self, [...] To Rafael ... I have known it all these years ... 185 [...] (When the young man was flaming out his thoughts [...] Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, [...] Too lifted up in heart because of it) [...] "Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub [...] Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, [...] 190 [...] Who, were he set to plan and execute [...] As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, [...] Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!" [...] To Rafael's!--And indeed the arm is wrong. [...] I hardly dare ... yet, only you to see, [...] 195 [...] Give the chalk here--quick, thus the line should go! [...] Aye, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! [...] Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, [...] (What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? [...] Do you forget already words like those?) [...] 200 [...] If really there was such a chance, so lost-- [...] Is, whether you're--not grateful--but more pleased. [...] Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! [...] This hour has been an hour! Another smile? [...] If you would sit thus by me every night [...] 205 [...] I should work better, do you comprehend? [...] I mean that I should earn more, give you more. [...] See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; [...] Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, [...] The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. [...] 210 [...] Come from the window, love--come in, at last, [...] Inside the melancholy little house [...] We built to be so gay with. God is just. [...] King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights [...] When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, [...] 215 [...] The walls become illumined, brick from brick [...] Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, [...] That gold of his I did cement them with! [...] Let us but love each other. Must you go? [...] That Cousin here again? He waits outside? [...] 220 [...] Must see you--you, and not with me? Those loans? [...] More gaming debts to pay? You smiled for that? [...] Well, let smiles buy me! Have you more to spend? [...] While hand and eye and something of a heart [...] Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? [...] 225 [...] I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit [...] The gray remainder of the evening out, [...] Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly [...] How I could paint, were I but back in France, [...] One picture, just one more--the Virgin's face, [...] 230 [...] Not yours this time! I want you at my side [...] To hear them--that is, Michel Agnolo-- [...] Judge all I do and tell you of its worth. [...] Will you? Tomorrow, satisfy your friend. [...] I take the subjects for his corridor, [...] 235 [...] Finish the portrait out of hand--there, there, [...] And throw him in another thing or two [...] If he demurs; the whole should prove enough [...] To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside, [...] What's better and what's all I care about, [...] 240 [...] Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! [...] Love, does that please you?

I'd like his face-- [...] His, elbowing on his comrade in the door [...] With the pike and lantern--for the slave that holds [...] John Baptist's head a-dangle by the hair [...] With one hand ("Look you, now," [...] as who should say) [...] 35 [...] And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped! [...] It's not your {{chance to have a}} bit of chalk, [...] A wood-coal, or the like? or you should see! [...] Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me so. [...] What, brother Lippo's doings, up and down, [...] 40 [...] You know them and they take you? like enough! [...] I saw the proper twinkle in your eye-- [...] 'Tell you, I liked your looks at very first. [...] Let's sit and set things straight now, hip to haunch. [...] Here's spring come, and the nights one makes up bands [...] 45 [...] To roam the town and sing out carnival, [...] And I've been three weeks shut within my mew, [...] A-painting for the great man, saints and saints [...] And saints again. I could not paint all night-- [...] Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air. [...] 50 [...] There came a hurry of feet and little feet, [...] A sweep of lute-strings, laughs, and whifts of song-- [...] Flower o' the broom, [...] Take away love, and our earth is a tomb! [...] Flower o' the quince, [...] 55 [...] I let Lisa go, and what good in life since? [...] Flower o' the thyme--and so on. Round they went. [...] Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter [...] Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight--three slim shapes, [...] And a face that looked up ... zooks, sir, flesh and blood, [...] 60 [...] That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it went, [...] Curtain and counterpane and coverlet, [...] All the bed-furniture--a dozen knots, [...] There was a ladder! Down I let myself, [...] Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped, [...] 65 [...] And after them. I came up with the fun [...] Hard by Saint Laurence, hail fellow, well met-- [...] Flower o' the rose, [...] If I've been merry, what matter who knows? [...] And so I was stealing back again [...] 70 [...] To get to bed and have a bit of sleep [...] Ere I rise <b>up</b> <b>tomorrow</b> and go work [...] On Jerome knocking at his poor old breast [...] With his great round stone to subdue the flesh, [...] You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I see! [...] 75 [...] Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head-- [...] Mine's shaved--a monk, you say--the sting's in that! [...] If Master Cosimo announced himself, [...] Mum's the word naturally; but a monk! [...] Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now! [...] 80 [...] I was a baby when my mother died [...] And father died and left me in the street. [...] I starved there, God knows how, a year or two [...] On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks, [...] Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty day, [...] 85 [...] My stomach being empty as your hat, [...] The wind doubled me up and down I went. [...] Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand [...] (Its fellow was a stinger as I knew), [...] And so along the wall, over the bridge, [...] 90 [...] By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there, [...] While I stood munching my first bread that month: [...] "So, boy, you've minded," [...] quoth the good fat father, [...] Wiping his own mouth--'twas refection-time-- [...] "To quit this very miserable world? [...] 95 [...] Will you renounce" ... "the mouthful of bread?" [...] thought I; [...] By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me; [...] I did renounce the world, its pride and greed, [...] Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house, [...] Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici [...] 100 [...] Have given their hearts to--all at eight years old. [...] Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure, [...] 'Twas not for nothing--the good bellyful, [...] The warm serge and the rope that goes all round, [...] And day-long blessed idleness beside! [...] 105 [...] "Let's see what the urchin's fit for"--that came next. [...] Not overmuch their way, I must confess. [...] Such a to-do! They tried me with their books; [...] Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure waste! [...] Flower o' the clove, [...] 110 [...] All the Latin I construe is [...] "amo," [...] I love! [...] But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets [...] Eight years together, as my fortune was, [...] Watching folk's faces to know who will fling [...] The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires, [...] 115 [...] And who will curse or kick him for his pains-- [...] Which gentleman processional and fine, [...] Holding a candle to the Sacrament, [...] Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch [...] The droppings of the wax to sell again, [...] 120 [...] Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped-- [...] How say I?--nay, which dog bites, which lets drop [...] His bone from the heap of offal in the street-- [...] Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike, [...] He learns the look of things, and none the less [...] 125 [...] For admonition from the hunger-pinch. [...] I had a store of such remarks, be sure, [...] Which, after I found leisure, turned to use. [...] I drew men's faces on my copy books, [...] Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge, [...] 130 [...] Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes, [...] Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's, [...] And made a string of pictures of the world [...] Betwixt {{the ins and outs of}} verb and noun, [...] On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black. [...] 135 [...] "Nay," [...] quoth the Prior, [...] "turn him out, d'ye say? [...] In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark. [...] What if at last we get our man of parts, [...] We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese [...] And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine [...] 140 [...] And put the front on it that ought to be!" [...] And hereupon he bade me daub away. [...] Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank, [...] Never was such prompt disemburdening. [...] First, every sort of monk, the black and white, [...] 145 [...] I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church, [...] From good old gossips waiting to confess [...] Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends-- [...] To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot, [...] Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there [...] 150 [...] With the little children round him in a row [...] Of admiration, half for his beard and half [...] For that white anger of his victim's son [...] Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm, [...] Signing himself with the other because of Christ [...] 155 [...] (Whose sad face on the cross sees only this [...] After the passion of a thousand years) [...] Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head, [...] (Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve [...] On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf, [...] 160 [...] Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers [...] (The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone. [...] I painted all, then cried, [...] "'Tis ask and have; [...] Choose, for more's ready!"--laid the ladder flat, [...] And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall. [...] 165 [...] The monks closed in a circle and praised loud [...] Till checked, taught what to see and not to see, [...] Being simple bodies--"That's the very man! [...] Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog! [...] That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes [...] 170 [...] To care about his asthma: it's the life!" [...] But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked; [...] Their betters took their turn to see and say: [...] The Prior and the learned pulled a face [...] And stopped all that in no time. [...] "How? what's here? [...] 175 [...] Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all! [...] Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true [...] As much as pea and pea! It's devil's-game! [...] Your business is not to catch men with show, [...] With homage to the perishable clay, [...] 180 [...] But lift them over it, ignore it all, [...] Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh. [...] Your business is to paint the souls of men--- [...] Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke ... no, it's not ... It's vapor done up like a new-born babe-- [...] 185 [...] (In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth) [...] It's ... well, what matters talking, it's the soul! [...] Give us no more of body than shows soul! [...] Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God, [...] That sets us praising--why not stop with him? [...] 190 [...] Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head [...] With wonder at lines, colors, and what not? [...] Paint the soul; never mind the legs and arms! [...] Rub all out; try at it a second time. [...] Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts, [...] 195 [...] She's just my niece ... Herodias, I would say-- [...] Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off! [...] Have it all out!" [...] Now, is this sense, I ask? [...] A fine way to paint soul, by painting body [...] So ill the eye can't stop there, must go further, [...] 200 [...] And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white [...] When what you put for yellow's simply black, [...] And any sort of meaning looks intense [...] When all beside itself means and looks naught. [...] Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn, [...] 205 [...] Left foot and right foot, go a double step, [...] Make his flesh liker and his soul more like, [...] Both in their order? Take the prettiest face, [...] The Prior's niece ... patron-saint--is it so pretty [...] You can't discover if it means hope, fear, [...] 210 [...] Sorrow, or joy? Won't beauty go with these? [...] Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue, [...] Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash, [...] And then add soul and heighten them three-fold? [...] Or say there's beauty with no soul at all-- [...] 215 [...] (I never saw it--put the case the same--) [...] If you get simple beauty and naught else, [...] You get about the best thing God invents: [...] That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed, [...] Within yourself, when you return Him thanks. [...] 220 [...] "Rub all out!" [...] Well, well, there's my life, in short, [...] And so the thing has gone on ever since. [...] I'm grown a man no doubt; I've broken bounds: [...] You should not take a fellow eight years old [...] And make him swear to never kiss the girls. [...] 225 [...] I'm my own master, paint now as I please-- [...] Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house! [...] Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front-- [...] Those great rings serve more purposes than just [...] To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse! [...] 230 [...] And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes [...] Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work, [...] The heads shake still--"It's art's decline, my son! [...] You're not of the true painters, great and old; [...] Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find; [...] 235 [...] Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer: [...] Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!" [...] Flower o' the pine, [...] You keep your mist ... manners, and I'll stick to mine! [...] I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know! [...] 240 [...] Don't you think they're the likeliest to know, [...] They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage, [...] Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint [...] To please them--sometimes do and sometimes don't; [...] For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come [...] 245 [...] A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints-- [...] A laugh, a cry, the business of the world-- [...] (Flower o' the peach, [...] Death for us all, and his own life for each!) [...] And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over, [...] 250 [...] The world and life's too big to pass for a dream, [...] And I do these wild things in sheer despite, [...] And play the fooleries you catch me at, [...] In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass [...] After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so, [...] 255 [...] Although the miller does not preach to him [...] The only good of grass is to make chaff. [...] What would men have? Do they like grass or no-- [...] May they or mayn't they? All I want's the thing [...] Settled forever one way. As it is, [...] 260 [...] You tell too many lies and hurt yourself: [...] You don't like what you only like too much, [...] You do like what, if given you at your word, [...] You find abundantly detestable. [...] For me, I think I speak as I was taught; [...] 265 [...] I always see the garden and God there [...] A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned, [...] The value and significance of flesh, [...] I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.|$|E
