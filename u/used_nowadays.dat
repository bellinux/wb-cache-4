5|$|Galileo steadfastly {{refused to}} use Marius' names and invented {{as a result}} the {{numbering}} scheme that is still <b>used</b> <b>nowadays,</b> in parallel with proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively. Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it. The numbered names (Jupiter x) were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius' names became widely used.|$|E
5|$|Early diamond {{identification}} tests {{included a}} scratch test {{relying on the}} superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely <b>used</b> <b>nowadays.</b> Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E

25|$|A wood {{surface is}} ideal for social dancing if {{maintained}} properly and is also standard for many indoor sports. Engineered wood is normally <b>used</b> <b>nowadays</b> for wood flooring as it is less liable to warp or shrink and is more economic.

Traditional Lincolnshire sausages are made entirely from minced pork, stale bread crumb (rusk is <b>used</b> <b>nowadays)</b> pepper, sage and salt. The skins should be natural casings which are made from the intestines of either sheep or pig.|$|E

25|$|Near Wadjemup Lighthouse, a Battery Observation Post (BOP) {{was built}} as a lookout to {{coordinate}} aiming and firings from the Bickley and Oliver's Hill Batteries. A Signals Building, associated with the BOP and a Women's Army Barracks, built to house officers and staff who operated the BOP were constructed there also. The latter building is <b>used</b> <b>nowadays</b> for occasional accommodation for University and other scientific research groups working on the island.|$|E
25|$|The first-generation devices {{relied on}} the same {{colorimetric}} reaction that is still <b>used</b> <b>nowadays</b> in glucose test strips for urine. Besides glucose oxidase, the test kit contains a benzidine derivative, which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the test strip had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had to be washed away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently.|$|E

25|$|In the {{classical}} preparation of French côtelettes de volaille, the humerus bone {{of the wing}} is left attached. This also holds for their Russian versions and in particular for chicken Kiev. For serving, the bone is usually covered with a frilled paper napkin. However, industrially produced pure fillets are often <b>used</b> <b>nowadays,</b> and the cutlets are served without the bone. This is the usual way of serving chicken Kiev in the US. A spherically shaped version was developed by English chef Jesse Dunford Wood.|$|E
25|$|The offline combustion/reduction has {{the highest}} {{accuracy}} and precision for hydrogen isotope measurement without limits for sample types. The analytical uncertainty is typically 1~2‰ in δD. Thus it is still being used today when highest levels of precision are required. However, the offline preparation procedure is very time-consuming and complicated. It also requires large sample size (several 102 mg). Thus the online preparation based on combustion/reduction coupled with the subsequent continuous flow-IRMS (CF-IRMS) system has been more commonly <b>used</b> <b>nowadays.</b> Chromium reduction or high temperature conversion are the dominant online preparation methods {{for the detection of}} hydrogen isotope by IRMS.|$|E
25|$|The Cornforth reagent (pyridinium dichromate, PDC), pyridinium {{chlorochromate}} (PCC), the Collins reagent (complex of chromium(VI) oxide with pyridine in dichloromethane) and the Sarret reagent (complex of chromium(VI) oxide with pyridine in pyridine) {{are similar}} chromium-based pyridine compounds, {{which are also}} used for oxidation, namely conversion of primary and secondary alcohols to ketones. The Collins and Sarret reagents are both difficult and dangerous to prepare, they are hygroscopic and can inflame during preparation. For this reason, the use of PCC and PDC was preferred. Those reagents were rather popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but because of their toxicity and confirmed carcinogenic status, they are rarely <b>used</b> <b>nowadays.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although a {{precursor}} to the flush toilet system which is widely <b>used</b> <b>nowadays</b> was designed in 1596 by John Harington, such systems did not come into widespread use until the late nineteenth century. With {{the onset of the}} industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummings in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic growth in the sewage system, especially in London, which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons.|$|E
25|$|St. Gregory VII having, indeed, {{abridged}} {{the order}} of prayers, and having simplified the Liturgy as performed at the Roman Court, this abridgment received the name of Breviary, which was suitable, since, according to the etymology of the word, it was an abridgment. The name has been extended to books which contain in one volume, {{or at least in}} one work, liturgical books of different kinds, such as the Psalter, the Antiphonary, the Responsoriary, the Lectionary, etc. In this connection it may be pointed out that in this sense the word, as it is <b>used</b> <b>nowadays,</b> is illogical; it should be named a Plenarium rather than a Breviarium, since, liturgically speaking, the word Plenarium exactly designates such books as contain several different compilations united under one cover. This is pointed out, however, simply to make still clearer the meaning and origin of the word; and section V will furnish a more detailed explanation of the formation of the Breviary.|$|E
25|$|The general {{classification}} {{winner was}} not always determined by a time system. In the inaugural Giro d'Italia the organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. In addition to that, the organizers chose the point system since it would be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking the riders during each stage. The race leader was calculated by adding up each rider's placings in each stage and the rider with the lowest total was the leader; if a rider placed second {{in the first stage}} and third in the second stage, he would have five points total. The system was modified a year later to give the riders who placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system the same for the riders who placed 1st through 50th in a stage. The calculation remained unmodified until 1912 where the organizers chose to have the race be centered around teams, while still keeping the point system. The next year race organizers chose to revert to the system used in 1911. In 1914, the organizers shifted to the system <b>used</b> <b>nowadays,</b> where riders would have their finishing times for each stage totaled together to determine the overall leader.|$|E
