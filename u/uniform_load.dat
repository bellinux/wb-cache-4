Under the <b>uniform</b> <b>loading,</b> the maximum vertical force of the rock-arch instability was much higher than that under the concentrated loading condition, but the maximum lateral force was almost the same.

The single-tracked bridge was approximately 3686 ft long, and its longest span, at 525 ft, was reputed to be the longest trestle span in the world at that time. The bridge ran from the northern edge of Main Street in Henderson to the low water mark on the Indiana side, resting on 15 stone piers. It was designed to carry two 118000 lb engines followed by 60000 lb coal tenders, and its maximum <b>uniform</b> <b>load</b> capacity was [...] A crowd of 8,000 watched the first train cross the bridge on July 13, 1885.|$|E
50|$|Approximations of parabolas {{are also}} found {{in the shape of the}} main cables on a simple {{suspension}} bridge. The curve of the chains of a suspension bridge is always an intermediate curve between a parabola and a catenary, but in practice the curve is generally nearer to a parabola, and in calculations the second degree parabola is used. Under the influence of a <b>uniform</b> <b>load</b> (such as a horizontal suspended deck), the otherwise catenary-shaped cable is deformed toward a parabola. Unlike an inelastic chain, a freely hanging spring of zero unstressed length takes the shape of a parabola. Suspension-bridge cables are, ideally, purely in tension, without having to carry other, e.g., bending, forces. Similarly, the structures of parabolic arches are purely in compression.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amount of}} fiber in a fiber {{reinforced}} composite directly corresponds with the mechanical properties of the composite. Theoretically the maximum fiber ratio of round fibers {{that can be achieved}} in a composite is 90.8% if the fibers are in a unidirectional hexagonal close packed configuration. Realistically the highest fiber volume ratio is around 70% due to manufacturing parameters and is usually in the range of 50% to 65%. Adding too little fiber reinforcement in the composite will actually deteriorate the properties of the material. Too much fiber volume may also decrease the strength of the composite {{due to the lack of}} space for the matrix to fully surround and bond with the fibers. Therefore, there is an optimal space between fibers that will fully exploit the <b>uniform</b> <b>load</b> transfer between fibers. Given the fiber volume fraction, the theoretical elastic properties of a composite can be determined. The elastic modulus of a composite in the fiber direction of a unidirectional composite can be calculated using the following equation: ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Uniform</b> cyclic <b>loading</b> is {{commonly}} used in laboratory tests to evaluate soil resistance to earthquake-induced liquefaction, even if the cyclic stresses induced by earthquakes {{in the field are}} highly irregular. This paper discusses the use of stress and energy-based approaches to evaluate the liquefaction resistance of sand under irregular loading. Results of undrained cyclic triaxial tests including a large-amplitude singular peak loading cycle are presented and compared to those obtained using <b>uniform</b> <b>loading.</b> Although samples are subjected to loading patterns which would have been deemed equivalent by conventional stress-based methods, the number of cycles required to trigger liquefaction strongly depends on the amplitude and location of the peak within the loading history. Conversely, a unique relationship exists between the accumulation of dissipated energy per unit volume, computed using stress and strain measurements, and the observed residual pore water pressure build-up for all tests, throughout the entire cyclic loading application. This demonstrates that conventional laboratory tests using <b>uniform</b> <b>loading</b> conditions can be employed to determine liquefaction resistance if their interpretation is carried out based on energy principles...|$|R
