50|$|Some modern music {{calls for}} the {{recorder}} to produce <b>unusual</b> <b>noises,</b> rhythms and effects, by such techniques as flutter-tonguing and overblowing to produce multiphonics. David Murphy's 2002 composition Bavardage is an example, as is Hans Martin Linde's Music for a Bird.|$|R

6000|$|They did begin; {{and being}} too much engaged {{in their own}} noise to be struck by an <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> in {{the other part of}} the house, had {{proceeded}} some way when the door of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearing at it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, [...] "My father is come!

50|$|After a {{malfunction}} from a worn brake mechanism, {{a service}} team from Vestas were called. Vestas engineers checked and repaired the wind turbine brake {{on the morning}} of February 22, 2008. At the last routine inspection it was noted that the main gear of the turbine was also making <b>unusual</b> <b>noises</b> and a sophisticated endoscopic inspection of the gear was planned, but as result of its high cost it was not undertaken immediately.|$|R
60|$|Festus {{was already}} out of breath, and soon {{found that he was}} not likely to {{overtake}} her. On she went, without turning her head, till an <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> behind compelled her to look round.

6000|$|So Mr. Great-heart, old Honest, and {{the four}} young men went {{to go up to}} Doubting Castle, to look for Giant Despair. When they came at the castle gate, they knocked for {{entrance}} with an <b>unusual</b> <b>noise.</b> At that, the old giant comes to the gate, and Diffidence his wife follows. Then said he, [...] "Who and what is he that is so hardy as after this manner to disturb the Giant Despair?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was dreary work {{waiting there}} in the darkness, {{listening}} intently for the lightest <b>unusual</b> <b>noise,</b> and believing that an enemy was, or soon would be, close at hand. The gurgling {{of the water in}} an eddy; the leap of a fish, or a bit of drift-wood striking {{against the side of the}} pungy, sounded in our ears loud as thunder, and we heard the ordinary night rustlings of the forest as if it was something strange to our ears.|$|E
5|$|The Finnhorse is also well-suited to riding therapy, being {{calm and}} steady, hard-working, obedient, healthy and enduring.

Many Finnhorses have also been trained for driving, and therefore are familiar with <b>unusual</b> <b>noises</b> and can be controlled from behind, and ex-trotters are inexpensive. Many Finns also find {{the appearance of the}} Finnhorse comforting.|$|R
50|$|Following unusually {{heavy rains}} in April 1971, the clay soil bed at Saint-Jean-Vianney became {{saturated}} with water that {{had failed to}} run off, causing pockets of clay to gradually dissolve. Over the few {{weeks leading up to}} the landslide, cracks were reported in some of the town's streets and driveways, some house foundations dropped roughly six to eight inches into the soil, and some <b>unusual</b> <b>noises</b> — including underground thumps and an untraceable sound of running water — were reported.|$|R

60|$|When I {{returned}} to the servants' hall, bad news of my mistress was awaiting me there. The <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> and confusion in the house had reached her ears, {{and she had been}} told what had happened without sufficient caution being exercised in preparing her to hear it. In her weak, nervous state, the shock of the intelligence had quite prostrated her. She had fallen into a swoon, and had been brought back to her senses with the greatest difficulty. As to giving me or anybody else directions what to do under the embarrassing circumstances which had now occurred, she was totally incapable of the effort.|$|E
6000|$|Some other peculiarities may be noted. All persons did {{not always}} hear the noises. It was three weeks before Mr. Wesley heard anything. [...] "John and Kitty Maw, who lived over against us, listened several nights {{in the time of}} the {{disturbance}}, but could never hear anything." [...] Again, [...] "The first time my mother ever heard any <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> at Epworth was long before the disturbance of old Jeffrey [...] . the door and windows jarred very loud, and presently several distinct strokes, three by three, were struck. From that night it never failed to give notice in much the same manner, against any signal misfortune or illness of any belonging to the family," [...] writes Jack.|$|E
6000|$|The {{sun rose}} and warmed the chill air. Hare {{began to notice}} the {{increased}} height and abundance of the sagebrush, which was darker in color. The first cedar-tree, stunted in growth, dead at the top, was the half-way mark up the ascent, so Naab said; {{it was also the}} forerunner of other cedars which increased in number toward the summit. At length Hare, tired of looking upward at the creeping white wagons, closed his eyes. The wheels crunched on the stones; the horses heaved and labored; Naab's [...] "Getup" [...] was the only spoken sound; the sun beamed down warm, then hot; and the hours passed. Some <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> roused Hare out of his lethargy. The wagon was at a standstill. Naab stood on the seat with outstretched arm. George and Dave were close by their mustangs, and Snap Naab, mounted on a cream-colored pinto, reined him under August's arm, and faced the valley below.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are <b>unusual</b> <b>noises,</b> Captain Borroughcliffe, in {{the grounds}} of the abbey, if not in the {{building}} itself," [...] he said advancing with a fine military air from the table to the centre of the room, [...] "and as master of the mansion I will inquire who it is that thus unseasonably disturbs these domains. If as friends, they shall have welcome, though their visit be unexpected; and if enemies, they shall also meet with such a reception as will become an old soldier!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{ruled that}} {{the smell of the}} sty was enough to deprive Aldred of his {{property}} and personal dignity and therefore a violation of his rights and his honor as it was stripped away from him, holding that a man has, [...] "no right to maintain a structure upon his own land, which, by reason of disgusting smells, loud or <b>unusual</b> <b>noises,</b> thick smoke, noxious vapors, the jarring of machinery, or the unwarrantable collection of flies, renders the occupancy of adjoining property dangerous, intolerable, or even uncomfortable to its tenants..." ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins with}} a farmer named Billy Hoss (Rex Linn) and his wife Ethel (Dee Wallace) {{waking up in the}} middle of the night to <b>unusual</b> <b>noises.</b> They and their dog Sparky go outside to investigate, where they find a horse lying dead, violently ripped open. Their dog runs into the dark, and is {{attacked}} (and presumably killed off-screen), causing Billy and Ethel to run back in the house where they see a mysterious giant figure behind their home. Once the creature is gone, they come out again and find large footprints on the ground.|$|R
60|$|Once, perhaps, comes a real fright, {{when all}} their summer's {{practice}} is {{put to the}} test. An <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> is heard; and round the bend glides a bark canoe with sound of human voices. Away go the brood together, the river behind them foaming like {{the wake of a}} tiny steamer as the swift-moving feet lift them almost out of water. Visions of ocean, the guns, falling birds, and the hard winter distract the poor mother. She flutters wildly about the brood, now leading, now bravely facing the monster; now pushing along some weak little loiterer, now floundering near the canoe as if wounded, to attract attention from the young. But they double the point at last, and hide away under the alders. The canoe glides by and makes no effort to find them. Silence is again over the forest. The little brood come back to the shallows, with mother bird fluttering round them to count again and again lest any be missing. The kingfisher comes out of his hole in the bank. The river flows on as before, and peace returns; and over all is the mystic charm of the wilderness and the quiet of a summer day.|$|E
60|$|After having mused a great {{while on}} the course they should take, and beaten their brains in {{considering}} their present circumstances, they resolved, at last while it was dark, to send the old savage (Friday's father) out as a spy, to learn if possible something concerning them, as what they came for, and what they intended to do, and the like. The old man readily undertook it, and stripping himself quite naked, {{as most of the}} savages were, away he went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he had been among them undiscovered, that he found they were two parties, and of two several nations who had war with one another, and had had a great battle in their own country, and that both sides having had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were by mere chance landed in the same island for the devouring their prisoners, and making merry; but this coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their mirth; that they were in a great rage at one another, and were so near, that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; he did not perceive that they had any notion of anybody's being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made an end of telling the story, when they could perceive, by the <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> they made, that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight.|$|E
60|$|When we have {{exhausted}} {{the various}} schools of Art - during which discussion {{the whole body}} have remained profoundly attentive, except when some <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> at the Theatre over the way has induced some gentleman to glance inquiringly towards the window in that direction, behind his next neighbour's back - we burrow for information on such points as the following. Whether there really are any highway robberies in London, or whether some circumstances not convenient to be mentioned by the aggrieved party, usually precede the robberies complained of, under that head, which quite change their character? Certainly the latter, almost always. Whether {{in the case of}} robberies in houses, where servants are necessarily exposed to doubt, innocence under suspicion ever becomes so like guilt in appearance, that a good officer need be cautious how he judges it? Undoubtedly. Nothing is so common or deceptive as such appearances at first. Whether in a place of public amusement, a thief knows an officer, and an officer knows a thief - supposing them, beforehand, strangers to each other - because each recognises in the other, under all disguise, an inattention to what is going on, and a purpose that is not the purpose of being entertained? Yes. That's the way exactly. Whether it is reasonable or ridiculous to trust to the alleged experiences of thieves as narrated by themselves, in prisons, or penitentiaries, or anywhere? In general, nothing more absurd. Lying is their habit and their trade; and they would rather lie - even if they hadn't an interest in it, and didn't want to make themselves agreeable - than tell the truth.|$|E
50|$|The film {{opens with}} a young Romanian woman, Elena, being driven {{to the home of}} her new employers, Danish couple Louise and Kasper. Louise and Kasper are a wealthy couple living in near-isolation in a lakehouse in the forest. Kasper {{explains}} that Elena was hired for some extra help because Louise has been weakened by recent surgery. The couple lives without electricity and lives off the food they grow, as well as eggs from the chicken coop they keep, and the only communication with the outside world is through a simple landline phone. Although Elena hears a few <b>unusual</b> <b>noises</b> at the house, she otherwise fits in easily.|$|R
6000|$|... "The house," [...] he said, [...] "belongs to my friends, the Applebys, who let it, as {{they live}} elsewhere. A quiet couple {{took it and}} lived in it for five years, when the husband died, and the widow went away. They made no {{complaint}} while tenants. The house stood empty for some time, and all I know personally about {{the matter is that}} I, my wife, and the children were in the dining-room one Sunday when we heard <b>unusual</b> <b>noises</b> in the drawing-room overhead. We went through the rooms but could find no cause or explanation of the disturbance, and thought no more about it.|$|R
5000|$|The crew {{consists}} of five members: Captain Lacroix (Pierre Semmler), Lindbergh (Regula Grauwiller), Yoshida (Yangzom Brauen), Prokoff (Claude-Oliver Rudolph), and Vespucci (Michael Finger). Crew members {{spend most of}} the fully automated flight in deep cryosleep while one person stays awake in 8½ month shifts to monitor the ship. Due to the current terrorist threat from the radical Neo-Luddite group [...] ("Machine Strikers"), there is also an additional security guard aboard: Samuel Decker (Martin Rapold). Toward the end of her shift, Portmann hears <b>unusual</b> <b>noises</b> from the cargo bay, and feels as though she is being observed. Her colleagues are awakened, and together the crew sets out to investigate the cold cargo space.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{they went}} on; {{and when they}} were come to By-path Meadow, to the stile over which Christian went with his fellow Hopeful, when they were taken by Giant Despair, and put into Doubting Castle; they sat down and {{consulted}} what was best to be done; to wit, now they were so strong, and had got such a man as Mr. Great-heart for their conductor, whether they had not best to make an attempt upon the Giant, demolish his castle, and, if there were any pilgrims in it, to set them at liberty, before they went any further. So one said one thing, and another said the contrary. One questioned if it were lawful to go upon unconsecrated ground; another said they might, provided their end was good; but Mr. Great-heart said, Though that assertion offered last cannot be universally true, yet I have a commandment to resist sin, to overcome evil, to fight the good fight of faith; and, I pray, with whom should I fight this good fight, if not with Giant Despair? I will, therefore, attempt the taking away of his life, and the demolishing of Doubting Castle. Then said he, Who will go with me? Then said old Honest, I will. And so will we too, said Christiana's four sons, Matthew, Samuel, James, and Joseph; for they were young men and strong (1 John 3:13, 14). So they left the women in the road, and with them Mr. Feeble-mind and Mr. Ready-to-halt with his crutches, to be their guard, until they came back; for in that place though Giant Despair dwelt so near, they keeping in the road, a little child might lead them (Isa. 11:6). So Mr. Great-heart, old Honest, and the four young men, went to go up to Doubting Castle, to look for Giant Despair. When they came at the Castle-gate, they knocked for entrance with an <b>unusual</b> <b>noise.</b> At that the old Giant comes to the gate, and Diffidence, his wife, follows. Then said he, Who, and what is he that is so hardy, as after this manner to molest the Giant Despair? ...|$|E
60|$|After having mused a great {{while on}} the course they should take, they {{resolved}} at last, {{while it was still}} dark, to send the old savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning them, as what they came for, what they intended to do, and the like. The old man readily undertook it; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he had been among them undiscovered, that he found they were two parties, and of two several nations, who had war with one another, and had a great battle in their own country; and that both sides having had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed all on the same island, for the devouring their prisoners and making merry; but their coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their mirth--that they were in a great rage at one another, and were so near that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; but he did not perceive that they had any notion of anybody being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they could perceive, by the <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> they made, that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight. Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen; he told them their safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and the savages would kill one another to their hands, and then the rest would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was so importunate that they must run out and see the battle. However, they used some caution too: they did not go openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where they might securely see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, not be seen by them; but the savages did see them, as we shall find hereafter.|$|E
60|$|The ill-starred {{gentleman who}} had been the unfortunate cause of the <b>unusual</b> <b>noise</b> and {{disturbance}} which alarmed the inhabitants of the Royal Crescent in manner and form already described, after passing a night of great confusion and anxiety, left the roof beneath which his friends still slumbered, bound he knew not whither. The excellent and considerate feelings which prompted Mr. Winkle to take this step can never be too highly appreciated or too warmly extolled. 'If,' reasoned Mr. Winkle with himself--'if this Dowler attempts (as I have no doubt he will) to carry into execution his threat of personal violence against myself, it will be incumbent on me to call him out. He has a wife; that wife is attached to, and dependent on him. Heavens! If I should kill him in the blindness of my wrath, what would be my feelings ever afterwards!' This painful consideration operated so powerfully on the feelings of the humane young man, as to cause his knees to knock together, and his countenance to exhibit alarming manifestations of inward emotion. Impelled by such reflections, he grasped his carpet-bag, and creeping stealthily downstairs, shut the detestable street door with as little noise as possible, and walked off. Bending his steps towards the Royal Hotel, he found a coach on the point of starting for Bristol, and, thinking Bristol as good a place for his purpose as any other he could go to, he mounted the box, and reached his place of destination in such time as the pair of horses, who went the whole stage and back again, twice a day or more, could be reasonably supposed to arrive there. He took up his quarters at the Bush, and designing to postpone any communication by letter with Mr. Pickwick until it was probable that Mr. Dowler's wrath might have in some degree evaporated, walked forth to view the city, which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any place he had ever seen. Having inspected the docks and shipping, and viewed the cathedral, he inquired his way to Clifton, and being directed thither, took the route which was pointed out to him. But as the pavements of Bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth, so its streets are not altogether the straightest or least intricate; and Mr. Winkle, being greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings, looked about him for a decent shop in which he could apply afresh for counsel and instruction.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the train}} crew {{became aware of}} <b>unusual</b> <b>noises</b> and {{movement}} within the train, it was impossible, in the darkness, for them to tell what was amiss. It transpired that {{a portion of the}} left hand rail had broken, derailing the coaches, which had scraped along the platform leaving a trail of debris. The coupling of the second sleeping car finally parted as it passed over the crossover to the siding, colliding with a row of coal wagons. It took the brunt of the impact, losing its roof, much of its body work being shattered, and the floor being driven back into the following coach. The next two coaches were thrown partly over and telescoped together, but the guard's van remained virtually undamaged.|$|R
5000|$|Just before half distance, Schell’s Maserati {{started making}} <b>unusual</b> <b>noises,</b> and {{eventually}} slowed and pitted.

By now Moss’s lead over Collins was 65 seconds, about half-a-lap, with Musso a lap adrift in third. At 3:15pm, the windy dull day, turned worse with pouring rain. Collins started to lost ground rapidly, as his Ferrari’s brakes were being too erratic in the wet conditions, to take any chances. 15 minutes, later Musso trundled slowly towards pits with a punctured rear tyre, dropping the car down to fifth, behind Scott-Brown and Schell. The 30-minute spell of rain, Moss gained another half-a-lap on Collins, giving him a full lap advantage over his countryman.|$|R
