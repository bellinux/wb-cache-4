The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered {{when he and his}} older sister were separated.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study compared selected HIV/STD-related risk variables (sexual behavior, condom use, STD diagnosis, and beliefs) between adults who grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area {{and those who}} grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area. Participants were recruited through an electronic mailing list of a large, internet-based sexual enhancement product company and completed a web-based questionnaire. A sample comprising 123 rural {{men and women and}} 1131 non–rural men and women, ages 18 to 39 years, were analyzed. No significant differences were found for any of the variables between those who grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area compared to those who grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area, although both groups reported HIV/STD risk behaviors. Hence, prevention education efforts appear justified in rural, as well urban area...|$|R

5|$|At the {{university}} Goldstone {{became involved in}} the international effort to end South Africa's apartheid system. He had been brought <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E

5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing {{a sense of}} humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to {{at least a dozen}} lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E

5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees.

On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove {{into the face of}} the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory.
