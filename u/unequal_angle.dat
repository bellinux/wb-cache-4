40|$|Cold-formed steel unequal angles are non-symmetric sections. The design {{procedure}} of non-symmetric sections subjected to axial compression load {{could be quite}} difficult. The <b>unequal</b> <b>angle</b> columns may fail by different buckling modes, such as local, flexural and flexural-torsional buckling as well as interaction of these buckling modes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the behaviour and design of cold-formed steel <b>unequal</b> <b>angle</b> columns. A nonlinear finite element analysis was conducted to investigate the strength and behaviour of <b>unequal</b> <b>angle</b> columns. The measured initial local and overall geometric imperfections as well as the material properties of the angle specimens were included in the finite element model. The finite element analysis was performed on fixed-ended columns for different lengths ranged from stub to long columns. It is demonstrated that the finite element model closely predicted the experimental ultimate loads and the behaviour of cold-formed steel <b>unequal</b> <b>angle</b> columns. Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries. The column strengths obtained from the parametric study were compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification for cold-formed steel structural members. It is shown that the current design rules are generally unconservative for short and intermediate column lengths for the unequal angles. Therefore, design rules of cold-formed steel <b>unequal</b> <b>angle</b> columns are proposed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the accuracy of}} equations specified by the North American and Australasian steel structures codes for determining the net section tension capacity of a cold-formed steel angle brace bolted at one leg. The configurations tested in the laboratory include single equal angle, single <b>unequal</b> <b>angle</b> bolted at the wider leg, single <b>unequal</b> <b>angle</b> bolted at the narrow leg, double angles, and alternate angles. The steel materials used in the experiment are among those with the lowest ductility for which nominal tensile strength is permitted by cold-formed steel design codes to be fully utilized in structural design calculations. Based on a modification to the equation derived for channel braces bolted at the web, a design equation is proposed for determining the net section tension capacity of a cold-formed steel angle brace bolted at one leg. The proposed equation is demonstrated, through laboratory tests on 61 specimens composed of G 450 sheet steel, to be more accurate than the code equations and those existing in the literature.

As a result, cold-formed steel open sections are usually singly-point- or non-symmetric. The most common types of singly-symmetric sections are channel and angle. The research focused on cold-formed steel open sections, such as plain and lipped channels, channels with simple and complex edge stiffeners as well as plain and lipped <b>angles,</b> and <b>unequal</b> <b>angles.</b> In addition, cold-formed steel built-up closed sections with intermediate stiffeners were investigated. Both experimental and numerical investigations into the strength and behaviour of cold-formed steel columns were conducted. The column strengths obtained from these investigations were compared with the design strengths obtained using various international standards for cold-formed steel structures. Furthermore, the behaviour and design of cold-formed steel lipped channel columns at elevated temperatures were also investigated.

40|$|Steel angles {{are widely}} used in roof trusses as web and chord members and in lattice towers. Very often angle members are {{connected}} eccentrically. As a result, not only an angle member is under an axial force, {{but it is also}} subject to a pair of end eccentric moments. Moreover, the connection at each end provides some fixity so neither pinned nor the fixed end represents the reality. Many national design codes allow for the effects due to eccentricities by modifying the slenderness ratio and reducing the compressive strength of the member. However, in practice, {{it is difficult to determine}} accurately the effective length. The concept behind this method is inconsistent with strength design of members of other cross-sectional types such as I or box sections of which the buckling strength is controlled by the Perry constant or the initial imperfection parameters. This paper proposes a method for design of angle frames and trusses by the second-order analysis. The equivalent initial imperfection-to-length ratios for equal and <b>unequal</b> <b>angles</b> to compensate the negligence of initial curvatures, load eccentricities and residual stresses are determined in this paper.

The results indicate that at ambient condition, there are equal bond lengths and three <b>unequal</b> bond <b>angles</b> {{in the structure of}} chiral tubes. The bond length depends much more on the chirality and very slightly on the tube radius. Length of the tubes does not play very significant role on bond length and bond angles. These C-C bonds were recalculated under hydrostatic pressure. The bond length compresses with pressure while the bond angles remain practically unchanged. We also carry out analysis regarding the cross sectional shape of chiral tubes and its pressure dependence. It is found that at some pressures, transition from circular to oval cross section takes place. The transition pressure is found to strongly depend on the radius and chirality of tube. At this transition, corresponding to given elliptical cross section, the bond length for all chiral tubes is identical. This behavior of bond length is different from achiral tubes.

40|$|Observing the {{relative}} state of two space vehicles {{has been an}} active field of research since the earliest attempts at space rendezvous and docking during the 1960 's. Several techniques have successfully been employed by several space agencies {{and the importance of}} these systems has been repeatedly demonstrated during the on-orbit assembly and continuous re-supply of the International Space Station. More recent efforts are focused on technologies that can enable fully automated navigation and control of space vehicles. Technologies which have previously been investigated or are actively researched include Video Guidance Systems (VGS), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), RADAR, Differential GPS (DGPS) and Visual Navigation Systems. The proposed system leverages the theoretical foundation which has been advanced in the development of VisNav, invented at Texas A & M University, and the miniaturized commercially available Northstar sensor from Evolution Robotics. The dissertation first surveys contemporary technology, followed by an analytical investigation of the coarse sun sensor and errors associated with utilizing it in the near-field. Next, the commercial Northstar sensor is investigated, utilizing fundamentals to generate a theoretical model of its behavior, followed by the development of an experiment for the purpose of investigating and characterizing the sensor's performance. Experimental results are then presented and compared with a numerical simulation of a single-sensor system performance. A case study evaluating a two sensor implementation is presented evaluating the proposed system's performance in a multisensor configuration. The initial theoretical analysis relied on use of the cosine model, which proved inadequate in fully capturing the response of the coarse sun sensor.

The geometric parameters of equal scarf angles, adhesive thickness, and <b>unequal</b> scarf <b>angles,</b> and the laminate parameter of similar laminate configurations of both adherends of [+/-[theta]₂/ 0 ₂]S, [[theta]/ 0 = 0]₂S, and homogenized [[theta]₂/ 0 ₂]S (equivalently homogeneously orthotropic) were explored for values of [theta] of 45 ° and 15 °. The ply regions of the laminates were modeled as transversely isotropic T 700 / 2510 carbon/epoxy composite material, and the adhesive region as isotropic FM 300 - 2 K polymer film adhesive. Linear elastic plane strain analyses were performed via finite element modeling. The {{results indicate that the}} overall mechanical response of two-dimensional composite scarf joints in the joint region is influenced by the global/macroscopic joint features of 'effective' through-thickness stiffness properties of the configuration in the joint region, and equilibrium considerations along the bondline, and by the local joint features manifested at the tips of the adherends at the ends of the joint region and through ply-by-ply level mismatch in stiffness properties within the adherend. The global peaks in the magnitudes of strains occur in the adhesive, and the distributions of strains in the adhesive essentially reflect the distributions of strains along the bondline in the adherend. The distributions of strains in the adherend along the bondline reflect the distribution of stiffness properties of the adherend through the thickness, and are governed by the local effects of mismatch in stiffness properties between the [theta] and 0 ° plies along with the lengthscale of the effective ply thickness. Sharp changes in the magnitudes of strains occur near the acute and obtuse tips of the adherend, and these are related to the overall length-scales of the configuration and show similar aspects to those occurring in laminated structures with ply drop-offs. The magnitudes of strains show the greatest sensitivity to variations in the scarf angle of the configuration, increasing with increasing values of scarf angle and associated changes in bondline length, but show little sensitivity to variations in the adhesive thickness of the configuration. For the asymmetric configurations of <b>unequal</b> scarf <b>angles,</b> the response characteristics exhibit combined effects of variations in scarf angles and adhesive thickness, and exhibit signicant asymmetry in the cross-sectional distribution of far-field longitudinal strain.

The latest progresses have addressed the major issues hampering the cross-scale developments of structural applications, such as cost-ineffective fabrication, limited area, low efficiency and challenging integration. The studies carried out on high-resolution and large-area laser interference nanomanufacturing technology will complement the exploration of modern optical devices and extraordinary functional applications. With respect to classical interference theory and relevant references, {{there is still a}} lack of studies providing insight into the effects of polarisation on the multi-beam interference while it is found that the polarisation vector {{plays a key role in}} the formation, period and contrast of interfering patterns. Herein, the theory of multi-beam interference is developed through the integration of the polarisation vector and electric field vector.

Foals appear to be born with symmetrical paired feet which by maturity are frequently <b>unequal</b> in <b>angle</b> and width. They stand within minutes of birth subjecting the hoof wall to loading. Hoof growth rate and hoof compression may be factors affecting hoof shape. The effect of conformation changes during maturation upon loading and differential hoof growth was unknown. The aims were to; quantify and evaluate the epidermal structure, hoof growth rate, hoof renewal, dorsal hoof wall angle, plastic hoof compression, and hoof loading, during paediatric development. Hoof growth rate, renewal, and hoof angle were recorded in foals (n= 80) and weanlings/yearlings (n= 12) and the hoof wall structure of histological samples of fetuses and paediatric foals (n= 15) was determined. Solar loading, hoof growth, and hoof angle was recorded in healthy foals (n= 18) and compared to a group with acquired flexural deformity (n= 9). Horn tubule size and number increased significantly, and density decreased significantly during maturation. The dorsal hoof wall angle declined with age. Hoof renewal in newborn foals was 145 ± 15 days whereas weaning/yearlings were 283 ± 26 days. A relationship between plastic hoof compression and time was found (r = 0. 46, P = 0. 002). Hoof compression in foals was 0. 039 ± 0. 022 mm per day and in weanling/yearlings 0. 03 ± 0. 016 mm per day.

40|$|The {{operation}} of the LHCb spectrometer dipole has a considerably larger and more challenging impact on the geometry of the LHC beams than the magnets in the high luminosity regions [1]. The integrated dipole field of 4 Tm deflects the beams in the horizontal plane, and using a set of three dipole magnets, called "compensators" a closed horizontal orbit bump is created. This paper summarizes the basic layout of the beam geometry in IR 8 {{under the influence of}} the LHCb dipole and its compensators and shows the theoretically expected beam orbits, envelopes and aperture needs in the originally designed version. LHCb operation with both field polarities leads to <b>unequal</b> net crossing <b>angles</b> between the two beams and affects the experiment acceptance. It had been proposed therefore to establish a LHC operation mode where the originally designed horizontal crossing angle is shifted at high energy into the vertical plane leading to a vertical crossing scheme at luminosity operation. The new scheme has been successfully implemented in the LHC operation in 2012 together with the so-called diagonal luminosity leveling procedure [2]. In view of the future 25 ns bunch spacing for LHC operation after the long shut down LS 1 however, the present injection scheme of LHC in IR 8 will have to be modified. A vertical crossing angle at injection therefore is proposed to avoid parasitic bunch crossings during injection and acceleration mode to overcome the problem. In this case additional aperture is required in the vertical direction. Accordingly this scenario relies either on small beam emittances and orbit tolerances or on a rotated beams screen inside the IR 8 triplet magnets, if the LHCb dipole magnet cannot be ramped down for beam injection...|$|R

The design parameters are based on geometricproperties such as length, width, angle or position of the heat sources. The heatsources were parameterized by combining two smooth exponential functions thatexplicitly depended on the position and size of the heat source. The problem wasthen solved as a PDE constrained optimization problem using MATLAB's built infunction fmincon. Three different 1 D test cases were implemented to investigate how the solverbehaved and that the parameterization was correctly implemented. Then the solverwas extended to 2 D and three heat sources were placed in the domain. The optimalangle of rotation of the sources where the heat transfer was governed by conductionand convection were found. This was followed by an optimal placement of two heatsources in the domain. Three cases with a different convective field in each case wereinvestigated. In the last examples, four heat sources were placed inside the domain. One geometric property of each heat source was allowed to change. The fourdifferent parameters were length, width, angle of rotation and position.
