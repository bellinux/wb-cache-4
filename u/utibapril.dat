40|$|<b>Utibapril</b> is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibitor}} with {{a proposed}} tissue-specific inhibitory profile. This implies {{that at a}} certain dose, <b>utibapril</b> {{should be able to}} inhibit tissue ACE activity without affecting plasma ACE. Moreover, if tissue ACE activity is rate limiting, functional conversion of angiotensin I should be decreased. Accordingly, we studied the dose-dependent effect of long-term treatment with <b>utibapril</b> on plasma and tissue ACE. Normal Wistar rats were randomly allocated to oral treatment with different doses of <b>utibapril</b> (0, 2, 10, 50, or 250 micrograms/kg/day) for 30 days. Tissue inhibition of ACE was assessed biochemically, whereas functional conversion of angiotensin I was determined in the isolated organ. <b>Utibapril</b> significantly inhibited plasma, renal, and vascular ACE but not ventricular ACE activity. Notably, however, only treatment with the highest dose of <b>utibapril</b> resulted in a significant inhibition of plasma ACE, whereas vascular ACE activity was already significantly inhibited after treatment with a lower dose of <b>utibapril.</b> In accordance, <b>utibapril</b> dose-dependently inhibited the contraction of isolated aortic rings to angiotensin I. Furthermore, angiotensin I-induced decreases in coronary flow in the isolated heart were significantly inhibited after treatment with the higher doses of <b>utibapril.</b> These data suggest the preferential inhibition of vascular ACE by <b>utibapril</b> in normal rats. Furthermore, the dose-dependent inhibition of the functional conversion of angiotensin I indicates that the tissue ACE activity may be rate limiting in vascular beds in rat...|$|E
