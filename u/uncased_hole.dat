40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is devoted to}} the study of the distribution and geochemistry of contaminated subsurface waters, beneath the site of temporary storage of liquid radioactive waste known as Lake Karachai. For this purpose a method of hydrogeochemical logging (HGCL) together with standard hydrogeochemical and geophysical methods of <b>uncased</b> <b>hole</b> logging were used. The distribution of sodium nitrate brine plumes in the subsurface was determined by the physical and physico-chemical properties of these brines and by the petrochemical composition of enclosing rocks and the structural setting of the flow paths. The latter is represented by fractures and large faults in the bedrock of volcanogenic and volcanogenic-sedimentary rocks of intermediate-to-basic composition. The volcanogenic rocks are overlain in some places by a thin cover of unconsolidated sediments, i. e., by loams and relatively impermeable silts. Contaminated waters flow-in accordance with the eluvium bottom relief towards local areas of natural (Mishelyak and Techa rivers) and artificial (Novogomenskii water intake) discharge of subsurface waters. The large Mishelyak fault, southwest of Lake Karachai and under fluvial sediments of the Mishelyak, is assumed to significantly influence the flow pattern of contaminated waters, diverting them from an intake of drinking water...|$|E
50|$|With {{government}} and EU support {{the expertise of}} the scientists and engineers at Rosemanowes was used to support the European HDR project at Soultz-sous-ForÃªts {{and a number of}} commercial contracts ensued exploiting HDR techniques, such as microseismic monitoring, in the oil and gas industry. Rosemanowes Quarry and the assets of CSMA, including intellectual property, were acquired by Asea Brown Boveri in 1997. In 2004 Schlumberger acquired the intellectual property and some of the staff most closely associated with microseismic monitoring and the quarry was sold off.In 2006, the site was acquired by 3K Facilities. The company now offers deep borehole test facilities in one of the best-logged sites in the world. All the deep boreholes are now available to hire for a range of down hole testing. There are three deep boreholes (2350m, 2180m, 2800m), four <b>uncased</b> 300m <b>holes</b> and one 150m hole inclined at 30degrees, as well as micro seismic testing and a wind turbine test environment on this 20 acre site.|$|R
40|$|CSIRO 2008 There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of studies examining the spatial and temporal patterns in species richness, community structure and population dynamics of groundwater organisms. These studies have raised the issue of uncertainty about the comparability of different sampling methods, and questions of whether sampling bias may exist. Recently, a diverse subterranean fauna was discovered in calcrete (carbonate) aquifers of the Yilgarn Region of central Western Australia. Little is known about the community structure and population dynamics in these aquifers. One important issue is whether current sampling methods adequately sample the species richness and abundance of the fauna to allow for comparative studies. Here we investigate the effectiveness of three sampling methods: haul net sampling, pumping with a 12 -V impeller pump, and a discrete interval sampler. The methods were trialled over 16 months with > 250 samples taken from 55 <b>uncased</b> bore <b>holes.</b> No significant taxonomic bias was detected across the sampling methods. However, sampling using a haul net was found to be the most efficient method for capturing the available taxa per unit time when sampling bores are less than 10 m deep, with pumping being the least efficient. These results are discussed in relation to the problems of studying stygofauna in Western Australian calcrete aquifers, and of groundwater faunas more generally. Adam Allford, Steven J. B. Cooper, William F. Humphreys and Andrew D. Austi...|$|R
30|$|Mougel et al. {{proposed}} that the information is conveyed {{by one or more}} different rotational angle codes. In the drilling, a discontinuous angular displacement is detected by an underground gyroscope and the command is solved in the microprocessor. The intermittent command codes are generated by successive rotations of the drill rod at different angular velocities, which are also detected by the gyroscope and transmitted to the microprocessor for decoding. The decoded command is then sent to the control tool by the microprocessor to complete the delivery of the command [1]. In 2001, Schlumberger invented two kinds of signal transmission methods; one is the drill rod to rotate the command code generated by the continuous different angular speed and the detection of underground rotary instrument. The downlink command transmission system decodes in the microcomputer. The other is the use of underground rotary tool-sensitive drill pipe rotation angular velocity to generate the command code. In the microcomputer, the system decodes and sends the decoded command to control the underground equipment. The invention provided a comparatively economical transmission system, which avoided costly devices, and its downward transmission system was relatively complete. The system had an error detection function and the fault detection system was not affected by formation factors. In the reference [2], it was proposed by using inclinometer and three-axis magnetometer to monitor the rotation angle of drill pipe rotation rate, through the underground equipment to deal with inclinometer and three-axis magnetometer output command code. The magnetometer output in this method is affected by formation parameters and can only be used in <b>uncased</b> <b>hole.</b> These inventions provided a downstream command transmission method without a mud circulation system.|$|E
40|$|Hole UE- 25 h No. 1 was core drilled during December 1982 and January 1983 within several {{degrees of}} due west, 400 ft {{horizontally}} into the southeast slope of Fran Ridge {{at an altitude}} of 3409 ft. The purpose of the hole was to obtain data pertinent for radionuclide transport studies in the Topopah Spring Member of the Paintbrush Tuff. This unit had been selected previously as the host rock for the potential underground nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, adjacent to the southwestern part of the Nevada Test Site. The hole was core drilled first with air, then with air mist, and finally with air, soap, and water. Many problems were encountered, including sloughing of tuff into the <b>uncased</b> <b>hole,</b> vibration of the drill rods, high rates of bit wear, and lost circulation of drilling fluids. On the basis of experience gained in drilling this hole, ways to improve horizontal coring with air are suggested in this report. All of the recovered core, except those pieces that were wrapped and waxed, were examined for lithophysal content, for fractures, and for fracture-fill mineralization. The results of this examination are given in this report. Core recovery greater than 80 % at between 209 and 388 ft permitted a fracture frequency analysis. The results are similar to the fracture frequencies observed in densely welded nonlithophysal tuff from holes USW GU- 3 and USW G- 4. The fractures in core from UE- 25 h No. 1 were found to be smooth and nonmineralized or coated with calcite, silica, or manganese oxide. Open fractures with caliche (porous, nonsparry calcite) were not observed beyond 83. 5 ft, which corresponds to an overburden depth of 30 ft...|$|E
