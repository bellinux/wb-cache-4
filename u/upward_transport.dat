Transport of Al through EcM hyphae was studied in vitro in a two-compartment Petri dish system. Two of the five fungal isolates tested transported Al.

We conclude that at least some EcM fungi transport Al and that Ga, and probably also Al, can be transported upwards by EcM fungal hyphae in a podzol system.

40|$|The budget {{equation}} of the zonally averaged angular momentum is analyzed by introducing belts of 1000 -km width {{to cover the}} meridional plane from pole to pole up to an altitude of 28 km. Using ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) data the fluxes of angular momentum are evaluated {{as well as the}} mountain and friction torques per belt. Generalized streamfunctions and velocity potentials are introduced to better depict the fluxes related to the angular momentum transferred at the ground during an event of mountain or friction torque. The variance of the total flux divergence per belt is one order of magnitude larger than those of the torques. All variances peak at midlatitudes. As a rule, the structure of the generalized streamfunctions changes little during an event; that is, the structure of the nondivergent part of the fluxes is stable. That of the divergent part, as represented by the velocity potential, undergoes a rapid change near the peak of a torque event. Positive friction torque events in midlatitude belts are preceded by a divergence of angular momentum fluxes in that belt, which is linked to the anticyclonic mass circulation needed to induce the positive torque. The divergence in the belt breaks down shortly before the torque is strongest. Angular momentum is <b>transported</b> <b>upward</b> from the ground after that.

40|$|The {{tropical}} tropopause {{is considered to}} be the main region of <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of tropospheric air carrying water vapor and other tracers to the tropical stratosphere. The lower tropical stratosphere is also the region where the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the zonal wind is observed. The QBO is positioned in the region where the <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of tropospheric tracers to the ovenworld takes place. Hence the QBO can in principle modulate these transports by its secondary meridional circulation. This modulation is investigated in this study by an analysis of general circulation model (GCM) experiments with an assimilated QBO, The experiments show, first, that the temperature signal of the QBO modifies the specific humidity in the air transported upward and, second, that the secondary meridional circulation modulates the velocity of the <b>upward</b> <b>transport.</b> Thus during the eastward phase of the QBO the upward moving air is moister and the upward velocity is less than during the westward phase of the QBO. It was further found that the QBO period is too short to allow an equilibration of the moisture in the QBO region. This causes a QBO signal of the moisture which is considerably smaller than what could be obtained in the limiting case of indefinitely long QBO phases. This also allows a high sensitivity of the mean moisture over a QBO cycle to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena or major tropical volcanic eruptions. The interplay of sporadic volcanic eruptions, ENSO, and QBO can produce low-frequency variability in the water vapor content of the tropical stratosphere, which renders the isolation of the QBO signal in observational data of water vapor in the equatorial lower stratosphere difficult...|$|E

40|$|The {{modulation}} {{of tropical}} cyclogenesis over the southern South China Sea (SSCS) by the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is examined in October-December (OND), when tropical cyclone (TC) activities are most active in this region. The results reveal {{that there were}} more TCs formed over the SSCS during La Nia years and less TCs during El Nio years. How different environmental factors (including low-level vorticity, mid-level relative humidity, vertical wind shear, and potential intensity) contribute to this influence is investigated, using a genesis potential (GP) index developed by Emanuel and Nolan. Composite anomalies of the GP index are produced for El Nio and La Nia years separately, which could account for the changes of TC frequency over the SSCS in different ENSO phases. The degree of contribution by each factor is determined quantitatively by producing composites of modified indices in which only one of the contributing factors varies, with the others set to climatology. The results show that the mid-level relative humidity makes the largest contribution to the ENSO modulation of tropical cyclogenesis over the SSCS. Although warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and larger amount of evaporation from the ocean surface were observed over the SSCS during El Nio years, anomalous descending motions due to the anomalous Walker circulations inhibited the <b>upward</b> <b>transports</b> of water vapor and led to less moisture contents in the middle troposphere, which suppressed TC formations...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} role of sea ice {{freshwater}} and salt fluxes in modulating 21 st century surface warming in the Southern Ocean via analysis of sensitivity experiments in the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM 3). In particular, we investigate whether a change in these fluxes can cause surface cooling in the Southern Ocean, expand sea ice, and increase deep oceanic storage of heat. Our results indicate that {{in response to the}} doubling of CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere in CCSM 3, net freshwater input from sea ice to the ocean increases south of 58 °S (owing to less growth) and decreases from 48 - 58 °S (owing to less melt). The freshwater source from changing precipitation in the model is considerably less than from sea ice south of 58 °S, but serves to compensate for the reduction in sea ice melt near the ice edge, leaving almost no net freshwater flux change between about 48 - 58 °S. As a result, freshwater input principally from sea ice reduces ocean convection, which in turns reduces entrainment of heat into the mixed layer and reduces <b>upward</b> heat <b>transport</b> along isopycnals below about 1000 m. The reduced <b>upward</b> heat <b>transport</b> (from all sources) causes deep ocean heating south of 60 °S and below 500 m depth, with a corresponding surface cooling in large parts of the Southern Ocean in the model. These results indicate that changing sea ice freshwater and salt fluxes are a major component of the 21 st century delay in surface warming of the Southern Ocean and weak reduction in Antarctic sea ice in model projections. ...|$|R
40|$|The subarctic North Pacific is one {{of three}} major high nitrate, low {{chlorophyll}} (HNLC) oceanic regions, along with the Southern Ocean and the eastern equatorial Pacific. In these regions, uptake of nitrogen by phytoplankton is widely thought to be regulated by the availability of dissolved iron. The supply of dissolved iron is twofold: via atmospheric deposition of dust and via <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of dissolved iron from the ocean interior to the surface euphotic layer. In the subarctic North Pacific, atmospheric deposition has been considered to be the dominant source, despite little compelling evidence. The subarctic NE Pacific Ocean, in the vicinity of Ocean Station P (OSP), contrasts with the subarctic NW Pacific, because the strong permanent halocline between 100 and 150 m depth in the NE Pacific resists winter mixing deeper than ~ 120 m and reduces the diffusive <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of dissolved nutrients from below the permanent halocline.

We consider two observed forms of <b>upward</b> <b>transport,</b> the PSSR and upwelling growth, and their sources. In addition to the pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) of dayside E, {{which is responsible for}} PSSR, we consider a role played by a polarization E, which accompanies an upwelling in the bottomside of equatorial F layer. The notion that this polarization E should be additive to the PRE E is not new (Tsunoda, 2005; Tsunoda and Ecklund, 2007); what is new and unexpected is our finding that the polarization E can not only be strong, that is, comparable to what we consider to be a strong PRE, but this can also occur when the PRE E is actually weak! (see “Case Study: 27 March 2006 ” section) Deeply modulated upwellings have been observed before [e.g., Tsunoda (2015)], but they apparently have not been commonplace enough to warrant immediate consideration regarding whether upwelling growth competes with the PSSR for control of <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> and EPB development.|$|E

Five neutral surfaces are mapped, encompassing the AAIW from 700 to 1100 db at the subtropical latitudes. Coherent and significant dianeutral upwelling is found in the western boundary near the Brazil coast north of the separation point (about 25 °S) between the anticyclonic subtropical and cyclonic south equatorial gyres. The magnitude of dianeutral upwelling transport is 10 - 3 Sv (1 Sv= 106 m 3 s- 1) for 1 °× 1 ° square area. It is found that the AAIW sources from the southwestern South Atlantic and southwestern Indian Ocean do not rise significantly into the Benguela Current. Instead, they contribute to the NADW return formation by dianeutral upwelling into the South Equatorial Current. In other words, the AAIW sources cannot obtain enough heat/buoyancy to rise until they return to the western boundary region but north of the separation point. The basin-wide integration of dianeutral <b>transport</b> shows net <b>upward</b> <b>transports,</b> ranging from 0. 25 to 0. 6 Sv, across the lower and upper boundary of AAIW north of 40 °S.

In this paper, the structure and development of unbalanced forces and flows in hurricanes are examined, through the analyses of the radial momentum and absolute angular momentum (AAM) budgets, using a high-resolution (i. e., Dx 5 6 km), fully explicit simulation of Hurricane Andrew (1992). It is found from the radial momentum budgets that supergradient flows and accelerations, even after temporal and azimuthal averaging, are well organized {{from the bottom of}} the eye center to the upper outflow layer in the eyewall. The agradient accelerations are on average twice greater than the local Coriolis force, and caused mainly by the excess of the centrifugal force over the pressure gradient force. It is shown by the AAM budgets that supergradient flows could occur not only in the inflow region as a result of the inward AAM transport, but also in the outflow region through the <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of AAM.

The model with the new numerics has been testet against the standard scheme in a one-column (1 D) and a 3 D climate model. We conclude from the 1 D results that for certain initial conditions the standard scheme may keep or even increase maxima in tracer concentration profiles in convective situations. The standard scheme is not able to smooth out maxima and minima in each case. All shortcomings are eliminated when the new numerical formulation is used. From the 3 D results we see typical difference patterns corresponding to the prescribed tracer source.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Simulations of tropical-tropopause-layer (TTL) cirrus {{under the}} {{influence}} of a large-scale equatorial Kelvin wave have been performed in two dimensions. These simulations show that, even {{under the influence}} of the large-scale wave, radiatively induced dynamics in TTL cirrus plays an important role in the transport of water vapor in the vertical direction. In a typical TTL cirrus, the heating that results from absorption of radiation by ice crystals induces a mesoscale circulation. Advection of ice and water vapor by the radiatively induced circulation leads to the persistence of the cloud and upward advection of the cloudy air. Upward advection of the cloudy air is equivalent to <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of water vapor when the air above the cloud is drier than the cloudy air, and downward transport otherwise. In TTL cirrus, microphysical processes also contribute to transport of water vapor in the vertical direction. Ice nucleation and growth, followed by sedimentation and sublimation, always lead to downward transport of water vapor. The magnitude of the downward transport by microphysical processes increases with the relative humidity of the air surrounding the cloud. Moisture in the surrounding environment is important because there is continuous interactions between the cloudy and environmental air throughout the cloud boundary. In our simulations, when the air surrounding the cloud is subsaturated, hence drier than the cloudy air, the magnitude of the downward transport due to microphysical processes is smaller than that of the <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> due to the radiatively induced advection of water vapor. The net result is <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of water vapor, and equivalently hydration of the lower stratosphere. On the other hand, when the surrounding air is supersaturated, hence moister than the cloudy air, microphysical and radiatively induced dynamical processes work in concert to induce downward transport of water vapor, that is dehydration of the lower stratosphere. TTL cirrus processes also depend sensitively on the deposition coefficient of water vapor on ice crystals. The deposition coefficient determines the depositional growth rate of ice crystals, hence microphysical and radiative properties of the cloud. In our simulations, larger values of the deposition coefficient correspond to less ice crystals nucleated during homogeneous freezing, larger ice crystal sizes, faster ice sedimentation, smaller radiative heating rate and weaker dynamics. These results indicate that detailed observations of the relative humidity in the vicinity of TTL cirrus and accurate laboratory measurements of the deposition coefficient are necessary to quantify the impact of TTL cirrus in the dehydration of the stratosphere. This research highlights the complex role of microphysical, radiative and dynamical processes in the transport of water vapor within TTL cirrus. It shows that under certain realistic conditions, TTL cirrus may lead to <b>upward</b> <b>transport</b> of water vapor, which results in moistening of the lower stratosphere.
