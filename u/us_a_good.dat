25|$|The ancient Greek {{custom of}} placing terra cotta miniatures of their {{furniture}} in children's graves gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea of its style and design. The Greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches {{were used for}} banquets. The tables, high for normal meals and low for banquets, were initially rectangular in shape. By the 4th century BC, the usual table was round, often with animal-shaped legs (for example lion's paws). Loaves of flat bread {{could be used as}} plates, but terra cotta bowls were more common.|$|E

India, Indonesia and China conducted three high level exercises including anti-hijack exercise. PLAN official who visited the ship mentioned that [...] "The Indian ship {{is a very strong}} ship with powerful weapons," [...] and [...] "This gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> opportunity to see the Indian Navy". INS Shivalik sailed [...] from Port Blair to Qingdao, without being assisted by any support vessel and without official from headquarters, showcasing the confidence of the crew and the autonomy they enjoy. PLAN and Indian Navy decided to further deepen the Naval bond between the two nations.|$|E
2500|$|This {{approach}} {{does not}} come with any acceleration method such as spectral shifts and deflation as in QR algorithm. It is because the shift method is not easily defined without using similarity transformation. [...] But it is very simple to implement where the speed does not matter. Also it give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> interpretation that only orthogonal/unitary transformations can obtain SVD as the QR algorithm can calculate the eigenvalue decomposition.|$|E

2500|$|Heinrich Isaac's career spanned {{well over}} thirty years and allowed him to travel far from his {{homeland}} of Flanders into Germany, Italy, and Austria, {{as well as other}} parts of central Europe. [...] While the absence of plentiful primary sources makes it hard for us to map out Isaac's life, piecing together the sources we do have along with the works he wrote gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> picture of just how popular this Franco-Flemish composer was in his time. [...] Isaac was probably writing music by the 1470s, and the first document mentioning his name dates back to 15 September 1484, placing him in Innsbruck as a singer for Duke Sigismund of Austria, of the House of Habsburg. [...] The following year Isaac migrated to Florence, since documents show that by July 1485 Isaac had become employed as a singer at the church Santa Maria del Fiore. [...] By the middle of 1491, he was designated as a singer at Santissima Annunziata, a position that he held until 1493.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basic concept}} of Pyst {{was to show}} what Myst Island (from the best-selling game) would look like after four million people (players) had visited and [...] "explored". [...] Pyst {{developer}} and comedian Peter Bergman wanted to give Myst players the ability to [...] "'experience the island {{in a whole new}} light". Palladium President Ed Bernstein wanted the game to be a [...] "transformative work that moved way beyond Myst", in order to avoid copyright issues with Myst publisher Broderbund on the grounds of being a parody work. However, a spokesman from Broderbund said the company was unfazed with the project, commenting [...] "We've seen imitators and they usually just give <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chuckle". Bergman discovered that the sense of comic timing he had become accustomed to in his live shows couldn't be replicated in the digital realm, and had to adapt accordingly. Firezine said that the game was illustratory of Bergman's ability to [...] "survey America's culture and obsessions like a maniacal monitor reflecting the absurdness of it all, while casting his iconoclastic eye to read the entrails of the present coarse [...] and our delirious future".|$|E

2500|$|The Daily Mail ran {{the story}} again on 20/October, {{comparing}} Haringey council to Nazi Germany. [...] Again, the council attempted {{to set the}} record straight, with a press statement that noted the irony of the Daily Mail comparing the council to Nazi Germany when the Mail itself had supported Hitler right up until the eve of World War II. [...] And again, only the British black community newspapers (the 3 November Asian Herald and the 5 November West Indian News) carried Haringey council's corrections. [...] The story continued to be carried by many newspapers for months thereafter, including The Economist on 1 November and the Islington Gazette on 20 February 1987, this time with Islington council as the ban-issuer, a fact that was explicitly denied by a council spokesman in the piece, who said [...] "it is not council policy to ban Baa Baa Black Sheep but if individual nursery workers find it offensive the council is {{not in the business of}} forcing them to teach that rhyme rather than others." [...] The Daily Express carried the new Islington variant on the same day ("School bars boy's Baa-baa Black Sheep 'racist' rhyme"), as did the Daily Telegraph ("Boy's first rhyme upsets nursery staff"), the Daily Mirror ("Baa Baa blacked"), and the Sun ("Baa Baa nursery ban on sad little Dan"), whose lead article the next day then began with [...] "Loony left councils have given <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> laugh over the years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1895, Grand Duke Paul {{began an}} affair with a married woman, Olga Valerianova Pistolkors. He was able to obtain a divorce for her and he {{eventually}} married Olga in 1902, while the couple was staying abroad. As they had married defying Nicholas II’s opposition, the Tsar forbade them to return to Russia. Left fatherless, twelve-year-old Maria and eleven-year-old Dmitri moved to Moscow placed under the custody of their uncle Grand Duke Sergei and his wife, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, a sister of the Tsarina Alexandra. Maria and Dimitri resented their aunt and uncle, blaming them for the forced separation from their real father, who had abandoned them. Grand Duke Sergei was strict and demanding, but devoted and affectionate towards the children. Marie wrote in her memoirs: [...] "In his fashion he loved us deeply. He liked to have us near him, and gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of his time. But he was always jealous of us. If he had known the full extent of our devotion to our father it would have maddened him." [...] Maria Pavlvona also commented that she could not entirely disagree with those who thought Grand Duke Sergei heartless, self-centered and cruel. Maria had a somewhat strained relationship with her aunt. Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna found difficult to relate to the children and was cold and distant towards them. The teenage Maria was described by her maternal aunt, Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia, as [...] "full of life and very jolly, but inclined to be self-willed and selfish, and rather difficult to deal with." ...|$|E
2500|$|The reredos {{has five}} tiers of figures {{and at the}} bottom some marble reliefs by Westmacott. [...] In the immaculately kept New College Archives {{are a series of}} sepia {{photographs}} of Hitch’s figures taken before they were sent from his workshop near Vauxhall to Oxford and in the archive's record 3140 are letters dated between 1883 and 1892 relating to the reredos and these include several letters written by Hitch himself. Some of these letters show the lengths to which Hitch went to ensure that his statues were true to life. In the instance of the statue of William of Wykeham we read how a mask was made of the Winchester effigy of William of Wykeham and then sent to Hitch so that he could be sure that he achieved an accurate likeness. In looking at the relationship between architect/designer and sculptor one is sometimes struck by {{the way in which the}} architect/designer received credit for a particular work with the sculptor very often getting little or no mention and one letter written by Hitch shows that this did matter to him. [...] In this letter he thanks the addressee for sending him a newspaper cutting, one assumes about the reredos, and notes [...] "They name the architect I notice but not the sculptor." [...] We also learn from these letters of the great care taken in the detail of each of the individual statues. [...] "St Peter carries the keys", [...] "James Minor a club" [...] and [...] "Simon a saw" [...] etc. etc. [...] A photograph of the complete reredos is shown below, another shows some of Hitch's carvings and a close-up of the statue of Moses complete with tablet and horns gives <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea of Hitch's ability as a mason.|$|E
