25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, actor Raj Kapoor had {{commenced}} {{the filming of}} Sangam with Vyjayanthimala playing the female lead along with Rajendra Kumar and Kapoor himself as male lead. The filming took four years to finish. During this time Vyjayanthimala {{is said to have}} been romantically involved with Kapoor and almost married him. Initially, she was vexed with him and kept him at a distance. However Kapoor did not give <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> attitude. This incident had made Kapoor's wife Krishna move out of her husband’s house with their children. They checked into Natraj Hotel in Mumbai and stayed there for four and a half months as Krishna was disgusted with the affair. However, Vyjayanthimala in her autobiography mentioned that it was a publicity stunt by newspapers in North India to link her with Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar and that she was never in any relationship with her co-stars.|$|E
500|$|Among the deleted {{scenes in}} the producer's cut were a scene of Tom and Lucy running off to Ann's house to have sex, where they are {{interrupted}} by a nonchalant and seemingly unfazed Chris Traeger. Another cut scene included Tom and Ann {{in which the two}} share a pleasant moment and Tom cheers her <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> conflicting romantic feelings, only for Tom to ruin it by proposing three-way sex between them and Lucy. The DVD also included a commentary track for [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] featuring Amy Poehler, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Rashida Jones, Adam Scott, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Jim O'Heir, Retta and Michael Schur.|$|E
500|$|In October 1918, she {{was sold}} to the Belgian firm of Lloyd Royal Belge (LRB) and {{converted}} to a freighter under the name Péruvier by Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde. A conventional bow was built <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> pseudo-ram and the space was used to accommodate her crew. The two outboard engines, their associated boilers and propeller shafts were removed as were the two forward funnels. The ship's side and deck armour was removed wherever it did not compromise structural strength. Péruvier was delivered in December 1919 and she began her first voyage carrying [...] of coal from Cardiff to Rio de Janeiro on 20 January 1920. Engine repairs {{had to be made}} at Falmouth the next day and were not completed until 14 February. Her engine broke down again in the mid-Atlantic and she was towed to Las Palmas by a Spanish merchantman. Arriving there on 20 March, she was towed by another LRB ship to Pernambuco. After her arrival there on 1 June, the coal in her No. 3 hold was found to be on fire. This was not extinguished until 19 June and the ship remained in harbour until 14 October. Péruvier was towed to Antwerp, arriving on 18 November, and lay idle there until she was sold for scrap. On 4 March 1923, she was towed to the shipbreakers in Flushing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Worn out! Worn out!" [...] Madame said, nodding {{slowly up}} and down. Her black veil, pushed <b>up,</b> sagged <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brows like a {{mourning}} band. [...] "You cannot afford to waste the stamina. And will {{you keep on}} the theatre--with Mr. May--?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Kekay - Kekay is Kokey's jealous furry little sister. She {{was born}} {{thinking}} she was disliked and unloved by her parents, and grew <b>up</b> envious <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brother's popularity {{not only in}} Planet Yekok but on Earth as well. Her sense of curiosity and misadventure send her to an accidental journey to Earth.|$|R

60|$|It ended, of course, in {{her being}} crushed {{as flat as}} is a broken-winged {{butterfly}} that comes {{in the path of}} a garden roller. He stood <b>up</b> and towered <b>over</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|He towered <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{and smiled}} {{down at her}} in his fatherly way.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{lifted up}} no voice, but, {{as one who}} has been shot through the heart falls with no cry, she fell back,--a mist rose <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> great mournful eyes,--she had fainted.|$|E
60|$|She alighted {{from the}} car, white and tremulous with fear, {{and her eyes}} moved about anxiously. When they fell upon Thatcher the blood gushed <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, and {{her eyes filled with}} tears of relief.|$|E
60|$|In all {{the talk}} of the circus which {{followed}} among her companions, she took no part because she feared she might be obliged to mention his name. When others spoke his name she could feel a hot flush surge <b>up</b> all <b>over</b> <b>her</b> body and she trembled for fear some one might discover her adoration of him.|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>up</b> at him <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{spectacles}} {{from the}} stocking she was darning; the china egg gleamed through the frayed place. [...] "What notion {{have you got}} in your head, now?" ...|$|R
60|$|Nellie Townshead looked <b>up</b> quickly <b>over</b> <b>her</b> sewing {{from the}} other side of the stove, and for a moment there was {{something}} akin to pain in her eyes. They were clear brown eyes, and it was characteristic that they almost immediately brightened into a smile, for while the girl's face resembled her father's in its refinement, there was courage in it in place of weariness.|$|R
6000|$|... "PLEASE don't talk! I'm almost DEAD with sleep!" [...] {{returned}} Irene. [...] "Do go, mamma! I shan't disturb her." [...] She {{turned her}} {{face down in the}} pillow, and pulled the covering <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> ears.|$|E
6000|$|His mother, {{her hands}} held <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, and in them two plaits of hair--"couleur de feuille morte," [...] as little Jon {{had not yet}} learned to call it--had {{looked at him with}} eyes like little bits of his brown velvet tunic, and answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tatty,' {{said her}} young mistress, putting her hand <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{that the other}} might take it, 'Miss Wade almost frightened me when we parted, and I scarcely {{like to think of}} her just now as having been so near me without my knowing it. Tatty dear!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Phyllis {{smiled a}} little pitifully as her own little girl, all radiant with health and joy, came {{skipping}} <b>up,</b> performing antics <b>over</b> <b>her</b> father's hand. [...] "Take care, Lily, don't wake poor little Lena," [...] was murmured quietly.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>up</b> at him <b>over</b> <b>her</b> spectacles. He {{was staring}} back at her, unswerving. She met {{his eyes for a}} moment, then took off her glasses. He was white. The male was up in him, dominant. She {{did not want to see}} him too clearly.|$|R
60|$|After a {{while she}} was awakened suddenly; for the chest was jarring and grinding, {{and the air was}} full of sound. She looked <b>up,</b> and <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head were mighty cliffs, all red in the setting sun, and around her rocks and breakers, and flying flakes of foam. She clasped her hands together, and shrieked aloud for help. And when she cried, help met her: for now there came over the rocks a tall and stately man, and looked down {{wondering}} upon poor Danae tossing about in the chest among the waves.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly not. There {{will be no}} {{more going}} out until this mystery has been cleared up. It has been hard enough for Dorothy to bear <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> last trouble, but it would be out of the {{question}} for her to go into society with this terrible thing hanging over her.' ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{got back}} to the house already dismally affected, I was still more sadly downcast at the sight of Mary. She had her sleeves rolled <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> strong arms, and was quietly making bread. I got a bannock from the dresser and sat down to eat it in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Mrs. Cornbury," [...] said Rachel, {{pressing}} her friend's {{hand as she}} parted from her. This allusion to her lover had called a blush <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> whole face, so that Mrs. Cornbury well {{knew that she had}} been understood. [...] "I'll see to it," [...] she said, driving away her ponies.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{go back to}} camp now, and get a pack, {{saddle and}} horse," [...] he said. [...] "She'll be safe here. We'll rope her again, tie <b>her</b> <b>up,</b> throw <b>her</b> <b>over</b> a pack-saddle, and take her to camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's 'Ilda, sir. Such a thing Mitchett and me {{never could}} 'ave expected, comin' on us so sudden. I {{thought it best}} to bring 'er round, poor girl. Of course, it's all the war. I've warned 'er a dozen times; but there it is, comin' next month, {{and the man in}} France." [...] Pierson instinctively averted his gaze from the girl, who had not moved her eyes from his face, which she scanned with a seeming absence of interest, as if she had long given <b>up</b> {{thinking}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> lot, and left it now to others.|$|R
50|$|A {{little earlier}} that day, Nadia (Olga Fonda) worries that Elena {{is going to}} turn <b>up</b> and take <b>over</b> <b>her</b> body and she informs Katherine that they have to make the {{transfer}} permanent. To do that, they need her body so she chains Katherine to the bed, in case Elena takes over and escapes, and she goes to the Salvatore house to ask for Katherine's body.|$|R
6000|$|... "Frank Jones!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Father, {{what has}} brought him here?" [...] and she blushed <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face {{and head to}} the very roots of her hair. [...] "Come up, of course he must come up. When a man has {{come all the way}} from Castle Morony he must be allowed to come up. Why should you wish to keep him down in the area?" [...] Then Frank Jones soon made his {{appearance}} within the chamber.|$|E
60|$|The widow now {{followed}} {{the direction of}} the other eyes; and looked <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder; she gave a little cry, and shrank down. The young bride made her petted mouth, in appeal to the company; her husband looked severe, as if he were going to do something, but refrained, not to make a scene. The reticent father threw one of his staccato glances at the port, and Mrs. March was sure that she saw the daughter steal a look at Burnamy.|$|E
6000|$|Again she {{startled by}} hearing a voice saying, [...] "Sister, {{what is that}} in the field?" [...] and {{starting}} up, she saw Mrs. Delia in high pattens, and her Sunday silk tucked <b>up</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> quilted petticoat, with a basket of corn in her hand, surrounded by her poultry, while Mrs. Phoebe was bending over a coop. She had stumbled unawares on their back premises, and with a wild hope, founded on their well-known enmity to Lady Belamour, she sprang over the stile. Mrs. Delia retreated in haste, but Mrs. Phoebe came to the front.|$|E
5000|$|Constance {{acted as}} regent {{on behalf of}} her son [...] and took the title of Queen as a {{daughter}} of the King of France, but she was imprisoned by Grimoald Alferanites, who proclaimed himself Lord of Bari. Constance was released in 1120 on the intervention of King Roger II of Sicily and the Pope, but in exchange for her release, Constance had to give <b>up</b> the regency <b>over</b> <b>her</b> son.|$|R
60|$|Only a {{night-light}} {{was burning}} there. Mrs Fyne raised <b>her</b> <b>up,</b> took <b>her</b> <b>over</b> to Mr Fyne's little dressing-room {{on the other}} side of the landing, to a fire by which she could dry herself, and left her there. She had to go back to her guests.|$|R
5|$|What {{began as}} an {{on-screen}} storyline marriage in 2000 blossomed into a real-life romance when Levesque began dating Stephanie McMahon. They married on October 25, 2003. They have three daughters. He had previously been in a long-term relationship with former WWF wrestler Joanie Laurer, better known as Chyna, later breaking <b>up</b> with <b>her</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> personal demons as well as Laurer not being interested in having children.
