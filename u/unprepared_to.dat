5|$|The Thirty Years' War period {{brought the}} Commonwealth a mixed legacy, rather more losses than gains, with the Polish–Lithuanian state {{retaining}} {{its status as}} one of the few great powers in central-eastern Europe. From 1635 the country enjoyed a period of peace, during which internal bickering and progressively dysfunctional legislative processes prevented any substantial reforms from taking place. The Commonwealth was <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> deal with grave challenges that materialized in the middle of the century.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana's realm {{began with the}} capture of his brother Andrianavalonimerina's territory, which he ruled from Ambohitrabiby. The king led his brother {{to believe that they}} were on friendly terms and that they should work together to support one another. When the king launched a surprise attack on Ambohitrabiby, his brother was <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> deflect the offensive and Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana successfully seized control of the territory, which he incorporated into his own.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress saw no need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> fight a major maritime war before 1897.|$|E

60|$|Perfectly still, {{his eyes}} downcast, he suddenly, with no {{preliminary}} stir, hit {{the table with}} his fist a blow which caused the utterly <b>unprepared</b> Ricardo <b>to</b> leap aside. And only then did Schomberg look up with a dull, resentful expression.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, {{columnist}} and highly decorated military veteran David Hackworth again criticized the 10th Mountain Division for being <b>unprepared</b> due <b>to</b> lack of training, low physical fitness, unprepared leadership and low morale. He said the division {{was no longer}} capable of mountain warfare.|$|R
5|$|Following the Battle of Inchon and {{subsequent}} Second Battle of Seoul, the North Korean Army was largely defeated, and the 19th Infantry {{was one of}} the units of the Eighth United States Army which pursued the fleeing North Koreans north of the 38th Parallel with the intention of reuniting the country. However, beginning in October 1950, the People's Republic of China conducted the First Phase Offensive, a surprise attack against the advancing United Nations forces, which were <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> counter the offensive. By early November, Red Cloud and his unit had advanced to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E
5|$|When the United States entered World War II, Kouma {{was trained}} as a tank crew member. He was {{assigned}} to the 9th Armored Division. The Division landed in Normandy late in September 1944, and moved to the front lines on October 23. Its first mission was patrol duty in a quiet sector along the Luxembourg-German frontier. When the Germans launched their winter offensive, the 9th Armored Division was quickly involved in the Battle of the Bulge with next to no experience. The Division saw very heavy action at St. Vith, Echternach and Bastogne, its units, <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> counter the offensive, fighting in widely separated areas.|$|E
5|$|Air Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté, {{commander-in-chief}} of RAF Coastal Command agreed {{this was}} the probable route. He expected the Germans to make an attempt anytime after the 10 February. Unfortunately, the Air Ministry and the three RAF commands, RAF Coastal Command, RAF Bomber Command and RAF Fighter Command, believed the Germans would use the darkness for the longest and most dangerous {{part of the journey}} through the straits and would leave in daylight. The far from adequate forces at their disposal, they believed, would be best used at night. Most of RAF Bomber Command was ordered to stand down accordingly. Such an order made it totally <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> strike in daylight hours on 12 February.|$|E

5|$|By early July the Chinese {{launched}} a major offensive in the ROK II Corps and US X Corps sectors. The Americans and South Koreans subsequently {{responded with a}} series of counter-attacks to regain the ground lost, yet these met with only limited success. On 6 July the Chinese attacked elements of the US 7th Division on Porkchop Hill on the US I Corps right flank, and succeeded in gaining the crest. The Americans were reinforced and counter-attacked over the following days, although again without success. Following another Chinese assault on 9 July the Americans again counter-attacked, yet neither side gained a clear advantage. The following day the Chinese {{launched a}} series of company and battalion-sized assaults, but were repulsed. Yet, with the Americans <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> accept further casualties for limited tactical gain, they evacuated Porkchop Hill on 11 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days. Since sieges were {{uncommon}} in Arabian warfare, the arriving confederates were <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with the}} trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered {{on either side of}} the trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{receiving}} the order, Shimon Avidan called an emergency meeting at Hatzor. Yehoshua Goldrat, the only {{officer in the}} brigade who had experience from the British Army operating a combined force of infantry, armor, artillery and air, wrote the operational order. The order was in English, as Goldrat was not fluent in Hebrew, and was handed out to the battalion commanders on June 1. The battalion commanders translated the document into Hebrew for the company commanders. According to the plan, six companies (3 Palmach and 3 Irgun) would attack the Egyptians from the south. Three companies (2 from the 52nd and one from the 51st battalions) would attack from the north, and two companies (one from the 53rd Battalion and one from Irgun) would prevent a retreat to the east. A company from the 53rd Battalion would block reinforcement from Majdal. Only senior officers knew of the full plans however. Simha Shiloni, commander of the Palmach forces (Negev Beasts Battalion), commented that his forces came exhausted and completely <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> the assembly points, and he had given consent for their deployment only after being assured that they would serve as the operational reserve (the plan in fact called for these forces to lead the southern assault).|$|E
5000|$|However, Smith {{was more}} {{critical}} after the Monday Night Football game during Week 2, {{saying that the}} replacement referees were [...] "an embarrassment to Roger Goodell and the NFL owners, who are allowing underqualified and <b>unprepared</b> people <b>to</b> tarnish a great league." ...|$|R

5|$|In East Anglia, Rædwald's {{conversion}} was {{not universally}} accepted by his household {{or his own}} queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from {{his commitment to the}} Christian faith. As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one pagan and another dedicated to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of Rædwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the regio of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke explains the dual nature of the temple by suggesting that Rædwald would have been <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> reject his old religion and fully embrace Christianity, as this act would have been a public acknowledgment of his inferiority to Æthelberht. Rædwald's lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
25|$|In 1840s, mathematicians were {{generally}} <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> understand Grassmann's ideas. In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas {{similar to that}} of Grassmann's, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore.|$|E

25|$|Developmental causes {{may also}} result in sexual {{harassment}} among students.

25|$|In some areas, {{particularly}} the American South, turkeys {{may also be}} deep fried in hot oil (often peanut oil) for 30 to 45 minutes by using a turkey fryer. Deep frying turkey {{has become something of}} a fad, with hazardous consequences for those <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> safely handle the large quantities of hot oil required.|$|E
25|$|The impasse did {{not favor}} the Chinese troops who were utterly <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> {{fight in the}} {{tropical}} weather of Upper Burma. Thousands of Chinese soldiers reportedly were struck down by cholera, dysentery and malaria.

5000|$|His <b>unprepared</b> {{statement}} <b>to</b> {{the press}} quickly earned Schill an homophobic reputation. A popular radio-station broadcast a song calling him [...] "Mega-Proll" [...] (mega redneck) and {{gay and lesbian}} associations protested vocally. Schill however later affirmed Beust's version of the story, except for the accusations of blackmail, saying that he warned Beust to stay clear of nepotism, and that this {{had nothing to do}} with Beust's sexual orientation. He stated [...] "I have nothing against homosexuals".|$|R

The X-ray source and the photon-counting X-ray imaging spectrometer are arranged in a reflection geometry relative to the predetermined coordinate...|$|R
25|$|The post-Civil War {{period was}} {{characterized}} by a precarious executive office, a lack of ideological definition, the marginalization of popular movements, indiscipline and the intervention of military chiefs in politics. The death of the Regent, formerly King Pedro, after successfully installing his daughter as Queen, thrust the inexperienced Maria da Glória into a role that, {{at the age of}} 15 years, she was <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> handle.|$|E
25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the crisis, many of the injured died in the only hospital in Beslan, which was highly <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> cope with the casualties, before the patients were sent to better-equipped facilities in Vladikavkaz. There was an inadequate supply of hospital beds, medication, and neurosurgery equipment. Relatives were not allowed to visit hospitals where the wounded were treated, and doctors were not allowed to use their mobile phones.|$|E
25|$|Between 1529 and 1530, {{the local}} population, both Spanish and Taíno, were heavily {{impacted}} by the passing {{of at least three}} hurricanes. This, combined with a previous plague that the natives were <b>unprepared</b> <b>to</b> overcome, diminished their role in the colonization's heavy work, which was now progressing to plantations and moving away from mining, in favor of more African slaves. During the 1540s, the capture of natives of any locale was prohibited by the New Laws.|$|E
5000|$|After {{bringing}} down yet another German pilot and escaping uninjured from his burning aircraft, Haggerty (Milton Sills) and his buddy, aircraft machinist Klaxon (Arthur Stone), head for Paris, albeit without an official leave of absence. In escaping from M.P.'s, Haggerty takes refuge {{in a room}} occupied by Germaine Benoit (Molly O'Day). Love soon springs up, and Haggerty decides to reform, returning to Major Cotton (Mitchell Lewis) with this resolution. He is <b>unprepared,</b> however, <b>to</b> be awarded a medal for his actions as a fighter pilot.|$|R
