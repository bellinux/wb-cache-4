5|$|Feral {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats {{at some of these}} sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E

These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana's campaign support network, Tiako iMadagasikara (TIM), and in speeches the candidate delivered in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> across the island, with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko.

5|$|Various {{forms of}} Chinese {{architecture}} exist throughout Indonesia with marked differences between <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> {{and among the}} different islands. Architectural developments by the Chinese in Southeast Asia differ from those in mainland China. By blending local and European (Dutch) design patterns, numerous variations of fusion styles emerged. Chinese architecture in Indonesia has manifested in three forms: religious temples, study halls, and houses. Cities {{during the colonial period}} were divided into three racial districts: European, oriental (Arabs, Chinese, and other Asians), and indigenous. There usually were no physical boundaries among the zones, except for rivers, walls, or roads in some cases. Such legal boundaries promoted high growths in urban density within each zone, especially in the Chinese quarters, often leading to poor environmental conditions.|$|E

This cross-sectional study was aimed to compare and investigate the relationship between the nutritional status and eating practices among children aged 4 - 6 years old in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> in Selangor, Malaysia. 142 children from urban (n = 100) <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> (n = 42) participated in this study. The nutritional status of the subjects were evaluated by assessing their anthropometry values which were weight, height and Body Mass Index (BMI) and later compared with standard growth chart. The diet intake of the subjects were obtained using 3 days diet record and later compared with Malaysian Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI). The t-test showed, there was a significant differences for weight for age and height for age among children from <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> (p< 0. 05). Prevalence of wasting was higher among rural children (31 %) than urban children (22 %). Two-way ANOVA test showed that there were significant differences in nutrient intake between children from <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> (p< 0. 05) with calorie intake among rural children higher (23 %) than RNI, higher protein intake among <b>urban</b> (114 %) <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> (165 %) than RNI, calcium intake were lowered than RNI for <b>urban</b> (35 %) <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> (17 %). There was also a positive relationship between children’ BMI with fast food intake (r = 0. 274, p< 0. 05) and eating out (r = 0. 207, p< 0. 05). As a conclusion, rural children had higher prevalence of undernutrition compared to the urban children but the prevalence of obesity were same in both areas...|$|R

5|$|Severe storms impact {{large cities}} {{more often and}} can damage cars, houses and disrupt public {{services}} such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste. The foothills of the Andes and the Sierras de Cordoba are vulnerable to hail. This is because the Andes force humid air from the Atlantic upwards, intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms, making hail more likely. Mendoza, a city located in the Andean foothills, experiences frequent hailstorms that can impact the agriculture of the region. Hailstorms have caused serious losses in both <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> It is estimated that wine and fruit production experience yearly losses of US$50 million and US$30 million, respectively, due to hail. Most of these hailstorms occur in the summer although they can occur in winter, particularly in the east where warm and humid air from the north frequently collides with cold air from the south, leading to convective thunderstorms that can produce hail.|$|E

Objectives: To compare the perceptions of different aspects of menstrual hygiene between adolescent girls of <b>rural</b> <b>and</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area.</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2013 to September 2013 in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> of South 24, Paraganas, West Bengal among 541 adolescent school girls in {{the age group of}} 13 - 18 years. Data were collected by the predesigned and pretested questionnaires. Result: Only 37. 52 % girls were aware of menstruation prior to attainment of menarche. The difference in the awareness regarding menstruation in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> was highly significant. Only 36 % girls in the <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> 54. 88 % girls in the <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> used homemade sanitary pads and reused the same in the subsequent period.

This study found differences in hygienic practices followed by adolescent girls in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area.</b> Conclusion: Hygienic practices during menstruation were unsatisfactory in the <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> as compared to the urban area.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the levels of burnout among English language teachers of secondary schools in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area.</b> It intends to examine the different levels of burnout experiencing by English language teachers of secondary schools in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area,</b> factors that lead to the burnout as well as the coping strategies to overcome burnout. A total of 20 English teachers of secondary schools in <b>urban</b> area <b>and</b> 20 English language teachers of secondary schools in <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> in Kuantan are involved in this study. A survey research method was used. The result of the study suggests that there is not much difference in the levels of burnout experienced by English language teachers in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> secondary schools. The factor of work overload is the most contributing factor that leads to burnout of the English teachers in urban area. Meanwhile, the factor of work environment is the most contributing factor that leads to burnout of English teachers in <b>rural</b> <b>area.</b> The most effective coping strategies to overcome burnout for English teachers in <b>urban</b> <b>and</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> are by going for holiday as well as by spending more time in doing things they like. The least effective coping strategy to overcome burnout is by being optimistic on challenges faced. Suggestions on how to overcome factors that lead to burnout are mentioned in this study such as by lessening teachers' workload, limiting scope of duties for teachers and also teachers should fully utilize school's facilities and ESL materials provided by the school...|$|R
