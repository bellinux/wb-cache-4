25|$|In 1998, Evans was rearrested. In custody, {{he confessed}} to five murders and then led police to the {{scattered}} bodies of his dismembered victims. His final escape was from a prison transport van. Manacled and chained, Evans used a key secreted <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> kicked out a window and then jumped from the prison van. Evans was later cornered by police and leaped to his death.|$|E
25|$|Ed Harris did not {{actually}} breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) {{below the surface of}} the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and his eyes swelling up. Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{felt the}} episode offered him {{excellent}} scope {{to try new}} techniques, noting that the series producers [...] "encourage cinematic stuff". He felt a highlight of this approach was in shooting the episode's climactic stand-off, explaining that [...] "instead of shooting at a normal eye level as the Salamander Man takes the gun, I tilt up, and now I'm shooting <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> almost, {{and it was kind}} of like very disorienting. The show's got a certain ennui that appeals to me, the film noir-y movies of the '40s look, an undercurrent of tension and anxiety 'cause of all the weird things going on".|$|E

500|$|After divorcing Hubbard, Northrup married Miles Hollister {{and bought}} a house in Malibu, California. Hubbard {{continued}} to develop Dianetics (and ultimately Scientology), through which he met his third and last wife, Mary Sue, in late 1951 – only a few months after his divorce. The controversy surrounding the divorce had severely dented his reputation. He sought to explain it to his followers as being the result of his victimization by his ex-wife. Speaking to Dianeticists following the divorce, Hubbard blamed shadowy outside forces for the bad publicity: [...] "We have just been through the saw mill, through the public presses. Every effort was made to butcher my personal reputation. A young girl is nearly dead because of this effort. My wife Sara." [...] Around the summer of 1951, he explained his flight to Cuba as being a bid to escape Northrup's depredations: [...] "He talked a lot about Sara. When she ran off with another man Ron followed them and they locked him in a hotel room and pushed drugs <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> but he managed to escape and went to Cuba." [...] He publicly portrayed his marital problems as being entirely the fault of Northrup and her lover Hollister: ...|$|E
500|$|Mulder sees Diabra, {{a diplomat}} from Burkina Faso. Diabra tells him an old folk {{tale of the}} Bambara people about the Teliko, which were nocturnal [...] "spirits of the air". Meanwhile, Scully {{examines}} a PET scan of Aboah, which shows {{that he has no}} pituitary gland. Aboah escapes the hospital and meets Duff in a car; he paralyses Duff {{in the same manner as}} his other victims and inserts a long metal object <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> A policeman finds Duff and requests an ambulance, and the police tell Mulder and Scully that they are sweeping the area for Aboah. Driving around, Mulder tells Scully that he thinks Aboah is the mythical Teliko. He stops at a demolition site, remembering that Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Sanders' body. Mulder and Scully split up at the site; Mulder is pierced as Kittel was and is taken into a duct by Aboah. Meanwhile, Scully, having heard Mulder's shouts for help, tracks him in the duct and is able to get him out of it, finding then the missing men dead, all of them with their skins depigmented. While calling for medical assistance by phone, Aboah is about to jump on her but Mulder's look alerts her and she quickly turns around and shoots at him. In her field journal, Scully writes that Aboah will stand trial if he lives long enough. She muses that Aboah's condition and survival may be discovered by science, but humans have a fear of an alien among them which causes them to [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate".|$|E

2500|$|... "The Ferret Song". John Cleese has an {{obsession}} with ferrets throughout the show, including his famous performance of [...] "The Ferret Song". This song begins with the line [...] "I've got a ferret sticking up my nose." [...] The line is repeated, then: [...] "How it got there I can't tell, but now it's there, it hurts like hell and, what is more, it radically affects my sense of smell," [...] – and promptly gets even worse. The song, written by John Cleese and Graham Chapman, was included in The Fairly Incomplete and Rather Badly Illustrated Monty Python Song Book, accompanied by a picture of John with a Terry Jones-shaped ferret <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} tour to Zimbabwe, after two close draws, Lloyd {{generated}} controversy with his post-match statements. Speaking {{after the first}} Test in Bulawayo, which ended as a draw with the scores level, he stated [...] "We murdered them. We got on top and steamrollered them. We have flipping hammered them. One more ball and we'd have walked it. We murdered them and they know it. To work so hard and get so close, there is no praise too high. We have had some stick off your lads. We flipping hammered them." [...] The comments were not appreciated by Zimbabwe fans, with one banner in the crowd reading [...] "Wanted. David Lloyd. For Murder of Zim Cricket Team.

2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP 2 has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Paul MacInnes of The Guardian gave the album a perfect five star rating saying, [...] "His flows are exceptional, the wordplay is dazzling. The jokes, in places offensive, are relentless. There is no apology; no concession; just a virtuoso application of talent." [...] Jon Dolan of the Rolling Stone said, [...] "Nostalgia is everywhere. … He's playing his best character, the demon spawn of Trailer Hell, America, hitting middle age with his middle finger <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> while he cleans off the Kool-Aid his kids spilled on the couch". Christopher Weingarten of Spin stated, [...] "If rapping were purely an athletic competition, Eminem would be Michael Phelps and Lou Retton combined: pure ability and flexibility, like a bullet with only white-hot hate in his wake". He {{would go on}} to add that [...] "we get rhymes… more rhymes than some rappers manage in a whole career". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Eminem sounds more alive – angrier yet fully present – than he has in years… Eminem burns with purpose on [...] "MMLP2". And if you don't like what he (still) has to say, there's a chance he doesn't either".|$|E
