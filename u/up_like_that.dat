500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E
2500|$|Sister Irma Geddon of the Portland, Oregon-based Order of Benevolent Bliss {{offered her}} view of the {{efficacy}} of using nun's clothing and drag: [...] "The lightness of everything, {{in addition to the}} whiteface and the nun's habits, are a mechanism to reach out to people. When we're dressed <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> kind of like sacred clowns, it allows people to interact with us." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{was quite}} {{difficult}} to have all that responsibility at first. We {{were one of the}} only Latin families growing up. It was very interesting to be in that environment; it was such a complete departure from our lives in Uruguay. Essentially, we were in a place where people didn't want you, and didn't understand what you were about", he said. And though Espuelas did not speak any English, [...] "growing <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> provided a tremendous incentive for me to learn. [...] " ...|$|E

5000|$|Van Hoogstraten told Lynn Barber, {{writing for}} The Observer in 2006, that he {{pays for the}} {{education}} of three children in every school in Zimbabwe: [...] "Actually, it doesn't {{cost a lot of money}} in real terms, but I've set <b>up</b> things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> that will continue." ...|$|R
2500|$|American {{musician}} Harry Connick Jr., {{who performed}} on the show, was serving as a guest judge {{at the time and}} strongly expressed his disapproval of the skit when asked to give a score, and also later on in the show, and gave the performers a [...] "0" [...] score. He appeared visibly uncomfortable throughout the skit. He said, [...] "If they turned <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in the United States, it'd be like Hey Hey There's No More Show." [...] He later said that he would not have agreed to be on the show had he known beforehand about the sketch.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
