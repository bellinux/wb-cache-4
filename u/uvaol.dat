40|$|International audienceUvaol, a triterpene {{present in}} olives and virgin olive oil, {{has been shown}} to possess {{anti-inflammatory}} properties and antioxidant effects. However, until now, no studies have demonstrated its potential effects on allergic inflammation. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of <b>uvaol</b> in a mouse model of allergy characterized by eosinophil-dominant inflammation in actively sensitized mice. The anti-inflammatory effect of <b>uvaol</b> was analyzed in two murine models of allergic inflammation (pleurisy and asthma). In these models, Swiss mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). In the pleurisy model, the pleural eosinophilic inflammation and IL- 5 concentrations were examined 24 h after the OVA challenge, while in the asthma model were examined the airway inflammation via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytology and lung histopathology analyses. Our results showed that <b>uvaol</b> decreased the accumulation of eosinophils and the concentration of IL- 5 in pleural effluent. <b>Uvaol</b> also demonstrated important anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting production of IL- 5 and influx of leukocytes, mainly of eosinophils, in BAL fluid, but without interfering with levels of reactive oxygen species in leukocytes. Moreover, the eosinophil infiltration, mucus production, number of alveoli that collapsed, and IL- 5 levels in the lung were clearly decreased by <b>uvaol</b> treatment. These findings indicate that <b>uvaol</b> can be a good candidate for the treatment of allergic inflammation by inhibiting eosinophil influx and IL- 5 production in ovalbumin-induced allerg...|$|E

40|$|Olive pomace oil, {{also known}} as "orujo" olive oil, {{is a blend of}} refined-pomace oil and virgin olive oil, fit for human consumption. Maslinic acid, oleanolic acid, erythrodiol, and <b>uvaol</b> are pentacyclic triterpenes, found in the non-glyceride {{fraction}} of orujo oil, which have previously been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. In the present work, we investigated the effect of these minor components on pro-inflammatory cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in six different samples. <b>Uvaol,</b> erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid significantly decreased IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 production in a dose-dependent manner. All three compounds significantly reduced TNF-alpha production at 100 mu M; however, at 10 mu M, <b>uvaol</b> and oleanolic acid enhanced the generation of TNF-alpha. In contrast, maslinic acid did not significantly alter the concentration of those cytokines, {{with the exception of a}} slight inhibitory effect at 100 mu M. All four triterpenes inhibited production of I- 309, at 50 mu M and 100 mu M. However, <b>uvaol</b> enhanced I- 309 production at 10 mu M. The triterpenic dialcohols had a similar effect on MIG production. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that pentacyclic triterpenes in orujo oil exhibit pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on chemical structure and dose, and may be useful in modulating the immune response.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The natural triterpenes, {{erythrodiol}} and <b>uvaol,</b> exert anti-inflammatory, vasorelaxing and anti-proliferative effects. Angiotensin II is {{a well-known}} profibrotic and proliferative agent that participates in the cardiac remodeling associated with different pathological situations through the stimulation and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} study was to investigate the preventive effects of the natural triterpenes erythrodiol and <b>uvaol</b> on the proliferation and collagen production induced by angiotensin II in cardiac myofibroblasts. Their actions on cardiac hypertrophy triggered by angiotensin II were also studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effect of erythrodiol and <b>uvaol</b> on angiotensin II-induced proliferation was evaluated in cardiac myofibroblasts from adult rats in the presence or the absence of the inhibitors of PPAR-γ, GW 9662 or JNK, SP 600125. The effect on collagen levels induced by angiotensin II was evaluated in cardiac myofibroblasts and mouse heart. The presence of low doses of both triterpenes reduced the proliferation of cardiac myofibroblasts induced by angiotensin II. Pretreatment with GW 9662 reversed the effect elicited by both triterpenes while SP 600125 did not modify it. Both triterpenes at high doses produced an increase in annexing-V binding in the presence or absence of angiotensin II, which was reduced by either SP 600125 or GW 9662. Erythrodiol and <b>uvaol</b> decreased collagen I and galectin 3 levels induced by angiotensin II in cardiac myofribroblasts. Finally, cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular remodeling, fibrosis, and increases in myocyte area and brain natriuretic peptide levels observed in angiotensin II-infused mice were reduced in triterpene-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Erythrodiol and <b>uvaol</b> reduce cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricle remodeling induced by angiotensin II in mice by diminishing fibrosis and myocyte area. They also modulate growth and survival of cardiac myofibroblasts. They inhibit the angiotensin II-induced proliferation in a PPAR-γ-dependent manner, while at high doses they activate pathways of programmed cell death that are dependent on JNK and PPAR-γ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} aimed {{to isolate the}} non-polar secondary metabolites that produce the vasodilator effects induced by the dichloromethane extract of Prunus serotina (P. serotina) fruits and {{to determine whether the}} NO/cGMP and the H 2 S/KATP channel pathways are involved in their mechanism of action. A bioactivity-directed fractionation of the dichloromethane extract of P. serotina fruits led to the isolation of ursolic acid and <b>uvaol</b> as the main non-polar vasodilator compounds. These compounds showed significant relaxant effect on rat aortic rings in an endothelium- and concentration-dependent manner, which was inhibited by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), dl-propargylglycine (PAG) and glibenclamide (Gli). Additionally, both triterpenes increased NO and H 2 S production in aortic tissue. Molecular docking studies showed that ursolic acid and <b>uvaol</b> are able to bind to endothelial NOS and CSE with high affinity for residues that form the oligomeric interface of both enzymes.

40|$|Pomace oil ('orujo' olive oil), is {{an olive}} sub-product which {{possesses}} potential beneficial components (e. g. tetra- and pentacyclic triterpenes: oleanolic and maslinic acids, erythrodiol and <b>uvaol)</b> to which {{great variety of}} biological effects is attributed. Pharmacological properties of oleanolic acid have been demonstrated: anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, hepatoprotective, cytotoxic, anti-diabetogenic, antibacterial and anti-HIV activities. There is scarce evidence about the pharmacological effects of these triterpenoid on vascular events; the chronic treatment of Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats with these natural compounds (oleanolic and ursolic acids) prevent the development of hypertension with significant bradycardia and potent diuretic activity. In relation to erythrodiol and <b>uvaol,</b> only their therapeutic efficiency on different experimental models of inflammation has been reported. Moreover, <b>uvaol</b> plays a protective role on the oxidation of lipoproteins of low density in vitro, {{as well as a}} protective effect on induced hepatic injuries.

Astrocytomas {{are among the most}} common and aggressive type of primary malignant tumors in the neurological system lacking effective treatments, and in this study, we addressed the effect of these two triterpenic diols on the human 1321 N 1 astrocytoma cell line. [Principal Findings]: Erythrodiol and <b>uvaol</b> effectively affected cell proliferation, as well as cell cycle phases and induced 1321 N 1 cell death. Both triterpenes successfully modulated the apoptotic response, promoting nuclear condensation and fragmentation. They caused retraction and rounding of cultured cells, which lost adherence from their supports, while F-actin and vimentin filaments disappeared as an organized cytoplasmic network. At molecular level, changes in the expression of surface proteins associated with adhesion or death processes were also observed. Moreover, triterpene exposure resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and correlated with the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The presence of catalase reversed the triterpenic diols-induced mitochondrial depolarization, JNK activation, and apoptotic death, indicating the critical role of ROS in the action of these compounds.

There were significant effects of cultivars or ps on unsaponifiable matter, β-sitosterol, Δ 5 -avenasterol, total sterols, 1 -docosanol, 1 -tetracosanol (ps), erythrodiol and percentage erythrodiol + <b>uvaol.</b> The values of most of these parameters were within the limits established by the EU Directives for olive and pomace oils but classification of the respective oils was not conclusive. Predictive discriminant analysis using these variables permitted 100 % success in the classification according to cultivars and ps (68 % in the case of cross validation). Results revealed that some influential steps should be re-designed, particularly the storage phase, in order to minimise changes in the studied fat components during ripe olive processing.

40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{investigation of}} Ochrosia eliptica leaves resulted in isolation and identification of eight compounds; lupeol, lupeol acetate, <b>uvaol,</b> ursolic acid, β-sitosterol glucoside, rutin, 8 -methoxy and 9 -methoxy ellipticine. The ethanolic extract and fractions were studied for their cytotoxic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The cytotoxic activity {{was performed on}} human mammary adenocarcinoma (MCF 7), its multidrug-resistant ‎ counterpart (VCREMS), estrogen receptor negative human metastatic breast ‎ adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB- 231) and the non-cancerous, immortalized by ‎ telomerase, human breast epithelial cell line (hTERT-HME 1). Additionally, the inhibitory potential on Cdc 25 s proteins was determined. The {{results showed that the}} dichloromethane (DCM) fraction and the major alkaloid; 9 -methoxyellipticine exhibited high inhibitory activity against all tested cell lines particularly MCF 7 and VCREMS cell lines, whereas t he DCM fraction showed a significant inhibitory action on Cdc 25 A isoform. In contrast, the n-butanol fraction and 9 -methoxyellipticine displayed the highest antioxidant potential. The DCM fraction showed significant anti-inflammatory activity compared to indomethacin. This work comprises the first comprehensive work to be conducted on O. elliptica leaves showing its potential in multiple biological activities. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{process is}} involved in the genesis and evolution of different diseases like obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Macrophages {{play a central role in}} inflammation. In addition, they can regulate some stages of cancer development. Macrophages can polarize into M 1 or M 2 functional phenotype depending on the cytokines present in the tissue microenvironment. On the other hand, triterpenes found in virgin olive oil are described to present different properties, such as antitumoral and anti-inflammatory activity. The present study was designed to elucidate if the four major triterpenes found in virgin olive oil (oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, <b>uvaol,</b> and erythrodiol) are able to enhance M 1 macrophage response which represents an important defense mechanism against cancer. Our results indicated that maslinic acid modulated the inflammatory response by enhancing the production of IL- 8, IL- 1 α, and IL- 1 β; it promoted M 1 response through the synthesis of IFN-γ; and finally it did not modify significantly the levels of NFκβ or NO. Overall, our results showed that maslinic acid could prevent chronic inflammation, which represents a crucial step in the development of some cancers...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Qualidade e Segurança Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{main goal}} of the present work was the {{application}} of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) in the characterization of soybean oil, sunflower oil, {{extra virgin olive oil}} and olive oil. Firstly, the models provided by Bruker, the equipment manufacturer, were validated. These models are related to the fatty acid composition and acidity for oils and olive oils, iodine value for oils and peroxide value, ultraviolet absorbance (232 and 270 nm), -sitosterol and total sterols in olive oils. Simultaneously calibration models were developed for the individual oils (fatty acid composition, iodine value, anisidine value and the ultraviolet absorbance (230 and 270 nm) and olive oils (acidity, fatty acid composition, -sitosterol, total sterol, absorbance at 232 nm, erythrodiol and <b>uvaol).</b> Also two calibration models were developed for the quantification of stigmastadienes in extra virgin olive oils, to detect and quantify the presence of soybean oil or sunflower oil. Both models proved promising – sunflower oil (r 2 = 0, 94; RMSECV = 0, 013 ppm; RPD = 3, 95) and soybean oil (r 2 = 0, 70; RMSECV = 0, 054 ppm; RPD = 1, 82).

40|$|Chitosan is a {{polysaccharide}} {{obtained by}} deacetylation of chitin, {{and it is}} involved in defence mechanisms of plants toward diseases. In the present work, V. vinifera L. cv. Ortrugo, grafted on 420 A rootstock was grown in pot and treated, at veraison, by 0. 03 % chitosan solution at cluster level. Just before the treatment (T 0) and 24 hours (T 1), 48 hours (T 2), 72 hours (T 3) and 10 days (T 4) later, the concentration of stilbenic compounds was detected, and at T 1 proteomics and metabolomics analyses were done. Proteomics relies on {{the analysis of the}} complete set of proteins existing in a given substrate, while metabolomics relies on the analyses of the complete set of metabolites in a given substrate. The treatment improved the stilbene concentration over the control at T 1. Proteomic analysis showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were overexpressed in the treated grapes. SOD is known to be an enzyme active against reactive oxygen species (ROS) while PAL is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoids pathway. Metabolomics analysis highlighted the positive role of the treatment in improving the triperpenoid concentration (betulin, erythrodiol, <b>uvaol,</b> oleanolate); these compounds are known to be effective against microbes, insects and fungi...|$|E
40|$|The work {{characterizes the}} {{unsaponifiable}} matter of fats released in pitting green (GP) and ripe (RP) olives, in pitting/stuffing green olives with vegetable (GPSV) and animal (GPSA) products {{and in the}} fat settled {{at the end of}} the factory sewer system (W). The unsaponifiable matter ranged from 1. 94 % (RP) to 5. 91 % (GPSA); total sterols from 1319 mg/kg fat (GPSV) to 2002 mg/kg fat (RP), with β-sitosterol as the most abundant. Fatty alcohols ranged from 242 mg/kg (GP) to 556 mg/kg (W), with C 22 as the most abundant. Triterpene diols were found only in GPSV (erythrodiol + <b>uvaol,</b> 0. 80 %). Wax was not present in the fats from GP and RP but increased with the general fat degradation in the order GPSV (128 mg/kg), GPSA (171 mg/kg) and W (263 mg/kg). Chemometric analysis was able to detect differences among the diverse fats; sterols + fatty alcohols cluster analysis was useful for fat grouping. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

40|$|THE {{authors have}} {{previously}} isolated and purified ursolic acid from heather flowers (Calluna vulgarts). This terpene {{was found to}} inhibit HL- 60 leukaemic cell proliferation and arachidonic acid oxidative metabolism in various cell species. The effects of ursolic acid and its analogues on soybean 15 -lipoxygenase activity and on the proliferation of a human gastric tumour cell line (HGT), have been assessed. These triterpenes inhibited soybean 15 -lipoxygenase at its optimal activity (pH 9). The proliferation ofHGT was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. At 20 tM the rank order is: ursolic acid> uvaol> oleanolic acid> methyl ursolate. The carboxylic group at the C 2 s position of ursolic acid appears to be implicated in the inhibition of both lipoxygenase activity and cell proliferation. Thus methylation of this group decreases these two inhibitory properties. Oleanolic acid, which differs by the position of one methyl group (C 20 instead of C 19) is less inhibitory than ursolic acid. The lipophilicity of the terpene is also implicated since <b>uvaol</b> {{appears to be more}} inhibitory than methyl ursolate.

40|$|The main {{triglycerides}} (TG) {{identified in}} the Oueslati virgin olive oil were 1, 2, 3 -trioleylglycerol (OOO), 2, 3 - dioleyl- 1 -palmitoylglycerol (POO) and 2, 3 -dioleyl- 1 -linoleylglycerol (LOO) representing more than 80 % of the total area of peaks in the chromatogram. Other minor triacylglycerols were 2, 3 -dioleyl- 1 -stearoylglycerol (SOO), 2 -oleyl- 3 -palmitoyl- 1 -stearoylglycerol (SOP), 1 -linolenoyl- 2 -oleyl- 3 -palmitoylglycerol (LnOP), 1, 2 -dilinoleyl- 3 -palmitoylglycerol (LLP), 1, 3 -dioleyl- 2 -linolenoylglycerol (OLnO), 1 -linolenoyl- 2 -linoleyl- 3 -oleylglycerol (LnLO) and 1, 2, 3 -trilinoleylglycerol (LLL). The sterol profile of Tunisian virgin olive oils produced from Oueslati cultivar was established by gas chromatography using a flame ionisation detector (GC-MS). More than 10 compounds were identified and characterised. As expected for virgin olive oil, the main sterols found in all Oueslati olive oils were b-sitosterol, D 5 -avenasterol, campesterol and stigmasterol. Cholesterol, 24 -methylenecholesterol, clerosterol, campestanol, sitostanol, D 7 -stigmastenol, D 5, 24 -stigmastadienol and D 7 -avenasterol were also found in all samples, but in lower amounts. Most of these compounds are significantly affected by the geographical origin of the oil. Besides the sterol components, two triterpene dialcohols, erythrodiol and <b>uvaol,</b> were also detected...|$|E
