2500|$|Wilson took a {{break from}} the {{negotiations}} and departed February 14, 1919 for home, then returned to Paris three weeks later and remained until the conclusion of a treaty in June. Heckscher describes Wilson, during the first four weeks of the Conference as, [...] "playing, with force and discretion, a commanding role…he established his priorities, secured accommodation on major issues and won preliminary acceptance of the League." [...] He promoted his plan in France, and then at home in February. Wilson gave a speech at the Metropolitan Opera House in defense of the League—he was more insistent about it than ever. Heckscher contends that the enduring image of Wilson as a grim, unsmiling and unforgiving figure dates from this visit home during the conference. While the general public along with editorial writers, churches and peace groups generally favored the League, the Republicans vowed to defeat the League and discredit Wilson. Wilson notably did not address the Congress as to ongoing deliberations at the peace conference, as indeed his counterpart Lloyd George did with Parliament. Heckscher opines that this was a missed opportunity to forge the debate even though the Congressional majority had changed. In France he was without the <b>usual</b> <b>control</b> over his message through the media; in fact, the French initiated an aggressive propaganda campaign {{in the midst of the}} Conference to affect its outcome.|$|E

50|$|In {{the absence}} of a rudder, the AV.2's pilot {{controlled}} yaw by differentially operating two pairs of airbrakes, each mounted near a wing tip and opening above and below the wing. The outer panels also carried ailerons. The only vertical surfaces on the wing were two fixed triangular fins, intended to reduce turbulence {{at each end of the}} unusual elevator designed by Peyret, mounted on the trailing edge of the centre section. It consisted of two geometrically similar surfaces, each of symmetrical section and joined to each other and to the wing without a gap. In plan the rear surface, though shorter, blended smoothly into the forward one. Together they formed a control surface with adjustable curvature, which could modify the profile of the centre section from symmetric to reflex. The pilot's controls were conventional; the airbrakes were controlled with a rudder bar which when rotated raised them differentially and when pressed forward opened them together as brakes. The ailerons and elevator operated by the <b>usual</b> <b>control</b> column. His seat was in an open cockpit at the leading edge of the wing, where a brief, rounded, enclosed forward extension carried a windscreen and pitot tube.|$|E
