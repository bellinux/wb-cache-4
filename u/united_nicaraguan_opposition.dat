2500|$|Nicaraguan women {{organized}} independently {{in support}} of the revolution and their cause. Some of those organizations were the Socialist Party (1963), Federación Democrática (which support the FSLN in rural areas), and Luisa Amanda Espinoza Association of Nicaraguan Women ( [...] , AMNLAE). However, since Daniel Ortega, was defeated in the 1990 election by the <b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UNO) coalition headed by Violeta Chamorro, the situation for women in Nicaragua was seriously altered. In terms of women and the labor market, by the end of 1991 AMNLAE reported that almost 16,000 working women—9,000 agricultural laborers, 3,000 industrial workers, and 3,800 civil servants, including 2,000 in health, 800 in education, and 1,000 in administration—had lost their jobs. The change in government also resulted in the drastic reduction or suspension of all Nicaraguan social programs, which brought back the burdens characteristic of pre-revolutionary Nicaragua. The women were forced to maintain and supplement community social services on their own without economic aid or technical and human resource.|$|E

25|$|There were {{isolated}} protests among the population against the draft {{implemented by the}} Sandinista government, which even resulted in full-blown street clashes in Masaya in 1988. However, polls showed the Sandinista government still enjoyed strong support from <b>Nicaraguans.</b> Political <b>opposition</b> groups were splintered and the Contras began to experience defections, although United States aid maintained them as a viable military force.|$|R
50|$|Ortega's {{relationship}} with the United States was never very cordial, due to U.S. support for Somoza prior to the revolution. Although the U.S. supplied post-revolution Nicaragua with {{tens of millions of}} dollars in economic aid, relations broke down when the Sandinistas supplied weapons to leftist El Salvadoran rebels (something which Ortega later admitted occurred). His government was opposed by the Contras in a vicious civil war; the Contras were funded by the Reagan administration of the United States. A joint peace proposal by the Democratic Speaker of the House Jim Wright and Ronald Reagan helped precipitate a peace agreement at a meeting of five Central American chiefs of state in July 1987, which won Costa Rican President Oscar Arias the Nobel Peace Prize. This led to free elections in which Ortega was defeated by Violeta Chamorro in the 1990 presidential election, but he remained an important figure in <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>opposition</b> politics, gradually moderating in his political position from Marxism-Leninism to democratic socialism.|$|R

50|$|In early 1983, {{he joined}} the {{political}} directorate of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). By October he became its president, though many observers wondered about his real power, due to the political wing's weak control over the military wing.

50|$|The <b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition</b> (Unidad Nicaragüense Opositora, UNO) was a Nicaraguan rebel {{umbrella}} group formed in 1985, {{led by the}} triumvirate of Adolfo Calero, Alfonso Robelo, and Arturo Cruz. However, {{the great majority of}} UNO's military forces came from Calero's Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), and throughout its two-year existence Robelo and Cruz complained that Calero treated them as figureheads rather than equals. Generally, the CIA backed Calero in these struggles, while Elliott Abrams and the State Department backed Robelo and Cruz.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} defeat came in 1990 when Violeta Chamorro {{representing the}} <b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UNO), was elected into office thus ousting the FSLN from power. This {{was not only}} a defeat for the FSLN and revolutionaries but for the Nicaraguan feminists in particular. Because neither AMNLAE nor the FSLN explicitly challenged the sexist controversies, they subsequently fell to a much more traditional and conservative party led by a woman president fulfilling the typical gender-roles that Nicaraguan feminists felt that women desperately needed to dismantle during the revolution.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, {{the newly}} named <b>United</b> States <b>Nicaraguan</b> Canal Commission {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} building the canal, as did the subsequent Isthmian Canal Commission in 1899.

Since the French effort was in disarray, in 1904 the United States purchased the French concession, equipment, and excavations for US$40 million.|$|R

50|$|Back in Costa Rica, UDN-FARN {{joined the}} new rebel {{umbrella}} group, the <b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UNO) in June 1985. UNO/FARN began {{competing for the}} loyalties of Pastora's ARDE remnants. In early 1986, most of Pastora's commanders agreed to align with Chamorro, and in May, Pastora quit the struggle {{with a handful of}} remaining followers. However, FDN leaders were always ambivalent about supporting UNO/South. In January 1987, the Southern Front withdrew from UNO, citing broken promises. The Southern Front was brought back on board for the Nicaraguan Resistance in May.|$|E
5000|$|As ARDE's {{regional}} field commanders penetrated {{deeper and}} deeper into Nicaragua they became increasingly frustrated at the squandering of resources, the constant bickering with other factions of the armed struggle against the alleged communist dictatorship, and Pastora's erratic directives. In 1985, other rebel groups, including former ARDE political head Alfonso Robelo, formed the <b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition</b> umbrella group. Fernando [...] "El Negro" [...] Chamorro of the UNO-aligned FARN sought to win over ARDE commanders, and in November, ARDE units encountered Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) elements moving down from the north.|$|E
50|$|Afterwards, Cruz drifted {{deeper into}} the {{politics}} of the rebel Contras. He was a primary drafter of the San José Declaration of March 1, 1985, signed by many rebel leaders. The declaration evolved into the formation of the rebel umbrella group <b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition</b> (UNO) on June 12, with Alfonso Robelo and the Nicaraguan Democratic Force's Adolfo Calero. However, with Calero's FDN comprising the great majority of UNO's forces, he found himself in another figurehead position. He continually threatened to resign unless he and Robelo were given real power. Despite Calero's eventual resignation in February 1987, he quit anyway on March 9.|$|E

50|$|Cardenal still enjoyed good {{relations}} with the CIA, and they agreed to fund an effort However, the Agency severed funding after he publicly mentioned his plans to create an Internal Front in an interview. His network had been penetrated by Sandinista intelligence from its inception, and they now rolled it up. After this, Cardenal gave up on rebel politics and began selling life insurance in Miami. However, he did not turn on the movement, and when Congress approved $100 million in aid to the Contras in 1986, he appeared at a press conference with the UNO (<b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition)</b> leaders to join in the celebrations.|$|E
50|$|The Liberal Party had by {{this time}} split into many groups, many of which {{supported}} the <b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition</b> which successfully opposed the Sandinistas in the 1990 elections. By the late 1990s, led by Arnoldo Alemán, most of the Liberal groups consolidated to form the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, which was at first known as the Liberal Alliance. In 1996 Alemán won the presidential election and served as president until 2002, while the party won 42 of the 93 seats in the 1996 congressional elections, {{more than any other}} party. At the November 2001 elections, the party gained a majority in Congress, winning 47 of 92 seats. The same day, its candidate Enrique Bolaños won the presidential elections.|$|E
50|$|Cruz, Jr. is {{the child}} of Arturo José Cruz Porras and Consuelo Sequeira Ximénez, the firstborn of seven children. As an idealistic youth, Cruz {{supported}} the Sandinistas, only to become disillusioned after they took power. In 1982 {{he turned to the}} charismatic Edén Pastora, the former Sandinista commander starting up the rebel Democratic Revolutionary Alliance, only to become disenchanted with him as well. Cruz then became involved in 1985 with UNO (<b>United</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> <b>Opposition),</b> the rebel umbrella group which his father had joined. Trips to Lt. Colonel Oliver North's office at the United States National Security Council brought him into contact with North's secretary, Fawn Hall, with whom he had a well-publicized relationship. After his father's resignation from UNO in March 1987, he attached himself to Aristides Sánchez. Eventually, Cruz left Contra politics, recounting his experience in Memoirs of a Counter-Revolutionary.|$|E
