500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite <b>upset</b> <b>me,</b> the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{publicly}} supported Sinn Féin and {{the unification}} of Ireland, although in 2005 he suggested to Sinn Féin leaders that it abandon its long-standing policy of not taking seats at Westminster (abstentionism). Sinn Féin in turn argued that {{to do so would}} recognise Britain's claim over Northern Ireland, and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British-created institution. A supporter of the Scottish Parliament and political devolution, Benn however opposed the Scottish National Party and Scottish independence, saying: [...] "I think nationalism is a mistake. And I am half Scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife. The thought that my mother would suddenly be a foreigner would <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> very much." ...|$|E

500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{was not a}} [...] "walker"; he {{believed}} in waiting for the umpire to make a decision, once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan, [...] "The more you play this game, the more you will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa". [...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That <b>upset</b> <b>me.</b> I did not know if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E
2500|$|The film's soundtrack {{includes}} [...] "You <b>Upset</b> <b>Me</b> Baby" [...] {{performed by}} B.B.

6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to America," [...] Tom replied, [...] "and may not be back for years. Yes, those are my sisters, and what <b>upsets</b> <b>me</b> most is that I have to leave them all alone, for we have lost both our parents." ...|$|R
2500|$|Allan's piece also {{affected}} the case proceedings. Social worker Yvette van Schalkwyk {{said that she}} decided to testify in Pistorius' defence after reading what was said about the athlete in the media. van Schalwyk alluded to Allan's column when she explained her motives: [...] "What <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> {{was the fact that}} they said he had acting training, that he just put on a show and just started crying when it was needed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{one of her}} 2000s {{interviews}} Shatskaya {{described her}} family as [...] "my mother and my brother [...] with his family." [...] She's never been married. [...] "This 'lack of love' does <b>upset</b> <b>me,</b> yes, but one has to agree that feisty, energetic and emotional men are very few, while others bore me," [...] she remarked in one interview, adding: [...] "In relationships I prefer to keep my distance. Otherwise, I am quite open and a very sociable person." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cover was}} also {{inspired}} by a photograph taken during the Kosovo War, which Donwood said [...] "was of a square metre of snow and {{it was full of}} the detritus of war, all military stuff and fag stains. I was upset by it in a way war had never <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> before. It felt like it was happening in my street." [...] Donwood painted on large canvases with knives and sticks, then photographed the paintings and manipulated them with Photoshop.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{hope you}} will find another wire; I really do, for it <b>upsets</b> <b>me</b> and makes me feel ill. I know that I shall be {{afraid to go to}} bed to-night, and even for you, Miss Ogilvy, I won't come next Sunday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Meet me {{at eight}} o'clock this evening, if you can, at the Ring on the Budmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The news <b>upsets</b> <b>me</b> almost. The girl {{seems to be in}} ignorance. Keep her so till I have seen you. M. H." ...|$|R
60|$|We were in {{a little}} circle now of which somehow I found myself the centre, and they were attacking us on all sides.

2500|$|They {{separated}} on 5 August 1972. It is {{not clear}} what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O P Nayyar once said, [...] "I know astrology very well. I knew that one day I had to part with her. Something also happened that <b>upset</b> <b>me,</b> so I left her." [...] Nevertheless, he also said [...] "...now that I am seventy-six, I can say that {{the most important person in}} my life was Asha Bhosle. She was the best person I ever met." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{five minutes}} {{from the time of}} the blow, Carroll leaned heavily against the barmaid next to her and complained of feeling ill. Carroll told co-workers, [...] "I feel deathly ill, that man has <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> so." [...] The barmaid and another {{employee}} helped Carroll to the kitchen. Her arm became numb, her speech thick. She collapsed and was hospitalized. Carroll died eight hours after the assault. Her autopsy showed hardened arteries, an enlarged heart and high blood pressure. A spinal tap confirmed brain hemorrhage as the cause of death. She died in Mercy Hospital at 9 a.m. on February 9, 1963.|$|E
2500|$|As {{far as the}} {{libretto}} went, it {{was acceptable}} to Verdi; he was even [...] "highly delighted" [...] with it. [...] However, from Voltaire's play the [...] "intellectual content [...] reduced to a minimum [...] religion and politics, the two raisons d'être of the drama, are scarcely mentioned; and the confrontation of different creeds, different civilizations and different worlds becomes merely another variant of the eternal triangle. In the Spring of 1845 Verdi's health forced a postponement until at least following August, although he was well enough to arrive in Naples {{by the end of}} July to oversee rehearsals. [...] In a letter of 30 July, he expresses optimism that the opera will be well received but notes that [...] "if it were to fail, that wouldn't <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> unduly".|$|E
6000|$|... "It's queer," [...] said he, [...] "that {{a little}} while ago the thing that worried me to the {{exclusion}} of everything else was the idea of being married, and now it is so near it's entirely the getting married that <b>upsets</b> <b>me.</b> I have forgotten the horrid consequences in the horror of the operation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the mortification, not the miles, that <b>upsets</b> <b>me.</b> I {{often take}} that run for {{exercise}} and {{think nothing of}} it but tonight I was so mad I made extra-good time, I fancy. Now don't you worry, but compose your mind and 'sip your dish of tea,' as Evelina says," [...] answered Mac, artfully turning the conversation from himself.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{a square}} fight never frets <b>me,</b> nor unpleasantness <b>upsets</b> <b>me,</b> but [...] the simple thing that gets me--now {{the job is}} done and gone, [...] And we've come home free and merry from the {{peaceful}} cemetery, [...] leavin' Cutter there with Sutter--that mebbee just a stutter [...] On the part of Mr. Cutter caused the loss we deeply mourn.|$|R
2500|$|In July 1986, Bono and {{his wife}} Ali {{travelled}} to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where they saw firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and United States military intervention. The trip angered Bono and {{formed the basis of}} the song's lyrics. He said, [...] "I remember the ground shaking, and I remember the smell, I suppose, of being near a war zone. I don't think we were in danger, but I knew there were lives in danger or being lost close to us, and I felt for them. It <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> as a person who read the Scriptures, to think that Christians in America were supporting this kind of thing, this kind of proxy war because of these Communists." [...] In August, after reconvening with his bandmates in Dublin to resume work on The Joshua Tree, Bono instructed the Edge to [...] "put El Salvador through an amplifier", resulting in the song's feedback-based guitar part. The Edge said that his guitar playing was also informed by Bono's lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Hoppus {{was born}} in Ridgecrest, California, on March 15, 1972, to Kerry Wernz and Tex Hoppus. Ridgecrest {{is a small town}} in the California desert, {{composed}} mainly of what Hoppus later described as [...] "geniuses, scientists, physicists and then just complete strung-out meth-heads". Hoppus' Finnish paternal great-grandparents, Aaron and Lempi Orrenmaa, emigrated to the U.S. from Laihia. His father, like many in Ridgecrest, worked for the U.S. Department of Defense, designing missiles and bombs for the town's Navy testing center. Hoppus describes himself as [...] "pretty mellow" [...] until his parents divorced when he was eight, which had a [...] "drastic, unsettling effect" [...] on him. [...] "When my parents argued, it was always behind closed doors. I remember sitting outside my parents' room when I was seven years old, hearing the dulled voice of anger behind the door. It <b>upset</b> <b>me</b> a lot." [...] Following these events, he spent two years shuffling between his parents' homes with sister Anne, until he and his father moved to nearby Monterey. His father was often away earning a postgraduate degree in college. He later would describe his childhood as lonely, remarking, [...] " [...] was living by myself in the fifth grade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his first}} Billboard Rhythm and Blues chart number one, [...] "3 O'Clock Blues" [...] (February 1952), B.B. King {{became one of}} the most {{important}} names in R music in the 1950s, amassing an impressive list of hits including [...] "You Know I Love You", [...] "Woke Up This Morning", [...] "Please Love Me", [...] "When My Heart Beats like a Hammer", [...] "Whole Lotta Love", [...] "You <b>Upset</b> <b>Me</b> Baby", [...] "Every Day I Have the Blues", [...] "Sneakin' Around", [...] "Ten Long Years", [...] "Bad Luck", [...] "Sweet Little Angel", [...] "On My Word of Honor", and [...] "Please Accept My Love". This led to a significant increase in his weekly earnings, from about $85 to $2,500, with appearances at major venues such as the Howard Theater in Washington and the Apollo in New York, as well as touring the entire [...] "Chitlin' circuit". 1956 became a record-breaking year, with 342 concerts booked and three recording sessions. That same year he founded his own record label, Blues Boys Kingdom, with headquarters at Beale Street in Memphis. There, among other projects, he produced artists such as Millard Lee and Levi Seabury. In 1962, King signed to ABC-Paramount Records, which was later absorbed into MCA Records, and which itself was later absorbed into Geffen Records. In November 1964, King recorded the Live at the Regal album at the Regal Theater. King later said that Regal Live [...] "is considered by some the best recording I've ever had [...] [...] [...] that particular day in Chicago everything came together [...] [...] [...]" ...|$|E

5000|$|In Ohio, {{state and}} local {{officials}} are investigating whether the accessing was illegal. Wurzelbacher responded on Fox News saying that, [...] "It <b>upsets</b> <b>me</b> greatly, to be honest with you." [...] John McCain responded later that day calling the actions, [...] "remarkable." [...] The Obama campaign responded that the access {{had nothing to do with}} the Obama campaign and that it should be fully investigated.|$|R
6000|$|I {{send you}} {{herewith}} {{a letter from}} the Queen which moves and almost [...] <b>upsets</b> <b>me.</b> It must have cost her much to write, and it is really a [...] pearl of great price.

6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] he said, with serenity. [...] "You needn't {{be afraid}} of <b>upsetting</b> <b>me.</b> It's the other fellow that'll be upset when he least expects it. I don't care a hang; {{but there will be}} some fun when he shows his mug to-morrow. I don't care that for the old man's pieces, but right is right. You shall see me put a head on that coon--whoever he is!" ...|$|R
