40|$|International audienceThe {{data from}} two {{high-frequency}} radars (HFR) {{operating in the}} Iroise Sea are re-processed by applying an improved version of the direction finding algorithm, removing wave-induced surface currents and the variational interpolation on a regular grid. Combining these processing techniques allowed reconstruction of the surface currents {{at a level of}} details that was not previously available. Refined resolution enabled to identify fine-scale structures of surface circulation, to quantify the variability of tidal currents and the residual (time averaged) velocity field, and to explain spatial intermittence in polarization of the tidal current ellipses. The analyzed data span two month-long periods in spring and late summer of 2007. The major findings include (a) a dipole structure in the vorticity field characterized by two oppositely rotating eddies, generated on the leeward side of the <b>Ushant</b> <b>Island</b> at flood (negative polarity) and at ebb (positive polarity); (b) an extremely strong fortnightly variability of tidal currents northwest of the <b>Ushant</b> <b>Island</b> with the highest velocity magnitude of 3. 9 m/s caused by the interference of the major semi-diurnal tidal constituents; (c) a significant contribution of the higher order nonlinear tidal harmonics to the surface currents in the Fromveur strait, which maintains strong tidal currents and affects the shape of their fortnightly modulation. The residual circulation is characterized by two distinct zones approximately separated by the 100 m isobath: in the offshore zone the residual currents have a significant contribution of the wind-driven component, whereas the nearshore zone is characterized by extremely strong (up to 0. 4 m/s) time-independent residual circulation featuring two permanent anticyclonic eddies: north of the western extremity of the Sein archipelago, and north the <b>Ushant</b> <b>Island.</b> The acquired data and the presented results could be useful for regional model validation and studies of the local eddy dynamics, tidal fronts, and passive tracer transport in the region...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ushant</b> <b>Island</b> is the westernmost island {{offshore}} western France. It {{is exposed}} to severe storms. The western peninsulas of the island are partly covered with boulder fields, the origin of which is an open question. On March 10, 2008 a very severe storm (973 hPa) was able to move some of these blocks and to raft them over several tens of meters. The heaviest block weighs about 62 tons. Some blocks were located in the intertidal zone, others were above the spring tide limit and were detached from the cliff during the storm. Most of the blocks had already existed before; thus, the event which actually caused their detachment was not the March 2008 storm. When applied to this case, the hydro-dynamical equations by NOTT would suggest a storm with wave heights of 12 to 50 meters. New equations by the authors reduce these values to about 8 to 32 meters. Anyhow, these heights have never been recorded in Ushant. These results thus lead to {{the hypothesis that the}} blocks were not created by a storm but by a tsunami, possibly the one of 1755 (Lisbon Tsunami). The important point is that these blocks have a polygenetic origin: they were detached from their initial location by an event which cannot have been a storm, but subsequently they were moved by each severe storm. Boulder fields on <b>Ushant</b> <b>Island,</b> therefore, seem to be polygenetic coastal high energy event features...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} {{refers to}} a companion modelling approach applied {{to the study of}} interactions between social and environmental dynamics in a small protected island, part of a biosphere reserve. This approach leads to a role-playing game designed by a pluridisciplinary workgroup (researchers and reserve manager), used as management support and as a tool to help people regarding the stakes of sustainable development. For several years, <b>Ushant</b> <b>Island</b> (Brittany, France) {{was in the process of}} social and environmental restructuration due to land use and land cover changes. Major land use changes resulted in fallow land encroachment and its consequences on landscape, traditional activities and biodiversity. This situation raises the question as to the different types of actors (stakeholders, scientists, local population) in relation to the future and the consequences of individual actions on common good. The stakes of sustainable development are set. In this study, the multidisciplinary process leads to a geographical agent-based model, simulations and a role-playing game. The role-playing game, final step of our companion modelling approach, is developed in order to assist the awareness raising and the involvement of all, be they elected representatives or not. This contribution describes the steps which led to the role-playing game design, the contents of the play sessions, their results and prospects in terms of learning tools. It examines the place of companion modelling and associated tools in the context of a dialogue, whose main issue remains the following question: "How?...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHourly Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fields {{derived from}} the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) are {{frequently}} used in studies of the diurnal cycle of the ocean. In this article, we focus on high frequency SST variability induced by tidal currents in the Iroise Sea, west of Brittany (France). This region {{is known for its}} strong tidal currents that are responsible in summer for the generation of an intense thermal front, the Ushant front. We use hourly MSG/SEVIRI derived SST to compute the displacements of this front. In {{the northern part of the}} front, at 48. 75 °N, we show that the longitudinal displacements of the front on subdiurnal time scales can be explained by the Lagrangian advection induced by surface currents. We also present maps of surface currents computed from hourly SEVIRI derived SST data using the Maximum Cross Correlation (MCC) method. Comparison of SEVIRI derived velocities with velocities obtained with high frequency (HF) radar measurements and a hindcast numerical simulation (Mercator Ocean) gives encouraging results in the northern part of the Ushant front, near the <b>Ushant</b> <b>Island.</b> Within that region, the mean bias of the SEVIRI velocities was below 0. 12 m·s− 1, with the standard deviation ranging from 0. 26 m·s− 1 during moderate tides to 0. 49 m·s− 1 during spring tides. Further offshore, where the surface thermal structures are weaker and the SST more homogeneous, currents derived using the MCC method were overestimated by 0. 3 m·s− 1 and showed larger error standard deviations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhereas {{numerous}} {{numerical modelling}} {{have been conducted}} to gain further insights about the hydrodynamic characteristics of tidal stream energy sites, the long-term transport of water particles has been routinely ignored. However, a refined evaluation of circulation pathways is fundamental to assess water-quality changes induced by tidal energy converters. The present study investigates the tide-induced Lagrangian circulation in northwestern coastal waters of Brittany (France, western Europe), including numerous islands, shoals and straits with strong potential for turbine farm implementation. Particular attention {{is dedicated to the}} hydrodynamic impact of tidal stream power extraction from a series of horizontal-axis turbines. An original approach, based on the coupling of the Lagrangian barycentric method with predictions from a model with high spatial resolution, is considered to assess circulation pathways in a single synoptic view. Spatial results reveal a complex Lagrangian circulation highly controlled by bathymetry and islands geometry. The residual flow in the Fromveur Strait, separating <b>Ushant</b> <b>island</b> fromMoì ene archipelago, displays thus a strong asymmetry, between a prominent northeastern pathway with residual currents up to 0. 45 m s − 1 and a southward circulation. The positions of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic recirculations, both upstream and downstream the Strait, are furthermore precisely defined. The north eddy is found closely located to the sand bank of the Four. The extraction of tidal stream power impacts mainly the residual Lagrangian circulation along the current stream emerging from the Strait, with a tendency for surrounding eddies to get closer to the tidal stream energy site. The displacements of the south and north recirculations may thus exceed 1. 5 km with possible implications on the evolution of surrounding seabed features...|$|E
