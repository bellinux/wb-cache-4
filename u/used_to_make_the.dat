5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century a mine was {{developed}} alongside the River Barle. The mine was originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was a copper mine from 1845–54 and then an iron mine until 1857, although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. At Simonsbath, a restored Victorian water-powered sawmill, which was damaged in the floods of 1992, has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order; it is now <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> footpath signs, gates, stiles and bridges for various sites in the park.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E

5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail riders, who appreciate their gaits, stamina and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters and trail riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed, stamina and gait, and members of the breed were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> first horse-back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|The Andriamboninolona (or Zanakambony), Andriandranando (or Zafinandriandranando) and Zanaralambo were {{considered}} junior nobles.

Instead, they were made responsible for maintaining a key dike that supported irrigation of the capital's rice paddies, producing the silk <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> king's clothing, and conscripting soldiers for the king's army. They were also responsible for gathering used hoes for the royal blacksmiths to melt down and then supervise the artisans as the metal was crafted into nails, shackles and other forged objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{ytterbium}} +3 ion {{is used as}} a {{doping material}} in active laser media, specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers. Ytterbium lasers are highly efficient, have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses; ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> laser. Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1.06–1.12µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900nm–1µm, dependently on the host and application. The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling.|$|E

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

Over 38 different types of foam were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm fronds from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the Patchy the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 pounds of googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 pounds of woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 bunches of craft flowers (to create the parade float).|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised {{it was because of the}} chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.|$|E

Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
