5|$|Peaking at only 146 on the Billboard 200, {{the album}} was not a {{commercial}} success, and received only lukewarm critical attention. The UHF soundtrack {{is one of only}} a few of Yankovic's studio albums that is not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. It would also be Yankovic's last studio album to be released on vinyl record in the <b>US</b> <b>until</b> 2011's Alpocalypse.|$|E
5|$|The new cent {{was issued}} in {{exchange}} for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>until</b> then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they choked commercial channels, especially as they were not legal tender and no one had to take them. The eagle design did not strike well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's Indian Head cent.|$|E

Morgan scored 14 goals in a 12-match stretch from January to late May 2012, including three straight two-goal efforts.

5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the <b>US</b> <b>until</b> it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted {{to look like a}} fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station was {{released}} in January 1976 and reached No. 3 on Billboards Top LPs & Tape, remaining on the chart for 32 weeks.

5|$|After {{reading the}} novella, Mansfield was {{intrigued}} by {{the opportunity to play}} a dual role. He secured the right to adapt the story for the stage in the United States and the United Kingdom, and asked Sullivan to write the adaptation. The play debuted in Boston in May 1887, and a revised version opened on Broadway in September of that year. Critics acclaimed Mansfield's performance as the dual character. The play was popular in New York and on tour, and Mansfield was invited to bring it to London. It opened there in August 1888, just before the first Jack the Ripper murders. Some press reports compared the murderer to the Jekyll-Hyde character, and Mansfield was suggested as a possible suspect. Despite significant press coverage, the London production was a financial failure. Mansfield's company continued to perform the play on tours of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>until</b> shortly before his death in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Although Crash! Boom! Bang! saw chart success (No.1 in Sweden, No.2 in Germany & Australia, No.3 in the UK), it sold fewer copies {{than had}} their {{previous}} albums. EMI America {{were reluctant to}} release the album, and instead promoted a shortened 10-track Favorites CD in association with McDonald's. The Favorites of Crash! Boom! Bang! CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies. It was noted by journalists that the McDonald's promotion CD and other CDs by Tina Turner, Garth Brooks and Elton John, led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion on several fronts, including that it bypassed established music stores and {{that the price of}} the CD was way below normal wholesale costs. Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI, with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling all products from CEMA (EMI's distribution wing) out of its sales and ad campaigns. Relations with EMI's North American subsidiary, never on the best of terms, collapsed after the release of this album. Crash! Boom! Bang! became the last Roxette release EMI would issue in the <b>US,</b> <b>until</b> Greatest Hits was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records.|$|E
5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government {{took an interest in}} her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While {{she and her husband were}} travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the <b>US</b> <b>until</b> 1987.|$|E
