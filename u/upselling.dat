25|$|<b>Upselling</b> {{and cross}} selling are {{sometimes}} known as suggestive selling. When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants {{can try to}} sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or can suggest complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the sales assistant might suggest plastic slicers that do not damage the non-stick surface.|$|E
2500|$|H2NO {{refers to}} an <b>upselling</b> {{campaign}} by Coca-Cola to dissuade consumers from ordering tap water drinks at restaurants, and to instead order more profitable soft drinks, non-carbonated beverages, or bottled water.

The program taught waiters how to use [...] "suggestive selling techniques" [...] to {{offer a variety of}} alternative beverages when diners asked for water.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} PC industry, declines in prices along with {{commensurate}} increases in computer performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities {{to engage in}} <b>upselling.</b> As a result, the company was selling {{a greater proportion of}} inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. Dell's customer service worsened as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure. Although, Dell originally was known for high levels of customer service, the decline in computer prices led to the company cutting costs. Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting [...] "got in the way," [...] aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve customer service, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional [...] "bloatware" [...] on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the [...] "Dell Hell" [...] prominent on Internet search engines.|$|E

Eventus were cautioned for falsely marketing their pies as 'home-made'.|$|R
50|$|<b>Upselling</b> is a sales {{technique}} where {{a seller}} induces the customer to purchase more expensive items, upgrades or other add-ons {{in an attempt}} to make a more profitable sale. While it usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered. (A different technique is cross-selling in which a seller tries to sell something else.) In practice, large businesses usually combine <b>upselling</b> and cross-selling to maximize profit.|$|E
50|$|Another way of <b>upselling</b> is {{creating}} fear over {{the durability of}} the purchase, particularly effective on expensive items such as electronics, where an extended warranty can offer peace of mind.|$|E

50|$|Growing same store sales can be {{explained}} by a number of reasons, including: marketshare gains in a retailer's trade areas; higher average purchases and/or more frequent customer visits; and successfully cross-selling into a broader product range or <b>upselling</b> to more expensive ones.|$|E

50|$|For an <b>upsell</b> to be successful, {{a seller}} must give a {{detailed}} demonstration, {{to show how}} the product will benefit the customer. An example could be seen as booking a hotel room for your family, then being offered a premium package, which is although more expensive includes breakfast and dinner for the entire family.

The benefit is given to the customer answering the question, “why should they change their minds?” And the total amount of the sale increases.|$|R

If a seller is unable to do so, it {{could result in a}} damaged relationship with the customer, a tarnished reputation for the brand and can also influence the sale negatively. Customers are more likely to trust salespeople who are confident in what they are selling.|$|R
