50|$|Two Italian scientists, Fontana and Tozzetti, first {{explained}} the stem rust fungus in wheat in 1767. Thirty years later it received its name, Puccinia graminis, by Persoon, and in 1854 brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne discovered the characteristic five-spore stage {{that is known}} to some stem rust species.

5000|$|The disease cycle for Canna Rust has {{not been}} fully {{discovered}}, but there are several known pieces. Urediniospores (or uredospores), asexual rust spores, have been discovered on the leaf surface. [...] The color of the <b>urediniospore</b> can range from a golden to a yellow-orange, and are egg or pear shaped. The urediniospores {{are responsible for the}} spread of the rust to new leaf tissue. In addition, the overwintering spores that produce basidiospores, also known as teliospores, have been located on the leaf surface. The teliospores range from cylindrical to club shaped, and sized from 50−83 × 14−21 μm. Basidiospores are the sexual spores of rusts. There have been no pycnia or aecia located on Canna Rust. However, Puccinia thaliae has been known to cause rust on several cannabis species and on arrowroot which are other uredial hosts. The pathogen is likely mobile in the plant leaf allowing it to spread across the leaf surface. The overwintering stage occurs during the wet and cold seasons.|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{temperature}} on <b>urediniospore</b> production in Puccinia arachidis was investigated under monocyclic infection using detached {{leaves of the}} susceptible peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivar TMV 2. Urediniospores produced at different temperatures were also examined for their germinability in vitro. The optimal temperature for <b>urediniospore</b> production was at about 20 and 25 C. Temperatures below 20 C or above 30 C were highly detrimental to <b>urediniospore</b> production. There were also marked differences in the percent germination of urediniospores produced at different temperatures. Urediniospores produced at 20 and 25 C showed the highest germination percentages. The interaction {{of temperature}} with <b>urediniospore</b> production and germinability is important in understanding the development of peanut rust epidemics...|$|E
50|$|<b>Urediniospores</b> {{are formed}} in {{structures}} called uredinia, which {{are produced by}} fungal mycelia on the cereal host 1-2 weeks after infection. The <b>urediniospores</b> are dikaryotic (contain two un-fused, haploid nuclei in one cell) and are formed on individual stalks within the uredinium. They are spiny and brick-red. <b>Urediniospores</b> are the only type of spores in the rust fungus life cycle which are capable of infecting the host on which they are produced, and this is therefore {{referred to as the}} 'repeating stage' of the life cycle. It is the spread of <b>urediniospores</b> which allows infection to spread from one cereal plant to another. This phase can rapidly spread the infection over a wide area.|$|R
50|$|Since the <b>urediniospores</b> are {{produced}} on the cereal host and can infect the cereal host, {{it is possible}} for the infection to pass from one year's crop to the next without infecting the alternate host (barberry). For example, infected volunteer wheat plants can serve as a bridge from one growing season to another. In other cases the fungus passes between winter wheat and spring wheat, meaning that it has a cereal host all year round. Since the <b>urediniospores</b> are wind dispersed, this can occur over large distances. Note that this cycle consists simply of vegetative propagation - <b>urediniospores</b> infect one wheat plant, leading to the production of more <b>urediniospores</b> which then infect other wheat plants.|$|R

40|$|Although rust {{can reduce}} grain yields of late-planted sorghum crops in Queensland, little {{research}} has been conducted on environmental parameters affecting infection and development. The effects of temperature, leaf wetness period, plant growth stage, <b>urediniospore</b> concentration and darkness period on the development of rust (Puccinia purpurea) on the inbred Sorghum bicolor line IS 8525 were evaluated separately by artificial inoculation of plants under controlled conditions. Rust developed between 16 and 28 °C, with the optimum temperature being 20 °C. Disease severity (pustules cm− 2) increased as the length of leaf wetness increased from 4 to 24 h. Infection occurred when plants were exposed to full light, full darkness and varying periods of darkness for the first 24 h after inoculation; 16 h of darkness resulted in the highest rust severity. Plants of IS 8525 and of the more resistant line IS 12539 inoculated 21 – 49 days after sowing developed higher levels of rust than others inoculated at, or close to, flowering (63 days after sowing). Rust severity also increased with increasing <b>urediniospore</b> concentrations, but leaf death occurred on young plants inoculated with the highest concentration (50 mg 100 mL water− 1).

40|$|The wheat stripe rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), {{does not}} have a known {{alternate}} host for sexual reproduction, which makes it impossible to study gene linkages through classic genetic and molecular mapping approaches. In this study, we compared 4, 219 Pst expression sequence tags (ESTs) to the genomic sequence of P. graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), the wheat stem rust fungus, using BLAST searches. The percentages of homologous genes varied greatly among different Pst libraries with 54. 51 %, 51. 21 %, and 13. 61 % for the <b>urediniospore,</b> germinated <b>urediniospore,</b> and haustorial libraries, respectively, with an average of 33. 92 %. The 1, 432 Pst genes with significant homology with Pgt sequences were grouped into physical groups corresponding to 237 Pgt supercontigs. The physical relationship was demonstrated by 12 pairs (57 %), out of 21 selected Pst gene pairs, through PCR screening of a Pst BAC library.

40|$|Abstract Background Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is an obligate biotrophic {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} leaf stripe rust on wheat. Although {{it is critical}} to understand molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in the wheat stripe rust fungus for developing novel disease management strategies, little is known about its genome and gene functions due to difficulties in molecular studies with this important pathogen. To identify genes expressed during early infection stages, in this study we constructed a cDNA library with RNA isolated from urediniospores of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici germinated for 10 h. Results A total of 4798 ESTs were sequenced from the germinated <b>urediniospore</b> library and assembled into 315 contigs and 803 singletons. About 23. 9 % and 13. 3 % of the resulting 1118 unisequences were homologous to functionally characterized proteins and hypothetical proteins, respectively. The rest 62. 8 % unisequences had no significant homologs in GenBank. Several of these ESTs shared significant homology with known fungal pathogenicity or virulence factors, such as HESP 767 of the flax rust and PMK 1, GAS 1, and GAS 2 of the rice blast fungus. We selected six ESTs (Ps 28, Ps 85, Ps 87, Ps 259, Ps 261, and Ps 159) for assaying their expression patterns during <b>urediniospore</b> germination and wheat infection by quantitative real-time PCR. All of them had the highest transcript level in germinated urediniospores and a much less transcript level in un-germinated urediniospores and infected wheat tissues (1 – 7 dpi). The transcript level of Ps 159 increased at later infection stages (6 – 7 dpi). Our data indicated that these genes were highly expressed in germinated urediniospores and may play important roles in fungal-plant interactions during early infection stages in the wheat stripe rust fungus. Conclusion Genes expressed in germinated urediniospores of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici were identified by EST analysis.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 North American {{cultivation}} of Ribes L. may expand as small fruit growers seek species to diversify horticultural crops. The Ribes industry was suppressed for decades {{out of fear}} that cultivated black currants and gooseberries would intensify the fungal disease white pine blister rust (WPBR) on five-needle pine (Pinus L. section Quinquefoliae) species. These pines were historically vital to the timber industry. Today, plant breeders seek to strengthen the Ribes small fruit industry through production of material suitable for North American conditions. Paramount to this effort is the development of resistance against major pests and diseases. Growers must be able to recognize the attributes of available genotypes prior to field establishment. The objectives of this research were to determine disease resistance and phenological characteristics of Ribes selections at the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR) in Corvallis, Oregon. Since the early 1930 's, plant breeders have used immune black currant (R. nigrum L.) germplasm as a control tactic against the exotic WPBR, caused by the basidiomycete fungus Cronartium ribicola J. C. Fischer. In 1999, a seedling population was generated at the NCGR from a cross involving susceptible pistillate R. nigrum 'Ben Lomond' and immune staminate parent R. ussuriense Jancz. x R. nigrum 'Consort. ' To test the inheritance of resistance in the F₁ population, aeciospore and <b>urediniospore</b> treatments were applied in 2008 to single-leaf softwood cuttings under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. Resistant F₁ phenotypes segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio consistent with the pattern of simple dominant inheritance of a single gene. Artificial inoculations testing aeciospore and <b>urediniospore</b> infectivity produced equivalent disease severity in the experimental Ribes genotypes. Resistance to the native powdery mildew fungus, Podosphaera mors-uvae (Schwein.) U. Brown and S. Takamatsu, was also evaluated in the F₁ population. Individuals segregated for resistance in a 1 : 3 ratio after exposure to elevated disease pressure in the greenhouse.

In this study, four F 2 populations of G. tomentella derived from crossing a rust susceptible (PI 441011) with four rust resistant accessions (441008, 483218, 509501, and 583970) were evaluated for rust resistance. About 100 F 2 individuals per population and parents were inoculated with P. pachyrhizi under controlled greenhouse conditions. Rust resistance was assessed on a qualitative scale based on lesion color and sporulation of uredinia. Segregation analysis of F 2 populations indicated several genetic models explained the inheritance of resistance based on how the data were interpreted; the models included one dominant gene and two dominant genes. The rust resistance gene or genes in these four accessions of G. tomentella may represent unique resistance to P. pachyrhizi not found in soybean. Survival and production of <b>urediniospores</b> of P. pachyrhizi depends on its hosts, the environment, and exposure to fungicides. In this study, uredinia in infected leaves were washed, incubated at different temperatures and fungicide concentrations, and evaluated for re-sporulation and germination of <b>urediniospores.</b> There was a significant (P < 0. 05) temperature effect on uredinia production of <b>urediniospores</b> and their germination.

In 1998, virulence phenotypes MDRR and MDRM (virulent on Lr 1, 3, 3 ka, 10, 11, 23, 24, and 30) were the most prevalent. In both years, virulence frequency was above 80 % to genes Lr 1, 3, 3 ka, 10, 11, 23, 24, and 30 and below 21 % to Lr 2 a, 17, and 26. Virulence frequency to Lr 2 c was 37 % in 1997 and 22 % in 1998. No virulence was found to Lr 9, 16, or 21 in either year. New virulence phenotypes were detected in 1998 that were not found in 1997. In 1998, virulence was less frequent on Lr 2 a, 2 c, 3 ka, 18, 24, and 26 and more frequent on Lr 17 than in 1997...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the durable resistance in a near isogenic line of spring wheat (Triticum aestivalis L.), possessing resistance gene Yr- 18 to some isolates (race specific resistance) of stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici), namely Thatcher Yr- 18 and durable resistance of an cultivar of spring wheat to all isolates of stripe rust (race non- specific resistance), namely Hybrid de Berse'e. In this investigation fresh urediniospores of two isolates namely SRC 99 (race 70 E 128) and SRC 89 (race 14 E 14), were collected from a susceptible cultivar of spring wheat, Avocet, as inoculums. Then suspension of spore in mineral oil [Soltrol 170 (5 mg/ml) ] were sprayed on third and flag leaves of the booth genotypes mentioned above and on the Thatcher cultivar which was susceptible to booth isolates. The Percentage of <b>urediniospore</b> germination, latent period and infection types of all susceptible and resistant genotypes to booth isolates were determined in four replicates at seedling and adult plant stages. Mean percentage of spore germination and the value of latent period were analyzed separately in each replicate, and then compared using analysis of variance and the Student- Newman Keuls test. The results indicated that urediniospoe germination in all genotypes / isolates / leaf stage combination was high and neither resistance type affected spore germination significantly. In both types o...|$|E
40|$|The barley stem rust {{resistance}} gene Reaction to Puccinia graminis 1 (Rpg 1), encoding a receptor-like kinase, confers durable {{resistance to}} the stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. The fungal <b>urediniospores</b> form adhesion structures with the leaf epidermal cells within 1 h of inoculation, followed by hyphae and haustorium formation. The RPG 1 protein is constitutively expressed and not phosphorylated. On inoculation with avirulent <b>urediniospores,</b> it is phosphorylated in vivo within 5 min and subsequently degraded. Application of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide loops prevented the formation of adhesion structures for spore attachment, the phosphorylation of RPG 1, and germination of the viable spores. Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid affinity chromatography of proteins from the ungerminated avirulent rust spores led to the purification and identification of a protein with fibronectin type III and breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein domains and a vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 9 with a coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation domain. Both proteins are required to induce in vivo phosphorylation and degradation of RPG 1. Combined application of both proteins caused hypersensitive reaction on the stem rust-resistant cultivar Morex {{but not on the}} susceptible cultivar Steptoe. Expression studies indicated that mRNA of both genes are present in ungerminated <b>urediniospores</b> and are constitutively transcribed in sporelings, infected leaves, and haustoria in the investigated avirulent races. Evidence is presented that RPG 1, in yeast, interacts with the two protein effectors from the <b>urediniospores</b> that activate cooperatively the stem rust resistance protein RPG 1 long before haustoria formation...|$|R
5000|$|... "Yellow rust" [...] {{takes its}} name from the {{appearance}} of yellow-colored stripes produced parallel along the venations of each leaf blade. These yellow stripes are actually characteristic of uredinia that produce yellow colored <b>urediniospores.</b> Primary hosts of yellow rust are Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), Triticum turgidum (durum wheat), triticale, and a few Hordeum vulgare (barley) cultivars. The alternate host was discovered by accident in 2010. Species of common barberry plants (the alternate host of wheat stem rust) were found harbouring stripe rust. When transferred to grass hosts, Kentucky Bluegrass was successfully infected and <b>urediniospores</b> were produced. Several species of Berberis were then investigated as alternate hosts of Wheat stripe rust and inoculations were successful.|$|R
50|$|Rust spores, called <b>Urediniospores,</b> {{are able}} to {{penetrate}} the plant cells directly, rather than through natural openings or through wounds in the leaf tissue. Thus infection is relatively quick: about 9 to 10 days from initial infection to the next cycle of spore production.|$|R
