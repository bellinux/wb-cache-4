40|$|A {{combined}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) and experimental study of interaction of main gas path and rim sealing flow is reported. The experiments were conducted on a two stage axial turbine and included pressure measurements for the cavity formed between the stage 2 rotor disc and the <b>upstream</b> <b>diaphragm</b> for two values of the diaphragm-to-rotor axial clearance. The pressure measurements indicate that ingestion of the highly swirling annulus flow leads to increased vortex strength within the cavity. This effect is particularly strong for the larger axial clearance. Results {{from a number of}} steady and unsteady CFD models have been compared to the measured results. Good agreement between measurement and calculation for time-averaged pressures was obtained using unsteady CFD models, which predicted previously unknown unsteady flow features. This led to fest response pressure transducer measurements being made on the rig, and these confirmed the CED prediction...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mechanism}} by which disturbances can cause tripping between steady-flow regular and Mach reflection in the dual-solution domain is presented. Computational {{results indicate that the}} disturbance shock created {{as a result of the}} impact of dense particles on one of the shock-generating wedges can cause transition from regular to Mach reflection. The disturbance shock may also be generated by direct energy deposition on the wedge. Estimates of the lower bound of the required energy for transition to occur are presented and compared to values obtained computationally. Experiments were performed at Mach 4. 0 in a Ludwieg tube that has a test duration of 100 ms. Proper starting of the flow necessitated operation with an <b>upstream</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and modifications in the dump tank. The reflection state was changed by rapid rotation of one of the shock-generating wedges. The flow in the facility is sufficiently quiet to permit entering the dual-solution domain to approximately its midpoint before spontaneous transition to the Mach reflection occurs. The short test time prompted a {{study of the}} effect of wedge rotation speed on the transition from regular to Mach reflection. Transition due to deposition of energy on one of the wedges was also examined by using a pulsed laser focused on one of the two wedges. Measurements of the minimum energy to bring about transition and of the rapid growth of the Mach stem to its steady-state are compared to numerical and theoretical predictions...|$|E
3000|$|The diameters of the IVC were {{measured}} with tracings {{perpendicular to the}} vessel walls approximately 2 – 3  cm <b>upstream</b> to the <b>diaphragm</b> (Fig.  1 d). The maximal expiratory and inspiratory diameter was measured in the same respiratory cycle with the guidance of a respiration curve automatically generated from respiratory changes in thoracic impedance. The distensibility of the IVC was calculated as: [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{condensation}} by {{homogeneous nucleation}} of ethanol (200 proof) and of n-propanol (99. 98 %) carried at small mole fraction in dry air (99. 995 %) was {{studied in the}} unsteady, isentropic expansion of a shock tube. Samples of the vapor at different partial pressures in dry air at room temperature were expanded into the liquid coexistence regime of the condensing species. A Kristler pressure transducer and Rayleigh light scattering were {{used to measure the}} pressure in the expansion and the onset of condensation. Condensation was observed at different locations between 0. 15 and 1 m <b>upstream</b> of the <b>diaphragm</b> location, which correspond to different cooling rates of of the vapor samples about 50 to 10 C/ms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{liquefaction}} analysis procedure {{conducted at}} a dam foundation {{associated with a}} layer of liquefiable sand is presented. In this case, the effects of the overlying dam and an embedded diaphragm wall on liquefaction potential of foundation soils are considered. The analysis follows the stress-based approach which compares the earthquake-induced cyclic stresses with the cyclic resistance of the soil, and the cyclic resistance of the sand under complex stress condition is the key issue. Comprehensive laboratory monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests are conducted to evaluate the static characteristics, dynamic characteristics and the cyclic resistance against liquefaction of the foundation soils. The distribution of the factor of safety considering liquefaction is given. It is found that the zones beneath the dam edges and near the <b>upstream</b> of the <b>diaphragm</b> wall are more susceptible to liquefaction than in free field, whereas the zone beneath the center of the dam is less susceptible to liquefaction than in free field. According to the results, the strategies of ground improvement are proposed to mitigate the liquefaction hazards...|$|R
