5|$|The work {{is widely}} admired by biologists, anthropologists and architects among others, but less often read than cited. Peter Medawar {{explains}} this as being because it clearly pioneered {{the use of}} mathematics in biology, and helped to defeat mystical ideas of vitalism; but that the book is weakened by Thompson's failure to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of evolution and evolutionary history in shaping living structures. Philip Ball and Michael Ruse, on the other hand, suspect that while Thompson argued for physical mechanisms, his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the four}} theories, the feature {{mismatch}} hypothesis and the temporal discrimination model lack solid evidence and are inadequate. These two models differ {{slightly from the}} distractor inhibition model and episode retrieval model respectively and {{can be incorporated into}} the latter two. The distractor inhibition model was the dominant model until recent contradicting findings pointed to a retrieval mechanism in negative priming. The episode retrieval model is gaining more support for the memory based negative priming but lacks in its explanation of the association tags. Perhaps, further research exploring both these models may help to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of negative priming in attention, memory and cognition.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide has {{roles in}} both blood {{coagulation}} and anticoagulation. Sulfatide has anticoagulation activity when it binds to fibrinogen, which prevents fibrinogen from converting to fibrin. Sulfatide {{also has a}} direct inhibitory effect on thrombosis. On the other hand, sulfatide also helps to improve blood coagulation and thrombosis: first, sulfatide is believed to aid in thrombosis through its participation with coagulation factor XII; second, sulfatide binding to annexin V accelerates coagulation; third, sulfatide and P-selectin interactions expressed on platelets, help to ensure stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. However, most of these conclusions have been drawn using exogenous forms of sulfatide. Consequently, additional research and experimentation on endogenous sulfatide is necessary to fully <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of sulfatide in coagulation and thrombosis. Sulfatide is also present in serum lipoproteins, which {{are believed to be}} associated with the cause and development of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Emory University {{research}} is heavily {{funded by the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes of Health. The federal agency awarded the university nearly $300 million {{in the fiscal year}} of 2015. In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, an Emory-led research consortium received a five-year, 15 million dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research human immune responses to Varicella zoster virus and pneumococcal vaccination. The university also received a $9 million grant over five years from the NIH to support one of three national Centers for Collaborative Research in Fragile X syndrome. The grant is a renewal of Emory’s National Fragile X Research Center, continuously funded by the NIH for more than 10 years. In 2015, the university received a $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received a $8 million grant over five years from the NIH to develop and validate mathematical models of how prior immunity affects recall immune responses to influenza viruses. The researchers will create and disseminate powerful, user-friendly modeling tools for use by the wider research community in developing more effective vaccines. In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over five years from the NIH {{to examine the effects of}} maternal stress on brain function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome. In 2015, the university received a $3.5 million grant over five years from the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) for an Informatics Technology for Cancer Research award. Winship Cancer Institute and Emory School of Medicine researchers will develop software tools to help the cancer research community gain new insights from cancer imaging “big data” and develop new open-source cancer research applications. In 2015, the university received a $3.4 million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India.|$|E

500|$|Magoon's primary {{responsibilities}} {{within the}} Canal Zone were to improve sanitation and {{to deal with}} the all-too-common outbreaks of yellow fever and malaria. At first, he refused to believe that the diseases were carried by mosquitos because, he reasoned, the native population would have been more affected. At this time, the nature of human acquired immunity to diseases was not well understood. The Chicago Tribune, in an article about conditions in the canal, referred to the notion that yellow fever was carried by mosquitos as [...] "bugaboo". However, by January 1906, Magoon had long come to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of mosquitos in the transmission of diseases, as evidenced in a New York Times article wherein Magoon addressed criticisms of his administration in detail; by then he had undertaken a vigorous and ambitious plan to eliminate the swamps that bred mosquitos.|$|E
500|$|Churches of Christ have {{historically}} {{had the most}} conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the Restoration Movement, understanding baptism by immersion to be {{a necessary part of}} conversion. [...] The most significant disagreements concerned {{the extent to which a}} correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. [...] David Lipscomb consistently argued that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> baptism plays in salvation. [...] Austin McGary argued strongly that to be valid, the convert must also understand that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. [...] McGary's view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared. [...] More recently, the rise of the International Churches of Christ, who [...] "reimmersed some who came into their fellowship, even those previously immersed 'for remission of sins' in a Church of Christ," [...] has caused some to reexamine the question of rebaptism.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> conjunction of faculty roles as teachers and as researchers. This understanding is pursued through philosophical analysis. Discourse ethics, in particular, {{is used as}} a framework by which to best <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> played by faculty and if <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> of teacher and researcher are, in fact, commensurable. The purpose of the work is two-fold: 1) to develop a construct that may be used by future researchers to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> played by faculty, and 2) to suggest a best-construct that enables future researchers to propose how actual lived roles should be instantiated in the world. The dissertation reviews a series of university handbooks, professional association ethical guidelines, and philosophical arguments to establish how <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> of faculty are best <b>understood.</b> <b>The</b> investigation illuminates the tensions at the heart of faculty roles. This tension is not definitionally embedded in <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> of faculty as teacher and researcher. Rather, the tension emerges from the failure of institutions to fully actualize faculty roles as normatively grounded in human communicative interaction. As a result, the work suggests that in order to best resolve the cognitive dissonance that may be experienced as a result of role ambiguity, faculty should engage in a process of self-reflection and community dialectic in order to best determine how “faculty” can be actualized in a way that best benefits all stakeholders...|$|R
