40|$|Considering the {{influence}} of group piles, a prediction model for three-dimensional ground surface settlement induced by circular metro tunnels excavation in incompressible rock masses is proposed based on the stochastic medium theory and the shear displacement method. The surface settlement caused by the metro tunnel opening {{is divided into two}} parts. One part is soil mass settlement caused by the metro tunnel opening and calculated by the stochastic medium theory. The other part is the settlement induced by the friction force between the group piles and the soil mass around the metro tunnel cross section and calculated by the shear displacement method. The three-dimensional prediction of the ground surface settlement is obtained by the linear superposition of the two parts. The validation of the proposed prediction approach is proved by comparing with the measured data and the numerical model of the double tunnels under the Puyuan overpass where metro tunnels <b>undercrossed</b> group piles. The effects of buried depth, radial convergences, center distance of double tunnels, position and size of piles, and group piles are analyzed and discussed. The improved prediction approach can be applied to calculate the three-dimensional ground settlement, especially for the metro tunnels crossing through group piles...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{school is}} the mirror of a society. To create and develop good {{education}} means to realize objectives that would reflect its sense. In current education, the hierarchy of values that should be set and implemented is asymmetrically positioned. In successful school, the student should become the meaning {{and the purpose of}} the content that will introduce him/her into the world of competition and competence in order to enable successful communication with it. How can a teaching lesson become a workshop in which new ideas, creative solutions, new forms of research and new knowledge are being <b>undercrossed?!</b> The research that has been done in this paper aims to investigate the introduction of practical teaching and application of reforms in teaching biology in the six primary urban schools in Stip, R. Macedonia. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews made with 11 experienced teachers of biology and were analyzed their class planes. The results showed that teachers occasionally introduced a small number of enhanced instructional strategies that explicitly match the formal curriculum in their classes, such as: presenting, analyzing and generalizing experimental results from practical teaching of biology in various forms. However, teachers have used fewer strategies that target encouraging higher level thinking, such as to induce students to ask questions or to learn about problem solving strategies used during lessons. Differences were identified between teachers regarding the use of rich teaching strategies during lessons, and their beliefs about the abilities of students to develop the ability to think at a higher level...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of deformation and damage mechanisms induced by shallow tunnelling on masonrystructures {{is carried out}} using an integrated, geotechnical and structural, numerical approach based on two-dimensional finite-element analyses. The masonry construction, schematised as a block structure with periodic texture, is regarded at a macroscopic scale as a homogenised anisotropic medium. The overall mechanical properties display anisotropy and singularities in the yield surface, arising from the discrete nature of the block structure and the geometrical arrangement of the blocks. The soil ismodelled {{by means of a}} linear elastic-perfectly plastic model. The numerical analyses are performed assuming plane strain and plane stress conditions for the soil and the masonry structure, respectively. A displacement-controlled technique is adopted to simulate the tunnel construction, which produces settlement troughs in agreement with the empirical Gaussian predictions at different volume losses under free-field conditions. In order to test the numerical approach, a preliminary set of parametric analyses is carried out considering a simple masonry wall, characterised by different geometrical and mechanical properties, founded on a clayey deposit. Then, the case study of the Felice aqueduct in Rome (Italy), <b>undercrossed</b> by two tunnels of a new metro line, is considered. Significant differences are observed between the uncoupled analysis, where displacements predicted under free-field conditionsare simply applied at the foundation level of the structure, and the interaction-based one, the latter being characterised by a reduced amount of tensile plastic strain. Numerical results in terms of vertical displacements at the ground level and on the structure are found to be in good agreement with monitoring data, thus validating the numerical model for this class of soil-structure interaction problems...|$|R
40|$|This work {{illustrates}} a soil-tunnel-structure interaction study performed by an integrated,geotechnical and structural,approach based on 3 D finite element analyses and validated against experimental observations. The study aims at analysing {{the response of}} reinforced concrete framed buildings on discrete foundations in interaction with metro lines. It refers {{to the case of}} the twin tunnels of the Milan (Italy) metro line 5,recently built in coarse grained materials using EPB machines,for which subsidence measurements collected along ground and building sections during tunnelling were available. Settlements measured under freefield conditions are firstly back interpreted using Gaussian empirical predictions. Then,the in situ measurements’ analysis is extended to include the evolving response of a 9 storey reinforced concrete building while being <b>undercrossed</b> by the metro line. In the finite element study,the soil mechanical behaviour is described using an advanced constitutive model. This latter,when combined with a proper simulation of the excavation process, proves to realistically reproduce the subsidence profiles under free field conditions and to capture the interaction phenomena occurring between the twin tunnels during the excavation. Furthermore, when the numerical model is extended to include the building, schematised in a detailed manner, the results are in good agreement with the monitoring data for different stages of the twin tunnelling. Thus, they indirectly confirm the satisfactory performance of the adopted numerical approach which also allows a direct evaluation of the structural response as an outcome of the analysis. Further analyses are also carried out modelling the building with different levels of detail. The results highlight that, in this case, the simplified approach based on the equivalent plate schematisation is inadequate to capture the real tunnelling induced displacement field. The overall behaviour of the system proves to be mainly influenced by the buried portion of the building which plays an essential role in the interaction mechanism, due to its high stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is endemic in Eurasian {{wild boar}} (Sus scrofa) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) {{in south central}} Spain, where {{evidence}} suggests transmission to domestic cattle. Known risk factors for TB at the interface between livestock and wild ungulate species include density and spatial overlap, particularly around waterholes during summer. We evaluated the effectiveness of selective exclusion measures for reducing direct and indirect interaction between extensive beef cattle and wild ungulates at waterholes as an alternative for the integrated control of TB. We first monitored 6 water points (WP) with infrared-triggered cameras at a TB positive cattle farm to quantify interactions. We then assigned 3 WP to be “cattle-only” and 3 to be “wildlife-only”. Cattle-only WP were surrounded with a wildlifeproof fence (2. 5 m high) and an original design of cattle-specific gate. Wildlife-only WP were surrounded by a fence that wild ungulates could breach but cattle could not (1. 2 m high). Red deer, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wild boar easily jumped or <b>undercrossed</b> this fence. Wildlife-only fences were 100 % effective in preventing cattle access to WP and did not impede wildlife use. Many cows learned to operate the cattle-specific gate quickly and others followed and learned from them.
