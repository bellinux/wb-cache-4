25|$|Chloroplasts develop from proplastids when {{seedlings}} {{emerge from}} the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo {{and in the absence}} of light, proplastids develop into etioplasts that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo etiolation. An <b>underexposure</b> to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the fetal}} stages, {{hormonal}} influences of androgen, specifically testosterone, cause feminine qualities {{in regard to}} sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males. In typical sexual development, females are exposed to minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed {{to high levels of}} testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks {{play a critical role in}} this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen <b>underexposure</b> while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure. However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.|$|E

40|$|For various applications, such as object {{recognition}} or tracking {{and especially when}} the object is partly occluded or articulated, 3 D information is crucial for the robustness of the application. A recently developed sensor to aquire distance information {{is based on the}} photo mixer device (PMD) technique. This article presents an easy but accurate data acquisition method for data evaluation of a customary sensor. Data evaluation focuses on the detection of the over- and <b>underexposured</b> data under consideration of objects with two different albedos. This improves the exactitude of the data {{for the study of the}} systematic errors of this sensor. Therefore the work of this article can be seen as an intermediate result on the way to a PMD range imaging sensor calibration. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a framework for}} {{improving the quality of}} personal photos by using a person’s favorite photographs as examples. We observe that the majority of a person’s photographs include the faces of a photographer’s family and friends and often the errors in these photographs are the most disconcerting. We focus on correcting these types of images and use common faces across images to automatically perform both global and face-specific corrections. Our system achieves this by using face detection to align faces between “good ” and “bad ” photos such that properties of the good examples can be used to correct a bad photo. These “personal ” photos provide strong guidance for a number of operations and, as a result, enable a number of high-quality image processing operations. We illustrate the power and generality of our approach by presenting a novel deblurring algorithm, and we show corrections that perform sharpening, superresolution, in-painting of over- and <b>underexposured</b> regions, and white-balancing...|$|R
40|$|Autoradiographic image {{intensification}} {{methods for}} recovering {{the images of}} underexposed step wedges, resolution targets and radiographs were investigated. The fog level of the intensified image was decreased by treating the film in a subproportional photographic reducer (mixture of potassium ferricyanide and sodium thiosulfate) prior to activation with S- 35 thiourea. The fog level of intensified images of a step wedge decreased from a density of 1. 32 to. 12, the maximum contrast increased from 2. 08 to 5. 52, the relative speed increase calculated at 0. 6 above fog level increased from 3. 05 to 4. 06 while resolution remained the same at 5. 0 lines per millimeter. Radiographs of underexposed images were recovered by using this autoradiographic image intensification method. The underexposed radiograph {{was developed in the}} conventional manner using the Kodak X-Omat processor and treated in the subproportional photographic reducer to lower the fog density. The silver image of the underexposed radiograph was made radioactive with a solution of sulfur- 35 thiourea, air-dried and exposed to another emulsion. The intensified image was also developed in the conventional manner. Its diagnostic usefulness was judged by experienced radiologists as optimal, adequate, poor but diagnostic, or totally unacceptable in comparison to optimally exposed radiographs. Of the six underexposed radiographs involving various body regions studied following intensification, five were consistently rated adequate. This technique, when fully developed and applied will result in reduced radiation dose to patients undergoing radiologic examinations. A significant difference exists between the intensified image of a double-coated and single-coated emulsion. When both emulsions are treated in a subproportional reducer prior to activation with S- 35 thiourea, the intensified image obtained from a single-coated emulsion has less base plus fog density, higher gamma, and is more contrasty than that of a double-coated emulsion. These results indicate that to make deliberate <b>underexposures,</b> it is better to use a singlecoated than a double-coated emulsion...|$|R

50|$|The title <b>Underexposure</b> is {{not only}} a {{reference}} to the expired film stock on which the movie was filmed, but a commentary on the lives of a generation of Iraqis who grew up during the Iraq embargo, isolated from the world. In <b>Underexposure,</b> a fictional film crew copes with the frustration and fear of the Iraq War in Baghdad by making a movie. Friends, lovers, strangers, and family members are woven together by the complexities of their new reality. Along the way friends die and they encounter resistance from people who {{do not want to be}} filmed. Ultimately the burgeoning efforts to make the best of their gruesome reality end in tragedy.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{additional}} complications may arise.

50|$|The {{exposure}} meter uses a PX625 mercury battery, {{which is now}} discontinued. The alkaline equivalent can be used, but the different voltage, different discharge curve, and absence of voltage regulation circuit cause incorrect metering that results in between 1.5-f-stop <b>underexposure</b> {{at the beginning of}} the life of the alkaline battery and 1.5-f-stop overexposure at the end.|$|E
5000|$|Push {{processing}} in photography, {{sometimes called}} uprating, {{refers to a}} film developing technique that increases the effective sensitivity of the film being processed. Push processing involves developing the film for more time, possibly in combination with a higher temperature, than the manufacturer's recommendations. This technique results in effective overdevelopment of the film, compensating for <b>underexposure</b> in the camera.|$|E
50|$|Further {{challenges}} arise however. Even {{when one}} has established developmental delay {{and exposure to}} low levels of nurturance, one needs {{to rule out the}} possibility that the link between the two is coincidental. The developmental delay may be caused by a genetic disorder, disease or physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Of course the developmental delay may be caused by a mixture of <b>underexposure</b> to nurturance, abuse, genetics and disease.|$|E
50|$|Exposure {{compensation}} {{is a technique}} for adjusting the exposure indicated by a photographic exposure meter, in consideration of factors that may cause the indicated exposure {{to result in a}} less-than-optimal image. Factors considered may include unusual lighting distribution, variations within a camera system, filters, non-standard processing, or intended <b>underexposure</b> or overexposure. Cinematographers may also apply exposure compensation for changes in shutter angle or film speed (as exposure index), among other factors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Underexposure</b> is a 2005 Iraqi film, in the docufiction style, {{written and}} {{directed}} by Oday Rasheed, produced by Enlil Film and Arts.

50|$|Bleach bypass, {{also known}} as skip bleach or silver retention, is an optical effect which entails either the partial or {{complete}} skipping of the bleaching function during the processing of a color film. By doing this, the silver is retained in the emulsion along with the color dyes. The result is a black-and-white image over a color image. The images usually have reduced saturation and exposure latitude, along with increased contrast and graininess. It usually is used to maximum effect {{in conjunction with a}} one-stop <b>underexposure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first camera of the Alexa product family. The ARRI ALEXA’s CMOS Super-35mm sensor {{is rated}} at 2.8K and ISO 800.

5000|$|If {{the timing}} was accurate, the splice was invisible. However, if the camera and {{television}} were out of phase, a phenomenon known as [...] "shutter bar" [...] or [...] "banding" [...] took place. If the shutter was slow in closing, overexposure resulted where the part-fields joined and the [...] "shutter bar" [...] {{took the form of}} a white line. If the shutter closed too soon, <b>underexposure</b> took place and the line was black. The term [...] "banding" [...] referred to the phenomenon occurring on the screen as two bars.|$|E
50|$|At best, a {{flat card}} is an {{approximation}} to a three-dimensional scene,and measurement {{of a test}} card may lead to <b>underexposure</b> unless adjustmentis made. The instructions for a Kodak neutral test card recommend thatthe indicated exposure be increased by ½ step for a frontlighted scene insunlight. The instructions also recommend that the test card be heldvertically and faced in a direction midway between the Sun and the camera;similar directions are also given in the Kodak Professional Photoguide.The combination of exposure increase and the card orientation givesrecommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by anincident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with anoff-axis light source.|$|E
50|$|The rings {{controlling}} the effective lens diameter (from f/2.8 to f/22) and the shutter speed are mechanically linked so that once one combination has been matched to the ambient lighting conditions, a faster shutter speed can be selected {{and a larger}} effective lens diameter will automatically be set when possible. For instance, one might start with a setting of f/11 and 1/250 second, but decide that the moving target demanded the higher shutter speed of 1/500. Simply setting that shutter speed without changing the effective lens aperture would result in an <b>underexposure,</b> but the Ricoh 500 will automatically change the aperture setting to f/8.|$|E
50|$|A few {{underwater}} lights have a focusing facility {{by which the}} beam angle can be adjusted. There are two ways this can be done, depending on the basic emission pattern of the light source. HID lights, which generally produce non-directional light, are usually focused by a reflector, which can be slid longitudinally over the light. They produce a beam with a central bright area and a diffuse general illumination around it. This is good for illuminating a combination of near and far areas at the same time, but not good for wide angle video, as the hot-spot will confuse the automatic exposure software {{and the result is}} generally overexposure in the hot spot and <b>underexposure</b> around it.|$|E
5000|$|A {{study done}} by Wharton {{researchers}} Jonathan Hartley and Matthew Olson {{found that in}} the timeframe of August 2001 to March 2016, Cramer's charitable trust underperformed the S&P 500 primarily {{as a result of}} <b>underexposure</b> to market returns in years after the 2008 financial crisis. As of March 31, 2016, Cramer's trust since inception had a cumulative return of 64.5% where the S&P 500 less dividends returned 70% during the same time frame. Wharton finance professor Robert Stambaugh said he didn't think the findings showed significant underperformance or outperformance when adjusting for a variety of factors, but did state [...] "It’s a commendable attempt to dig more deeply into the style that underlies Cramer’s stock picks." ...|$|E
50|$|There are {{two general}} types of light meters: {{reflected}}-light and incident-light. Reflected-light meters measure the light {{reflected by the}} scene to be photographed. All in-camera meters are reflected-light meters. Reflected-light meters are calibrated to show the appropriate exposure for “average” scenes. An unusual scene with a preponderance of light colors or specular highlights would have a higher reflectance; a reflected-light meter taking a reading would incorrectly compensate for the difference in reflectance and lead to <b>underexposure.</b> Badly underexposed sunset photos are common exactly because of this effect: {{the brightness of the}} setting sun fools the camera's light meter and, unless the in-camera logic or the photographer take care to compensate, the picture will be grossly underexposed and dull.|$|E
