Ceramic {{phonograph}} cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper {{to maintain and}} easier to build. The development of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducer</b> allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic time-domain reflectometers (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.|$|E
2500|$|While {{diffraction}} occurs whenever propagating waves encounter such changes, {{its effects}} are generally most pronounced for waves whose wavelength is roughly {{comparable to the}} dimensions of the diffracting object or slit. If the obstructing object provides multiple, closely spaced openings, a complex pattern of varying intensity can result. [...] This is due to the addition, or interference, of different parts of a wave that travel to the observer by different paths, where different path lengths result in different phases (see diffraction grating and wave superposition). The formalism of diffraction can also describe the way in which waves of finite extent propagate in free space. For example, the expanding profile of a laser beam, the beam shape of a radar antenna and the field of view of an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducer</b> can all be analyzed using diffraction equations.|$|E
50|$|The imaging {{depth of}} photoacoustic {{microscopy}} is mainly {{limited by the}} ultrasonic attenuation. The spatial (i.e. axial and lateral) resolutions depend on the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducer</b> used. An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducer</b> with high central frequency and broader bandwidth are chosen to obtain high axial resolution. The lateral resolution {{is determined by the}} focal diameter of the transducer.

50|$|Capacitive micromachined <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> (CMUT) is a {{relatively}} new concept in the field of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers.</b> Most of the commercial <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> today are based on piezoelectricity. CMUTs are the transducers where the energy transduction is due to change in capacitance. CMUTs are constructed on silicon using micromachining techniques. A cavity is formed in a silicon substrate, and a thin layer suspended {{on the top of the}} cavity serves as a membrane on which a metallized layer acts an electrode, together with the silicon substrate which serves as a bottom electrode.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to systematically design piezoelectric <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> based on Topology Optimization Method (TOM) and Functionally Graded Material (FGM) concepts. The main goal is to find the optimal material distribution of Functionally Graded Piezoelectric <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Transducers,</b> to achieve the following requirements: (i) the transducer must be designed to have a multi-modal or uni-modal frequency response, which defines the kind of generated acoustic wave, either short pulse or continuous wave, respectively; (ii) the transducer is required to oscillate in a thickness extensional mode or piston-like mode, aiming at acoustic wave generation applications. Two kinds of piezoelectric materials are mixed for producing the FGM transducer. Material type 1 re{{presents a}} PZT- 5 A piezoelectric ceramic and material type 2 represents a PZT- 5 H piezoelectric ceramic. To illustrate the proposed method, two Functionally Graded Piezoelectric <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Transducers</b> are designed.

50|$|By the 1990s, it {{was well}} known that the Audio Spotlight could work but {{suffered}} from heavy distortion.

In 1998 the negative effects on THD of an insufficiently broad frequency response of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> was quantified with computer simulations by using a precompensation scheme based on Berktay's expression. In 1999 Pompei's article discussed how a new prototype transducer met the increased frequency response demands placed on the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> by the precompensation scheme, which was once again based on Berktay's expression. In addition impressive reductions in the THD of the output when the precompensation scheme was employed were graphed against the case of using no precompensation.|$|R

The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio obtained by test results of newly developed embedded transducers were compared with the values obtained from impact test for same batch of concrete and good agreement was observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Representing a new {{approach}} to ultrasound generation and detection, study on piezoelectric micromachined <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> (pMUTs) has been a growing research area in recent years. Intensive research work has been directed on the deposition of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films on silicon substrates for their excellent piezoelectric coefficients and electromechanical coupling coefficients. However, the high processing temperature required for PZT crystallization results in a low device yield and also makes it difficult to integrate with control circuits. In this paper, a fabrication technology of pMUTs based on piezoelectric P(VDF-TrFE) 70 / 30 copolymer films has been adopted, with the maximum processing temperature not exceeding 140 °C allowing for post-IC compatibility. The entire processing procedures are simple and low cost, as compared with those of capacitive micromachined <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> (cMUTs) and ceramic-based pMUTs. The applications of the fabricated pMUTs as airborne <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> and transducer arrays have been demonstrated.

40|$|Modeling <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> is an {{important}} aspect of research in nondestructive evaluation and testing. In most nondestructive evaluation applications, the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> are traditionally modeled as: (1) point sources generating spherical wave fronts (2) line sources generating cylindrical wave fronts, or (3) planar surfaces generating plane wave fronts. In reality, the transducer front face has finite dimensions; it is neither point source nor planar source because the ultrasound that emits from a piezoelectric transducer does not originate from a point or an infinite plane, but instead originates from the finite surface of the piezoelectric element with flat or curved front face. Analytically modeling the fields radiated by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> is a very difficult task because of the large number of possible transducer types, sizes and configurations that are used in practice. In this study, a semi analytical technique the Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) is adapted to model <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers.</b> The DPSM discretizes the transducer surface into a finite number of elemental surfaces. As a result, the complexity associated with the discretization of the three-dimensional problem geometry as done in the finite element technique is reduced. In the DPSM technique, the fundamental governing equations for elastic wave propagation in a fluid and in a solid are solved. For this reason, the DPSM technique is called a semi-analytical technique. In this research, computer codes for computing the ultrasonic field in a three dimensional inhomogeneous medium in front of a transducer of finite dimension have been written in MatLab. Two different cases are considered in this study, nonhomogeneous fluid and fluid-solid interface. Both normal and inclined incidence cases are investigated. This investigation shows that DPSM is an efficient technique for modeling <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>transducers</b> in nonhomogeneous media...|$|R
