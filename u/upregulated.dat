5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as argonaute proteins are <b>upregulated</b> in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is also {{a promising}} way to treat cancers by silencing genes differentially <b>upregulated</b> in tumor cells or genes involved in cell division. A key area {{of research in the}} use of RNAi for clinical applications is the development of a safe delivery method, which to date has involved mainly viral vector systems similar to those suggested for gene therapy.|$|E
5|$|This {{integrated}} viral DNA {{may then}} lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection. To actively produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors {{need to be}} present, {{the most important of}} which is NF-κB (NF kappaB), which is <b>upregulated</b> when T-cells become activated. This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection.|$|E
5000|$|Gli Proteins {{transcriptional}} {{regulation is}} tissue specific for many targets. For example, Gli1 in primary keratinocytes <b>upregulates</b> FOXM1 whereas in mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells {{it has been}} shown to <b>upregulate</b> platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFRa.|$|R
50|$|PD-L1 is notably {{expressed}} on macrophages. In the mouse, it {{has been}} shown that classically activated macrophages (induced by type I helper T cells or a combination of LPS and interferon-gamma) greatly <b>upregulate</b> PD-L1. Alternatively, macrophages activated by IL-4 (alternative macrophages), slightly <b>upregulate</b> PD-L1, while greatly <b>upregulating</b> PD-L2. It has been shown by STAT1-deficient knock-out mice that STAT1 is mostly responsible for upregulation of PD-L1 on macrophages by LPS or interferon-gamma, but is not at all responsible for its constitutive expression before activation in these mice.|$|R

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is <b>upregulated</b> through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid aldehydes and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E
5|$|The major {{determinant}} is PSORS1, {{which probably}} accounts for 35%–50% of psoriasis heritability. It controls genes {{that affect the}} immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis. PSORS1 is located on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the PSORS1 locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6, which encodes a MHC class I protein; CCHCR1, variant WWC, which encodes a coiled protein that is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and CDSN, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, a protein which is expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis and <b>upregulated</b> in psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is <b>upregulated</b> during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E

25|$|Choriocarcinomas, in {{contrast}} to adrenal carcinomas, have <b>upregulated</b> H19 and downregulated IGF2 expression. The <b>upregulated</b> H19 expression, however, came from alleles that were fully methylated. Surgically removed choriocarcinomas from human patients also exhibited a heavily methylated H19 promoter with enhanced H19 expression. This led researchers Arima et al. to suggest that in cases of choriocarcinomas, the H19 promoter was mutated, allowing it to overcome the transcriptional repression of promoter CpG methylation.|$|E
25|$|In {{prolonged}} acidosis, PEPCK-C is <b>upregulated</b> in renal proximal tubule brush border cells, {{in order}} to secrete more NH3 and thus to produce more HCO3−.|$|E
25|$|Murine microRNA-712 is a {{potential}} biomarker (i.e. predictor) for atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular disease of the arterial wall associated with lipid retention and inflammation. Non-laminar blood flow also correlates with development of atherosclerosis as mechanosenors of endothelial cells respond to the shear force of disturbed flow (d-flow). A number of pro-atherogenic genes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are <b>upregulated</b> by d-flow , mediating pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals. These findings were observed in ligated carotid arteries of mice to mimic the effects of d-flow. Within 24 hours, pre-existing immature miR-712 formed mature miR-712 suggesting that miR-712 is flow-sensitive. Coinciding with these results, miR-712 is also <b>upregulated</b> in endothelial cells exposed tonaturally occurring d-flowin the greater curvature of the aortic arch.|$|E
50|$|Directly acting {{adrenergic}} agonists act on adrenergic receptors. All adrenergic receptors are G-protein coupled, activating {{signal transduction}} pathways. The G-protein receptor {{can affect the}} function of adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C, an agonist of the receptor will <b>upregulate</b> the effects on the downstream pathway (it will not necessarily <b>upregulate</b> the pathway itself).|$|R

25|$|Both sFlt-1 and sEng are <b>upregulated</b> in all {{pregnant}} women to some extent, supporting {{the idea that}} hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of maternal immune tolerance for a foreign placenta, {{it is not surprising}} that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled spiral arteries in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to <b>upregulated</b> sFlt-1 and sEng.|$|E
25|$|PEDF induces PPAR-gamma {{expression}} {{which in}} turn induces p53, a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Thrombospondin, an antiangiogenic protein, is <b>upregulated</b> by PEDF. PEDF stimulates several other well known signaling cascades such as the Ras pathway, the NF-κB pathway, and extrinsic apoptosis cascades.|$|E
25|$|KCC2b, on {{the other}} hand, is {{scarcely}} present during prenatal development and is strongly <b>upregulated</b> during postnatal development. The upregulation of KCC2b expression {{is thought to be}} responsible for the “developmental shift” observed in mammals from depolarizing postsynaptic effects of inhibitory synapses in early neural networks to hyperpolarizing effects in mature neural networks.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{sequences}} (siRNA and miRNA) {{that are}} complementary {{to parts of}} a promoter can increase gene transcription, a phenomenon dubbed RNA activation. Part of the mechanism for how these RNA <b>upregulate</b> genes is known: dicer and argonaute are involved, possibly via histone demethylation. miRNAs have been proposed to <b>upregulate</b> their target genes upon cell cycle arrest, via unknown mechanisms.|$|R
25|$|PEDF {{expression}} is <b>upregulated</b> by plasminogen kringle domains 1-4 (also known as angiostatin) and the kringle 5 (K5) domain. Hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, {{leads to the}} downregulation of PEDF. This effect is due to hypoxic conditions causing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to proteolytically degrade PEDF. In addition, amyloid beta {{has been shown to}} decrease PEDF mRNA levels.|$|E
25|$|Signalling from GluRs is {{mediated}} {{by the presence of}} an abundance of proteins, especially kinases, that are localized to the postsynaptic density. These include calcium-dependent calmodulin, CaMKII (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), PKC (Protein Kinase C), PKA (Protein Kinase A), Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP-1), and Fyn tyrosine kinase. Certain signallers, such as CaMKII, are <b>upregulated</b> in response to activity.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} Fas and MIF are {{candidate}} biomarkers of progressive neurodegeneration. <b>Upregulated</b> levels of sFas (soluble form of Fas molecule) {{were found in}} MS patients with hypotense lesions with progressive neurodegeneration, and also levels of MIF appeared to be higher in progressive than in non-progressing patients. Serum TNF-α and CCL2 seem to reflect the presence of inflammatory responses in primary progressive MS.|$|E
50|$|PCK2 is {{associated}} with several cancers, including lung cancer, and promotes tumorigenesis through its gluconeogenic function. In low-glucose settings, stress to the endoplasmic reticulum <b>upregulates</b> ATF4, which then <b>upregulates</b> PCK2. As PCK2 allows cells to utilize alternative cataplerotic pathways to convert TCA cycle intermediates to glycolytic intermediates, PCK2 activity can enhance the survival tumor cells facing reduced glucose levels.|$|R
50|$|Some {{receptor}} agonists {{may cause}} downregulation {{of their respective}} receptors, while most receptor antagonists temporarily <b>upregulate</b> their respective receptors. The disequilibrium caused by these changes often causes withdrawal when the long-term use of a drug is discontinued. However, the use of certain receptor antagonists may also damage receptors faster than they <b>upregulate</b> (internalization of receptors due to antagonism).|$|R

25|$|CYR61 {{promotes}} the apoptotic functions of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, FasL, and TRAIL. It also reprograms macrophages towards M1 polarization through αMβ2-mediated activation of NF-κB. CYR61 is <b>upregulated</b> {{in patients with}} Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CYR61 supports the patrolling behavior of murine resident Ly6Clow monocytes along the endothelial in the steady state and is required for their accumulation under viral-mimicking vascular inflammation.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} studies that link FAM83A overexpression to lung, prostate, and bladder cancers. Researchers {{believe that this}} gene might make {{a good candidate for}} early detection of these cancers, especially lung cancer. It is unknown why or how FAM83A is <b>upregulated.</b> Studies have shown that arsenic can acetylate the promoter causing upregulation, suggesting this may be a similar mechanism to how this gene becomes unregulated in cancer.|$|E
25|$|At {{the root}} tip interface, {{researchers}} have observed a homologue for a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd) gene that is consistently <b>upregulated</b> {{compared to the}} extraradical mycelium. This could allow for new membranes to form at the symbiotic interface, which, in turn, could help explain the development of various permeases that occur in these locations. These new membranes could be largely responsible for nutrient transport from the fungal mycelium to the plant host.|$|E
