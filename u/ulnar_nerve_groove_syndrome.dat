40|$|Ultrasound (US) {{is one of}} {{the methods}} for imaging {{entrapment}} neuropathies, post-trau‑ matic changes to nerves, nerve tumors and postoperative complications to nerves. This type of examination {{is becoming more and more}} popular, not only for economic reasons, but also due to its value in making accurate diagnosis. It provides a very precise assess‑ ment of peripheral nerve trunk pathology – both in terms of morphology and localization. During examination there are several options available to the specialist: the making of a dynamic assessment, observation of pain radiation through the application of precise palpation and the comparison of resultant images with the contra lateral limb. Entrap‑ ment neuropathies of the upper limb are discussed in this study, with the omission of median nerve neuropathy at the level of the carpal canal, as extensive literature on this subject exists. The following pathologies are presented: pronator teres muscle syndrome, anterior interosseus nerve neuropathy, <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>groove</b> <b>syndrome</b> and cubital tun‑ nel syndrome, Guyon’s canal syndrome, radial nerve neuropathy, posterior interosseous nerve neuropathy, Wartenberg’s disease, suprascapular nerve neuropathy and thoracic outlet syndrome. Peripheral nerve examination technique has been presented in previous articles presenting information about peripheral nerve anatomy [Journal of Ultrasonog‑ raphy 2012; 12 (49) : 120 – 163 – Normal and sonographic anatomy of selected peripheral nerves. Part I: Sonohistology and general principles of examination, following the exam‑ ple of the median nerve; Part II: Peripheral nerves of the upper limb; Part III: Peripheral nerves of the lower limb]. In this article potential compression sites of particular nerves are discussed, taking into account pathomechanisms of damage, including predisposing anatomical variants (accessory muscles). The parameters of ultrasound assessment have been established – echogenicity and echostructure, thickness (edema and related increase in the cross sectional area of the nerve trunk), vascularization and the reciprocal relation‑ ship with adjacent tissue...|$|E

40|$|Cubital tunnel {{syndrome}} is {{often accompanied by}} paresthesia in <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> sites and hand muscle atrophy. When muscle weakness occurs, or after failure of more conservative treatments, anterior transposition is used. In the present study, the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> and its blood vessels were examined in the elbows of 18 adult cadavers, and the external diameter of the nutrient vessels of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> {{at the point of}} origin, the distances between the origin of the vessels and the medial epicondyle of the humerus, and the length of the vessels accompanying the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> in the superior ulnar collateral artery, the inferior ulnar collateral artery, and the posterior ulnar recurrent artery were measured. Anterior transposition of the vascularized <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> was performed to treat cubital {{tunnel syndrome}}.

40|$|Clinical {{features}} and X-rays of thirty-four cases with cuhitus varus deformity were analysed {{in order to}} explain the occurrence of tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy caused by cubitus varus deformity. Cubitus varus cases with tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy, compared to cases without it, were older at the {{first visit to the}} clinic for cubitus varus deformity. There were no other {{differences between the two groups}} in clinical features. Computed tomography showed that the olecranon moved to the ulnar side against the olecranon fossa. Operative findings showed that the medial head of triceps brachii shifted medially and covered the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve.</b> Both from computed tomography and operative findings we conjectured the possibility that tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy was caused because the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> was compressed by the forward medial movement of the medial head of the triceps brachii caused by cubitus varus deformity. It is well known that tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy occurs as a late complication after a lateral condylar fracture of the humerus in childhood. Because of the cubitus valgus deformity, the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> runs a longer distance over the medial side of the elbow and by flexing the elbow traction force is applied to the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve.</b> That is considered the major cause of tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy in cubitus valgus deformity. On the other hand, cubitus varus deformity often results after supracondylar fractures of the humerus, which mostly occur around the elbow joint in childhood. However, reports of tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy in the cubitus varus deformity are few. Among reports of tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy caused by snapping of the medial head of the triceps brachii there are cases of cubitus varus deformity (Dreyfuss, 1978; Reis, 1980; Rolfsen, 1970). Hayashi (1984) reported some cases and pointed out the possibility that cubitus varus deformity is related to the snapping of the medial head of the triceps brachii. The author experienced in the past six years six cases of tardy <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy with cubitus varus deformity.

40|$|Guyon's canal at {{the wrist}} {{is not the}} common site of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> compression. Ganglion, lipoma, {{anomalous}} tendon and muscles, trauma related to an occupation, arthritis, and carpal bone fracture can cause <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> compression at the wrist. However, <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> compression at Guyon's canal by vascular lesion is rare.

The authors experienced a case of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> compression at Guyon's canal by an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and the patient's symptom was improved after surgical resection.

40|$|Numerous causes are {{reported}} for <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> compression at the wrist, known as Guyon's tunnel syndrome. In the present article, {{a patient with}} Guyon's tunnel syndrome during pregnancy concomitant with an anomaly of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> is described. A 29 -year-old Iranian woman presented with clinical features of Guyon's tunnel syndrome (pain and paresthesia in the fifth finger of the left hand and atrophy of the first dorsal interosseus muscle). Symptoms of the patient appeared during the third trimester of pregnancy. Electro diagnostic studies confirmed Guyon's tunnel syndrome. Surgical exploration revealed an anomalous arch of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> passing through the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon. The anomalous arch of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> was released by resection of the segment of FCU tendon passing through the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> arch.

30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{study was to investigate}} the frequency of persistent ulnar affection in patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of distal humeral fractures without <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> transposition or mobilisation. Eighty-two patients (53 women), mean age 62  years, were, at a mean of 48  months, reviewed through medical records and a subjective evaluation form concerning <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> problems. <b>Ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> affliction, in most cases regarded as mild, was experienced by 22 patients (27 %; 14 women) and significantly associated with multiple surgeries. Three patients had been operated with late neurolysis and one with transposition without reported improvement. The proportion of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> dysfunction was equally common regardless of medial or lateral plating. ORIF with plate fixation and without <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> transposition seems to be an acceptable option for patients with distal humeral fractures. The frequency of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> affection in our series does not appear higher than previously reported. Subjective <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> symptoms were, however, relatively common and appear related to the trauma itself, the surgery, or the post-operative management which highlights the need for further analysis of these factors.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{describe}} an ultrasonography-guided technique for cubital tunnel injection. Method The <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> from 12 elbows of 6 adult cadavers were scanned, and the cross-sectional {{areas of the}} <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves,</b> cubital tunnel inlets and outlets were measured by using ultrasonography. All elbows were dissected after an ultrasonography-guided dye injection at the inlet of the cubital tunnel. The dissectors evaluated the spread of dye and the coloration of the nerve and remeasured the cross-sectional areas of the cubital tunnel inlets and outlets. Results After a real-time visualization of an ultrasonography-guided injection, the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> were seperated from the medial <b>groove</b> for the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve.</b> All the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> of the cadavers were successfully colored with the dye, from the inlet to oulet of the cubital tunnel.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the safety and {{efficacy}} of the Agee endoscopic system (3 M, Orthopedic Products, St. Paul, MN) for <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> decompression at the elbow. TYPE OF STUDY: A cadaveric study. METHODS: The <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> was identified through a 3 -cm longitudinal incision between the medial epicondyle and olecranon. A release of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> was performed with the Agee device under endoscopic magnification. A complete open assessment of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve,</b> its branching, and structures divided was performed under loupe magnification. RESULTS: In all 6 cadaveric specimens, the arcade of Struthers, the cubital tunnel retinaculum, and the flexor carpi ulnaris aponeurosis were completely divided. In all specimens, the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> and all motor and capsular branches were preserved. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that the Agee endoscopic <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> decompression at the elbow is both safe and effective in a cadaveric model.

40|$|Background: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is most commonly employed, alongside electrodiagnostic studies, {{in the diagnosis}} of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> entrapment. It is expensive, time consuming, not readily available to the general public, and limits imaging to {{a segment of the}} nerve at any given time. In contrast, high-frequency ultrasound is an inexpensive imaging modality with a flexible field of view through which the nerve can be traced. An ultrasound cross-sectional area (CSA) > 0. 075 cm² has previously been suggested as indicative of nerve entrapment. Objectives: To confirm the suggested CSA measurement of 0. 075 cm² and discuss the difference in CSA measurement between abnormal nerves, nerves in the contra-lateral elbow of the same participant, and those of asymptomatic participants. Methods: Ultrasonography was performed on both elbows of 25 patients with confirmed unilateral <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> entrapment and on 25 healthy controls for comparison. Three CSA measurements were taken of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> along its course, and the mean measurement was recorded. Results: CSA measurements were significantly different between patients with <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> entrapment and healthy controls (p 0. 070 cm² defined <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> entrapment at the elbow.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} features of the arcade of Struthers, and to assess its clinical implication in <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> compression. METHOD: Forty arms from 26 cadaver specimens were dissected in the Anatomy Laboratory of this institution. The extension of the arcade, distance from the medial epicondyle, and relation with <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> were recorded. RESULTS: The arcade of Struthers was identified in 40 dissected arms (100 %). In 29 (72. 5 %) the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> was covered by a muscular arcade, in nine (22. 5 %) by an aponeurotic arcade, and in two (5 %) the arcade was beneath the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve.</b> The extension of the arcade ranged from 3. 0 to 7. 5 cm, and {{the distance from the}} medial epicondyle ranged from 2. 5 to 7. 0 cm. CONCLUSION: The arcade of Struthers is a musculoaponeurotic canal that represents an important site of entrapment or compression of the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve.</b> The arcade, the intermuscular septum, and the internal brachial ligament should be released in patients submitted to <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> anterior transposition surgery...|$|R

40|$|Background:  Medial pinning {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the surgical treatment of supracondylar fractures (SHF) owing to the risk of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> injury.   Aim: To evaluate the safety and usefulness of medial pinning for SHF using ultrasound imaging for ulnar nerve visualization.    Methods: Fifteen children, with a mean age of 60 months, with displaced SHF were treated with a crossed-pinning configuration after fracture reduction. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to guide medial pin insertion to avoid <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> injury. Results:  Cubital tunnel anatomy was easily identified in all children.

40|$|A case of <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> {{compression}} at {{the wrist}} within Guyon’s canal is reported.

40|$|MEDIAN nerve {{compression}} at the wrist is common and its treatment by decompression is usually successful. <b>Ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> entrapment, {{on the other}} hand, is uncommon. The <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> as it enters the hand passes through and divides in the canal of Guyon, into its deep (motor) and superficial (sensory) branch.
