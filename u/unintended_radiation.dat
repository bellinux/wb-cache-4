It was previously {{shown that the}} same coils used in wireless charging {{can be used for}} detection of <b>unintended</b> <b>radiation.</b> Therefore, these charging pads pose a potential hazard. Malicious charging pads might attempt to extract keys in addition to charging a user’s phone. When coupled with packet sniffing capabilities of public wifi, the keys extracted could be used to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on users. If Far Field attacks are discovered, an attacker only needs to point his antenna at a victim to perform these attacks; the victim need not be actively charging their phone on one of these public pads.|$|E

Therefore, a rough characterization of potential adversaries using this attack range from highly educated individuals to low to medium funded cartels. The following demonstrates a few possible scenarios: ...|$|E

30|$|There are {{multiple}} different sources of realistic non-white external noise. One example is galactic radiation noise. The {{power spectral density}} (PSD) of such noise is proportional to \(\frac 1 {f^{ 2.7 }}\) [15], where f denotes the frequency, which makes it non-white. Another example is man-made noise [16]. The reason this kind of noise leads to correlation in the received samples under \(\mathcal {H}_{ 0 }\) is twofold. Firstly, it occurs in strong bursts that affect multiple receiver samples, which leads to time correlation. Secondly, when multiple receivers or multiple receive antennas are considered, the received noise is correlated in the case that multiple {{of them are in}} the range of the same man-made impulsive noise. The origin of man-made noise lies in, e.g., <b>unintended</b> <b>radiation</b> from electrical machinery or power transmission lines. Furthermore, nearly every electronic device creates it and thus, impulsive man-made noise is an effect that needs to be taken into account.|$|E
40|$|Radiation therapy (RT) for {{esophageal cancer}} {{often results in}} <b>unintended</b> <b>radiation</b> doses {{delivered}} to the heart owing to anatomic proximity. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we examined late cardiac death in survivors of esophageal cancer that had or had not received RT. 5, 630 patients were identified that were diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC) from 1973 - 2012, who were followed for at least 5 years after therapy. Examined risk factors for cardiac death included age (≤ 55 / 56 - 65 / 66 - 75 /> 75), gender, race (white/non-white), stage (local/regional/distant), histology (SCC/AC), esophageal location (< 18 cm/ 18 - 24 cm/ 25 - 32 cm/ 33 - 40 cm from incisors), diagnosis year (1973 - 1992 / 1993 - 2002 / 2003 - 2012), and receipt of surgery and/or RT. Time to cardiac death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox model {{was used to evaluate}} risk factors for cardiac death in propensity score matched data. Patients who received RT were younger, diagnosed more recently, had more advanced disease, SCC histology, and no surgery. The RT group had higher risk of cardiac death than the no-RT group (log-rank p< 0. 0001). The median time to cardiac death in the RT group was 289 months (95 % CI, 255 - 367) and was not reached in the no-RT group. The probability of cardiac death increased with age and decreased with diagnosis year, and this trend was more pronounced in the RT group. Multivariate analysis found RT to be associated with higher probability of cardiac death (OR 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 47, HR 1. 961, 95 % CI 1. 466 - 2. 624). Lower esophageal subsite (33 - 40 cm) was also associated with a higher risk of cardiac death. Other variables were not associated with cardiac death. Recognizing the limitations of a SEER analysis including lack of comorbidity accountability, these data should prompt more definitive study as to whether a possible associative effect of RT on cardiac death could potentially be a causative effect...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades the puissant desire to miniaturize the digital {{circuits}} to achieve higher speed and larger density has shaped the evolution of the silicon-based technologies. This development opens a new era in the field of millimeter-wave electronics in which many low-cost high-yield silicon-based transistors can be used on a single chip to enable creation of novel architectures with unique properties not achievable with old processes. In addition to this high level of integration capability, the die size of comparable or even larger than the wave-length makes it possible to integrate antennas, transceivers, and digital circuitry all on a single silicon die. It is important to realize that although smaller parasitic capacitors and shorter transistor channels have improved fT and fmax of transistors, extremely thin metal layers, highly doped substrates, and low breakdown voltage transistors have severely affected the performance of analog and RF building blocks. For example, thin metal layers have increased the loss and lowered the quality factor of the building blocks such as capacitors and inductors and low breakdown voltage transistors have made the power generation quite challenging. Additionally, if not carefully designed, small wave-lengths in the millimeter-wave range may cause <b>unintended</b> <b>radiation</b> by on-chip components. In this dissertation, we address these issues in design of millimeter-wave silicon-based single-chip phased-array transceivers with integrated antennas. We also introduce the technique of Direct Antenna Modulation (DAM) and implement two proof-of-concept chips operating at 60 GHz. We will present the receiver and the on-chip antenna sections of a fully integrated 77 GHz four-element phased-array transceiver with on-chip antennas in silicon. The receiver section of the chip includes the complete down-conversion path comprising low-noise amplifier (LNA), frequency synthesizer, phase rotators, combining amplifiers, and on-chip dipole antennas. The signal combining is performed using a novel distributed active combining amplifier at an IF of 26 GHz. In the LO path, the output of the 52 GHz VCO is routed to different elements and can be phase shifted locally by the phase rotators. A silicon lens on the backside is used to reduce the loss due to the surface-wave power of the silicon substrate. Our measurements show a single-element LNA gain of 23 dB and a noise figure of 6. 0 dB. Each of the four receive paths has a gain of 37 dB and a noise figure of 8. 0 dB. Each on-chip antenna has a gain of + 8 dBi. A direct antenna modulation (DAM) technique is also introduced, where the radiated far-field signal is modulated by time-varying changes in the antenna near-field electromagnetic (EM) boundary conditions. This enables the transmitter to send data in a direction-dependent fashion producing a secure communication link. The transmitter architecture makes it possible to use narrow-band highly-efficient switching power amplifiers to transmit wideband constant and non-constant envelope modulated signals. Theoretically, these systems are capable of transmitting independent data in multiple directions at full-rate concurrently using a single transmitter. Direct antenna modulation (DAM) can be performed by using either switches or varactors. Two proof-of-concept DAM transmitters operating at 60 GHz using switches and varactors are demonstrated in silicon proving the feasibility of this approach...|$|E
