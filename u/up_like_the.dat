5|$|In 1241, the barons in Poitou, {{including}} Henry's step-father Hugh de Lusignan, {{rebelled against}} {{the rule of}} Louis of France. The rebels had counted on aid from Henry, but he lacked domestic support and was slow to mobilise an army, not arriving in France until the next summer. Henry's campaign was hesitant and was further undermined by Hugh switching sides and returning to support Louis. On 20 May Henry's army was surrounded by the French at Taillebourg; Henry's brother Richard persuaded the French to delay their attack and the King {{took the opportunity to}} escape to Bordeaux. Simon de Montfort, who fought a successful rearguard action during the withdrawal, was furious with the King's incompetence and told Henry that he should be locked <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 10th-century Carolingian king Charles the Simple. The Poitou rebellion collapsed and Henry entered into a fresh five-year truce; his campaign had been a disastrous failure and had cost over £80,000.|$|E
5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E

This they used to take people up the river on excursions and also to carry produce down the river, thus earning money with which to pay their father for the material used to build the boat.|$|E

25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn <b>up.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E
500|$|Many {{experts suggest}} that Sargsyan as prime {{minister}} was the most powerful politician in Armenia, while others suggest that he had become Armenia's strongest politician long before that. According to Mark Grigorian, his [...] "activities had began to overshadow" [...] Kocharyan. Despite Kocharyan's formal welcome of their alliance, the president was [...] "effectively weakened" [...] and [...] "was being sidelined". Some political analysts suggested that the Sargsyan-Demirchyan alliance [...] "ultimately would bring about the resignation of Kocharyan." [...] Vazgen Manukyan stated that Kocharyan [...] "would end <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Queen of England." [...] Despite no longer being the Minister of Defence, Vazgen Sargsyan remained the de facto leader of the army, as a close ally, Vagharshak Harutiunyan, replaced him.|$|E

While Lennon and his partner, Yoko Ono, undertook a highly publicised campaign for world peace during 1969, Harrison believed that all human suffering could be averted if individuals focused on addressing their own imperfections rather than, as he put it, [...] "trying to fix everybody else <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Lone Ranger". This divergence in philosophy also formed part of Harrison's subject matter for [...] "Awaiting on You All", a song that, Greene writes, [...] "projected his message to the world".|$|E

500|$|Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for {{regional}} cooperation between NATO {{and its neighbors}} were set <b>up,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1998, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was established. On 8July 1997, three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999. Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. At that time, the decision was criticised in the US by many military, political and academic leaders as a [...] "a policy error of historic proportions." [...] According to George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and an advocate of the containment policy, this decision [...] "may {{be expected to have}} an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, [...] to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the first}} Kingdom Hearts, Nomura {{was worried that}} players would be unhappy that Sora would start Kingdom Hearts II as a weak {{character}} with few powers who once again had to be leveled <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first title. Therefore, Nomura developed the plot of Chain of Memories to explain how Sora loses his abilities in Castle Oblivion and then starts anew. Additionally, with Chain of Memories a new mystery regarding Sora's memories of Twilight Town was added, which would be explained in Kingdom Hearts II. The team in charge of Kingdom Hearts II expressed difficulties in animating Sora's [...] "Valor" [...] Drive Form for having a completely different motion except in Sora's walking animation, which is shared with his regular motion. After finishing Kingdom Hearts II, Nomura wanted to give Sora a rest from the series in order to focus the following games on other characters from the series. Moreover, the events from the endings of Coded and Birth by Sleep hinted a new mystery regarding Sora's character, which will be revealed in Kingdom Hearts III. Although Nomura stated in March 2010 that Sora would once again {{be the focus of}} the next Kingdom Hearts, he will share it with another character with great importance. In response to rumors saying that Sora's story would end in Kingdom Hearts III, Nomura answered that Sora is the protagonist of the series and that his role will end once the series ends. For this game, Nomura was interested in giving Sora a new costume, but was worried about doing so because of the popularity of the character's Kingdom Hearts II outfit. In the end, he decided to create a new one as Kingdom Hearts III was a new numbered title.|$|E

But none of those moments have created a stir quite like [...] when [...] locked lips." [...] The kiss was trending on Twitter after it aired, and many fans created artwork of the characters and couple as the series progressed; others engaged in cosplay of Lexa (dressing <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> character), with some receiving input from Debnam-Carey and Rothenberg.|$|E

[...] Similarly, GameSpy's Gerald Villoria praised the game in July that year as highly original to the point that it could end <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> poor-selling Ōkami (another Kamiya-directed game) for it—"the premise, the characters, the action sequences, they're all entirely different from anything else I've ever seen," [...] he wrote—and called its lead a [...] "constantly moving", [...] "remarkably multi-faceted" [...] character [...] "presented in an ultra-stylish way".|$|E

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} D+, stating that [...] "a few of the images are startling" [...] but [...] "Silent Hill is mostly paralyzing in its vagueness."

[...] According to Nathan Lee of The New York Times: [...] "It begins as a quest, develops into a ghost-town mystery, devolves into a preposterous cautionary tale about witchcraft and religious fundamentalism, and wraps <b>up</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> outrageously overwrought fantasy of a movie nerd obsessed with horror who has been given obscene amounts of money to adapt a video game." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{recording}} {{process for}} California was {{more complex than}} for the band's previous records. They chose to record the disc to analog tape rather than digitally and some songs required several 24-track machines, utilizing over 50 tracks. As a result, each song contains layers of original samples, keyboards, percussion and melodies. The album displays influences from Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys, while blending lounge, pop, jazz, funk, thrash metal, Hawaiian, Middle Eastern, kecak and avant-garde music. The band toured North America, Australia and Europe to support the record. They also notably appeared on the 2000 edition of the SnoCore Tour, performing alongside alternative metal acts whom they had influenced, such as Incubus and System of a Down. According to Trevor Dunn, Mr. Bungle were [...] "completely out of place" [...] on the SnoCore Tour. He stated [...] "We were sort of the grandpas of the tour, so we started really messing with the audiences.

This theme would be further developed in the following album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire).|$|E
2500|$|The hi-hat cymbals (nicknamed [...] "hats") {{consist of}} two cymbals mounted {{facing each other}} on a metal pole with folding support legs that keep a hollow support {{cylinder}} standing <b>up.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin pole which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand cylinder. The thin pole is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is pressed down, a mechanism causes the thin pole to move down, causing the cymbals to move together. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the cymbals move apart, due to the pedal's spring-loaded mechanism. The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals {{with one or two}} sticks or just by opening and closing the cymbals with the footpedal, without striking the cymbals. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone enables drummers to use both sticks on other drums or cymbals. Different sounds can be created by striking [...] "open hi-hats" [...] (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed [...] "sloppy hats") or a crisp [...] "closed hi-hats" [...] sound (with the pedal pressed down). As well, the high hats can be played with a partially depressed pedal.|$|E
