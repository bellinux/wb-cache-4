It received positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised Ramachandran's performance, as he was known for doing mainly action-adventure films up <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> in his career. The film was also a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 23 weeks. It was also dubbed into Telugu, under the title Prema Manasulu.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1920, and {{continuing}} until the 1960s, McGill imposed a controversial quota which specified a maximum on {{the proportion of}} newly admitted students who were Jewish. Up <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> Jews had been overrepresented in the university, especially in the arts (20% Jewish) and law (40% Jewish). The quota limited the Jewish population across McGill to at most 10%.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Austria {{called for}} Prussia {{to hand over}} {{administration}} of Schleswig-Holstein, which had <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> been jointly administered by the two powers, to the Duke of Augustenberg. Prussia refused, and Otto von Bismarck sent troops into Austrian-administered Holstein. This provoked war between Austria and Prussia, with Hesse siding with the Austrians, technically making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} the first weather satellite, TIROS-I, in 1960, {{introduced}} new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present. In the 1970s, buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements, which <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> were not available at all over sea surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{net effect}} of the Dutch {{campaign}} was a pax Hollandica (Dutch peace), assuring VOC control in the southwest of the island. The Dutch called their new area of control the Verenigde Dorpen (United Villages), a deliberate allusion to the United Provinces of their homeland. The campaign was vital to the success and growth of the Dutch colony, which had operated {{as more of a}} trading post than a true colony <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|Going {{into his}} sophomore campaign, Arcidiacono focused on {{improving}} his footwork and shooting mechanics. Arcidiacono hit a 3-pointer with 10.1 {{seconds left in}} a November 29 matchup against Kansas despite not making a shot <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> The Wildcats held on to upset the second-ranked Jayhawks 63-59. Arcidiacono had his first double-double with 20 points and 11 assists in a 94–85 overtime win over Marquette on January 25, 2014. He recorded a season-high 21 points in the February 18 game against Providence. With 3.1 seconds left in double overtime, Arcidiacono completed a three-point play to help the Wildcats to a 82–79 victory.|$|E

5|$|IFK Göteborg {{was founded}} at Café Olivedal—a café in the Annedal {{district}} of Linnéstaden—in the central parts of Gothenburg, on October 4, 1904. It was the third, but only lasting, IFK association in Gothenburg, becoming the 39th overall. A committee for football was created {{at the historic}} first meeting; the association's first football match ended in a 4–1 victory against a club from the local area, IK Viking. The foundation of IFK Göteborg was important {{for the development of}} football in the city, as <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> Örgryte IS, the largest of Gothenburg clubs, were dominant. IFK Göteborg represented some needed competition.|$|E
5|$|In 1099, Bethlehem was {{captured}} by the Crusaders, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister {{on the north side}} of the Church of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, William Parker Foulke {{discovered}} {{the first known}} American dinosaur, in marl pits {{in the small town}} of Haddonfield, New Jersey. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii. It was an extremely important find: Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found (the first was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{during the}} Ramesside period, statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs {{including}} one of Nyuserre Ini were placed in a cachette (a hiding place) in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, suggesting their continued use for cultic purposes <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> Concurrently with these activities, extensive restoration works in Abusir and Saqqara were undertaken {{during the reign of}} Ramses II under the direction of prince Khaemweset.

5|$|McNamara showed {{early on}} {{that he was a}} clutch performer, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82-80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February. In a March game at Georgetown, McNamara missed a free-throw with 10 seconds left that allowed the Hoyas to force {{overtime}}. <b>Until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> McNamara had been a perfect 41-for-41 in conference play. However, McNamara made up for his miss, hitting two 3-pointers and adding another jumper in an 11-3 run to start overtime as Syracuse beat Mike Sweetney and the Georgetown Hoyas, 93-84. Ten of McNamara's 22 came in the extra frame.|$|E

5|$|The Portland {{class were}} also {{designed}} with more advanced armament in mind. Their main guns {{were the first}} to be specially designed to fire long-point projectiles with a streamlined shape, which increased the guns' range when compared with older cruiser guns. Such projectiles were in use by ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> out-ranged U.S. cruisers with their firepower. The New Orleans class was designed with these lessons in mind, intended to create a better balance between protection, armament and speed.|$|E

5|$|To {{counter the}} power of Saavedra, Moreno sought to modify the {{military}} balance of power by reforming the promotion rules. Up <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead. However, {{in the short run}} this measure worked against him, as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted precisely because of such rules.|$|E

Wade was named the game's MVP after recording 28 points, 11 assists, 5 steals and 6 rebounds.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Minister of Interior commented that the police were already in the process of hiring 4,000 new officers (about 10% of its total manpower), thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments. Experts further pointed out the necessity to provide more CQB training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas.

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{campaign}} against the Catholic Church, hundreds of monasteries in Germany and Austria were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled. In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster, August von Galen, publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4, the Nazi non-voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to be killed. In a series of sermons that received international attention, he criticised the programme as illegal and immoral. His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders, the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up <b>until</b> <b>that</b> <b>point.</b> Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen's death would only {{be viewed as a}} martyrdom and lead to further unrest. Hitler decided {{to deal with the issue}} when the war was over.|$|E
