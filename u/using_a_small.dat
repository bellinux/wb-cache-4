5|$|A 2002 {{research}} paper on machine vision by computer scientists Roman Goldenberg, Ron Kimmel, Ehud Rivlin, and Michael Rudzsky used Futurism's techniques of motion, as embodied by Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, {{to illustrate the}} mathematical representation of periodic motion <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of eigenshapes.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{on reports}} from airmen {{that there were}} no signs of enemy {{activity}} and the islands might have been evacuated, General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force. The campaign began on 29February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros, the third-largest island in the group. By <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied. A furious battle over the islands ensued.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} are sensitive to light, <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in {{those who do not}} respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E

5|$|Jarrett {{used his}} {{strength}} against the 1–2–3 Kid {{in the following}} match. The Kid fought back with a spinning heel kick, but Jarrett regained control. Toward {{the end of the}} match, The Kid sustained a kayfabe injury to his knee. Jarrett tried to use this to his advantage by using the Figure Four leglock, but The Kid blocked the hold by <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> package to pin Jarrett for the victory. Upset at being eliminated from the tournament, Jarrett responded by performing three piledrivers on The Kid after the match.|$|E
5|$|Joy had {{to review}} 500 films a year <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> staff and little power. The Hays office {{did not have}} the {{authority}} to order studios to remove material from a film in 1930, but instead worked by reasoning and sometimes pleading with them. Complicating matters, the appeals process ultimately put the responsibility for making the final decision {{in the hands of the}} studios themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} the {{accordion}} feat was performed by Home <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> harmonica was originally suggested by J. M. Robertson in 1891. The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR did not record {{the presence of the}} mouth organs, and Lamont speculates that it is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or not made them public. The accordion in the SPR collection is not the actual one Home used. They display a duplicate.|$|E

5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|LeMonde resurfaces in Pyongyang, where North Korean ruler Kym Zung-Lee invites several {{world leaders}} to a peace conference. The two plan to kidnap the world leaders, {{especially}} since Kim financed LeMonde's operations in Indocine {{and getting the}} nuclear weapon (stashed inside Kim Il-sung's statue on Mansudae Hill). <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> helicopter and nonlethal weapons, the player is able to spirit the delegates to a French frigate somewhere in the Taedong River and {{get them out of}} the country; other delegates left behind are sent to bomb shelters or are evacuated by STRIKE Chinook transports. Also, between escorting the delegates to safety, the player and Andrea manage to take over an AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter from a museum while fending off Kym's security forces in the process. The missing nuclear weapon explodes as the player sits out the blast in the Rungnado May Day Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Magic in Vagrant Story {{is learned}} {{later in the}} game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire {{will remain in the}} menu, and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{designated}} in 1924 by the New York State Department of Transportation from Colliersville (near Oneonta) north to Utica. At the time, NY28 began at then-NY9 in Colliersville and headed north on its current alignment to Cooperstown. NY28 separated from its modern routing {{and continued to}} Springfield north of Cooperstown on what is now NY80. Between Springfield and Richfield Springs, the highway utilized what is now US20. At Richfield Springs, the highway turned north onto modern NY167 and followed the current alignments of NY167 and NY168 {{to the village of}} Mohawk. Here, the highway turned westward, <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> portion of its current alignment and the present-day NY5S corridor to connect to Utica by way of Ilion.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{was born}} in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 10 July 1927. His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself {{frequently}} out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer when he was 12. He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his thinking in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so {{they would be more}} adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.|$|E

5|$|The Tongan Meteorological Service {{reported}} {{that some of}} its property and equipment had been damaged. The property damage had an approximate value of about $2,000 (2009TOP, $1,0002009 USD). This included a Stevenson screen, office guttering, a HF radio antennae, signal processor, and satellite receiver. They also {{reported that}} the National weather forecasting center in Fua’amotu had experienced power failure on April 4 at 1600 UTC; for this reason the center operated <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> portable generator until early {{the next day when}} they stopped issuing warnings as Lin was no longer a threat to Tonga. Power was eventually restored later that day.|$|E
5|$|Thus the FG01 did not promise much {{in terms}} of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor {{aerodynamic}} performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had a plump nose, initially no airbox, and was overweight and under-powered, <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> Ford-Cosworth ED V8 customer engine largely financed by Ford do Brasil, which developed an estimated 100bhp less than the most powerful engine in the field, the Renault V10 supplied to the Benetton and Williams teams. It was also the only car to have a manual gearbox in the 1995 F1 season. The car was liveried in a distinctive yellow-and-blue colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green wheel-rims, illustrating the team's Brazilian influence in its first year. The precise hue of each colour was chosen {{as a tribute to}} Ayrton Senna, who had been killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix; the cars were liveried in identical shades to those used on the Brazilian's helmet design.|$|E
5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
