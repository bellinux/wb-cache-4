5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games. A remake of the game with <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E

500|$|In February 1959, Kubrick {{received}} a phone call from Kirk Douglas asking him to direct Spartacus (1960), based on the true life story of the historical figure Spartacus and the events of the Third Servile War. Douglas had acquired the rights to the novel by Howard Fast and blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo began penning the script. It was produced by Douglas, who also starred as rebellious slave Spartacus, and cast Laurence Olivier as his foe, the Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus. Douglas hired Kubrick for a reported fee of $150,000 to take over direction soon after he fired director Anthony Mann. [...] Kubrick had, at 31, already directed four feature films, and this became his largest by far, with a cast of over 10,000 and a large budget of $6 million. At the time, this was the most expensive film ever made in America, and Kubrick became the youngest director in Hollywood history to helm an epic. It was the first time that Kubrick filmed using the anamorphic 35mm horizontal Super Technirama process to achieve <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition,</b> which allowed him to capture large panoramic scenes, including one with 8,000 trained soldiers from Spain representing the Roman army. [...] Disputes broke out during the filming. Kubrick complained about not having full creative control over the artistic aspects, insisting on improvising extensively during the production. Kubrick and Douglas were also at odds over the script, with Kubrick angering Douglas when he cut all but two of his lines from the opening 30 minutes. Despite the on-set troubles, Spartacus was a critical and commercial success, earning $14.6 million at the box office in its first run. The film established Kubrick as a major director, receiving six Academy Award nominations and winning four; it ultimately convinced him that if so much could be made of such a problematic production, he could achieve anything. Spartacus also marked, however, the end of the working relationship between Kubrick and Douglas.|$|E

50|$|The {{instrument}} {{used for this}} purpose is known as a pachymeter. Conventional pachymeters are devices that display the thickness of the cornea, usually in micrometres, when the ultrasonic transducer touches the cornea. Newer generations of ultrasonic pachymeters work by way of Corneal Waveform (CWF). Using this technology the user can capture an <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> echogram of the cornea, somewhat like a corneal A-scan. Pachymetry using the corneal waveform process allows the user to more accurately measure the corneal thickness, verify the reliability of the measurements that were obtained, superimpose corneal waveforms to monitor changes in a patient's cornea over time, and measure structures within the cornea such as micro bubbles created during femto-second laser flap cuts.|$|E

50|$|A {{broadband}} {{speed of}} 2 Mbit/s or more {{is recommended for}} streaming standard definition video without experiencing buffering or skips, especially live video, for example to a Roku, Apple TV, Google TV or a Sony TV Blu-ray Disc Player. 5 Mbit/s is recommended for High Definition content and 9 Mbit/s for <b>Ultra-High</b> <b>Definition</b> content. Streaming media storage size is calculated from the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula (for a single user and file) requires a storage size in megabytes which is equal to length (in seconds) × bit rate (in bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024). For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in a 320 × 240 pixels window size) will be:(3,600 s × 300,000 bit/s) / (8×1024×1024) requires around 128 MB of storage.|$|E
5000|$|Spartacus {{was filmed}} using the 35 mm Super 70 Technirama format and then blown up to 70 mm film. This {{was a change}} for Kubrick, who {{preferred}} using the standard spherical format. This process allowed him to achieve <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> and to capture large panoramic scenes. Kubrick had wanted to shoot the picture in Rome with cheap extras and resources, but Edward Muhl, president of Universal Pictures, wanted to make {{an example of the}} film and prove that a successful epic could be made in Hollywood itself and [...] "stem the flood of 'runaway' producers heading for Europe". A compromise was reached by filming the intimate scenes in Hollywood, and the battle scenes, at Kubrick's request, in Spain. Kubrick found working outdoors or in real locations to be distracting; he believed the actors would benefit more from working on a sound stage, where they could fully concentrate. To create the illusion of the large crowds that play such an essential role in the film, Kubrick's crew used three-channel sound equipment to record 76,000 spectators at a Michigan State - Notre Dame college football game shouting [...] "Hail, Crassus!"

40|$|In {{software}} driven multi-user {{video conferencing}} systems, consumer progression towards <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> (i. e., 8 k) resolution introduces new {{challenges to the}} video combination process in sustaining smooth combined video playback at high frame rates. As such, this paper analyzes the underlying architecture of a conventional video combiner to identify the performance impact of combined video frame rates at <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> resolutions. Then, two straightforward parallel video combination architectures using software application threads, namely PVC- 1 and PVC- 2, are studied as a benchmark. In PVC- 1, the number of application threads tallies {{with the number of}} client videos to be combined, which improves playback performance at the expense of inconsistencies in inset client frame rates within a combined video. PVC- 2 includes a synchronizer to address these inconsistencies, but exhibits marginal performance gains. To address the aforementioned problems, a balanced workload parallel video combiner architecture is proposed, namely PVC- 3. In this architecture, a balanced workload management algorithm stitches client videos into an <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> combined frame, {{based on the number of}} available logical processors on a multi-core processor. This method improves frame rate performance and sustains consistent client frame rates within a combined video. Experimental results suggest that PVC- 3 is superior over PVC- 2 and achieves a frame rate performance gain of 27 % against a conventional video combiner for a combined video of 16 clients (each at a resolution of 720 p) and zero standard deviation in combined frame rate consistency...|$|E
40|$|Several <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> imaging sensors, {{applicable}} in TV systems, electronic cinemas and tele-medicine, {{have been}} reported [1 - 3]. However, these sensors require a large optical system, high power and many components for driving and signal-processing circuits, limiting the realization of a practical camera system. A newly developed digital-output CMOS image sensor fabricated in 0. 25 µm CMOS technology for a compact <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> television (UDTV) camera is presented. The image sensor size corresponds to 1 1 / 4 -inch optical format and the die size of the chip fits into the standard reticle window (20 mm x 20 mm). The UDTV system requires 8. 3 million pixels, 60 frames/s operation in the progressive scanning mode, which translates to approximately 500 MHz pixel readout rate. To eliminate the difficulty of handling analog signals with such a wide frequency bandwidth, analog-to-digital converters (ADC’s) are implemented on-chip.

40|$|The {{increase}} in real-time <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> video services is a challenging issue for current network infrastructures. The high bitrate traffic generated by <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> content reduces {{the effectiveness of}} current live video distribution systems. Transcoders and application layer multicasting (ALM) can reduce traffic in a video delivery system, but they are limited due to the static nature of their implementations. To overcome the restrictions of current static video delivery systems, an OpenFlow based migration system is proposed. This system enables an almost seamless migration of a transcoder or ALM node, while delivering real-time <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> content. Further to this, a novel heuristic algorithm is presented to optimise control of the migration events and destination. The combination of the migration system and heuristic algorithm provides an improved video delivery system, capable of migrating resources during operation with minimal disruption to clients. With the rise in popularity of consumer based live streaming, {{it is necessary to}} develop and improve architectures that can support these new types of applications. Current architectures introduce a large delay to video streams, which presents issues for certain applications. In order to overcome this, an improved infrastructure for delivering real-time streams is also presented. The proposed system uses OpenFlow within a content delivery network (CDN) architecture, in order to improve several aspects of current CDNs. Aside from the reduction in stream delay, other improvements include switch level multicasting to reduce duplicate traffic and smart load balancing for server resources. Furthermore, a novel max-flow algorithm is also presented. This algorithm aims to optimise traffic within a system such as the proposed OpenFlow CDN, with the focus on distributing traffic across the network, {{in order to reduce the}} probability of blocking...|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of smartphones/mobile devices that support {{a wide range}} of broadband applications and services has driven the volume of mobile data traffic to an unprecedented high level, requiring a next generation mobile communication system, i. e., the fifth generation (5 G). Millimeter wave bands, due to the large available spectrum bandwidth, are considered {{as one of the most}} promising approaches to significantly boost the capacity. In this paper, we define a typical use case envisaged in the early stage of the 5 G system rollout, where users can experience 100 M+ data rate in the target area and at the same time enjoy services demanding extremely high data rates, such as virtual reality and <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> video. We then break down the use case into four different traffic types: web browsing, content sharing, virtual reality experience and <b>ultra-high</b> <b>definition</b> video, and derive and analyze the distributions of the required instantaneous data rates for each individual traffic type. Finally, we consider the case where multiple users with mixture of traffic types are simultaneously active and analyze the overall data rate and bandwidth requirements to support such a scenario.
