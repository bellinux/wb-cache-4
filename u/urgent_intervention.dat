30|$|Quality {{assurance}} is {{a complex}} task, and patients {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) are more likely than other hospitalized patients to experience medical errors, due to the complexity of their conditions, need for <b>urgent</b> <b>interventions,</b> and considerable workload fluctuation [7 – 15]. Thus, the risk of medical errors associated with ICU admission deserves continuous attention. Safety must be defined and measurement tools devised. The indicators for routine monitoring must be clearly identified. The impact of medical errors and other adverse events on patients and relatives must be investigated. Prevention strategies must be developed and evaluated. The keys to developing a culture of patient safety in the ICU must be found. In this article, we review these points.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} great {{progress}} in antithrombotic therapy {{over the past several}} years. Its use has increased with the advent of novel anticoagulants, as these medications do not require frequent blood tests for monitoring. Antithrombotic therapy is aimed at reducing the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, valvular heart disease and pulmonary embolism. These patients are often critically ill and frequently undergo <b>urgent</b> <b>interventions</b> requiring discontinuation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy which can increase the risk of thrombosis; however, continuing these agents can lead to increased risk of haemorrhage.

30|$|Intensive {{care unit}} (ICU) {{patients}} {{are at risk}} for medication errors and adverse drug events (ADEs) because of the complexity of their conditions, the need for <b>urgent</b> <b>interventions</b> and the considerable workload fluctuation of the ICU staff [1, 2]. In addition, certain hospital processes carry a high risk for medication errors. One of these processes is the transition of care. Approximately 60 % of the medication errors occur at care transitions [3]. Lee et al. [4] showed that clinically significant medication transfer errors (MTEs) occur in 6 out of 10 patients when being shifted from one hospital ward to another. The main cause of MTEs is incorrect or incomplete communication, although healthcare providers spend much time trying to validate the accuracy of patient medication at these interfaces of care [5].|$|R
