40|$|This DIIS Report {{provides}} an overview of the political and military issues that are likely to shape the coming discussions about NATO's new <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept.</b> NATO's current <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> dates back to 1999 and over the last couple years an increasing number of policy-makers have suggested {{that it is time to}} take stock of the transatlantic Alliance. The exercise is significant because the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> represents the operational view of the Washington Treaty - the basic text of NATO - and because it will bequeath a new strategic direction to the Alliance. The Report presents three arguments. One is that the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> serves several functions: it codifies past decision and existing practices; it provides strategic direction; and it serves as an instrument of public diplomacy. The second argument is that the new <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> must balance the push and pull of two competing visions of NATO, one being Come home, NATO; the other being Globalize, stupid. The contest between these diverging visions has consequences for a number of issues that the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> must address. Lastly, it is argued that although the agenda of globalization is being questioned, NATO will continue down the path of global engagement...|$|R

40|$|The <b>strategic</b> <b>concept</b> of "blue oceans" is {{currently}} undoubtedly {{one of the}} most interesting and most often talked <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts.</b> The thesis is therefore deals with the development of this <b>strategic</b> <b>concept</b> at the time and on the basis of previous papers of the authors in which were introduced tools and frameworks that later became part of the blue ocean strategy concept. The thesis also deals with other publications that the idea of the concept uses in own frames or in some way continues to build upon it. Further a description of the whole <b>strategic</b> <b>concept</b> is presented with each of analytical framework and tool with emphasis on additional context and findings of the section on the recent development of the concept. A key part of the thesis is the application of the concept to the three services - Knihovnička. cz Prezi and the Steam and evavulation of these tools with emphasis to the conclusions that have been made in the recent development of the <b>strategic</b> <b>concept</b> of "blue oceans" and its application...|$|R

The new <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> is {{analyzed}} in a DIIS Report edited by Jens Ringsmose and Sten Rynning. The report entitled NATO's New Strategic Concept: A Comprehensive Assessment contains 15 individual chapters all on {{different aspects of}} NATO's new <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept</b> making the publication the first major and comprehensive analysis {{of the implications of}} NATO's new <b>Strategic</b> <b>Concept.</b> The publication is the outcome of cooperation between DIIS and University of Southern Denmark and draws on the contributions from a conference held {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Lisbon Summit.

40|$|A {{decision}} has been made that the Swedish and the Finnish Navy will expand their cooperation by creating the “Swedish-Finnish Naval Task Group” (SFNTG). Based on Michael Codner’s theory of interoperability, this essay’s aim is to investigate if the Swedish and the Finnish currently are interoperable with each other, due to their military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts.</b> According to Codner, similarities between the cooperating nation’s military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts</b> are required in order to reach a high degree of interoperability. This essay will analyze and compare Sweden and Finland’s military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts,</b> based on three categories; Global Projection, Territorial Defence and Combat Capability. The conclusion is that there are differences between the Swedish and the Finnish military <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts</b> in every category, of varying degrees. By looking at the results of this investigation, it is clear in what direction the two nations have to adapt their concepts to enable a high degree of interoperability {{for the future of the}} SFNTG...|$|R

5000|$|Concept-driven {{strategy}} therefore {{starts from}} agreeing and enacting {{a set of}} <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts</b> (organizing principles) that [...] "works best" [...] for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts</b> make up its Statement of Intent (or Purpose).|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{argues that}} despite increase in international activity by retailers across the globe, and increase in retail internationalization failures, the study on {{analysis of these}} failures is sufficiently less. The report acknowledges {{the fact that the}} internationalization of firm needs to be accessed from different <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts.</b> These concepts, either external or internal to the firms are important to be studied and analyzed before entering international markets. The report reviews the literature on Porter five forces, Resource-Based View of the Firm, Acquisition as an entry mode strategy, and CAGE framework. Thus, taking a holistic view of different <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts,</b> and referring to past studies and company records, the concepts are then applied to investigate Wal-Mart’s failure in Germany. The analysis helps to understand the effects of various <b>strategic</b> <b>concepts</b> that influenced Wal-Mart’s failure in Germany. The report recognizes the importance of organizational fit between external and internal environment, entry mode strategies and CAGE framework in the overall Retail Internationalization Process. At the end, the report concludes with the difficulties and limitations observed, thereby recommending suggestions for future research...|$|R
