50|$|Overcollateralization (OC) is a {{commonly}} used form of credit enhancement. With this support structure, the face {{value of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio {{is larger than the}} security it backs, thus the issued security is overcollateralized.

25|$|Currency {{interest}} rate fluctuations: Like all fixed income securities, {{the prices of}} fixed rate ABS move in response to changes in {{interest rate}}s. Fluctuations in interest rates affect floating rate ABS prices less than fixed rate securities, as the index against which the ABS rate adjusts will reflect interest rate changes in the economy. Furthermore, interest rate changes may affect the prepayment rates on <b>underlying</b> <b>loans</b> that back some types of ABS, which can affect yields.

50|$|Companies {{recognize}} servicing {{rights as}} distinct assets or liabilities when ownership of those rights is contractually separated from {{ownership of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>loan.</b> The value recognized for servicing rights {{is based on the}} net present value of the expected cash flows received from servicing less the amount that would be required to adequately compensate a servicer (this incorporates an expected cost of servicing plus a profit margin required by market participants). The value of servicing assets or liabilities is highly interest-rate sensitive due to the relationship between interest rates and expected prepayments (i.e., loan refinancing). This is because when a loan is refinanced the servicing fees and other benefits of servicing cease, making the value of these assets extremely volatile. For this reason, companies that hold large amounts of servicing rights tend to hedge the value of those servicing rights using interest rate sensitive derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and swaptions.|$|E

This paper examines the dynamic linkages between credit risk migration due to rating shifts and prevailing macroeconomic conditions, reflected in alternative business cycle states. An innovative empirical methodology applies to bank internal rating data, under different economic scenarios and investigates the implications of credit risk quality shifts for risk rating transition matrices. The empirical findings are useful and critical for banks to align to Basel guidelines in relation to core capital requirements and risk-weighted assets in the <b>underlying</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{representative}} sample of residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) deals from the pre-crisis period, we show that deals with a higher level of equity tranche have a significantly lower foreclosure rate that cannot be explained away by the <b>underlying</b> <b>loan</b> pool’s observable credit risk factors. The effect is concentrated within pools with a higher likelihood of asymmetric information between deal sponsors and potential buyers of the securities.

40|$|This project {{reviews the}} {{structure}} of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities at issuance {{as well as their}} underlying collateral analysis and deal level analysis. Through the comparison of CMBS 1. 0 and CMBS 2. 0 (CMBS 1. 0 is the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities issued pre-crisis and CMBS 2. 0 is the CMBS that was issued after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis), we investigate how the underwriting standards evolved {{as a response to the}} crisis of 2008. This paper looks at several different categories with convergent informational outcomes. This paper identifies how underwriting standards becomes stricter, for example the cutoff LTV for CMBS 2. 0 is lower and cutoff DSCR for CMBS 2. 0 is higher. The new CMBS issuance starts to take off after 2008, though slowly. Moreover, this paper provides estimates of expected loss by vintage through the use of its own collateral model. Bloomberg identifies the deals we modeled as falling into one of the following categories: Conduit, Portfolio, SASB (single asset/single borrower), or Small Balance deals. In total, we modeled 617 American CMBS deals, which originated at various years between 2000 and 2011. Approximately 4, 000 bonds were included in our model. The underlying property and loan information that we used in our model came exclusively from the Bloomberg database. We modeled the change in property values by the time-dependent Moody’s CPPI index. We also considered stressed property values. The discount factor on the value of a particular stressed property is influenced by relative location of the target property to stressed properties. We subtracted the current balance of the <b>underlying</b> <b>loan</b> by the current estimated value of the property in our model to get the expected loss for each loan. Then we summed each of the individual losses to get the expected total loss for each deal. This algorithm influenced our decision to investigate the change in value of the collateral underwriting the loans...|$|E

Reputational incentives induce a large fraction of potential sellers to hold on to their loans rather than sell them in the secondary market. We find that a variety of policies that have been proposed during the recent crisis to remedy market inefficiencies do not help resolve the adverse selection problem. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the potential loan book transfer to NAMA, the Draft NAMA Business Plan outlined the existence of over 1,000 derivative positions attached to the commercial loans. These loans were transferred to NAMA as well. The nominal value of this derivative portfolio was €14.7 billion. Developers and other borrowers in real-estate transactions are often required by lenders to enter into derivative transactions {{as part of a}} loan agreement, as a mechanism to fix the interest rate on the loan. Typically, interest rate swap agreements are used. If interest rates fall, the borrower does not benefit, as he/she must pay the saving to the counter-party of the swap agreement. Given the decline in interest rates over the last 2 years (e.g. the US Federal Funds Rate was 0.25% in late September 2009 versus 5.25% in August 2007), there may be a significant liability relating to the €14.7bn derivative portfolio. The Draft NAMA Business Plan does not elaborate on the magnitude of this liability, however, it states: [...] "These derivatives change the interest rate structure of the <b>underlying</b> <b>loans</b> and their mark-to-market value will be incorporated into the valuation of the loans".|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three {{essays on}} financial contracting and intermediation under information asymmetry. They examine both {{some of the}} asymmetric information problems that contracts can mitigate {{as well as some}} of the distortions they can cause. The first essay examines real investment distortions that occur as a result of information intermediation through credit ratings. Credit Rating Agencies emphasize the importance of Debt/EBITDA ratio thresholds in their rating process. I show that firms near these salient thresholds respond to the incentive to improve their appearance on this dimension by distorting R&D and SG&A investment activities during periods leading up to bond issuance. Subsequently, these firms are more likely to experience declines in innovation output, profitability, and Tobin’s Q than observationally similar firms not near a threshold. These distortions highlight at important cost of transparency in corporate credit rating criteria. The second essay examines how high-quality borrowers use the design of performance-sensitive bank debt contracts to alleviate financial constraints. I show that borrowers use a convex pricing grid (i. e., a contract where the increase in the loan spread following a decline in performance exceeds the decrease in the spread following a performance improvement) to signal their unobservable creditworthiness. I find that these borrowers receive loans that are 21 - 28 % larger with a spread that is 31 - 37 basis points lower than observationally similar borrowers who use fixed-spread loans. Consistent with the notion that a costly signal should positively correlate with future financial health, signaling borrowers are one third less likely to experience financial distress during the term of their loans. The third essay examines the role of security design in mitigating informational frictions in securitization markets. We show that residential mortgage-backed security deals with a higher level of equity tranche have a significantly lower foreclosure rate that cannot be explained away by the <b>underlying</b> <b>loan</b> pool's observable credit risk factors. The effect is concentrated within pools with a higher likelihood of asymmetric information between deal sponsors and potential buyers of the securities.

40|$|CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) are {{securities}} {{backed by}} pools of mortgage loans on {{commercial real estate}} properties. The primary attractiveness of the CMBS market is that it provides liquidity and diversification to commercial real estate investors and ready access to capital for commercial lenders. CMBS are structured such that a master servicer oversees {{the administration of the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>loans</b> and the distribution of the cash flows to the tranche investors. One of these functions involves the administration and disposition of troubled loans. When a loan in a CMBS deal fails to perform as expected, the master servicer sends the loan to a “special servicer. ” The special servicer has wide latitude to foreclose on the loan or modify the loan terms in an effort to maximize the cash flows to the CMBS investors. Since the first-loss investors have the most at stake when a loan fails to perform, these investors often control the appointment of the special servicer. In fact, the special servicer often holds a portion of the first-loss piece in order to properly align the incentives of the investors and the special servicer. As such, the special servicer may not be concerned with the borrower's position, but rather may undertake action...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{rise and}} fall of {{subprime}} mortgage securitizations contributed in part to the ensuing credit crisis and financial crisis of 2008. Some participants in the subprime-mortgage-backed securities market relied at least in part on analyses grounded in the loss development factor (LDF) method, and many did not conduct their own credit analyses, relying instead on the work of others such as securities brokers and rating agencies. In some cases, the parties providing these analyses may have lacked the independence, or at least the appearance of it, that would have likely better served the market. A new appreciation for the value of independent analysis is clearly a silver lining and an important lesson to be taken from the crisis. Actuaries are well positioned to lend assistance to the endeavor. Mortgages are long-duration assets and, similarly, mortgage credit losses are relatively long-tailed. As casualty actuaries are aware, the LDF method has inherent limitations associated with immature development. The authors in this paper will cite examples of parties relying on the LDF or similar methods for projecting subprime mortgage credit losses, highlight the limitations of relying exclusively on such methods for projecting subprime mortgage credit performance, and conclude by offering general enhancements for an improved approach that considers the underwriting characteristics of the <b>underlying</b> <b>loans</b> as well as economic factors...|$|R
