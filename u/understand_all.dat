The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must <b>understand</b> <b>all</b> of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

According to Peikoff, one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it, i.e., it can be logically integrated with the rest of one's knowledge; one is then certain {{within the context of the}} evidence.|$|E
25|$|Insurance {{policies}} can be {{complex and}} some policyholders may not <b>understand</b> <b>all</b> the fees and coverages {{included in a}} policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing {{every aspect of the}} insurance business, including minimum standards for policies {{and the ways in which}} they may be advertised and sold.|$|E

She wanted to ensure that the audience would <b>understand</b> <b>all</b> the jokes. The opera won the 1986 National Institute for Music Theatre Award.|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–", noting that [...] "'The Fire' {{is not the}} second season’s funniest half-hour, but I love it for its simplicity." [...] Writing that the episode bore {{similarities}} to a bottle episode, he enjoyed {{the way that the}} conversations among the employees allowed the audience to more fully <b>understand</b> <b>all</b> of the individual characters better. Adams also praised the interaction between Carell and Novak, as well as the performance of Wilson, which he called [...] "unsettling".|$|E

500|$|The writers {{worked to}} keep the script's pop-culture {{references}} up-to-date over the years of development. Kinberg confirmed that the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It also makes jokes at that expense of Green Lantern. While Miller {{felt that it was}} okay for audience members to not <b>understand</b> <b>all</b> of the jokes in the film, he wanted to avoid things specifically targeted to comic fans, saying that [...] "any joke that an audience needs to look up on the internet after the movie is not something I’m in favour of." [...] The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where the title character breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home. He also confirms that Cable will appear in the sequel. After reading the scene, a Fox executive described the film as [...] "Ferris Bueller's Day Off meets Natural Born Killers", which the writers felt was an accurate description.|$|E

Ziegler indicated that the new staffer would be handling [...] "special projects of a wide variety", and The New York Times speculated that in view of his past, his duties would most likely be political. Haldeman noted in his diaries that his new subordinate was to serve as the [...] "inside White House man for political campaigns". Chotiner served as liaison between the White House and Republican organizations in 31 states. Chotiner taught at a March 1970 seminar for Young Republican leaders where he suggested that the Republican running against Senator Edward Kennedy mention the Chappaquiddick incident at every opportunity, while insisting that it was not an issue in the campaign. Chotiner stated, [...] "If he says it enough times, I think the voters of Massachusetts will <b>understand</b> <b>all</b> about Chappaquiddick." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by freelance writer Kenji Terada, based on a story by Sakaguchi. Ishii heavily influenced the game's setting with his idea of the crystals. He also suggested illustrator Yoshitaka Amano as character designer, but Sakaguchi declined at first as {{he had never heard}} the artist's name before. When Sakaguchi showed Ishii some drawings on magazine clippings and told him that this was the art style he was looking for, Ishii revealed to him that these were actually created by Amano, hence leading to his involvement in the game. The music for Final Fantasy was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and marked his 16th video game music composition. Iranian-American programmer Nasir Gebelli was hired to code the game. He initially tried to <b>understand</b> <b>all</b> aspects of the gameplay but was soon advised by Sakaguchi to just program the design concepts so {{he did not have to}} explain everything to Gebelli in detail. Among the other developers were graphic designer Kazuko Shibuya, programmers Kiyoshi Yoshii and Ken Narita, as well as debugger Hiroyuki Ito. When the project started to show promise, designer Hiromichi Tanaka and his [...] "B-Team" [...] joined to aid development. The lack of faith in Sakaguchi's team, as well as its unpopularity within the company, motivated the staff members to give their best.|$|E

[...] Overfishing has also had an effect. Frid adds, “Fish communities can be altered in a number of ways, for example they can decrease if particular sized individuals of a species are targeted, as this affects predator and prey dynamics. Fishing, however, is not the sole perpetrator of changes to marine life - pollution is another example [...] No one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor." ...|$|E
