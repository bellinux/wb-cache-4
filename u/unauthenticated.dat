5|$|On March 9, {{the judge}} {{sentence}}d Cisneros and Garza {{to life in}} prison after the jury decided that neither of them posed a threat to society, and thus did not deserve the death penalty. This sentence included the possibility for parole after they complete 35 mandatory years behind bars. The head juror said the tapes were the strongest evidence against them, along with Martínez' testimony. Fischer's parents said they were pleased with the decision, and that justice was finally served, but said their son's absence would leave a void {{for the rest of their}} lives. The prosecution intended to have Cisneros sentenced to death arguing that her actions were premeditated. Garza's closing words centered around him being told by Martínez that Cisneros wanted Fischer hurt, and that he would not have knowingly participated in a murder. Both defense attorneys said they would appeal the verdict. Cisneros's attorney in particular said the judge's denial of a separate trial for his client was the reason for his early appeal. The defense said that trials where two defendants implicate each other are often severed, The judge refused to sever them because Cisneros's statement did not mention Garza. The defense also said they would appeal the verdict because they believed that the voice recordings were tampered with and <b>unauthenticated.</b> A judge formalized the jury's decision and sentenced Cisneros and Garza {{to life in prison}} on April 18.|$|E

2500|$|By way of comparison, [...] "pilgrims' notes" [...] are items or sayings {{that are}} {{attributed}} to the central figures but have not been authenticated. While these may be inspirational, they are not considered authoritative. Some of `Abdu'l-Bahá's collected talks (e.g. `Abdu'l-Bahá in London, Paris Talks, and The Promulgation of Universal Peace.) may fall into this category, but are awaiting further authentication. The Star of the West, published in the United States from 1910 to 1924, contains many pilgrim's notes and <b>unauthenticated</b> letters of `Abdu'l-Bahá.|$|E

60|$|Thus briefly, and, I trust, impressively, have I sketched {{the history}} of Kaspar Hauser, 'the Child of Europe,' as it was {{presented}} by various foreign pamphleteers, and, in 1892, by Miss Elizabeth E. Evans.[11] But, as for the 'authentic records' on which the partisans of Kaspar Hauser based their version, they are anonymous, <b>unauthenticated,</b> discredited {{by the results of}} a libel action in 1883; and, in short, are worthless and impudent rubbish.|$|E

60|$|However, {{by way of}} {{psychological}} explanation of the dream, my friend cited Coleridge's legend, as to the German girl and her unconscious knowledge of certain learned languages. 'And what is the evidence for the truth of Coleridge's legend?' Of course, there is none, or none known to all the psychologists who quote it from Coleridge.

60|$|They {{left the}} apartment--they left the house--an <b>unauthenticated</b> and dubious, but appalling, {{sensation}} of terror had already spread itself among the inferior retainers, {{who had so}} short time before strutted, and bustled, and thronged the doorway and the passages. A report had arisen, of which the origin could not be traced, of troops advancing towards the spot in considerable numbers; and men who, {{for one reason or}} other, were most of them amenable to the arm of power, had either shrunk into stables or corners, or fled the place entirely. There was solitude on the landscape excepting the small party which now moved towards the rude pier, where a boat lay manned, agreeably to Redgauntlet's orders previously given.|$|E
60|$|The {{killing of}} a man named Sellers, and the {{combination}} of circumstances that had made the tragedy a memorable regret, had marked, if not a change, at least a cessation in Duane's activities. He had trailed Sellers to kill him for the supposed abducting of Jennie. He had trailed him long after he had learned Sellers traveled alone. Duane wanted absolute assurance of Jennie's death. Vague rumors, a few words here and there, <b>unauthenticated</b> stories, were all Duane had gathered in years to substantiate his belief--that Jennie died shortly after {{the beginning of her}} second captivity. But Duane did not know surely. Sellers might have told him. Duane expected, if not to force it from him at the end, to read it in his eyes. But the bullet went too unerringly; it locked his lips and fixed his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding his unwearied pains in {{the work}} of spoliation, some {{precious}} fragments are left, which we ought infinitely to value,--by which we may learn, and lament, the loss of what he has destroyed. If it were not for those inestimable fragments and wrecks of the recorded government which have been saved from the destruction which Mr. Hastings intended for them all, the most shameful enormities that have ever disgraced a government or harassed a people would only be known in this country by secret whispers and <b>unauthenticated</b> anecdotes; the disgracer's of government, the vexers and afflicters of mankind, instead of being brought before an awful public tribunal, might have been honored with the highest distinctions and rewards their country has to bestow; and sordid bribery, base peculation, iron-handed extortion, fierce, unrelenting tyranny, might themselves have been invested with those sacred robes of justice before which this day they have cause to tremble.|$|E
60|$|Thenceforth Wallace was an outlaw, and {{the most}} implacable foe to the English. In his wild retreat he quickly {{gathered}} round him other men ill-used, or discontented, or patriotic, or lovers of the wild life which he led, and at their head he not only cut off the parties sent to seize him, but watched his opportunity for marauding on the English or their allies. There is a horrible story that the English governor of Ayr, treacherously inviting the Scottish gentry to a feast, hung them all as they entered, and that Wallace revenged the slaughter with equal cruelty by burning the English alive in their sleep in the very buildings where the murder took place, the Barns of Ayr, as they were called. The history is <b>unauthenticated,</b> but it is believed {{in the neighborhood of}} Ayr, and has been handed down by Wallace's Homer, Blind Harry, whose poem on the exploits of the Knight of Ellerslie was published sixty years from this time.|$|E
60|$|This was, however, no charm for his {{unpleasant}} {{current of}} thought. There rushed {{on his mind}} the various traditions of Victor Lee's chamber, which, though he had often despised them as vague, <b>unauthenticated,</b> and inconsistent rumours, engendered by ancient superstition, and transmitted {{from generation to generation}} by loquacious credulity, had something in them, which, did not tend to allay the present unpleasant state of his nerves. Then, when he recollected the events of that very afternoon, the weapon pressed against his throat, and the strong arm which threw him backward on the floor--if the remembrance served to contradict the idea of flitting phantoms, and unreal daggers, it certainly induced him to believe, that there was in some part of this extensive mansion a party of cavaliers, or malignants, harboured, who might arise in the night, overpower the guards, and execute upon them all, but on Harrison in particular, as one of the regicide judges, that vengeance, which was so eagerly thirsted for by the attached followers of the slaughtered monarch.|$|E
6000|$|Concerning another ballad in the [...] "Minstrelsy"--"Auld Maitland"-- Professor Child has {{expressed}} a suspicion which most readers feel. What Scott told Ellis about it (Autumn, 1802) was, {{that he got}} it in the Forest, [...] "copied down from the recitation of an old shepherd by a country farmer." [...] Who was the farmer? Will Laidlaw had employed James Hogg, as shepherd. Hogg's mother chanted [...] "Auld Maitland." [...] Hogg first met Scott {{in the summer of}} 1801. The shepherd had already seen the first volume of the [...] "Minstrelsy." [...] Did he, thereupon, write [...] "Auld Maitland," [...] teach his mother it, and induce Laidlaw to take it down from her recitation? The old lady said she got it from Andrew Moir, who had it [...] "frae auld Baby Mettlin, who was said to have been another nor a gude ane." [...] But we have Hogg's own statement that [...] "aiblins ma gran'-mither was an unco leear," [...] and this quality may have been hereditary. On the other side, Hogg could hardly have held his tongue about the forgery, if forgery it was, when he wrote his [...] "Domestic Manners and Private Life of Sir Walter Scott" [...] (1834). The whole investigation is a little depressing, and makes one very shy of <b>unauthenticated</b> ballads.|$|E
6000|$|While {{our family}} has {{followed}} the general human law in the matter just mentioned, it forms a marked {{exception to the rule}} that so absolutely controls all of white blood, on this continent, in what relates to immigration and territorial origin. When the American enters on the history of his ancestors, he is driven, after some ten or twelve generations at most, to seek refuge in a country in Europe; whereas exactly the reverse is the case with us, our most remote extraction being American, while our more recent construction and education have taken place in Europe. When I speak of the [...] "earliest accounts I possess of my progenitors," [...] authentic information is meant only; for, like other races, we have certain dark legends that might possibly carry us back again to the old world in quest of our estates and privileges. But, in writing this history, it has been my determination from the first, to record nothing but settled truths, and to reject everything in the shape of vague report or <b>unauthenticated</b> anecdote. Under these limitations, I have ever considered my family as American by origin, European by emigration, and restored to its paternal soil by the mutations and calculations of industry and trade.|$|E
6000|$|The {{people were}} {{in a state of}} panic in Cardiff and many had fled to the hills, and {{directly}} the steamer came to the harbour she was boarded and her residue of food impounded by some <b>unauthenticated</b> Provisional Committee. Bert tramped through a country disorganised by pestilence, foodless, and shaken to the very base of its immemorial order. He came near death and starvation many times, and once he was drawn into scenes of violence that might have ended his career. But the Bert Smallways who tramped from Cardiff to London vaguely [...] "going home," [...] vaguely seeking something of his own that had no tangible form but Edna, was a very different person from the Desert Dervish who was swept out of England in Mr. Butteridge's balloon a year before. He was brown and lean and enduring, steady-eyed and pestilence-salted, and his mouth, which had once hung open, shut now like a steel trap. Across his brow ran a white scar that he had got in a fight on the brig. In Cardiff he had felt the need of new clothes and a weapon, and had, by means that would have shocked him a year ago, secured a flannel shirt, a corduroy suit, and a revolver and fifty cartridges from an abandoned pawnbroker's. He also got some soap and had his first real wash for thirteen months in a stream outside the town. The Vigilance bands that had at first shot plunderers very freely were now either entirely dispersed by the plague, or busy between town and cemetery in a vain attempt to keep pace with it. He prowled {{on the outskirts of the}} town for three or four days, starving, and then went back to join the Hospital Corps for a week, and so fortified himself with a few square meals before he started eastward.|$|E
6000|$|It may be {{urged that}} many of the stories here narrated come from remote times, and, as the {{testimony}} for these cannot be rigidly studied, that the old <b>unauthenticated</b> stories clash with the analogous tales current on better authority in our own day. But these ancient legends are given, not as evidence, but for three reasons: first, because of their merit as mere stories; next, because several of them are now perhaps for the first time offered with a critical discussion of their historical sources; lastly, because the old legends seem to show how the fancy of periods less critical than ours dealt with such facts as are now reported in a dull undramatic manner. Thus (1) the Icelandic ghost stories have peculiar literary merit as simple dramatic narratives. (2) Every one has heard of the Wesley ghost, Sir George Villiers's spectre, Lord Lyttelton's ghost, the Beresford ghost, Mr. Williams's dream of Mr. Perceval's murder, and so forth. But the original sources have not, as a rule, been examined in the ordinary spirit of calm historical criticism, by aid of a comparison of the earliest versions in print or manuscript. (3) Even ghost stories, as a rule, have some basis of fact, whether fact of hallucination, or illusion, or imposture. They are, at lowest, [...] "human documents". Now, granting such facts (of imposture, hallucination, or what you will), as our dull, modern narratives contain, we can regard these facts, or things like these, as the nuclei which our less critical ancestors elaborated into their extraordinary romances. In this way the belief in demoniacal possession (distinguished, as such, from madness and epilepsy) has its nucleus, some contend, in the phenomena of alternating personalities in certain patients. Their characters, ideas, habits, and even voices change, and the most obvious solution of the problem, in the past, was to suppose that a new alien personality--a [...] "devil"--had entered into the sufferer.|$|E
