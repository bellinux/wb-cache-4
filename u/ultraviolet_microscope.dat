50|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{offers several}} advantages for microscopic analysis. Since it is a scattering technique, specimens {{do not need}} to be fixed or sectioned. Raman spectra can be collected from a very small volume (< 1 µm in diameter); these spectra allow the identification of species present in that volume. Water does not generally interfere with Raman spectral analysis. Thus, Raman spectroscopy is suitable for the microscopic examination of minerals, materials such as polymers and ceramics, cells, proteins and forensic trace evidence. A Raman microscope begins with a standard optical microscope, and adds an excitation laser, a monochromator, and a sensitive detector (such as a charge-coupled device (CCD), or photomultiplier tube (PMT)). FT-Raman has also been used with <b>microscopes.</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>microscopes</b> and UV enhanced optics must be used when a UV laser source is used for Raman microspectroscopy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{have two}} main purposes. The {{first is to}} utilize the shorter {{wavelength}} of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the image resolution beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard optical microscopes. This technique is used for non-destructive inspection of devices with very small features such as those found in modern semiconductors. The second application for UV microscopes is contrast enhancement where the response of individual samples is enhanced, relative to their surrounding, due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself. One example is {{in the growth of}} protein crystals. Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions. As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm bandpass filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|R
25|$|In 1873, Ernst Abbe {{proposed}} {{that the ability to}} resolve detail in an object was limited approximately by the wavelength of the light used in imaging or a few hundred nanometers for visible light <b>microscopes.</b> Developments in <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>microscopes,</b> led by Köhler and Rohr, increased resolving power by a factor of two. However this required expensive quartz optics, due to the absorption of UV by glass.

For 1220 specimens the results in RREID and FAT were the same (651 positive and 569 negative—concordance: 97. 4 %). However, the RREID technique appeared to be less sensitive, since 22 (3 %) of the 673 specimens that were positive with FAT were negative with RREID.

Irradiated cells were found to show a characteristic syndrome of damage, involving blebbing at the cell surface, while control cells in the adjacent areas of the preparation remained unchanged. The end of the blebbing period is marked by swelling of the cells, and the time taken for this phenomenon to occur was used as a measure of the severity of the damage. It was found that the time required for swelling is dependent {{on the size of the}} dose employed, as well as on the sensitivity of the cells. This latter sensitivity was found to decline as the physiological age of the tumor increased.

40|$|With a {{modified}} color-translating <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>microscope,</b> {{the distribution of}} material showing an absorption maximum at 265 m~t was studied in samples from whole cultures of Entamoeba invadens at intervals during growth and from cysts allowed to mature under controlled conditions. Absorption by the cytoplasm in general gradually increased as trophozoites approached the period of maximum encystment. In late trophozoites and precystic forms, the absorbing material was concentrated into small bodies which coalesced to form large crystalloids of very high specific absorption. Maximum crystallization occurred in early cysts, where cytochcmical tests have shown the large crystalloids to be ribonucleoprotein. Electron micrographs show that the crystalloids are composed of particles 200 to 300 A in diameter. During cyst maturation the amount of absorbing material per cyst is not visibly reduced, but the large bodies fragment into smaller units until finally {{there is only a}} very high diffuse absorption over the entire cyst. From these and other results the hypothesis is advanced that the large crystalloids ("chromatoid bodies") are a manifestation of a special parasite-host adaptive mechanism; ribonucleoprotein is synthesized under favorable conditions, crystallized in the resistant cyst stage, and dispersed in the newly excysted amebae thereby enabling them to establish themselves in a new host by a period of quick growth...|$|E
40|$|As a major {{component}} of air pollution, carbon black (CB) is a nanoparticle that poses a threat to many urban communities. A nanoparticle is any particle that is between 20 and 100 nm in diameter. CB is created from car emissions, combustion, and industry. It is known to worsen asthma and bronchitis when inhaled. CB is also linked to cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. While it has been elucidated that CB kills cells through apoptosis, the specific pathway by which this occurs is currently unknown. The purpose of this project was to shed more light onto this process. For our model system, human bronchial epithelial cells (16 HBE 14 o-) cells were used. Between concentrations of 40 and 100 µg/mL, CB caused a significant decrease in cell density. Evidence for apoptosis was given by counting apoptotic nuclei. There was a significant increase in percent apoptotic nuclei per field of view in cells exposed to CB 50 and 100 µg/mL for 24 and 48 hours compared to mock-treated cells. To observe whether CB induced morphological changes in the mitochondria, cells were transfected with fluorescent protein and imaged using an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>microscope.</b> Cells exposed to CB 50 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL had higher levels of punctacte mitochondria than cells treated with mock.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} using fluorescein-labeled antibody {{for the detection}} of polysaccharide, protein, and teichoic acid antigens synthesized by streptococcal colonies on an agar surface is described. The bacteria were grown on the surface of an agar medium contained in the shallow well of an immunodiffusion slide. An agar overlay containing the fluorescein antiserum was dispensed over the colonies, excess antiserum was washed out of the overlay agar, and the fluorescent colonies were observed under an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>microscope.</b> The shallow well in the immunodiffusion slide prevented the agar from floating loose during washing, and the agar overlay prevented the fragmentation and loss of colonies. The thin layer of agar facilitated microscopic examination and the counting of fluorescent and nonfluorescent colonies. Colonies producing an antigen against which the antiserum was directed could readily be distinguished from colonies not producing the antigen. The specificity of the method was shown by using mixtures of streptococci representing six serological groups and five types. Those not known to possess cross-reacting antigens were specific in their reaction to the fluorescein antibody. Cross-reactions between the group antigens of A, C, and G, as reported previously by fluorescent staining of streptococcal suspensions, were also seen. Group A colonies reacted weakly with fluorescent E antibody and vice versa. The extraction of this antigen with cold trichloroacetic acid indicates it was related to the teichoic acids. Colonies possessing polysaccharide, protein, and teichoic acid antigens gave equally strong fluorescent reactions. This procedure permits detection of the synthesis of antigen which could not be observed by the use of a selective medium; it also eliminates the necessity for subculture of each colony and testing by appropriate serological means. Such a technique has value for studies in classification and biochemical genetics, and should be applicable to other genera of bacteria...|$|E

40|$|The acute nephritis that rapidly {{follows the}} {{injection}} of antikidney serum {{is the result}} of a specific reaction between antigens localized in the glomeruli and antibodies contained in the nephrotoxic sera. The antibodies, demonstrated by means of the fluorescence technique, were found in greatest concentration apparently in or on the glomerular basement membrane of nephritic animals and were noted to remain there for many months (1). The precise localization of nephrotoxie globulin in the glomeruli, however, was dif]fieult to establish owing in part to the limited resolution of the <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>microscope</b> and in part to the relatively thick sections employed.

40|$|A new {{technique}} for the intracellular localization of minute amounts of heine and hemoproteins is described. The specimen is treated with 1. 5 M perchloric acid {{in the presence}} of SH groups, followed by ultraviolet light irradiation in a fluorescence microscope. This fixes the proteins in situ and converts the heme to a porphyrin which fluoresces and is readily visualized. With this technique, hemoglobin has been demonstrated in the nuclei of avian erythrocytes, and in the nuclei of human normoblasts at an earlier stage than previously described. In addition, hemoproteins, presumably cytochromes, have been detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of myelocytes, in thymus lymphocyte nuclei, in chick embryo liver cytoplasm, and in chick embryo somites. The detection and localization within cells of hemoproteins such as hemcglobin, cytochromes, peroxidases, and catalases has, to date, been accomplished mainly through histochemical techniques based on the catalysis by heme of the peroxidation of benzidine, or one of its analogues, to form colored products (1). Absorption microspectroscopy and electron opacity studies also have been employed. The technique described here represents a different approach to the localization of intracellular heme and hemoproteins. It is based on the conversion of heme to a porphyrin which fluoresces and can be readily detected with the <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>microscope.</b> The method is simple, rapid, and sensitive, and affords rather precise resolution.

Three rabbits were sacrificed {{to determine whether the}} tetracycline stain was comparable between incisors in the same jaw. Of the remaining 16 animals, 6 were bleached once and 10 were bleached twice. One maxillary and one mandibular incisor were bleached in each jaw with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide and heat for ten minutes per tooth; the other incisors were protected with a rubber dam. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last bleach. The fluorescent intensity of 374 select ground sections 100 ± 5 microns thick from the incisal, middle and gingival thirds of the teeth were measured with an <b>ultraviolet</b> light <b>microscope</b> coupled to a television electronic measurement system. These measurements were statistically analyzed by t-test, and observations correlated. The dentin of tetracycline-stained maxillary incisors which were bleached twice and the dentin in the incisal one-third of the mandibular incisors which were bleached twice had a significantly (P ≤ 0. 001, P ≤ 0. 005) lower tetracycline fluorescent intensity than the dentin of unbleached tetracycline-stained teeth. The greatest loss of fluorescent intensity of tetracycline occurred in dentin closest to the dentino-enamel junction and varied from about 150 to 350 microns from the outer enamel surface. Clinical Kodachromes indicate that the loss of tetracycline pigment is associated with the loss of tetracycline fluorescence; The ground sections showed that the tetracycline fluorescence was never totally removed by two bleaches...|$|R

BackgroundKnowledge about biological functions of podocytes in the glomerulus is limited {{because of its}} unique anatomical location.

MethodsWith the help of fluorescence high-resolution digital imaging and a recently developed <b>ultraviolet</b> laser-scanning <b>microscope,</b> [Ca 2 +]i was measured in fura- 2 –loaded glomeruli and single podocytes of intact microdissected rat glomeruli. ResultsAngiotensin II (Ang II) increased [Ca 2 +]i reversibly in a biphasic and concentration-dependent manner. In contrast to Ang II, bradykinin, thrombin, arginine vasopressin, and serotonin did not change [Ca 2 +]i in the glomerulus. At reduced extracellular Ca 2 + activity, Ang II released [Ca 2 +]i from intracellular stores, but the second phase, corresponding to a Ca 2 + influx from the extracellular space, was absent. The L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated [Ca 2 +]i increase, and an increase of the extracellular K+ concentration did not change [Ca 2 +]i in the glomerulus. The angrotensin II type I (AT 1) receptor antagonist losartan inhibited the Ang II-mediated [Ca 2 +]i increase. Confocal [Ca 2 +]i measurements using fura- 2 or fluo- 3 or fluo- 4 on the single cell level show {{that some of the}} Ang II-mediated [Ca 2 +]i response originated from podocytes. Costaining with calcein allowed the identification of podocytes because of the characteristic morphology and location in relationship to the capillary network. ConclusionsThese data suggest that podocytes in the intact glomerulus respond to Ang II with an increase of [Ca 2 +]i via an AT 1 receptor...|$|R

Design details, development, characterization and optimization of the EUV source and the microscope are described and discussed. Test object and other samples were imaged to demonstrate superior resolution compared to visible light microscopy. Lay description Developments in nanoscience demand tools capable of capturing images with a nanometer spatial resolution beyond the capability of well-known visible light microscopes. Herein, we present the design details, development, characterization and optimization of a very compact desk-top transmission microscope, operating in invisible to an eye radiation from the so called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range. The apparatus {{is based on a}} laser-plasma source coupled with a special type of objective called Fresnel zone plate.

The main motivation for development of such compact systems operating with EUV radiations is the possibility to get information about thin samples due to the easily absorption of these radiation by solid materials with very small thicknesses, of the order of about 100 nm. Additionally, the employment of such kind of microscopes might open the possibility to perform experiments without necessity to employ large ‘photon facilities’ such as synchrotrons or free electron lasers and could have a huge impact on the speed of nanotechnology development.

Previous investigations showed the presence of biofilms lining depressions on ooidal surfaces and further appointed them as starting sites for low Mg calcite cortex formation. The factual processes behind the formation of these endogenic carbonates were still unknown. This thesis assembles the results of a detailed microbiological study combining field and laboratory experiments that confirm a substantial role of biological versus purely physicochemical processes triggering ooid formation. An experimental device was designed to harvest and study in laboratory the biofilms involved in ooids cortex formation. Biofilms lining ooids depressions and in situ harvested biofilms communities were compared using microscopical tools (natural, <b>ultraviolet</b> light, confocal <b>microscope</b> and TEM) and a PCR-DGGE approach. Microscopical observations show that these biofilms are mainly composed of photosynthetic microorganisms associated to low- Mg calcite precipitation. The microbial community is composed of different green algae, coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms which are embedded in EPS produced by the living bacteria. Low Mg calcite crystals are found mostly within EPS.

The unique interaction processes of fs-laser radiation with matter open up new markets in laser material processing and, therefore, are actively investigated in the last decade. The resulting "sub 100 nm"-structures offer vast potential benefits in photonics, biotechnology, tribological surface design, plasmonic applications and production of nanoparticles. Focused fs-laser radiation causes a local modification resulting in nanostructures of high precision and reproducibility. However the formation dynamics is not well understood. Research in this field requires high temporal and spatial resolution. A combination of fs-laser and EUV-microscope provides a tool for "in situ"-observation of the formation dynamics. As exemplary structures to be investigated, we use nanojets on thin gold films and periodic surface structures (ripples) on dielectrics. In the future, the EUV-pump-probe microscope can become a versatile tool to observe physical or biological processes. Microscopy using EUV-light is capable of detecting structures on a scale down to several tens of nanometers. For detailed investigations a compact EUV-microscope has been realized utilizing OVI Balmer-alpha radiation at 17. 3 nm coming from a discharge produced oxygen plasma. As optical elements a grazing incidence elliptical collector and a zone plate with a width of outermost zone of 50 nm and a spectral filter to avoid chromatic aberrations are used. The detector is a fast gated microchannel plate with a pore size of 2 microns contacted by a low impedance transmission line. The expected spatial resolution of the setup is better than 100 nm and the time resolution is better than 1 ns. The newly developed EUV-microscope is {{a powerful tool for}} a wide field of investigations that need high time and spatial resolutions simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} characterisation of a vacuum <b>ultraviolet</b> scanning photoelectron <b>microscope</b> as well as results from studies of laterally inhomogeneous surfaces. The instrument utilises synchrotron radiation from an undulator at the 550 MeV storage ring at the MAX-laboratory. The beamline is comprised of a plane-grating monochromator with a Kirkpatrick-Baez objective and a grazing incidence ring shaped ellipsoidal focusing mirror. The instrument provides a focused monochromatic photon beam with a high flux (10 E 9 - 10 E 10 photons/second) and a narrow bandwidth (0. 03 - 0. 25 eV) in the energy range from 15 - 150 eV. The ellipsoidal mirror gives a final focus with a full width half maximum of 1. 5 micrometer. The instrument is used for laterally resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and imaging of surfaces by detecting energy filtered photoelectrons. The thermally activated desorption of oxide layers on Si(100) has been studied for different initial oxide thicknesses. The oxide layers desorb inhomogeneously and gradually reveal areas of clean Si. The thin oxides (5 - 15 Å) desorb in irregular patterns while 300 Å thick oxides desorb through the formation of circular voids that expose the clean substrate and grow with annealing time. Core level spectra reveal Si and SiO 2 on the surface while sub-oxides exist only in the interface layer. For gold overlayers on these Si/SiO 2 surfaces the formation of silicide and the agglomeration of Au has been studied. In the superconducting material Ba(sub 0. 6) K(sub 0. 4) BiO(sub 3) we find local variations in the photoemission intensity, especially in the valence band spectra. We find regions on the surface where valence band spectra show much better agreement with theoretical predictions than previous measurements over large areas have shown. By locally illuminating the surface with the intense zero order beam we induce a transition from the metallic to the dielectric state which {{we believe to be}} due to a small depletion of the oxygen content. For extended illuminations the Bi oxide decomposes leaving metallic Bi in the surface layer. Finally it is demonstrated how the instrument can be used to study buried interfaces in Si/Si(sub 1 -x) Ge(sub x) /Si heterostructures and to reveal the extent of interdiffusion that has taken place during the growth process...|$|R
