2500|$|There {{are three}} ways to count letter {{frequency}} {{that result in}} very different charts for common letters. The first method, used in the chart below, is to count letter frequency in root words of a dictionary. The second is to include all word variants when counting, such as [...] "abstracts", [...] "abstracted" [...] and [...] "abstracting" [...] {{and not just the}} root word of [...] "abstract". This system results in letters like [...] "s" [...] appearing much more frequently, such as when counting letters from lists of the most used English words on the Internet. A final variant is to count letters based on their frequency of use in actual texts, resulting in certain letter combinations like [...] "th" [...] becoming more common due to the frequent use of common words like [...] "the". Absolute <b>usage</b> <b>frequency</b> measures like this are used when creating keyboard layouts or letter frequencies in old fashioned printing presses.|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the study of {{compositional}} properties of human gene sequences evaluating similarities and differences among functionally distinct sectors of the gene independently of the reading frame. To retrieve the compositional information of DNA, we present a neighbor base dependent coding {{system in which the}} alphabet of 64 letters (DNA triplets) is compressed to an alphabet of 14 letters here termed triplet composons. The triplets containing the same set of distinct bases in whatever order and number form a triplet composon. The reading of the DNA sequence is performed starting at any letter of the initial triplet and then moving, triplet-to-triplet, {{until the end of the}} sequence. The readings were made in an overlapping way along the length of the sequences. The analysis of the compositional content in terms of the composon <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the gene sequences shows that: (i) the compositional content of the sequences is far from that of random sequences, even in the case of non-protein coding sequences; (ii) coding sequences can be classified as components of compositional clusters; and (iii) intron sequences in a cluster have the same composon <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies,</b> even as their base composition differs notably from that of their home coding sequences. A comparison of the composon <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies</b> between human and mouse homologous genes indicated that two clusters found in humans do not have their counterpart in mouse whereas the others clusters are stable in both species with respect to their composon <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies</b> in both coding and noncoding sequences.

40|$|Synonymous codon {{replacement}} {{can change}} protein structure and function, indicating that protein structure depends on DNA sequence. During heterologous protein expression, low expression or formation of insoluble aggregates may {{be attributable to}} differences in synonymous codon usage between expression and natural hosts. This discordance may be particularly important during translation of the domain boundaries (link/end segments) that separate elements of higher ordered structure. Within such regions, ribosomal progression slows as the ribosome encounters clusters of infrequently used codons that preferentially encode a subset of amino acids. To replicate the modulation of such localized translation rates during heterologous expression, we used known relationships between codon <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies</b> and secondary protein structure to develop an algorithm ("codon harmonization") for identifying regions of slowly translated mRNA that are putatively associated with link/end segments. It then recommends synonymous replacement codons having <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the heterologous expression host that are {{less than or equal}} to the <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies</b> of native codons in the native expression host. For protein regions other than these putative link/end segments, it recommends synonymous substitutions with codons having <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies</b> matched as nearly as possible to the native expression system. Previous application of this algorithm facilitated E. coli expression, manufacture and testing of two Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidates. Here we describe the algorithm in detail and apply it to E. coli expression of three additional P. falciparum proteins. Expression of the "recoded" genes exceeded that of the native genes by 4 - to 1, 000 -fold, representing levels suitable for vaccine manufacture. The proteins were soluble and reacted with a variety of functional conformation-specific mAbs suggesting that they were folded properly and had assumed native conformation. Codon harmonization may further provide a general strategy for improving the expression of soluble functional proteins during heterologous expression in hosts other than E. coli...|$|R

5000|$|Chinese word {{frequency}} is {{an important}} aspect of the ABC Dictionary, and it lists homophones according to their decreasing occurrence. Frequency orders are based largely on Xiandai Hanyu Pinlü Cidian for monosyllabic entries and Zhongwen Shumianyu Pinlü Cidian 中文书面语频率词典 [...] "Dictionary of the Chinese Written Language" [...] for polysyllabic words (1996: xiii). For entries with identical spelling, including tones, arrangement is by order of frequency, indicated by a superscript number before the transcription, a device adapted from Western lexicographic practice to distinguish homonyms. For example, [...] "1dàomù 盜墓 [...] rob graves" [...] and [...] "2dàomù 道木 [...] railway sleeper tie". For entries that are homographic if tones are disregarded, the item of highest <b>usage</b> <b>frequency</b> is indicated by an asterisk following the transcription (see a* 啊 above), for instance, [...] "lìguǐ 厉鬼 [...] ferocious ghost" [...] and [...] "lìguì* 立柜 [...] clothes-closet; wardrobe; hanging cupboard".

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} for gene classification, adopting codon usage bias as feature inputs to support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed. The DNA sequence is first {{converted to a}} 59 -dimensional feature vector, where each element corresponds to the relative synonymous <b>usage</b> (RSCU) <b>frequency</b> of a codon. Since the input to the classifier is independent of sequence length, the approach is especially useful when sequences to be classified are of differing lengths and homology-based methods tend to fail. The method is demonstrated with 1, 841 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) sequences, which are classified into two major classes, HLA-I and HLA-II. Each major class is further classified into subgroups. Using codon <b>usage</b> <b>frequencies,</b> binary SVM achieved an accuracy rate of 99. 3 percent for HLA major class classification and multiclass SVM achieved accuracy rates of 99. 73 percent and 98. 38 percent for the subclass classification of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules, respectively. Comparisons with K-Means clustering and other classifiers and homology-based features are given. Results indicate that the classification based on codon usage bias is consistent with biological functions of HLA molecules...|$|R
