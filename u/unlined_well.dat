This could irrigate crops over an area of up to 20 mu.The same men could dig an <b>unlined</b> <b>well</b> in one day, basically a pit in the ground, but the irrigation capacity was only one fifth of that of the brick-lined well.|$|E
40|$|F ollowing a {{resurgence}} of fightingin Angola in 1998, more than 500 000 people fled their homes and sought shelter in the central high-land cities of Kuito, Huambo and Malange. Once settled, the displaced persons dug traditional wells (defined here as an <b>unlined</b> <b>well</b> with individual rope and bucket) to improve their access to a safe water supply. In response, Oxfam GB began a chlorination inter-vention to improve the water quality in these wells to within SPHERE stan-dards. 1 The chlorination programme covered more than 400 hand-dug wells during an 18 -month period. The methods of chlorination presented here vary slightly from traditional point-source methods of chlorination, 2 and the article is intended to provide alternative guidance to field staff undertaking routine chlorination and water-quality monitoring...|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} {{situated}} in {{the lower part of}} Bihar. Most of the area is agricultural land with rice as the main crop. Due to variations in annual rainfall, local farmers cannot depend on seasonal rain for irrigation and have instead constructed lined and <b>unlined</b> perennial <b>wells</b> for irrigation. A perennial canal has also been constructed by local governing bodies but the water supply is still insufficient for the farmers due to improper administration.|$|R

5000|$|There is no {{specific}} {{technology that is}} advocated with self-supply. Self-supply is rather an approach of how to improve access to water and sanitation services, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "moving up the water and sanitation ladders". [...] At the bottom of the [...] "water ladder" [...] are unprotected sources of water. The users [...] "climb the water ladder" [...] by adding protection to their water source or additional technology for convenience. For example, a user with an <b>unlined</b> hand dug <b>well</b> with a rope and bucket as a lifting device would be {{at the bottom of the}} water ladder. A user with a lined hand dug well would be higher on the water ladder since the water source has a lower risk of contamination due to the lining. A user with a hand pump would have the benefit of being able to get a larger volume of water more quickly than with a bucket, and contamination of the source is reduced. Finally, a user with a motorized pump would have the convenience of not having to expend any manual energy on pumping water. It should be noted that even sources on the lowest rungs of the ladder would provide service all day, every day, all year round.|$|R
40|$|PFA-linings for {{avoidance}} of dewpoint corrosion in heat-exchangers and ducts of waste-incineration power plants M. Lotz Quadrant EPP AG, Switzerland The combustion of wastes of diverging qualities {{leads to the}} formation of gases with a high content of sulphur, chlorine and fluorine compounds. When the dewpoint of these gases is underrun in heat exchangers, housings and ducts in order to re-cycle more heat out of the combustion gases, this leads to a heavy condensation of hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and sulphuric acid on the involved equipment and in consequence to one of the strongest types of corrosion known, called dewpoint corrosion. The latter even corrodes the most resistant steel grades and thus requires other technical solutions. A lining of the condensing heat-exchangers, their housings and the flue gas ducts with the fully-fluorinated thermoplastic PFA (tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether) renders possible a service of the heat exchangers under condensing conditions and consequently increases the total power production efficiency of the waste-incineration plant, even having a positive environmental effect due to a positive influence on the overall energy mix. Although the suitability of this technical principle had already been demonstrated in multiple successful examples in fossil- and waste-fired power plants, constructive and technical details can have an influence on the performance of the lined equipment, such as material properties, welding of the liner, installation and sealing against the <b>unlined</b> parts as <b>well</b> as constructive aspects of the heat exchanger pipes and tubes. This will be discussed in the following...|$|R
