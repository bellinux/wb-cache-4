5|$|The Gracchus brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were Romans {{who both}} served as tribunes {{in the late}} 2nd century BC.

The Smokey Mountain in Balut Island is once known as the largest landfill where thousands of impoverished people lives in the slums. After the closure of the landfill in 1995, mid-rise housing buildings were built in place.

5|$|Feeling a {{vocation}} {{to minister to}} the <b>urban</b> <b>poor,</b> Henson served in the East End of London and Barking before becoming chaplain of an ancient hospice in Ilford in 1895. In 1900 he {{was appointed to the}} high-profile post of vicar of St Margaret's, Westminster and canon of Westminster Abbey. While there, and as Dean of Durham (1913–18), he wrote prolifically and sometimes controversially. The Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church took exception to his liberal theological views, which some regarded as heretical, and sought unsuccessfully in 1917 to block his appointment as Bishop of Hereford.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, in 123 BC, Gaius {{took the}} same office as his brother, as a tribune for the plebeians. Gaius was more {{practical}} minded than Tiberius, and so was considered more dangerous by the senatorial class. He gained support from the agrarian poor by reviving the land reform programme and from the <b>urban</b> <b>poor</b> with various popular measures. He also sought support from the second estate, those equestrians who had not ascended to become senators.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius {{was elected}} to the office of Tribune of the Plebs in 133 BC.

Using the powers of Lex Hortensia, Tiberius established a commission to oversee the redistribution of land holdings from the rich to the unlanded <b>urban</b> <b>poor.</b> The commission consisted of himself, his father-in-law and his brother Gaius.|$|E

40|$|This report compiles a latest social {{accounting}} matrix (SAM) of Pakistan {{for the year}} 1989 - 90. The SAM framework provides useful information about the structure of Pakistan’s economy. Within this framework, the preferred classifications of various accounts are undertaken according to the policy objectives and later model building. The SAM presents four types of accounts: factor account, institution account, production account, and capital account. Theses accounts are disaggregated {{on the basis of}} requirement and availability of data. The account of factors of production is disaggregated into labour and capital. Institution accounts consist of households, firms, government, and rest of the world. Household account is further disaggregated by four income categories for rural and urban areas. Production account is disaggregated into agriculture, industry, education, health and other sectors. Further disaggregation of production account is also {{made on the basis of}} goods for domestic market and for export market. Finally, it presents consolidated capital account. This study also aims to undertake a multiplier analysis, which provides backward and forward linkages in production, consumption, distribution, and accumulation accounts of the economy. The multipliers for all endogenous accounts imply a high degree of integration of the accounts. For the production sectors, backward linkages are strongest for the education, followed by agriculture, health, other sector and industry. The largest forward linkage multipliers are found for industry, followed by other sectors, agriculture, health and education. Regarding the households income groups, the largest backward linkage is found for the <b>urban</b> <b>poorest</b> and smallest for the rural rich. While, the largest forward linkage is for the rural poorest and smallest for the <b>urban</b> <b>poorest.</b> ...|$|R

Wallace continued his social activism {{for the rest of his}} life, publishing the book The Revolt of Democracy just weeks before his death.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rebels}} had urban backgrounds, and the {{majority}} of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants. In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the <b>urban</b> <b>poor,</b> attempting to gain {{at the expense of the}} local elites. In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. Other urban rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.|$|E

In 2004, there were 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies in Colombia, including large, medium and small companies. Private sector involvement in the Colombian water sector began in 1995 in Cartagena, {{with support from the}} World Bank. The most important examples are in Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Tunja, Montería, Palmira, Girardot, and Riohacha. Operators are to a large extent Colombian.

5|$|Octavia Hill was the {{daughter}} of James Hill, corn merchant, follower of Owenism and banker, and his third wife, Caroline Southwood Smith. He had been widowed twice, and had six children (five daughters and a son) from his previous marriages. He had been impressed by the writings on education of Caroline Southwood Smith, {{the daughter}} of Dr Thomas Southwood Smith, a pioneer of sanitary reform. He had engaged Caroline as a governess for his children in 1832, and they were married in 1835, three years before Octavia was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, her father's eighth daughter and ninth child. The family's comfortably prosperous life was disrupted by James Hill's financial problems and his mental collapse. In 1840 he was declared bankrupt. Caroline Hill's father gave the family financial support, and took on some of Hill's paternal role. Southwood Smith was a health and welfare reformer concerned with a range of social issues including child labour in mines and the housing of the <b>urban</b> <b>poor.</b> Caroline Hill held similar views on social reform, and her interest in progressive education, influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and Southwood Smith's daily experience in his work at the London Hospital in the East End inspired Octavia Hill's concern for the poorest in early Victorian London. She received no formal schooling: her mother educated the family at home.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the <b>urban</b> <b>poor</b> eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

The interviews were administered using predesigned questionnaires. The questionnaires for household/water-vendor interviews targeted the following parameters: sources of income; monthly expenditures; potential savings; critical challenges (and opportunities) relating to access to water services. The questionnaires for interviews with WSPs focused on potable water, water coverage, and non-revenue water. Field visits targeted the frequency of outages in water supply and leakages in the distribution network. A market assessment was also designed and conducted to assess the <b>urban</b> <b>poor’s</b> current water usage and consumption practices and the amount currently paid for those services, demand and willingness to pay for improved services, {{and the ability to}} take on financing for those services.|$|R
