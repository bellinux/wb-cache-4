Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions <b>underlying</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} geological {{period of}} the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian, {{takes its name from}} the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants.

5|$|The {{floodplain}} of Johnson Creek is {{a remnant}} of large glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods that deposited thick sediments between 18,000 and 13,000years ago in the Columbia River Basin, including much of the Willamette Valley. <b>Underlying</b> <b>the</b> sediments are substantial thicknesses of basalt lavas from the Columbia River Basalt Group. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been folded and faulted to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks against which they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island. In the 20years following {{the end of the}} eruption, measurements revealed that the island was steadily subsiding and had lost about one metre in height. The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments <b>underlying</b> <b>the</b> island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to the weight of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|In the Abrahams Creek watershed, 94 {{percent of}} the rock is {{interbedded}} sedimentary rock. The remaining 6 percent is sandstone. The main rock formations in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Catskill Formation, the Llwellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. These formations mainly consist of coal, limestone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone. The Catskill Formation mainly occurs in the watershed's upper reaches. The Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pocono Formation, and the Pottsville Group occur under the Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge. The Llwellyn Formation also occurs there, in addition to <b>underlying</b> <b>the</b> floodplain in the watershed. A considerable area in the watershed has been strip mined.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese at Rock Springs {{were aware}} of the {{animosity}} and rising racial tension with white miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there would be any race riots. <b>Underlying</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism <b>underlying</b> <b>the</b> reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
