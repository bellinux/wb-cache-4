5000|$|In {{the end it}} took a {{determined}} campaign by Henry VII to largely stamp out the use of livery badges by others than the king, and reduce them to things normally worn only by household servants {{in the case of}} the aristocracy. Livery badges issues by guilds and corporations, and mayors, were exempt, and these continued in use until the 19th century in some cases. A particular concern in all the legislation was to forbid the issuing of liveries to those without a permanent contract with the lord; these groups assembled for a particular purpose were believed to be the most dangerous. The Statute of Liveries of 1506 finally forbade entirely the issuing of liveries to those of higher rank; they had to be domestic servants or persons experienced in the law, <b>unless</b> <b>covered</b> by a specific royal licence. A well-known story, first told by Francis Bacon but unsupported in the remaining records, has Henry visiting his principal military commander John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford at Hedingham Castle, who at his departure lined the king's exit route with liveried retainers, for which Henry fined him 15,000 marks. [...] In fact modern historical analysis of the court records shows few prosecutions, but by the end of Henry's reign liveried retainers do seem to have ceased to be a major problem. While the badges of the nobility were carefully restricted, the royal badges of the Tudors, most famously the Tudor rose that signified the union of the Lancastrian and Yorkist dynasties, were used more widely than ever before, for example being added freely to King's College Chapel, Cambridge when the Tudors completed Henry VI's unfinished building. The Collar of Esses became in effect a badge of office, though of course still denoting allegiance to the monarch.|$|E

40|$|The {{phospholipids}} of Escherichia coli consist {{mainly of}} phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin. PG makes up ∼ 25 % of the cellular phospholipid and {{is essential for}} growth in wild-type cells. PG is synthesized on the inner surface of the inner membrane from cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol and glycerol 3 -phosphate, generating the precursor phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate (PGP). This compound is present at low levels (∼ 0. 1 % of the total lipid). Dephosphorylation of PGP to PG is catalyzed by several PGP-phosphatases. The pgpA and pgpB genes, which encode structurally distinct PGP-phosphatases, were identified previously. Double deletion mutants lacking pgpA and pgpB are viable and still make PG, suggesting the presence of additional phosphatase(s). We have identified a third PGP-phosphatase gene (previously annotated as yfhB but renamed pgpC) using an expression cloning strategy. A mutant with deletions in all three phosphatase genes is not viable <b>unless</b> <b>covered</b> by a plasmid expressing either pgpA, pgpB, or pgpC. When the triple mutant is covered with the temperature-sensitive plasmid pMAK 705 expressing {{any one of the}} three pgp genes, the cells grow at 30 but not 42 °C. As growth slows at 42 °C, PGP accumulates to high levels, and the PG content declines. PgpC orthologs are present in many other bacteria...|$|E

40|$|Protostellar {{systems are}} {{variable}} on many timescales. One {{of the most}} dramatic forms of variability known to occur in low mass stellar systems is the FU Orionis outburst (Herbig 1977). Throughout a typical outburst lasting several decades, system luminosities may be a hundred times what is typical of the quiesent state. FU Orionis outburst events are thought to have significant impact on the thermal structure of the protosolar nebula; their existence has been used to explain features in the meteoritic record from thermally induced homogenization to the formation of chondrules. Until recently, the magnitude of the likely effect from such outbursts has been largely speculative {{due to the lack of}} a detailed understanding of the outburst mechanism. Recent numerical models (Bell& Lin 1994) have demonstrated the viability of the observational hypothesis (Hartmann& Kenyon 1985) that the radiation observed during outburst is emitted by a luminous circumstellar disk transporting mass at a thousand times the quiesent rate. Light curves and color and line width evolution observed in FU Orionis systems are naturally explained by time dependent outbursting model disks (Bell et al. 1995). The radial temperature structure and shape of the disk during outburst derived from these models may be used to calculate the outburst's expected impact on primitive material at various radii throughout the disk. In this review, we will begin by discussing what is known about the FU Orionis outburst phenomenon from recent observations and theory including statistically deduced outburst timescales and observed peak temperatures. <b>Unless</b> <b>covered</b> by another author, we will discuss the evidence which suggests that outburst radiation is emitted by a circumstellar disk rather than by the star and will briefly review the thermal instability as a mechanism for outburst. We will then report on recent work which investigates the likely heating of solar nebula material due to FU Orionis outbursts including the following effects: (1) heating of the planet forming region by direct radiation from the hot inner nebula; (2) heating by the diffuse radiation field of a coccooning envelope; and (3) time-dependent penetration of the increased luminosity from the above sources into the optically thick nebula. Some of this work is currently in progress. The potential effects on condensation and migration in the nebula and the thermal processing of solids will be evaluated...|$|E
