2500|$|Task {{partitioning}} {{refers to}} the division of one task into sequential actions done {{by more than one}} individual. The focus here is on the task, and its division, rather than on the individuals performing it. [...] For example, [...] "hygienic behavior" [...] is a task in which worker bees <b>uncap</b> and remove diseased brood cells that may be affected by American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae) or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. [...] In this case, individual bees often focus on either uncapping or removing diseased brood. [...] Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{exclusion}} of infected individuals can also prevent intra-group transmission. When dampwood termites (Z. angusticollis) {{come into contact}} with high densities of entamopathogenic fungal spores, they perform a whole-body [...] "vibratory motor display" [...] which induce others who are not in direct contact with the spores to flee, increasing their distance from the infected individual. In the eastern subterranean termite (R. flavipes) infection with the same fungus also causes a vibratory alarm response; termites then aggregate around the infected individual and box it in, preventing it from moving to other areas of the colony; it is sometimes licked and bitten before subsequently being buried. Individual Temnothorax unifasciatus ants who are dying due to fungal infection, carbon dioxide poisoning or 'naturally' (of unknown cause in colonies which had not been experimentally manipulated) permanently leave the nest one to 50 hours before their death, altruistically ceasing all social interactions with nestmates and dying alone away from the colony. Some Apis mellifera workers are 'hygiene specialists'—they detect cells in the colony containing diseased or dead brood, <b>uncap</b> these cells and then remove the cell contents.|$|E

His first care must be to ignore the very dream of haste, walking {{everywhere}} very slowly and very much at random, and to impute an esoteric sense to almost anything his eye may happen to encounter. Almost everything in fact lends itself to the historic, the romantic, the æsthetic fallacy--almost everything has an antique queerness and richness that ekes out the reduced state; that of a grim and battered old adventuress, the heroine of many shames and scandals, surviving to an extraordinary age and a considerable penury, but with ancient gifts of princes {{and other forms of}} the wages of sin to show, and the most beautiful garden of all the world to sit and doze and count her beads in and remember. He must hang {{a great deal about the}} huge Palazzo Pubblico, which indeed is very well worth any acquaintance you may scrape with it. It masses itself gloomily above the narrow street to an immense elevation, and leads up the eye along a cliff-like surface of rugged wall, mottled with old scars and new repairs, to the loggia dizzily perched on its cornice. He must repeat his visit to the Etruscan Gate, by whose immemorial composition he must indeed linger long to resolve it back into the elements originally attending it. He must <b>uncap</b> to the irrecoverable, the inimitable style of the statue of Pope Julius III before the cathedral, remembering that Hawthorne fabled his Miriam, in an air of romance from which we are well-nigh as far to-day as from the building of Etruscan gates, to have given rendezvous to Kenyon at its base. Its material is a vivid green bronze, and the mantle and tiara are covered with a delicate embroidery worthy of a silver-smith.|$|E

60|$|He was {{trolling}} {{snatches of}} melody and showing his great yellow teeth in a jovial grin {{all the way}} to Bellinzona--and this in face of the sombre fact that the Saint-Gothard tunnel is scraping away into the mountain, all the while, under his nose, and numbering the days of the many-buttoned brotherhood. But he hopes, for long service's sake, to be taken into the employ of the railway; he at least is no cherisher of quaintness and has no romantic perversity. I found the railway coming on, however, in a manner very shocking to mine. About an hour short of Andermatt they have pierced a huge black cavity in the mountain, around which has grown up a swarming, digging, hammering, smoke-compelling colony. There are great barracks, with tall chimneys, down in the gorge that bristled the other day but with natural graces, and a wonderful increase of wine-shops in the little village of Göschenen above. Along the breast of the mountain, beside the road, come wandering several miles of very handsome iron pipes, of a stupendous girth--a conduit for the water-power with which some of the machinery is worked. It lies at its mighty length among the rocks like an immense black serpent, and serves, as a mere detail, to give one the measure of the central enterprise.

40|$|The <b>uncapping</b> of telomeres induces a DNA damage response. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, {{deletion}} of pot 1 + causes telomere <b>uncapping</b> {{and rapid}} telomere resection, resulting in chromosome fusion. Using the nmt-pot 1 -aid strain, we previously reported that Pot 1 shut-off causes telomere loss and chromosome fusion in S. pombe. However, the factors {{responsible for the}} resection of <b>uncapped</b> telomeres remain unknown. In this study, we investigated these factors and found that concomitant deletion of rqh 1 + and exo 1 + alleviated the loss of telomeres following Pot 1 shut-off, suggesting that Rqh 1 and Exo 1 are redundantly involved in the resection of <b>uncapped</b> telomeres. We also investigated the role of Rqh 1 helicase activity and {{found it to be}} essential for the resection of <b>uncapped</b> telomeres. Moreover, we found that Dna 2 and Exo 1 function redundantly in the resection of <b>uncapped</b> telomeres. Taken together, these results suggest that Exo 1 and Rqh 1 -Dna 2 redundantly contribute to the resection of <b>uncapped</b> telomeres. Therefore, our results demonstrate that nmt-pot 1 -aid is an important model strain to study the role of helicases and nucleases in the resection of <b>uncapped</b> telomeres and to improve our understanding of DNA double-strand break repair...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of the transcriptome is determined by a balance between mRNA synthesis and degradation. An important route for mRNA degradation produces <b>uncapped</b> mRNAs, and this decay process can be initiated by decapping enzymes, endonucleases, and small RNAs. Although <b>uncapped</b> mRNAs are an important intermediate for mRNA decay, their identity and abundance have never been studied {{on a large scale}} until recently. Here, we present an experimental method for transcriptome-wide profiling of <b>uncapped</b> mRNAs {{that can be used in}} any eukaryotic system. We applied the method to study the prevalence of <b>uncapped</b> transcripts during the early stages of Arabidopsis thaliana flower development. <b>Uncapped</b> transcripts were identified for the majority of expressed genes, although at different levels. By comparing <b>uncapped</b> RNA levels with steady state overall transcript levels, our study provides evidence for widespread mRNA degradation control in numerous biological processes involving genes of varied molecular functions, implying that <b>uncapped</b> mRNA levels are dynamically regulated. Sequence analyses identified structural features of transcripts and ciselements that were associated with different levels of <b>uncapping.</b> These transcriptome-wide profiles of <b>uncapped</b> mRNAs will aid in illuminating new regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptional networks. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.

50|$|The {{most popular}} method of {{harvesting}} honey from a top-bar hive is by cutting the comb from the top-bar, crushing the comb and straining the honey. This results in honey {{with a higher}} pollen content than honey that is extracted by flinging out without crushing the comb. Top-bar hive comb can be extracted by flinging motion, e.g. in a hobbyist or commercial rotary extractor, {{but it can be}} problematic, because (a) if no foundation was used, the comb will break more easily during rotary movement, (b) top-bar hives combs have irregular or non-standard sizes that do not fit into commercially available extractors, (c) if the comb is not uniformly flat, {{it may be difficult to}} <b>uncap</b> the cells, which is required for rotary extraction, and (d) not all rotary extractors have cages or mesh to prevent loose pieces of comb from falling into the drum.|$|E

50|$|On December 21, 2012, the PTC {{announced}} that sections between US 22 and I-79 will proceed, with completion projected to occur sometime in 2019.

On November 25, 2013, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a transportation bill into law, known as Act 89, that will raise vehicle registration fees and <b>uncap</b> the oil tax cap in order to fund transportation projects in the state. Act 89 is expected to provide funding to complete the Southern Beltway all the way to the Mon-Fayette Expressway and provide a little less than half of the $2.2 billion (as of December 2013) needed to complete the Mon-Fayette Expressway. The second leg of the Southern Beltway will be the first project completed with the new funding available for both the Southern Beltway and the Mon-Fayette Expressway. On January 13, 2014, the PTC awarded two contracts for the project, with an anticipated completion date of 2019, a year ahead of the original schedule. Increased activity in the Marcellus Formation, which was just beginning when the Findlay Connector opened in 2006, helped expedite the earlier opening date for the second section of the Southern Beltway.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, the by then vacant brownstone {{building}} {{was selected as}} the site for the planned community art center and was purchased for about $8,000 with funds raised by the community. The building is sometimes referred to as the Comiskey Mansion, and it was described as the former home of Charles Comiskey by Eleanor Roosevelt in her newspaper column after she took part in the dedication of the South Side Community Art Center. According to <b>UNCAP,</b> the Uncovering New Chicago Archives Project, the house belonging to Comiskey was further south on Michigan Avenue. The community paid for the lease and purchase of the building, for utilities, and for art supplies. The federal government helped to stimulate the establishment of the center via support from the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. They provided administrative funds for staff and faculty and funds for the remodeling of the building. The interior was remodeled in the New Bauhaus-style by Hin Bredendieck and Nathan Lerner and the centre opened unofficially for its first classes on December 15, 1940. The opening was accompanied by an inaugural exhibition of paintings by local black artists including Charles Davis, Charles White, Bernard Goss, William Carter, Eldzier Cortor, Charles Sebree, Archibald Motley, Jr., amongst others. The interracial faculty of art instructors included Davis, White, Goss, Carter, Morris Topchevsky, Si Gordon, Max Kahn, and Todros Geller. Lessons were free and included oil painting, drawing, composition, water color, sculpture, lithography, poster design, fashion illustration, interior decoration, silk screen, weaving, and hooked rug-making. By March 1941, 13,500 people had attended classes, exhibitions, and events at the center. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated the facility May 7, 1941, in a ceremony that broadcast nationwide on CBS Radio.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCells {{respond to}} diverse {{external}} stimuli by polymerizing cytoplasmic actin, and recent {{evidence indicates that}} GTPases can specify where this polymerization takes place. Actin assembly in stimulated blood platelets occurs where sequestered monomers add onto the fast-growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments (F-actin), which are capped in the resting cells. We report that D 3 and D 4 polyphosphoinositides, PI(4) P, PI(4, 5) P 2, PI(3, 4) P 2, and PI(3, 4, 5) P 3, <b>uncap</b> F-actin in resting permeabilized platelets. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), GTP, and GTPγS, but not GDPβS, also <b>uncap</b> F-actin in permeabilized platelets. GDPβS inhibits TRAP-induced F-actin uncapping, and PI(4, 5) P 2 overcomes this inhibition. Constitutively active mutant Rac, but not Rho, activates uncapping of F-actin.

Migrating A. dorsata and A. laboriosa left unopened the sealed brood in deserted combs. Thus, A. dorsata and A. laboriosa do not open undamaged cells with dead brood. This behaviour is a more efficient mechanism in preventing the spread of diseases and parasitic mites than uncapping and removing dead pupae by A. mellifera and A. cerana. It may be beneficial for migrating A. dorsata and A. laboriosa to temporarily disuse part of the comb cells in exchange for arresting the mites there and thus reducing the increase of their population.
