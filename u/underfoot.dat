The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic <b>underfoot.</b> Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on fiberfill clouds with lights behind them to create a lightning storm underway in the background.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour {{ended in}} tragedy on June 30, with an {{accident}} at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed <b>underfoot</b> and suffocated to death {{as the crowd}} rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but {{it was already too}} late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|No nesting {{material}} {{is used in}} the breeding cavity. One white egg is laid each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first egg is laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate in the nest, and their pellets are trodden <b>underfoot,</b> making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of horse}} and foot {{soldiers}} {{immersed in a}} sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie <b>underfoot.</b> A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess <b>underfoot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Birds such as Hesperornithiformes were present, {{as well as}} giant Pterosauria {{related to}} Quetzalcoatlus. Stagodont marsupials, placentals and multituberculate mammals scurried <b>underfoot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern plastic {{materials}} (e.g. high-modulus polyethylene and Teflon), used on ski bases, {{have excellent}} gliding properties on snow, which in many circumstances diminish the added {{value of a}} glide wax. Likewise, uni-directional textures (e.g. fish scale or micro-scale hairs) <b>underfoot</b> on cross-country skis can offer a practical substitute for grip wax for those skiers, using the classic technique.|$|E
25|$|Armboth Fell is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District, {{regarded}} by Alfred Wainwright as the centre of Lakeland. The fell is a domed plateau, three-quarters of a mile across, jutting out {{to the east of}} the Derwentwater-Thirlmere watershed, in the Borough of Allerdale. The fell is wet <b>underfoot,</b> with large areas clad in heather. The eastern slopes above Thirlmere have been planted with conifers.|$|E
25|$|On {{reaching}} the water, lifeboat number 11 was nearly swamped by a {{jet of water}} being pumped out from the ship to stem the flooding. Tempers flared among the crowded passengers, {{some of whom had}} to stand, as the boat was rowed away from the ship. Rosenbaum offered some levity by using her musical pig to entertain the children <b>underfoot.</b> The lifeboat was met by Carpathia at about 7:00a.m.|$|E
25|$|A small rock outcrop {{forms the}} summit, {{complete}} with a cairn. A further knoll to the north east is of similar altitude. Much of the fell, particularly towards the main watershed, is very wet <b>underfoot</b> and the heather makes progress even more laborious. There are views east to the Helvellyn range and westward over the main ridge to the higher fells where a great sweep from Grisedale Pike to Bowfell can be seen. Fisher Crag presents a better viewpoint for Thirlmere.|$|E
25|$|Medieval amulets show a {{variation}} on this iconography, with Abyzou trampled <b>underfoot</b> by a horseman. The rider is identified again either as Solomon or Arlaph; one example depicts the rider as Sisinnios, with the demon named as both Abizou and Anabardalea, and an angel named Araph (for Arlaph) standing by with one raised wing. The medieval lead amulets that show the rider subduing the female often have a main image that resembles a gorgoneion and is likely a womb symbol (hystera).|$|E
25|$|Situated in {{the central}} area of the {{national}} park, four kilometres (2½ miles) south of Keswick, Bleaberry Fell is the northernmost top on the ridge that separates the valleys containing the lakes of Derwent Water (Borrowdale) and Thirlmere. This ridge, which also contains the fells of High Seat and High Tove, is notoriously boggy <b>underfoot,</b> but Bleaberry Fell is mostly dry and the heather-covered summit gives an excellent all-round vista. To the east the fell has the rock faces of Iron Crag and Goat Crags as it falls away towards the Thirlmere valley.|$|E
25|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{the same}} {{direction}} as the Earth rotates on its axis, so it takes slightly more than a day—about 24 hours and 50 minutes—for the Moon to return to the same location in the sky. During this time, it has passed overhead (culmination) once and <b>underfoot</b> once (at an hour angle of 00:00 and 12:00 respectively), so in many places the period of strongest tidal forcing is the above-mentioned, about 12 hours and 25 minutes. The moment of highest tide is not necessarily when the Moon is nearest to zenith or nadir, but the period of the forcing still determines the time between high tides.|$|E
25|$|Great Calva {{appears from}} Skiddaw Forest as a steep sided pyramid, clad {{predominantly}} in heather. The summit is a curving ridge {{half a mile}} long, with Great Calva at the eastern end and Little Calva to the west. The ridge itself is extremely wet <b>underfoot.</b> From between the two tops, Dead Beck runs down into Candleseaves Bog, the source of both the Caldew and Dash Beck. Great Calva has a prominent southern spur, around which the Caldew flows before steering north east for the Eden Valley. In a strict topographical sense Candleseaves Bog is the connection between Great Calva and Skiddaw, but it could hardly {{be described as a}} ridge route.|$|E
25|$|Marjorie Barnard met Flora Eldershaw, {{who was a}} {{year ahead}} of her, in her first year at the University of Sydney. Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually <b>underfoot,</b> and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the acid test of collaboration in writing.|$|E
25|$|To the {{north-east}} a long ridge {{leads to}} the subsidiary stony top of Randerside (729m). From there it broadens into Matterdale Common, becoming steadily wetter <b>underfoot,</b> before splitting into two {{on either side of}} Groove Beck. The more southerly ridge heads over High Brow (575m), fringed by Dowthwaite Crag which broods over the road-end settlement of Dowthwaitehead. The further tops of Low How (497m) and Cockley Moor (455m) are passed before this branch of the ridge peters out in extensive conifer plantations, and then the ground climbs again to Great Mell Fell. The northern branch of the ridge is edged by Wolf Crags above the Old Coach Road, beyond which a wide grassy moor sweeps north across Sandbeds Moss and Flaska to the A66 road and the dismantled Penrith to Keswick railway.|$|E
25|$|The term 'transition mire' {{relates to}} {{vegetation}} that in floristic composition and general ecological characteristics is transitional between acid bog and 7230 Alkaline fens, {{in which the}} surface conditions range from markedly acidic to slightly base-rich. The vegetation normally has intimate mixtures of species considered to be acidophile and others thought of as calciphile or basophile. In some cases the mire occupies a physically transitional location between bog and fen vegetation, as for example on the marginal lagg of raised bog or associated with certain valley and basin mires. In other cases these intermediate properties may reflect the actual process of succession, as peat accumulates in groundwater-fed fen or open water to produce rainwater-fed bog isolated from groundwater influence. Many of these systems are very unstable <b>underfoot</b> and can therefore also be described as 'quaking bogs'.|$|E
25|$|Haiti was {{the first}} {{government}} of an independent state that recognised the revolution. Jean-Pierre Boyer, President of Haiti, following a Greek request for assistance, addressed a letter on 15 January 1822. In the letter sent to Greek expatriates living in France, Adamantios Korais, Christodoulos Klonaris, Christodoulos Klonaris, Konstantinos Polychroniades and A. Bogorides, who had assembled themselves into a Committee which was seeking international support for the ongoing Greek revolution, expressed {{his support for the}} Greek Revolution and compared the struggle <b>underfoot</b> across the Atlantic to the struggle for independence in his own land. He apologized for being unable to support the Revolution in Greece financially, though he hoped {{he might be able to}} in the future. But he articulated his moral and political support for the revolution, notably by filling his letter with references to classical Greek history, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of this history and powerfully evoking the contemporary revolutionaries as the rightful heirs of their ancestors. Some historians claim that Boyer also sent to the Greeks 25 tons of Haitian coffee that could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons, but not enough evidence exists to support this or the other claim that one hundred Haitian volunteers set off to fight in the Greek Revolution. Allegedly, their ship was boarded by pirates somewhere in the Mediterranean and these fighters purportedly never reached their destination.|$|E
500|$|... "Wined and Dined" [...] dated from Barrett's Cambridge days, and {{is about}} the {{relationship}} between Barrett and his then-girlfriend, Gayla Pinion, a model from Cambridge. The song reflects on about Mediterranean evenings ("Musk winds blow"), and hauntings of Barrett's childhood ("Chalk <b>underfoot</b> / Light ash of blue") evoked during a summer party he didn't want to leave. Dave Gilmour added a sinuous sliding lead over Barrett’s vocals.|$|E

The bay is the centre of a National Trust estate which consists of [...] of shoreline, headland and farmland, and includes Mynydd Carreg and Mynydd Anelog.|$|E
500|$|Classic skis: Designed for {{skiing in}} tracks. For adult skiers (between 155cm/50kg and 185cm/75kg), {{recommended}} lengths are between 180 and 210 centimetres (approximately 115% of the skier's height). Traction {{comes from a}} [...] "grip zone" [...] <b>underfoot</b> that when bearing the skier's weight engages either a textured gripping surface or a grip wax. Accordingly, these skis are classified as [...] "waxable" [...] or [...] "waxless". Recreational waxless skis generally require little attention and are adapted for casual use. Waxable skis, if prepared correctly, provide better grip and glide.|$|E

[...] VCU established an engineering department in the late 1990s, and Fenn held a joint professorship between the two departments until his death. [...] Even in his 80s, Fenn enjoyed {{the opportunity to be}} in the lab doing research, saying, [...] "I like to mingle and exchange with the young people. It gets me out from <b>underfoot</b> at home." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of {{elephants}} as executioners continued {{well into the}} latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, Louis Rousselet described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head <b>underfoot.</b> The sketch was made into a woodcut and printed in [...] "Le Tour du Monde", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as Harper's Weekly.|$|E
500|$|Ermac's [...] "Pest Control" [...] Fatality {{from the}} 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, {{in which he}} shrinks his {{opponent}} and then crushes them <b>underfoot,</b> has been positively received by critics with some citing its humorous elements. When NetherRealm Studios posted a trailer of the [...] "Inner Workings" [...] Fatality from Mortal Kombat X on YouTube in March 2015, it accumulated over 850,000 views {{in less than a}} month, [...] and garnered publicity due to its graphic imagery. Ryan Smith of Chicago Reader spotlighted the finisher in an April 2015 article titled [...] "Has Mortal Kombat Finally Gone Too Far?", describing it as [...] "an act of medieval torture as imagined by Tolkien." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} <b>underfoot</b> were slushy {{during the}} day, {{as the temperature}} warmed up. Shackleton resolved to {{do most of the}} trekking at night, sledging the three lifeboats of the Endurance behind them. The sledging was hard work and after little more than a week, Shackleton and his men were forced to camp once more. [...] Underneath, the ice continued to move northwards, and by April 1916, the floe they were on was nearly within sight of Elephant Island but beginning to break up. Shackleton ordered the expedition to the lifeboats, placing Worsley in charge of one of them, the Dudley Docker. [...] It took a week to reach Elephant Island, the ice and currents inhibiting progress.|$|E
500|$|Davenport's {{cartoons}} had {{an effect}} on Hanna. West Virginia Senator Nathan B. Scott remembered being with Hanna as he viewed his caricature wearing a suit covered with dollar signs, trampling women and children <b>underfoot,</b> and hearing the Ohioan state, [...] "that hurts". Hanna could not make public appearances without having to field questions about the cartoons. Nevertheless, publisher J.B. Morrow, a friend of both McKinley and his campaign manager, stated that Hanna [...] "took his course regardless of local criticism". McKinley made no attempt to deflect criticism from Hanna and in fact kept a file of Davenport cartoons that particularly amused him. [...] Despite Hanna's discomfiture, both men were content to have Hanna attacked if it meant that McKinley would not be.|$|E
500|$|In Miller's Falls, Massachusetts, an exterminator {{inspects}} {{the basement}} of Dr. Jeff Eckerle, having been hired to eradicate a cockroach infestation. The exterminator sprays a roach, knocks {{it down to the}} ground, and attempts to crush it <b>underfoot.</b> However, upon doing so, he begins to succumb to anaphylaxis, clutching his heart and collapsing against a wall, while the roach crawls out from under his boot, unscathed. When Eckerle returns, he finds the exterminator's body covered with roaches. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is coincidentally nearby, investigating reported UFO sightings in Miller's Grove. While on the phone with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Mulder is approached by the local sheriff, Frass, who reveals that a series of [...] "roach attacks" [...] have taken place in the town. Frass allows Mulder onto the scene at Eckerle's residence.|$|E
500|$|Little {{distinguished}} {{himself with}} large, early investments into the railroad construction industry, still regarded with some suspicion by financiers. As {{with his other}} activities, these paid off handily, eventually earning him a new title, that of the [...] "Railroad King". However, {{for all of his}} wealth Little was little loved by his peers, many of whom secretly believed him to be lacking personal integrity, a hulking, manipulative figure who built his fortune through speculation and market manipulation and crushed other traders <b>underfoot</b> as he did. Little [...] "had been known to gorge and digest more stock in one day than the weight of bulk of his whole body in certificates." [...] Other investors followed his actions closely, terming him [...] "too shrewd to be caught, too rich to be ruined", and his sway and influence in the market was indeed enormous.|$|E
500|$|Skis {{designed}} for classic technique, both {{in track and}} in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the [...] "grip zone" [...] or [...] "kick zone", <b>underfoot.</b> This comes either from a) texture, designed to slide forward but not backwards, that {{is built into the}} grip zone of waxless skis, or from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or b) from grip waxes. Grip waxes are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax too hard for the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (wax too soft for the conditions). Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction. Hard grip waxes don't work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called klister.|$|E
500|$|During the Mughal era, [...] "it was {{a common}} mode of {{execution}} in those days to have the offender trampled <b>underfoot</b> by an elephant." [...] Captain Alexander Hamilton, writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan ordered an offending military commander to be carried [...] "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death". The Mughal Emperor Humayun ordered the crushing by elephant of an imam he mistakenly believed {{to be critical of}} his reign. Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor Jahangir, is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The French traveler François Bernier, who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment. Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of Delhi, elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces [...] "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".|$|E
500|$|Bicycling was {{the latest}} craze in the United States in 1896, and among those who came to salute McKinley was a brigade of bicyclists, who pulled images of McKinley and Hobart behind their vehicles, and {{performed}} tricks as they went to see their presidential candidate. The people of Canton joined in enthusiastically, and restaurants and souvenir venders expanded their operations. [...] A popular source of keepsakes was the wood of McKinley's front porch or fence, whittled as supporters listened, and the blades of his lawn, when not trampled <b>underfoot,</b> made later appearances in scrapbooks. In between delegations, McKinley entertained visitors; future Secretary of State John Hay, a major backer, came to Canton reluctantly, not relishing the crowds, but wrote [...] "he {{met me at the}} [...] station, gave me meat & took me upstairs and talked for two hours as calmly & serenely as if we were summer boarders in Bethlehem, at a loss for means to kill time. I was more struck than ever with his mask. It is a genuine Italian ecclesiastical face of the XVth Century." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Europe and North America. The tour started {{along with the}} album release on May 23, with a show in Lisbon, Portugal. The European tour had 26 dates. The final concert of the European tour ended in tragedy, where an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark on June 30 lead nine fans to be crushed <b>underfoot</b> and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. This led two additional concerts through July to be cancelled. [...] A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on a two-leg North American tour, starting on Virginia Beach, Virginia on August 3. The first leg of the tour focused on the East Coast of the United States, and then the band moved to the Midwest and the West Coast for the tour's second leg. The band considered disbanding after the Roskilde tragedy, but Vedder stated that [...] "playing, facing crowds, being together" [...] in the North American tour [...] "enabled us to start processing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ficus obliqua is {{an elegant}} shade tree for parks or fields, and is {{adaptable}} to differing soils. A notable specimen in Mick Ryan Park, Milton on the New South Wales south coast stands [...] tall and [...] across, {{and is a}} local landmark. [...] Like other fig species that grow into large trees, Ficus obliqua is not suitable for any but the largest gardens as its aggressive root system invades drains and garden beds. Fig trees also drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess <b>underfoot.</b> Although it is much less used in bonsai than F. rubiginosa, F. obliqua is well-suited {{for use in the}} medium; its small leaves and trunk's propensity to thicken give it attributes optimal for a tree [...] in height. It is seen in bonsai nurseries mainly in the Brisbane area, where it is a locally common species, and is very highly regarded by at least one proponent, Bradley Barlow. Barlow entered a specimen from Brisbane to the Bonsai Clubs International competition in 2006, winning a prize. It is also suited for use as an indoor plant in low-, medium- or brightly lit indoor spaces. The timber is too soft for use in woodworking.|$|E
500|$|... "Why I Love You" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AbsolutePunk's Ian Walker described the track as an [...] "album spotlight", {{and stated that}} it's [...] "carried by a dramatic, driving chorus from famed R artist Mr Hudson and, while featuring one of Jay's weakest verses on the entire album, showcases a surprisingly strong back-and-forth from the two headlining artists towards the end." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin commented that [...] "Why I Love You" [...] closes out the album proper with a monster Cassius-lifted chorus." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated that the song is [...] "pure pop aggrandisement", musing that [...] "this rather enjoyable piece of maximalism feels quite at home on an album writ so large, both in sound and verse, that a planetarium was deemed the only fitting venue for its first playback." [...] Craig Jenkins of Prefix wrote that [...] "Mike Dean's titanic, Cassius-sampling [...] "Why I Love You" [...] slowly peels layers off its stuffy largess to reveal the gorgeous string accompaniment <b>underfoot.</b> Kanye and his team are still trafficking in proggy, kitchen-sink experimentation, and Kanye's transformation into rap's own ELO is nearly complete." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson was less enthusiastic about the track, writing that [...] "Everything falls apart on the album-closing [...] "Why I Love You," [...] which cranks up West's love of prog-rock bombast {{so much that it}} sounds like guest crooner Mr Hudson is trying to sing the hook over a poorly recorded bootleg of a Muse concert." ...|$|E
