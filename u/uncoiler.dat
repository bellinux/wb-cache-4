5000|$|For metal coils, the slitter {{consists}} of three main parts: an <b>uncoiler,</b> slitter, and recoiler. [...] The material is fed from the <b>uncoiler,</b> through the nip between the two circular cutting wheels (one on top and another underneath), and then re-wound in slit pieces on the recoiler.|$|E
5000|$|The EPS process (see Figure 2) {{begins with}} {{hot rolled strip}} steel in coil form. This steel pays off of an <b>uncoiler,</b> then passes through a machine which serves the purpose of [...] "scale breaker", [...] "leveler" [...] or both. This machine (see Figure 2) works the {{material}} between sets of hardened rollers. This {{has the effect of}} removing the curvature of the strip ("coil set") and breaking loose the outer layers of mill scale which encase the steel strip.|$|E
50|$|Roll forming is, {{among the}} {{manufacturing}} processes, {{one of the}} simplest. It typically begins with a large coil of sheet metal, between 1 inch cm and 20 inch cm. in width, and 0.004 inch mm and 0.125 inch mm thick, supported on an <b>uncoiler.</b> The strip is fed through an entry guide to properly align the material as it passes through the rolls of the mill, each set of rolls forming a bend until the material reaches its desired shape. Roll sets are typically mounted {{one over the other}} on a pair of horizontal parallel shafts supported by a stand(s). Side rolls and cluster rolls may also be used to provide greater precision and flexibility and to limit stresses on the material. The shaped strips can be cut to length ahead of a roll forming mill, between mills, or {{at the end of the}} roll forming line.|$|E
