50|$|<b>Umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> is {{the most}} common {{umbilical}} abnormality in neonates, causing inflammation and drainage.|$|E
50|$|At times, {{there may}} be a fleshy red {{swelling}} seen in the hollow of the umbilicus that persists after the cord has fallen off. It may bleed on touch, or may stain the clothes that come in contact with it. This needs to be shown to a pediatric surgeon. This is most likely to be an umbilical polyp and the therapy is to tie it at the base with a stitch so that it falls off and there is no bleeding. Alternatively, it may be an <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> that responds well to local application of dry salt or silver nitrate but may take a few weeks to heal and dry.|$|E
40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} common {{umbilical}} abnormalities in neonates is <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma,</b> causing inflammation and drainage. The common treatment is application of a 75 % silver nitrate stick. This study was carried out to compare the effect of 2 and 24 hours salt (NaCl) in treatment on infant <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The direct trocar {{insertion}} technique (DTI) for {{the creation}} of pneumoperitoneum has been described as an alternative to open and Veress needle (VN) techniques. This study assesses the safety and feasibility of direct trocar insertion without a pre-existing pneumoperitoneum in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic procedures. Methods: From November 2001 to February 2006, we retrospectively studied 196 (146 women and 50 men) consecutive patients. A single consultant laparoscopic surgeon performed all operations. The mean patient age was 57 years (range, 22 to 81). The procedures included 186 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, 3 laparoscopic appendectomies, 1 laparoscopic Nissen, 5 laparoscopic groin hernia repairs, and 1 conversion to open surgery. Results: Creation of pneumoperitoneum with DTI was feasible in 99. 5 % of patients. No major complications were associated with the technique. Immediate minor postoperative complications included 1 (0. 5 %) wound infection and 3 (1. 5 %) hematomas. At mean follow-up of 23 months, 4 (2 %) <b>umbilical</b> wound stitch <b>granulomas</b> and 1 (0. 5 %) incisional hernia from the umbilical port site were observed. Conclusion: This study shows that that when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon the direct trocar insertion technique is a safe and effective alternative for creation of pneumoperitoneum...|$|R
40|$|Endometriosis: A highly {{unexpected}} {{skin lesion}} Endometriosis {{is the presence}} of functional endometrium in anywhere outside of uterin cavity. This clinical entity is relatively common, that 10 - 15 % of fertile women and 6 % of post-menopausal women are affected [1, 2]. Cutaneous endometriosis is a form of endometriosis and it usually occurs in the incision scar, after gynecological surgeries, cesarean sections and episiotomies [3]. Cutaneous endometriosis is characterized with painful, bluish skin lesions that may bleed concordantly with menstrual cycle. Cutaneous endometriosis is extremely rare in patients who haven&# 8217;t undergone any surgical procedures. We would like to share our clinical experience in this topic. A thirty-seven year-old female patient with no parity history admitted to our outpatient clinic because of supra-umbilical mass. Physical examination revealed a fascia defect with a 2 cm diameter, superior to umbilicus. There was also a brown raised skin lesion which is 2 x 1 cm in greatest diameters, on the left side near umbilicus. Patient underwent open hernia repair and the skin lesion was excised due to patient&# 8217;s request. After an unproblematic recovery patient was discharged. Histopathological examination of the skin revealed endometriosis. Patient&# 8217;s detailed gynecological history was questioned. Patient was married but failed to conceive a child, despite not using any methods of contraception. She was referred to the infertility clinic. Cutaneous endometriosis is a rare clinical entity, especially in patients who haven&# 8217;t undergone any surgical procedure. Primary umbilical endometriosis was first described by Villar and it is known that its size may vary between several millimeters and centimeters. Although retrograde menstruation theory is reasonable, exact mechanism of etiology remains unclear. Pyogenic <b>granuloma,</b> <b>umbilical</b> polyps, melanocytic nevus, seborrheic dermatitis, hemangiomas, and desmoid tumors are the frequently seen lesions of umbilicus [4, 5]. Endometriosis should be kept in mind, especially when skin lesions which don&# 8217;t meet the criteria for any of these conditions are detected. Skin lesions of patients suffering from infertility should be examined carefully. Excision and histopathological examination of these lesions are necessary. References 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> is {{a common}} {{pediatric}} problem related to persistent infection at the umbilical cord stump in the neonatal period. In the present study, the authors looked at the relation between {{a new way of}} prox-imal clamping of the umbilical cord and the incidence of <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> in comparison with the conventional clamping...|$|E
40|$|<b>Umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> is a {{very common}} cause of {{umbilical}} discharge. It is managed by chemical cauterization or simple thread ligation. However, {{it can be a}} differential diagnosis of patent vitello intestinal duct and this should be ruled out before managing such patients. We report a case of a 10 -week-old male infant referred by his General Practitioner for silver nitrate cauterisation, with a diagnosis of suspected <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> (UG). The child underwent subsequent exploratory laparotomy and bowel anastomosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{observed that}} topical doxycycline powder {{was effective in}} the treatment of <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma.</b> This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of this agent. The patients were randomly assigned into inpatient group and outpatient group. Doxycycline powder was administered topically once daily for 5 days. The protocol was restarted if no response observed. Eighty-four patients were included in this study. With one course of therapy, the overall cure rate was 82. 14 % (69 / 84), and the statistical difference in response rate was not significant between the 2 groups (P >. 05). With 2 courses of therapy, the overall cure rate was 94. 05 % (79 / 84). No complication was observed during treatment. No recurrence was observed during follow-up. The treatment of <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> using topical doxycycline is safe and efficacious. The administration of the agent can be performed conveniently by parents at home. This protocol could be considered to be the first treatment option for this disorder in neonates and infants...|$|E
40|$|Umbilical {{discharge}} {{in infancy}} is often attributed to infection or an <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma.</b> It {{is important to}} investigate if such a discharge is due to an underlying congenital abnormality because corrective surgical intervention may then be required. We present the first case of an infant with a persistent umbilical discharge from an omphalomesenteric duct cyst. The discharge was associated with periumbilical dermatitis. The dermatitis was most likely due to irritation of the skin by gastric acid produced by the ectopic gastric mucosa contained in the omphalomesenteric duct cyst. Both discharge and dermatitis resolved after surgical removal of the cyst...|$|E
40|$|Dermatological {{causes of}} {{umbilical}} discharge in an infant include eczema, bacterial omphalitis and <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma.</b> 1 Persistent discharge suggests an umbilical remnant. We report a simple test which correctly identifi ed {{the source of}} discharge after surgical exploration had been inconclusive. A 6 -month-old girl was referred to paediatric surgeons with persistent serosanguinous umbilical discharge and infl amma-tion from 12 weeks of age (fi gure 1). Provisional diagnosis {{at the time was}} a patent urachal duct; however, no abnormality was found at surgery. She was then referred to dermatology where the localised irritant dermatitis failed to respond to topical treat-ment. The pH of the discharge, tested in clinic with a urinary dipstick, was acidic (pH= 5), suggesting ectopic gastric mucosa. Subsequent excision of the umbilicus was curative and histology revealed gastric mucosal cells with crypts of intestinal epithe...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} causes of {{umbilical}} discharge in infancy are infection and <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> {{that may be}} treated by antibiotics and topical application of silver nitrate subsequently. If the umbilical discharge persists or {{if there is any}} abnormal discoloration around the umbilicus, it is important to investigate for underlying congenital abnormality that may be cured by surgical intervention. Unusual presentation of omphalomesenteric duct cyst has been reported in literature. We report, {{for the first time as}} far as our search is concerned, a case of a 16 -month-old infant who presented initially with persistent umbilical discharge and finally with bruising around the umbilicus in keeping with Cullen’s sign. A diagnosis of omphalomesenteric duct cyst containing pancreatic tissue was made on histopathological examination. This case emphasizes that, a persistent umbilical discharge and or discoloration around the umbilicus should be further investigated and an omphalomesenteric duct cyst can present as Cullen’s sign...|$|E
40|$|Background: Vitellointestinal duct (VID) or omphalomesenteric duct {{anomalies}} are {{secondary to}} {{the persistence of the}} embryonic vitelline duct, which normally obliterates by weeks 5 – 9 of intrauterine life. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a total of 16 patients of symptomatic remnants of vitellointestinal duct from period of Jan 2009 to May 2013. Results: Male to female ratio (M:F) was 4. 3 : 1 and mean age of presentation was 2 months and their mode of presentation was: patent VID in 9 (56. 25 %) patients, umbilical cyst in 2 (12. 25 %), <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> in 2 (12. 25 %), and Meckel diverticulum as content of hernia sac in obstructed umbilical hernia in 1 (6. 25 %) patient. Two patients with umbilical fistula had severe electrolyte disturbance and died without surgical intervention. Conclusion: Persistent VID may have varied presentations in infancy. High output umbilical fistula and excessive bowel prolapse demand urgent surgical intervention to avoid morbidity and mortality...|$|E
40|$|Persistence of the vitello-intestinal duct in {{children}} is not uncommon. It may present as a thin cord {{up to the}} umbilicus, or rarely lead to formation of an umbilical polyp with, or without, a patent diverticulum. It is formed at around eleven days post fertilization. The obliterative process begins at the umbilical end of the duct and extends towards the intestine making Meckel’s diverticulum more likely. This case report is of an infant who had a vitello-intestinal duct, which was treated in primary care on multiple occasions as an <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> and then as an umbilical infection. Key words: umbilicus, granuloma, vitello-intestinal duct, neonate, surgery, silver nitrate cauterization 1 The vitello-intestinal duct in the embryological life is the communication between {{the apex of the}} midgut and the yolk sac, formed at around eleven days post fertilization. Normally, it gets obliterated by seventh week of life. 1 In about 2 % of humans this duct per-sists and gives rise to a group of anomalies of which Meckel’s diverticulum is the commonest 2 and com...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although lesions of {{umbilicus}} are {{encountered in}} clinical practice {{on a regular}} basis, surgical intervention is rarely required for them. Umbilical tissues are uncommonly received for histopathology. They formed 0. 18 % of the total specimens received. Aims: To study the clinical and histopathological characteristics of umbilical lesions received in the Surgical Pathology Department of a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: This is a 2 -year retrospective study. Records of the cases were reviewed and the histopathology slides were reassessed. Results: A total of 15 cases {{were found between the}} age range of 9 months and 45 years, with a male preponderance. Complaints of umbilical discharge/wet umbilicus and umbilical mass were the most common. In four cases, the umbilical lesion was associated with underlying congenital anomaly. Umbilical sinus (four cases) and <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> (three cases) were the most common histopathological diagnosis. Two of the sinuses were pilonidal sinuses, which are rare lesions in this location. Conclusion: Umbilical mass or discharge associated with abdominal symptoms requires careful evaluation for congenital anomalies. Pilonidal sinus should be considered in a young hirsute patient with wet umbilicus...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the advantages of a telephone consultation with a specialist in paediatric surgery after taking photographs and video images by a general practitioner for the diagnosis of some diseases. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study of the reliability of paediatric surgery online consultation among specialists and general practitioners. Results: Of 26 general practitioners included in the study, 12 were working in the city and 14 were working in districts outside the city. A total of 41 pictures and 3 videos of 38 patients were sent and evaluated together with the medical history and clinical findings. These patients were diagnosed with <b>umbilical</b> <b>granuloma</b> (n = 6), physiological/pathological phimosis (n = 6), balanitis (n = 6), hydrocele (n = 6), umbilical hernia (n = 4), smegma cyst (n = 2), reductable inguinal hernia (n = 1), incarcerated inguinal hernia (n = 1), paraphimosis (n = 1), burried penis (n = 1), hypospadias (n = 1), epigastric hernia (n = 1), vulva synechia (n = 1), and rectal prolapse (n = 1). Twelve patients were asked to be referred urgently, but it was suggested that only two of these patients, who had paraphimosis and incarcerated inguinal hernia be referred in emergency conditions. It was decided that there was no need for the other ten patients to be referred to a specialist at night or at the weekend. All diagnoses were confirmed to be true, when all patients underwent examination in the pediatric surgery clinic in elective conditions. Conclusion: Evaluation of photographs and video images of a lesion together with medical history and clinical findings via a telephone consultation between a paediatric surgery specialist and a general practitioner provides a definitive diagnosis and prevents patients from being referred unnecessarily...|$|E
