5000|$|For example, a {{resident}} of Massachusetts, with a 6.25% [...] "sales and use tax" [...] on certain goods and services, purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for <b>use,</b> storage <b>or</b> other <b>consumption</b> in Massachusetts. Under New Hampshire law, the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods, but the Massachusetts purchaser/user must still pay 6.25% of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use tax. If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase, whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted (as a tax credit) from the 6.25% owed for subsequent <b>use,</b> storage <b>or</b> <b>consumption</b> in Massachusetts. With few exceptions, no state's vendors will charge the native state's sales tax on goods shipped out of state, meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax. The purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods.|$|R

40|$|How {{we measure}} poverty can {{importantly}} influence how {{we come to}} understand it, how we analyze it, and how we create policies to influence it. For this reason, measurement methodologies can be of tremendous practical relevance. Most {{countries of the world}} define poverty in a unidimensional way, <b>using</b> income <b>or</b> <b>consumption</b> levels. But poor people go beyond income in defining their experience of poverty. They often include a lack of education, health, housing, empowerment, humiliation, employment, personal security and more. No one indicator, such as income <b>or</b> <b>consumption,</b> is uniquely able to capture the multiple aspects that contribute to poverty. Furthermore, levels and trends of income poverty are not highly correlated with trends in other basic variables such as child mortality, primary school completion rates, or undernourishment (Bourguignon et al 2010 : 24, 27). A person or household can be income poor but multidimensionally non-poor, or income rich but in multidimensional poverty. In recent years, the literature on multidimensional poverty measurement has blossomed {{in a number of different}} directions...|$|R
