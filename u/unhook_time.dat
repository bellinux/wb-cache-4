40|$|The {{handbook}} {{does not}} attempt to define a single “best ” system for any site. Instead, it presumes that readers {{need to be aware}} of the key factors that influence the probability of achieving success with any given combination of equipment and site characteristics. Readers will then use their own judgement to evaluate the merits of the various options. The information in the handbook should be considered only as part of an overall process for equipment selection which will vary from company to company. reduction in the road network is especially important considering the typical location of the roads made redundant by this yarding system — steep, rough, and unstable terrain often associated with difficult road construction. Method used to hold logs Two basic ways are used to hold the logs for cable systems: chokers and grapples. The same issues for chokers versus grapples (e. g., hookup and <b>unhook</b> <b>time,</b> accessibility to logs) apply to cable systems as to ground-based systems and are discussed previously. Chokers Chokers are wire ropes for hooking the logs to the butt-rigging or carriage. Chokers allow for several logs to be yarded in each turn — either with several chokers used at a time, or one choker holding several logs...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the trapping mechanism of individual DNA molecules in ordered nanoporous structures generated by crystalline particle arrays. Two requisites for trapping are {{revealed by the}} dynamics of single trapped DNA, fully-stretched U/J shapes and hernia formation. The experimental results show there is a stronger possibility for hernias to lead the reorientation upon switching directions of the voltage at high field strengths, where trapping occurs. Fully stretched DNA has longer <b>unhooking</b> <b>times</b> than expected by a classic rope-on-pulley model. We propose a dielectrophoretic (DEP) force reduces the mobility of segments {{at the apex of}} the U or J, where field gradients are highest, based on simulations and observations of the trapping force dependence on field strength. A modified model for <b>unhooking</b> <b>time</b> is obtained after the DEP force is introduced. The new model explains the <b>unhooking</b> <b>time</b> data by predicting an infinite trapping time when the ratio of arm length differences (of the U or J) to molecule length 3 ̆ 94 x/L < 3 ̆b 2, where 3 ̆b 2 is a DEP parameter that is found to strongly increase with electric field. The DNA polarizability calculated with the DEP model and experimental value of 3 ̆b 2 is of the same magnitude of reported value. The results indicate the tension at the apex of U/J shape DNA is the primary reason for DNA trapping during pulsed field separation, instead of hernias. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Using single {{molecule}} fluorescence microscopy, {{we study}} {{the dynamics of}} an electric-field-driven DNA molecule colliding with a single stationary post. The radius of the obstacle is small compared to the contour length of the molecules. Molecules that achieve hooked configurations which span the obstacle were chosen for study. Four different types of hooked configurations were found: symmetric hairpins with constant extension during unhooking, asymmetric hairpins with constant extension during unhooking, asymmetric hairpins with increasing extension during unhooking, and rare multiply looped entangled configurations. The important physics describing the unhooking dynamics for each classification differ and models are proposed to predict <b>unhooking</b> <b>times.</b> Surprisingly, we find that most collisions do not follow classic rope-on-pulley motion but instead form hairpins with increasing total extension during the unhooking process (called X collisions). Last, we show that unraveling to form a hairpin and center-of-mass motion during unhooking affect the overall center of mass hold-up time during a collision process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the circle-hook on hooking injury, fish size and catch rates were {{evaluated}} for mixed-species recreational boat fisheries in the Balearic Islands (NW Mediterranean). The relationships between deep-hooking incidence (the main cause of fish mortality) and hook type (circle hooks vs conventional J-hooks), fish size, and angler were tested. Results demonstrated {{that the size of}} the fish was the most important predictor of deep-hooking incidence, as a larger fish size resulted in an increase in deeper wounds. Hook type also had a significant effect on the deep-hooking rate. Specifically, the deep-hooking rate of the most frequently-caught species, Diplodus annularis (L.) and Coris julis (L.), was reduced by greater than half with the circle hooks. The mean size of the fish caught and the <b>unhooking</b> <b>time</b> were not affected by the use of circle hooks. Finally, their use resulted in no change in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) compared to conventional hooks for both univariate and multivariate procedures. Hence, circle hooks are a promising conservation tool for marine resources when linked with catch-and-release strategies. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The factors {{affecting}} mortality in Diplodus annularis (L.) and Lithognathus mormyrus (L.) caught and released in a recreational fishery in the Balearic Islands (NW Mediterranean) were examined. A total of 194 and 214 specimens of each species, respectively, were caught and individually monitored in containment tanks for 10 days. The {{circumstances of the}} catch, such as capture depth, water temperature, fish size, hook type, hook location, bleeding, <b>unhooking</b> <b>time</b> and cutting the hook line were tested with a logistic regression model. Diplodus annularis experienced moderate rates of mortality (15 %), and only deep-hooking {{was a significant predictor}} of death. The incidence of undersized fish for this species was 48 %. By contrast, L. mormyrus exhibited higher mortality rates (33 %) with over 90 % of the catch under the minimum legal size. Deep-hooking was the strongest predictor of mortality. When circle hooks were used, or if the line was cut when the fish were deep-hooked, mortality was considerably reduced. Strategies, such as promoting the use of more selective gears that reduce the capture of undersized fish and implementing gentler release techniques, should be considered in managing these species. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|Immediate (4 - 5 h) {{and delayed}} (10 d) hooking {{mortality}} for released fish kept in tanks was evaluated for painted comber (Serranus scriba) {{taken by the}} recreational fishery of the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). Results showed low rates of immediate (10. 8 %) and delayed (3. 3 %) hooking mortality, a total mortality of 14. 1 %. Anatomical hook location and capture depth were the most significant predictors of mortality; 70. 4 % of fish caught with a deep location of hook died {{as a consequence of}} the damage caused, bleeding, and long <b>unhooking</b> <b>times.</b> Fish caught in depths > 16 m showed evidence of external barotrauma caused by rapid decompression, which increased the probability of death. The most common forms of barotrauma were swimbladder enlargement and stomach inversion. For fish vented with the aid of a hypodermic needle to extract excess gas, mortality was reduced by half. Factors such as surface temperature, fish size, and hook type (>J> hook vs. circle hook) could not explain the mortality of fish released into tanks. Therefore, the results confirm that a practice of catch-and-release (voluntary or mandatory) for S. scriba needs to be promoted among recreational anglers. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

40|$|The {{effects of}} hook size (small vs. large) and type (conventional vs. barbless) on hooking injury, catch per unit effort (cpue), and fish size in a mixed-species {{recreational}} fishery in the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean) are evaluated. Hook size {{was the most}} important predictor of deep-hooking, which is reduced by the use of large hooks. The size of fish captured was another predictor of deep-hooking incidence, because large fish tended to be caught in deep-hooking locations. Deep-hooking was highly correlated with the presence of bleeding, and <b>unhooking</b> <b>time</b> was reduced by the use of large hooks and barbless hooks, although differences were small. To determine the effects of different hook treatments on cpue and species composition, a mixed-effect linear model was used as a univariate procedure, and redundancy analysis was used as a multivariate analysis. Results showed a drastic decrease in cpue with barbless hooks. In contrast, large hooks reduced the incidence of hooking injuries, with a small reduction in catch rate. Moreover, large hooks were associated with a larger mean size of fish caught than small hooks. Hence, control of hook size, along with other traditional management measures that involve the release of fish, is presented as a management option for sustainable development of recreational fisheries in the western Mediterranean Sea. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

At last she showed me a prize, {{and this was a}} young lady big with child, who had a charming watch. The thing was to be done as she came out of church. She goes {{on one side of the}} lady, and pretends, just as she came to the steps, to fall, and fell against the lady with so much {{violence}} as put her into a great fright, and both cried out terribly. In the very moment that she jostled the lady, I had hold of the watch, and holding it the right way, the start she gave drew the hook out, and she never felt it. I made off immediately, and left my schoolmistress to come out of her pretended fright gradually, and the lady too; and presently the watch was missed. 'Ay,' says my comrade, 'then it was those rogues that thrust me down, I warrant ye; I wonder the gentlewoman did not miss her watch before, then we might have taken them.' ...|$|R
