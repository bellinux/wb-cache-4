Despite being advised to take out an interdict to prevent the work, in January 1797 the Hospital did not feel it had a strong enough case. However, four months later when two miles of the canal had been dug <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the north and south Ugie joined, the Hospital did apply for an interdict, and this was granted in July 1797.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E

25|$|In free diving (breathhold) {{the weight}} system is almost {{exclusively}} a weight belt with quick release buckle, as the emergency {{release of the}} weights will usually allow the diver to float to the surface even if unconscious, where {{there is at least}} a chance of rescue. The weights are used mainly to neutralise the buoyancy of the exposure suit, as the diver is nearly neutral in most cases, and there is little other equipment carried. The weights required depend almost entirely on the buoyancy of the suit. Most free divers will weight themselves to be positively buoyant at the surface, and use only enough weight to minimise the effort required to swim down against the buoyancy {{at the start of a}} dive, while retaining sufficient buoyancy at maximum depth to not require too much effort to swim back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the buoyancy becomes positive again. As a corollary to this practice, freedivers will use as thin a wetsuit as comfortably possible, to minimise buoyancy changes with depth due to suit compression.|$|E

500|$|In Kemper County, a 3,000ft2 (280m2) mini-mart {{was damaged}} beyond repair. Eleven people sought refuge inside the building's {{bathroom}} when the tornado struck; all escaped without injuries. Along the Kemper-Winston County kine, EF5 damage occurred as extremely deep ground scouring took place again and asphalt was ripped from roads. On Green Road, a double-wide mobile home, {{anchored to the}} ground, was lofted [...] and obliterated when it landed in a nearby tree line; debris from the home was scattered hundreds of yards farther. The survey team {{found no evidence of}} it having bounced or rolled from where it was picked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> it impacted the tree line. All three occupants were killed, the sole fatalities from this tornado. Nearby, the tornado weakened to EF3 strength as two brick homes were destroyed with barely any interior walls left standing; two people sustained serious injuries. A well-built frame wood home was nearly swept clean off its foundation and two trailers were destroyed. Cars were hurled hundreds of yards, often bouncing along the way, and some were rendered almost unrecognizable and were wrapped around trees. Continuing through southeastern Winston County, the tornado weakened slightly to EF2 strength but continued to produce extensive tree and property damage. As it crossed Central McDonald Road, it destroyed a single-wide mobile home and leveled a nearby grove of pine trees.|$|E

500|$|On 26 January 2009, Rehman {{signed a}} loan deal with League Two club Bradford City, {{which was to}} last {{until the end of}} the 2008–09 season. Rehman had turned down a chance to move to Luton Town and team up with Mick Harford, who was {{previously}} the assistant manager at QPR, and said he was only prepared to drop down to League Two if he joined Bradford City. Rehman said of the move, [...] "I was only prepared to drop down the leagues to play for this club. I spoke to the manager and chairmen and I know they want to get Bradford back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they belong. I've been involved in relegation battles in the past and it's nice to be joining a club pushing for promotion – that's a good pressure to have." [...] He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat to Bury at Gigg Lane, and in doing so became the first British Asian to play in all four divisions of professional football in England. He made his home debut on 31 January, playing at right back, in a 2–0 home win over Grimsby Town at Valley Parade. In March he turned down the chance to play for Pakistan in the Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup qualifiers in order to help Bradford's push for promotion.|$|E
500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi {{received}} a 64 out of 100 (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") on Metacritic, a website that averages professional reviews from critics into a numerical score. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album a [...] "highly crafted piece of dance-pop" [...] and [...] "relative comeback" [...] for Carey, {{although it is}} not as [...] "catchy" [...] as he thought it should have been. Erlewine voiced a common criticism of the album: that Carey's voice seemed [...] "damaged" [...] in comparison to her [...] "glory years" [...] in the 1990s. He commented that in the belted songs such as [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] and [...] "I Wish You Knew", Carey's voice sounded [...] "as airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet". Michael Paoletta from Billboard was less critical of her vocals, writing that [...] "while her voice has lost some of the power through the years, Mimi deftly showcases her still-considerable pipes with strong lyrics and slick production." [...] Paoletta praised The Emancipation of Mimi as Carey's best album since Butterfly (1997). Michael Dougall Bell from the Calgary Sun called Carey's voice [...] "very impressive". He concluded: [...] "While Emancipation may not send Carey's stock or star back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> it once was and where that voice deserves to be, at least she's not plummeting – she's merely levelled off." [...] Entertainment Weekly editor Tom Sinclair noted that almost every song [...] "showcases Carey's undeniable vocal strengths". Reviewing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Sinclair concluded, [...] "It's so moving that we'll resist the temptation to be crass and interpret the song as a plea for heightened record sales. Help from above is always welcome, but Emancipation sounds like it just might do fine all on its own." ...|$|E

2500|$|A major {{technical}} issue {{was that of}} frame rate.

According to Bruty, [...] "We {{had no idea how}} fast we could get the engine when we started. The game would run too slow if we textured everything, so some parts were just flat-shaded for speed. We did our best to make that look like a design choice, or shadows, but it was a tricky balance." ...|$|E

[...] "I was helping them myself, because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm." [...] The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached into his pocket and raised a gold coin.
