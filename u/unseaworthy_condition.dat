Orsborne had mentioned to him the possibility of engaging in profitable activities such as gun-running and smuggling. John Moore, the managing director of Marstrand's, stated that he had expected Orsborne to take Girl Pat fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully. When Moore was cross-examined, the defence's [...] "serious allegations" [...] were revealed. It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing, but {{to get rid of the}} vessel so that the company could claim its insurance value, of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share. The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, and he had never discussed insured values with Orsborne. The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>condition,</b> inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore.|$|E

500|$|In 1936–1937, {{the fleet}} was {{significantly}} {{strengthened by the}} acquisition of three [...] Beograd-class destroyers, the French-built Beograd, and the locally-built Zagreb and Ljubljana. Naval communication via teletype was established to connect Naval Command in Zemun with bases at Selce, Split, Šibenik and Novi Sad. Split was also connected to Divulje, and Đenovići was connected with the Tivat Arsenal. In 1937, the Naval Command was renamed the Naval Staff, and a Naval Staff College was established at Dubrovnik.

50|$|In 1936, eight German-built Orjen-class MTBs were added. Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was {{established}} {{under the command}} of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at Selce, Šibenik and Đenovići. By the end of that year, the KJRM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht Lada had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper D2. The training ship Sitnica had been converted into a second submarine depot ship, and the Galeb-class mine tenders had been reclassified as minelayers. The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht Dragor, two patrol boats—Graničar and Stražar, and three river tugs; Cer, Triglav and Avala. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were Dubrovnik and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attaché observed that the morale and discipline of the navy was very good. He further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was in very good condition considering its funding. During 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited Corfu, and Zmaj and three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu.In 1936-1937, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three 1240 LT Beograd-class destroyers, the French-built Beograd, and the locally-built Zagreb and Ljubljana.

Stribling, commanding the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, advised that Wanderer not be sent north for disposal because of her <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>condition.</b> She was sold at public auction on 28 June 1865 at Key West by A. Patterson to Packer and Watson. She subsequently entered the banana trade and operated in mercantile service until lost off Cape Maisí, Cuba, on 21 January 1871.|$|E

50|$|In 1946 she was acquired, in an <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>condition,</b> as a {{training}} ship by the Jewish Marine League. The League had been founded in 1934 {{with the aim}} of training boys for a future Israeli merchant marine. The original intention was to call her Tarshish, but a decision was taken to name her after Joseph Hertz 1872-1946, Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth 1913-1946. To raise funds for the enterprise, the League held a concert of Jewish Music at the Royal Albert Hall on 5 February 1946 with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Anatole Fistoulari.|$|E
50|$|A famous real-life marooning, {{only partly}} for punishment, {{was leaving the}} sailor Alexander Selkirk on Juan Fernández Island {{off the coast of}} Chile, in the Pacific Ocean. Selkirk, a sailor with the Dampier expedition, was worried about the <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>condition</b> of his ship, the Cinque Ports, and had argued with the captain until he left him ashore on the island where they had briefly stopped for water and food supplies. The Cinque Ports later sank with the loss of most of her crew. Selkirk was not rescued until four years later, by Woodes Rogers. Selkirk's travails {{provided}} the inspiration for Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe. Today, one of the islands on the Chilean coast is named Alejandro Selkirk Island and another one Robinson Crusoe Island.|$|E
5000|$|Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Whitehall sailed for Port Royal, South Carolina; but her <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>condition</b> {{prevented}} her {{completing the}} voyage south. She put into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in early November for emergency repairs and stopped again at Hampton Roads {{for the same}} purpose a few days later. Whitehall left Newport News, Virginia, for Port Royal on 5 November—only to be forced back to Hampton Roads by high seas on 6 November. On 7 November, carpenters examining Whitehall declared her unseaworthy. Nevertheless, she was badly needed at Port Royal and proceeded south towed by [...] on 12 November 1861. Again Whitehall turned back, reentering Hampton Roads on 13 November 1861. That same day, she was ordered to Baltimore, Maryland, for an extensive overhaul.|$|E
5000|$|The Governments of Puerto Rico, the United States, {{and other}} groups, sued {{the owners of}} the two vessels for clean up costs and natural {{resource}} damages. Criminal prosecutions were brought against {{the owners of the}} two vessels due to issues of crew negligence and the act of knowingly sending a vessel to sea in an <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>condition.</b> The three owners of the barge were charged with criminal negligence based on laws from the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. One of the barge managers and the captain and first mate of the 'Emily S' were also charged with felonies for violations of the Clean Water Act. [...] The court case was officially settled on January 19. The Governments of Puerto Rico and the United States were paid a total of $83.5 million from Metlife Capital Corp, Water Quality Insurance Syndicate and Caribbean Petroleum Corporation. The cargo that was spilled from the Berman was owned by the Caribbean Petroleum Corporation.|$|E
