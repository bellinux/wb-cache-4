For this and for reasons of animal welfare, animals should in general be transported to the facility about 1  week before the experiment. Regarding their housing, an enriched environment not only is less stressful to the animals than an <b>unenriched</b> <b>cage</b> but may also give more reproducible results [13]. Enrichment refers mainly to refugees and bedding and nesting material. Bored animals in an <b>unenriched</b> <b>cage</b> often develop stereotypic behaviour. This is repetitive activities at short intervals, and it would come as a surprise if neurotransmitter signalling—the target of most neuroimaging projects—would not be affected in one or the other way in bored animals and animals with stereotypic behaviour. In fact, housing in isolation affects the cognitive function of an animal and is even used as a model of depression in research [14, 15]. According to the animal welfare legislation, the isolated housing of an animal must be avoided if it is not required for a defined reason. However, mixing animals from different cages or any stressful event can result in harmful hierarchy fights, in particular, between males, again, potentially influencing an imaging experiment. The animals should thus be housed in stable groups in enriched cages, taking into account the minimal space requirements for their well-being. The required minimal available space per animal and maximal number of animals per cage are defined in national and European Union (EU) regulations and guidelines. Appendix A (Guidelines for accommodation and care of animals—Article 5 of the convention) to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (ETS No 123) contains tables with information of minimal floor area and cage height besides many more useful information regarding animal housing and animal welfare in general. Using larger cages than the recommended minimal size allows more and diverse enrichment and finally better imitating the natural environment of the animals.|$|E

In this bachelor's thesis is described historical development of housing systems of laying hens, animal welfare and the European Council Directive 74 / 1999 of 19 July 1999 that prohibited housing of laying hens in conventional <b>unenriched</b> <b>cages</b> for all member states of the European Union. This law came into force in 1 st January 2012. Thesis is focused on overall impact of the production of eggs for consumption in selected states of the European Union. In this thesis there is described the production of eggs from the global perspective and the perspective of Czech Republic. Foreign trade of eggs is also described there {{from the perspective of}} the European Union and the Czech Republic...|$|R

Those {{in a more}} positive state interpret such stimuli in a more optimistic manner than those in a negative state. Recently this research has extended to animals, and has shown that manipulations associated with negative affect cause animals to interpret ambiguous stimuli more pessimistically. We investigated whether exposure to environmental enrichment engenders optimistic responses to ambiguous stimuli. Rats, Rattus norvegicus, were trained on a novel conditional discrimination task whereby they learned the correct response necessary to obtain a food reward given the stimulus present during approach (rough or smooth sandpaper). One stimulus {{was associated with a}} higher-value reward than the other. Once the rats were trained, cognitive bias was probed by exploring their responses to an ambiguous stimulus (intermediate grade of sandpaper); a rat was defined as optimistic if it chose the response appropriate to the stimulus associated with the better reward. Animals transferred from <b>unenriched</b> to enriched <b>cages</b> showed more optimistic responses following the change. A control group maintained in <b>unenriched</b> <b>cages</b> showed pessimistic responses throughout. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} environmental enrichment can induce an optimistic cognitive bias in rats previously housed in standard caging, possibly indicative of a more positive affective state. These results add support to the suggestion that measuring cognitive biases can give an insight into animal emotional states; this has implications for animal welfare and preclinical testing of potential therapeutics for mood disorders...|$|R
40|$|The single housing of {{laboratory}} rats may be recommended {{in some situations}} such as hypothesis-driven or test-specific studies, during electroencephalogram recording of phases of sleep and after surgical procedures. However, as single housing {{of laboratory}} rats {{has been shown to}} be stressful, modification of the housing environment is needed to improve the welfare of these animals. This experiment was carried out to investigate the long-term effects of environmental enrichment on some behavioural, physiological, pathological and psychological measures of welfare. With two batches of animals, 24 rats were housed singly in either enriched cages (EC) (n 12 <b>cages)</b> or <b>unenriched</b> <b>cages</b> (UC) (n 12 cages). Behaviour was sampled every week and so was body weight and weight gain over a six-week observation period. Behaviours of the rats in the elevated plus-maze were recorded on the seventh week, whereas organ weights were recorded postmortem. The results revealed that long-term single housing of rats in super-enriched cages increased levels of indicators of good welfare including sleep, exploration, movement and feeding behaviour, body weights, weight gains and the relative weights of the thymus gland and spleen, and decreased levels of indicators of poor welfare such as stationary behaviour and the relative weight of adrenal glands. Thus, enrichment of conventional cages of newly weaned singly-housed laboratory rats with multiple physical structures appeared to improve their ability to control the environment and to promote their species-specific behaviour...|$|R
