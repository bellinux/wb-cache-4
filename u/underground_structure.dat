The Comtesse is about to tell them crucial information about Echsenfriedl, but then cannibalizing undead striking miners invade the room and kill her before she gets the chance to reveal the truth.|$|E

500|$|The walls {{enclosed}} {{many buildings}} {{related to the}} temple's function. Some enclosures contain satellite chapels dedicated to deities associated with the temple god, including mammisis celebrating {{the birth of the}} god's mythological child. The sacred lakes found in many temple enclosures served as reservoirs for the water used in rituals, as places for the priests to ritually cleanse themselves, and as representations of the water from which the world emerged. Mortuary temples sometimes contain a palace for the spirit of the king to whom the temple was dedicated, built against the temple building proper. The temple of Seti I at Abydos incorporates an unusual <b>underground</b> <b>structure,</b> the Osireion, which may have served as a symbolic tomb for the king. Sanatoria in some temples provided a place for the sick to await healing dreams sent by the god. Other temple buildings included kitchens, workshops, and storehouses to supply the temple's needs. Especially important was the pr-ˁnḫ or [...] "house of life", where the temple edited, copied, and stored its religious texts, including those used for temple rituals. The house of life also functioned as a general center of learning, containing works on non-religious subjects such as history, geography, astronomy, and medicine. Although these outlying buildings were devoted to more mundane purposes than the temple itself, they still had religious significance; even granaries might be used for specific ceremonies.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{methods are}} {{regarded}} {{as a tool for}} design of tunnel. Empirical methods have been extensively used in rock mass classification. In most of the projects, the rock mass classification is being considered as the only criteria for designing the complex <b>underground</b> <b>structures.</b> Based on the recorded information, the <b>underground</b> <b>structures</b> enjoy higher level of safety against dynamic waves compared to surface structures. Previously, the seismic design of <b>underground</b> <b>structures</b> have paid less attention than that of surface <b>structures,</b> while designing <b>underground</b> <b>structures</b> without considering seismic loads would result in an unsafe structure. Taking into account the seismic effect in rock mass classification is a new topic which has been addressed in this paper. Moreover, it has been attempted to investigate the seismic effect in the Q-system using numerical analysis. Firstly, the effect of joint sets on seismicity of the tunnel is studied and analyzed in static and pseudo-static states. Then, the results obtained from this analysis are compared and counterbalanced with the results of Q-system. After comparing and analyzing the results, a relationship has been proposed for the effects of seismic behavior in Q-system. The solved examples give reasonable and acceptable results. 1...|$|R
