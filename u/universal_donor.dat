First, it preserves the lower stock of O- blood and secondly, this eliminates the risk of O- negative mothers forming anti-D (Rh) antibodies from exposure to O+ blood.

Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for xenotransfusions. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the <b>universal</b> <b>donor),</b> their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring.

50|$|The most {{important}} canine blood type is DEA 1.1.

If it is the dog's first transfusion the red cells transfused will have a shortened life due to the formation of alloantibodies to the cells themselves and the animal will forever be sensitized to DEA 1.1 positive blood. If it is a second such transfusion, life-threatening conditions will follow within hours. In addition, these alloantibodies will be present in a female dog's milk (colostrum) and adversely affect the health of DEA 1.1 negative puppies.|$|R

However, currently it is a recommended policy to transfuse plasma derived from male donors only as transfusion of plasma from HLA antibody-positive female donors is {{associated with an increased}} risk for transfusion-related acute lung injury. As a result, due to high demands, supplies of blood banks may run out of AB plasma, calling for alternatives. Therefore, the aim of this review was to investigate alternatives for emergency release of AB plasma as the <b>universal</b> <b>donor.</b> A systematic search was conducted in Embase and PubMed. Studies on adult patients, who were transfused with at least 1 unit of plasma, investigating the incidence of transfusion-related complications or mortality in patients transfused with ABO-identical, ABO-compatible, or ABO-incompatible plasma were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were the incidence of transfusion-related complications and mortality. In total six studies were included. Transfusion of ABO-compatible plasma was associated with an increased incidence of lung injury and mortality (odds ratio, 1. 10; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 - 1. 15; p[*]=[*] 0. 0003) compared to transfusion of ABO-identical plasma. No significant differences were observed regarding transfusion-related complications and mortality between patients transfused with ABO-compatible or ABO-incompatible plasma.

Consideration of these facts stimulated the authors to make observations on planned hemolytic reactions in dogs with the hope that the results might find general application in the field of immuno-hematology, and that they might throw light on the behavior of the kidney when subjected to certain types of insult. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe preliminary serologic and hematologic observations on reactions produced in dogs by transfusion of incompatible whole blood and plasma.

40|$|Allelic {{differences}} {{at any one}} of {{at least}} 11 heterokaryon incompatibility (het) loci in Neurospora crassa trigger an incompatibility response: localized cell death at sites of hyphal anastomosis. We have isolated spontaneous and insertional suppressor mutants that are heterokaryon-compatible in spite of allelic differences at one or at several het loci. Some intra- and extragenic mutants tolerated allelic differences only at single het loci. Multi-tolerant spontaneous mutants were isolated by selecting simultaneously for tolerance of differences at het-c, -d and -e, or at each of these plus mating-type. Some suppressor mutants were specific for only one allele at the affected het locus; others suppressed both alleles. Insertional mutations were isolated from banks of transformants, each having a plasmid integrated into a random position in the chromosome. One mutant tolerated allelic differences at het-d. A homologous cosmid from a Neurospora genomic bank complemented the mutant phenotype. A second insertional inactivation mutant was tolerant of het-c differences. Inactivation of the wild-type locus corresponding to the integration site was accomplished by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). The RIP progeny, like the original mutant, were tolerant of differences at het-c.

However, sometimes even the <b>universal</b> <b>donor</b> can cause transfusion reactions {{that can be}} fatal to the patient. As commercial systems do not allow fast results and are not suitable for emergency situations, this paper presents the steps considered for the development and validation of a prototype, able to determine blood type compatibilities, even in emergency situations. Thus it is possible, using the developed system, to administer a compatible blood type, since the first blood unit transfused. In order to increase the system’s reliability, this prototype uses different approaches to classify blood types, {{the first of which}} is based on Decision Trees and the second one based on support vector machines. The features used to evaluate these classifiers are the standard deviation values, histogram, Histogram of Oriented Gradients and fast Fourier transform, computed on different regions of interest. The main characteristics of the presented prototype are small size, lightweight, easy transportation, ease of use, fast results, high reliability and low cost.

Furthermore, for some women, the anti D injection does not provide the entire solution, particularly where there is a medical history of complications during pregnancy which risk the woman's blood and that of the fetus becoming mixed. In such cases, sperm from a rhesus negative donor can provide the solution and a woman may be able to conceive and carry a pregnancy to full term when otherwise this would not be possible.
