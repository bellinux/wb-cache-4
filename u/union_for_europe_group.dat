50|$|Following {{its first}} European {{election}} in 1994, Forza Italia MEPs formed {{their own political}} group in the European Parliament called Forza Europa. In 1995, Forza Europa merged with the European Democratic Alliance to form the <b>Union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>group</b> alongside the Rally for the Republic of France and Fianna Fáil of Ireland. Following an abandoned attempt to form a European political party with Rally for the Republic in 1997, on 10 June 1998 Forza Italia was accepted into the Group of the European People's Party. In December 1999 Forza Italia was finally granted full membership of the European People's Party (EPP).|$|E

In 1995, the party - under the more Eurosceptic leadership of Manuel Monteiro - was kicked out of the EPP; it left the EUCD and joined the <b>Union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>group</b> in the European Parliament. [...] In 2003, the party joined the European Democrats component of the European People's Party-European Democrats (EPP-ED) group. In 2006, it left the European Democrats - now collapsing due to the formation of the Movement for European Reform - to join the EPP group proper.|$|E

25|$|In the European Parliament from 1999 to 2009, Fianna Fáil was {{a leading}} member of <b>Union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> of the Nations (UEN), a small national-conservative and Eurosceptic {{parliamentary}} group. European political commentators had often noted substantive ideological differences between the party and its colleagues, whose strongly conservative stances had at times prompted domestic criticism of Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil MEPs had been an attached to the European Progressive Democrats (1973–1984), European Democratic Alliance (1984–1995), and <b>Union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> (1995–1999) <b>groups</b> before the creation of UEN.|$|R
50|$|The party {{used to have}} a pro-EU line, but {{switched}} under Monteiro, becoming mildly eurosceptic, including {{opposing the}} Maastricht Treaty, with this change of tack credited for ending the party's decline. As a result of the change, the European People's Party (EPP) expelled the CDS-PP from the EPP Group in the European parliament, with the CDS-PP joining the <b>Union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> (UfE) <b>group</b> instead. Monteiro's successor, Paulo Portas, continued the CDS-PP's Eurosceptic line, but rejoined the EPP.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 {{the group}} was reconstituted as <b>Union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> of the Nations - European Alliance (UEN-EA), uniting {{a wide range of}} {{political}} options, from traditionally centrist parties to more national-conservative ones.

40|$|The {{notion of}} a European Monetary Union can be {{interpreted}} in different ways. To most non-economists it probably implies a single European currency and a European central bank. To economists, however, a monetary union implies only (in {{the words of the}} 1970 Werner Plan) : 'the irrevocable fixing of parities and the total liberalization of capital movements'. To others still a monetary union might be reached if there is a widely used European parallel currency. This article argues that these paradigms imply different degrees of monetary integration, and that the benefits that can be expected from a monetary <b>union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> depend on the degree of monetary integration. Which paradigm should be chosen, therefore, depends on the reasons for which a monetary <b>union</b> <b>for</b> <b>Europe</b> is deemed desirable. Copyright 1989 BPL. ...|$|R
