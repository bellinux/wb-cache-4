50|$|Both {{domestic}} and wild carrot {{are from the}} same species, Daucus carota L. There are several subspecies of Daucus carota that have evolved to different climates and atmospheres. Two examples of these subspecies are specifically from the Netherlands. D. carota subsp. sativus has roots {{that can be a}} wide range of colors. It has a thicker root and sweeter taste. The whorl of barbs above the spine on the vallecular ridges of the mericarp of D. carota subsp. sativus mature very well. D. carota subsp. carota has white roots that do not vary in color and, unlike D. carota subsp. sativus, have a thin root, bitter taste and are not edible. The middle <b>umbellet</b> of D. carota subsp. carota is not well developed (unlike D. carota subsp. sativus) and the color of the flower can vary from red to deep purple.|$|E
30|$|Analysis of {{variance}} showed that nitroxin had {{significant effect on}} the number of umbel per plant and number of <b>umbellet</b> per umbel (Table  2).|$|E
30|$|The {{first factor}} was the {{concentrations}} of nitroxin biofertilizer (0 %, 50 %, and 100 %) of the recommended amount (1  l of biological fertilizer for 30  kg of seed). The second factor was the following chemical fertilizer treatments: no fertilizer (control) and 50 and 100  kg ha− 1 urea along with 300  kg ha− 1 ammonium phosphate. Different characteristics such as plant height, number of umbel per plant, number of <b>umbellet</b> per umbel, number of grain per <b>umbellet,</b> 1, 000 seed weight, grain yield, biological yield, and oil percentage were recorded. According to the results, the highest height, biological yield, and grain yield components (except harvest index) were obtained on biological fertilizer. The results showed the highest essential oil content detected in biological fertilizer and chemical fertilizer. Identification of essential oil composition showed that the content of carvone increased with the application of biofertilizers and chemical fertilizers. The {{results indicated that the}} application of biofertilizers enhanced yield and other plant criteria in this plant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} was aimed to determine relationships between seed yield and some yield components of 20 sweet fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. var dulce) lines. The highest positive correlation (r= 0. 915) was recorded between biological yield and single plant yield. Plant height, number of branches, number of umbels and <b>umbellets</b> {{had a positive}} effect on single plant yield. One thousand seed weight was negatively correlated with essential oil percentage. The highest positive and direct effect on seed yield was shown by number of <b>umbellets,</b> while maximum negative and direct contribution to it was made by biological yield. In addition, single plant yield, plant height and one thousand seed weight affected seed yield positively. Single plant yield had maximum direct effect (32. 95 %) on essential oil percentage followed by plant height (24. 60 %) and number of branches (15. 11 %). In conclusion, it could be suggested that single plant yield, number of <b>umbellets</b> and plant height are good phenotypic selection criteria to improve seed yield and essential oil percentage of sweet fennel...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Twenty-five {{coriander}} (Coriandrum sativum L.) genotypes {{were evaluated}} {{to estimate the}} correlation coefficient and path analysis in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. Seed yield per plant exhibited positive and significant correlation with plant height, plant spread, fresh and dry weight of plant, days to 50 per cent flowering, number of umbels per plant, number of seeds per <b>umbellet,</b> days to seed maturity and harvest index. The perusal of path analysis revealed that the traits viz., dry weight of plant and harvest index had higher direct and positive contribution towards seed yield. Therefore, great emphasis should be given for aforesaid characters while selecting for growth and yield related traits. Key words: correlation coefficient, path analysis, coriander genotypes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Fertilizers {{are the key}} {{components}} which provide plant nutrients' needs in recent years (Omid Jangir & Sing, 1996; Kapoor et al., 2007). In many cases, using chemical fertilizers has different negative environmental effects such as soil, water and air pollution, which increase environmental hazardous and production costs (Jangir & Sing, 1996; Kapoor et al., 2007). Biological activities are markedly enhanced by microbial interactions in the rhizosphere of plants (Kapoor et al., 2007). Many investigators have successfully used mycorrhiza to increase the availability of immobilized phosphate and thus minimize the use of mineral fertilizers. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) can better enable a plant to withstand environmental stresses such as drought and salinity. AMF interacts with pathogens and other rhizosphere inhabitants which affect plant health and nutrition. More importantly, mycorrhizal fungi are capable of dissolving weakly soluble soil minerals, especially phosphate, by releasing acids or increasing CO 2 partial pressure (Gupta et al., 2002; Gosling et al., 2006; Kapoor et al., 2007). Therefore, {{they have the ability}} to enhance host plant uptake of relatively immobile nutrients particularly P, S and Zn. Limited water supply is also another major environmental constraint in the productivity of crop and medicinal plants. Moisture deficiency induces various physiological and metabolic responses such as stomatal closure, decline in growth rate and photosynthesis (Flexas and Medrano, 2002). The results of Baher et al. (2002) showed that greater soil water stress decreased plant height and total fresh and dry weight of Satureja hortensis. Materials and Methods In order to study the effects of mycorrhiza inoculation and different irrigation levels on the growth, quantitative and qualitative yield of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) and ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi L.), a field experiment was conducted as factorial based on randomized complete block design with three replications at the Agricultural Research Station, the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran during two growing seasons of 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011. Mycorrhiza inoculation (with and without inoculation) and irrigation levels (1000, 2000 and 3000 m 3. ha- 1) were allocated to the first and the second factors, respectively. Several criteria such as yield components (including branch numbers per plant, umbel number per branch, <b>umbellet</b> number per umbel, seed number per <b>umbellet</b> and 1000 -seed weight), biological yield, seed yield, harvest index, essential oil content and essential oil yield of fennel and ajwain were measured. Results and Discussion Results indicated that the simple effects of mycorrhiza inoculation and irrigation levels on the biological and seed yields, harvest index (HI), yield components, essential oil content and essential oil yield of fennel and ajwain were significant (p≤ 0. 01). The maximum biological yield of fennel (5. 3 g. m- 2) and ajwain (4. 3 g. m- 2) were observed in mycorrhiza inoculation.

40|$|In Daucus carota L. (Apiaceae) the florets {{comprising}} the central <b>umbellet</b> of inflorescences are usually pink or dark purple, presenting a {{marked contrast to}} the surrounding umbellets, which are generally white. The number of dark florets varies, and some inflorescences have no dark florets. It has been proposed that the dark florets function as an insect mimic, {{and in so doing}} serve to attract insects to the flower. In contrast, other authors, Darwin included, suggest that they are functionally redundant. The present study examined whether the dark florets attract insects, and also whether this effect can be replicated by replacing these florets with an insect. At the study site in Portugal the predominant insect visitor was the beetle Anthrenus verbasci L. (Dermestidae), which is similar in size and shape to the dark florets. Large inflorescences and those with more dark florets attracted more beetles than small inflorescences and those with fewer or no dark florets. Inflorescences with the dark florets removed attracted fewer beetles visitors compared with intact inflorescences. Inflorescences in which the dark florets were replaced with one or a cluster of five dead, freeze-killed A. verbasci attracted more beetles than inflorescences from which the dark florets had been removed. Replacement of the dark florets with a relatively large Meloid beetle resulted in the attraction of markedly fewer A. verbasci. We conclude that the dark florets can act as an insect attractant for some insect groups by acting as an insect mimic, and that they are adaptive, in contrast to the speculations of Darwin. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology...|$|E
50|$|Ranger's buttons {{plants are}} {{quite similar to}} the other large Umbelliferae that share similar habitats: Sierra {{angelica}} and cow parsnip, but each has a very differently shaped leaf, {{and the other two}} have <b>umbellets</b> with quite distinct flowers, in contrast to the tight balls on ranger's buttons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is a whitish compound umbel {{with many}} branches each up to 10 centimeters long. The nearly spherical, headlike terminal <b>umbellets</b> contain many tiny white or purple-tinged flowers, whose protruding stamens make them appear very fuzzy in full bloom, {{as for the}} central umbels in the top right image.|$|R
5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (<b>umbellets).</b> The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 <b>umbellets,</b> each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of mycorrhiza symbiosis and different nitrogen levels on yield, yield components and essential oil content and yield of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) and ajowan (Carum copticum L.), a field experiment was arranged in a factoriel based on a randomized complete block design with three replications at the Agricultural Research Station, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad during growing season 2009 - 2010. The first and the second factors were inoculation with mycorrhiza (with and without inoculation) and nitrogen levels as Urea (0, 50 and 100 kg. ha- 1), respectively. Inculated soil with 200 g mycorrhiza (Glomus intraradaices) was applied at planting time. Urea was used in two stages such as plating time and one month after that. Ceriteria such as yield components (including number of branch, umbel, <b>umbellet,</b> seed and seed weight), biological and seed yield, harvest index and essential oil content and yield of fennel and ajowan were measured. Results showed that yield components, seed yield, biological yield, harvest index, essential oil content and yield of fennel and ajowan were affected by mycorrhiza and nitrogen level. Mycorrhiza increased fennel and ajowan seed yield (with 35 and 85 %, respectively) and essential oil content (with 34 and 30 %, respectively). The highest and the lowest 1000 -seed weight of fennel and ajowan obsevered in inoculation (2. 9 and 0. 3 g) and control (2. 1 and 0. 2 g), respectively. Nitrogen improved all growth characteristics and decreased essential oil content. There were not significant differences between mycorrhiza and nitrogen interaction. Inoculation with mycorrhiza enhanced root development and hence availability of nutrients, particularly phosphorus. Also, nitrogen {{is the cause of}} increasement of photosynthesis rate and duration which promote growth and yield, but it declined essential oil content of two species...|$|E
5000|$|An umbel is an {{inflorescence}} {{which consists}} {{of a number of}} short flower stalks (called pedicels) which spread from a common point, somewhat like umbrella ribs. The word was coined in botany in the 1590s, from Latin umbella [...] "parasol, sunshade." [...] The arrangement can vary from being flat topped to almost spherical. Umbels can be simple or compound. The secondary umbels of compound umbels are known as umbellules or <b>umbellets.</b> A small umbel is called an umbellule. The arrangement of the inflorescence in umbels is referred to as umbellate, or occasionally subumbellate (almost umbellate).|$|R
50|$|The stems {{terminate}} into compound umbels {{of small}} white flowers, {{each of which}} spans about 2 - 4 in across and comprises about 8 <b>umbellets,</b> themselves each composed of some 16 flowers. The entire inflorescence is bractless, although a small sessile leaf may occur near the base of it. Flowers are about 1/8 in across and consist of 5 white petals, 5 stamens, 2 styles, and an ovary. The blooming period occurs during late summer to early fall and lasts about a month. There is no noticeable floral scent. Each seed is contained in a fruit {{of the same size}} as the original flower that is somewhat flattened, egg-shaped, and slightly notched at its apex.|$|R
50|$|Chaerophyllum procumbens is 15 to 50 centimeters tall. Several slender {{branching}} stems {{emerge from}} the base of the plant. The stems are shiny, but have a line of fine hairs running up them. The mostly hairless triangular compound leaves are doubly pinnate, with leaflets that are themselves pinnatifid. The lower leaves are borne on petioles, the upper leaves are smaller and nearly sessile. The upper stems terminate in compound umbels consisting of approximately 2 to 6 <b>umbellets,</b> each with 1 to 7 small white flowers with 5 petals. The flowers often bloom before the umbels have fully expanded. The fruit is an oblong capsule, 4 to 6 millimeters long, with longitudinal ridges.|$|R
50|$|The parsnip is a {{biennial}} {{plant with}} a rosette of roughly hairy leaves {{that has a}} pungent odor when crushed. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible, cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage. The plant's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to 40 cm long.The petioles are grooved and have sheathed bases. The floral stem develops {{in the second year}} and can grow to more than 150 cm tall. It is hairy, grooved, hollow (except at the nodes), and sparsely branched. It has a few stalkless, single-lobed leaves measuring 5 to 10 cm long that are arranged in opposite pairs. The yellow flowers are in a loose, compound umbel measuring 10 to 20 cm in diameter. Six to 25 straight pedicels are present, each measuring 2 to 5 cm that support the <b>umbellets</b> (secondary umbels). The umbels and <b>umbellets</b> usually have no upper or lower bracts. The flowers have tiny sepals or lack them entirely, and measure about 3.5 mm. They consist of five yellow petals that are curled inward, five stamens, and one pistil. The fruits, or schizocarps, are oval and flat, with narrow wings and short, spreading styles. They are colored straw to light brown, and measure 4 to 8 mm long.|$|R
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer <b>umbellets</b> of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of organic fertilizer on yield of anise, an experiment was conducted in the form of split-plot in randomized complete block design with three replications in Mashhad, Khorasan Agriculture and Natural Resource Research Center. Four treatments of fertilization: the control, vermicompost - 5 t/ha, cow manure - 25 t/ha, and mineral fertilizer (NPK) - 60 kg/ha (the same rate of each nutrient) were applied as the main factor. The second factor was plant density, applied at three levels: 17, 25, and 50 plants/m 2. The results showed a significant effect of fertilizer on the number of umbels per plant, number of <b>umbellets</b> per umbel and canopy cover. Plant density had a significant effect on grain yield, biological yield, the number of lateral branches, essential oil percentage and yield of essential oil.

The plant is glabrous, or smooth, without hairs, and is rarely greater than 16 inches tall. It is taprooted, with the caudex usually located about 1 to 2 inches below the ground surface. Its yellow flowers {{are small and}} compact. Inflorescences have from 5 to 14 <b>umbellets.</b> Fruits are oblong, to inch long, with thickened outer margins known as wings. Identification Tips: Lomatium bradshawii is most easily identified by the involucels (small bracts beneath the inflorescence) that are 3 cleft to the middle with the lobes often cleft again and by the corky-thickened wings on the fruit. L. utriculatum, which occurs {{within the range of}} L. bradshawii, has shallowly cleft involucels and thin winged fruit. Lomatium bradshawii appears to be most closely related to Lomatium cookii of the Rogue River and Illinois River valleys in southwestern Oregon. Phenology: The peak blooming period occurs from the last week of April through the first week of May, with few plants still blooming in early June. Fruit is present on plants from mid-May to early July, and is shed at maturity. Range: Endemic to the southern portion of western Washington in the Puget Trough physiographic province and to the central and southern portions of the Willamette Valley physiographic province in western Oregon. Habitat: The species occurs in remnant fragments of the once widespread low elevation grasslands and prairies. The habitat type is described as wet, seasonally flooded prairies and grasslands common around creeks and small rivers.

Identification Tips: Lomatium serpentinum is most closely related to L. halli. These species are most easily distinguishable by their stems: L. serpentinum is stemless, and L. halli has an obviously leafy stem. Phenology: Flowers from April through July. Range: A regional endemic, this species grows along the Snake River and its tributaries in western Idaho, eastern Oregon, and southeastern Washington in Columbia, Grant, and Asotin counties. Historically, it has been found in Walla Walla and Whitman counties, also in Washington. Habitat: This species is found at lower elevations just above river level growing in moderately deep sandy or rocky soil. It grows mostly within rock crevices or clefts on open moderate to steep slopes. Sites in Washington are located in shady areas on old flood plains, atop granite outcrops, on basaltic ledges along rapids, and on basalt talus. It is usually found in sparsely vegetated areas with no overstory. Associated species include blue-bunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum) and Sandberg’s bluegrass (Poa sandbergii).
