40|$|For the {{investigation}} of moisture movement in the mineral layer of a two component liner system for waste disposal under natural conditions, a testfield (18 m by 12 m) was built and a measuring program was carried out for more than 2 1 / 2 years. The test field consists of a 1 m thick mineral layer, covered by a PEHD-membrane (2. 5 mm). The 'natural' heat of a waste disposal was simulated by an electrical floor heating system, placed {{on top of the}} geomembrane. <b>Undermeath</b> one half of the testfield, a drainage layer (2 / 32 mm, thickness 0. 3 m) was placed in order to simulate a previous subsoil; the ofther half of the testfield was built directly onto the natural silty subsoil (Loess). For the observation of the physical processes in the liner and in the foundation, the following equipment was provided: 52 temperature sensors, 30 tensiometers, 10 gas pressure sensors and 4 measuring tubes for a neutron probe system. During the entire period, the top of the liner was heated to a temperature of 40 C. The temperature in a depth of 2 m increased from 12 C (in the beginning) to 30 C. In the portion of the testfield placed on the drainage layer, a substantial increase of suction in the mineral layer was measured in a very early period of the test. After a duration of 2 1 / 2 years, a decrease of water content of 11 Vol. -% (7 % by weight) was observed. In {{the other half of the}} testfield a decrease of water content was not measurable by means of the neutron probe system. However, a pronounced increase of suction was observed with teh tensiometers; this indicates a slow, constant decrease of soil moisture. The consequence of the desiccation of the mineral liner on the drainage layer is as follows: A subsoil of low permeability is necessary in order to reduce the desiccation in the mineral liner as much as possible and installations of previous layers in contact with clay liners (say for control or drainage purposes) should strictly be avoided. The question as to wether a low permeability foundation can prevent desiccation in a clay liner and the risk of shrinkage under long term conditions needs further investigation. (orig.)
