All random effect terms are significantly different from zero, indicating <b>unexplained</b> <b>variations</b> in income at both individual and prefectural levels, and the effects of individual variables vary significantly across prefectures. Coefficients in variance component indicate the average effect of these individual level characteristics across the prefectures in the data. The standard deviation for education (. 018) suggests relatively small variations in education across prefectures. The standard deviations for all other variables are rather high, meaning that there are large prefectural variations in occupation, household registration and employment in the private sector.|$|R

Other fungi have long been known to occur as occasional parasites or endophytes, but the one lichen–one fungus paradigm has seldom been questioned. Here we show that many common lichens are composed of the known ascomycete, the photosynthesizing partner, and, unexpectedly, specific basidiomycete yeasts. These yeasts are embedded in the cortex, and their abundance correlates with previously <b>unexplained</b> <b>variations</b> in phenotype.

We find the gap to be associated with the unexplained component.

40|$|Although {{the notions}} of {{vertical}} and horizontal equity are straightforward, con-structing valid measures of each has proven difficult in states that make revenue adjustments for multiple factors. In this article we introduce an alternative ap-proach for assessing horizontal and vertical equity that addresses this problem.

The vertical equity metrics are based on how close the linear relationships between per-pupil funding and vertical equity factors are to their intended values. We examine horizontal equity by looking at the <b>unexplained</b> <b>variations</b> in per-pupil funding levels from the same model. This leads to im-proved measurement of "equal treatment of equals " without assuming that all school districts have comparable funding needs.

However, most of the <b>unexplained</b> <b>variation</b> is attributed to teacher factors rather than influenced by variation at the school or municipality levels.

Moreover, the <b>unexplained</b> <b>variation</b> in schools and at municipality level is higher for self-certified than for certified sickness absence.

Many consider multicenter randomized controlled trials to be the gold standard of evidence-based medicine, although results are often inconclusive {{or may not be}} generally applicable due to differences in the contexts within which care is provided. Increasingly, others advocate the use ―quality improvement collaboratives‖, in which multi-institutional teams share information to identify potentially better practices that are subsequently evaluated in the local contexts of specific institutions, but there is concern that such collaborative learning approaches lack the statistical rigor of randomized trials. Using an agent-based model, we show how and why a collaborative learning approach almost invariably leads to greater improvements in expected patient outcomes than more traditional approaches in searching simulated clinical fitness landscapes.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain local {{variations}} {{in the use of}} antibiotics in the community and to assess the welfare loss due to heterogeneous attitudes towards the risk of bacterial infections and resistance. Significant differences are observed in the per capita antibiotic consumption measured in defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants (DID) across small geographic areas in Switzerland. A model is proposed in which antibiotic use varies according to the socioeconomic characterisitics of the population characteristics, the incidence of infections, antibiotic price and local supply of health care. Quarterly wholesales data on outpatient antibiotics in 2002 were obtained from IHA-IMS Market Research and combined with WHO standardized doses to obtain DID. The paper finds that the most important determinants of variations in outpatient antibiotics use in the community are income, demographic structure of the population and local supply and price of antibiotic treatment. We estimated that <b>unexplained</b> <b>variations</b> may account for 11 % of the total antibiotic spending in the community, thus leading to a C= 6 ml loss per year. Antibiotic use.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to make the first step in the modelling of pharmaceutical demand in Italy, by deriving a weighted capitation model to account for demographic differences among general practices. The experimental model was called ASSET (Age/Sex Standardised Estimates of Treatment). METHODS AND MAJOR FINDINGS: Individual prescription costs and demographic data referred to 3, 175, 691 Italian subjects and were collected directly from three Regional Health Authorities over the 12 -month period between October 2004 and September 2005. The mean annual prescription cost per individual was similar for males (196. 13 euro) and females (195. 12 euro). After 65 years of age, the mean prescribing costs for males were significantly higher than females. On average, costs for a 75 -year-old subject would be 12 times the costs for a 25 - 34 year-old subject if male, 8 times if female. Subjects over 65 years of age (22 % of total population) accounted for 56 % of total prescribing costs. The weightings explained approximately 90 % of the evolution of total prescribing costs, in spite of the pricing and reimbursement turbulences affecting Italy in the 2000 - 2005 period. The ASSET weightings were able to explain only about 25 % of the variation in prescribing costs among individuals. CONCLUSIONS: If mainly idiosyncratic prescribing by general practitioners causes the <b>unexplained</b> <b>variations,</b> the introduction of capitation-based budgets would gradually move practices with high prescribing costs towards the national average. It is also possible, though, that the <b>unexplained</b> individual <b>variation</b> in prescribing costs is the result of differences in the clinical characteristics or socio-economic conditions of practice populations. If this is the case, capitation-based budgets may lead to unfair distribution of resources. The ASSET age/sex weightings should be used as a guide, not as the ultimate determinant, for an equitable allocation of prescribing resources to regional authorities and general practices...|$|R
