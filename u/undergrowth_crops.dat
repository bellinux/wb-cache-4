The {{presence}} of punji sticks may be camouflaged by natural <b>undergrowth,</b> <b>crops,</b> grass, brush or similar materials. They were often incorporated into various types of traps; for example, a camouflaged pit into which a man might fall (it would then be a trou de loup).|$|E

Maize-potato {{rotation}} is {{the main}} form of crop rotation and free range grazing in crop fields after harvest is commonly practiced. In the agroforestry based system, the fields are divided into home gardens and distant outfields. In the home gardens, enset 2 (Enset ventricosum or Musa ensete), coffee and shade trees (e.g., Cordia africana) and fruit trees such as avocado (Persia americana) and mango (Mangifera indica) are typical features with <b>undergrowth</b> of root <b>crops,</b> tubers and species. The distant out fields are planted to cereals (maize, wheat, tef) that are cultivated in rotation with legumes such as faba bean (Vicia faba), haricot bean (Phaseulus vulgaris) and soybean (Glycinemax sp.) in certain places. Trees such as Codia africana, Milletia ferruginea, Croton macrostachyus, and various species of acacia are interspersed in the crop fields providing fresh supply of organic matter {{in the form of}} leaf litter to the soil.|$|R
