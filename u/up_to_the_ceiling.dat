5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
500|$|In the ride's climax, Doctor Octopus {{lifts the}} Scoop up to {{a height of}} [...] using the anti-gravity cannon. A number of {{synchronized}} effects help achieve this without the vehicle leaving the ground. These include a movable building set, lighting cues, simulator movements, projections and wind effects. Spider-Man attempts to pull the Scoop down, but is attacked by all the supervillains. Spider-Man thwarts them, but not before Doctor Octopus disengages the anti-gravity device, sending the Scoop on a simulated freefall until it is rescued by Spider-Man's webbing right above the ground and another Stan Lee cameo. Spider-Man manages to capture all of the supervillains by tying them with webs. As the vehicle pulls into the unload station, Spider-Man thanks the guests for their help and sends {{them back to the}} Daily Bugle, where he has rigged the anti-gravity cannon to lift Jameson <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> in his office. Guests unload while a modern rendition of the classic Spider-Man theme song plays and a voiceover by Stan Lee instructs the riders on exiting properly.|$|E
500|$|Both [...] "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] were {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. The first half was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto, whereas {{the second half}} was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez. Both {{were based on a}} story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. In the original outline for [...] "Mortal Folly", the Lich had several lines that played him off as a stereotypical villain. Sugar and Muto decided to make him into a more [...] "scary and dangerous" [...] character, and purposely played up the darker elements of the episode. In addition, Princess Bubblegum's sweater was supposed to be [...] "magic" [...] and [...] "shoot lasers". However, Sugar felt that it would be more emotionally poignant if the sweater was just a regular sweater imbued with positive emotions. The scene featuring Finn stuffing the sweater into the Lich's eye sockets and then ripping his skull apart was inspired by an artistic design idea Sugar had had when she was in high school; she had wanted to draw a comic featuring a small person getting into a fight and being pushed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} contains outer {{and inner}} lobbies, a ticket/telegraph office, a waiting room, two lavatories, {{and a large}} freight and baggage room. The interior is entirely finished with hardwoods. The walls are covered with vertical beaded-board dados <b>up</b> <b>to</b> chair-rail height, horizontal boarding above that, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> picture-moulding height, and additaional vertical boarding <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> is covered with boards, and the floor has original hardwood floorboards. The waiting room contains an original fireplace with mantelpiece. Columns similar <b>to</b> those supporting <b>the</b> platform canopies frame the opening between the main lobby and the waiting room.|$|R
60|$|The flame increased, {{and blown}} {{upon by the}} wind roared round the pictures, the tapestries, and <b>the</b> cradle, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plaster <b>ceiling</b> and through it into the forest of oak timbers above.|$|R
60|$|And {{now they}} stare around them with eager, greedy eyes, {{awaiting}} the amusement of the spectacle; {{gazing at the}} President, with his tall Phrygian cap; at the clerks wielding their indefatigable quill pens, writing, writing, writing; at the flickering lights, throwing clouds of sooty smoke, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>ceiling</b> above.|$|R
500|$|The next {{match was}} the [...] Casket match; the first wrestler {{to get his}} {{opponent}} in the casket and close the lid would win the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Yokozuna had great difficulty inflicting any serious damage on The Undertaker, but it was soon revealed that Mr. Fuji had arranged for several wrestlers to get involved on Yokozuna's behalf. Crush, The Great Kabuki, Genichiro Tenryu and Bam Bam Bigelow interfered, but The Undertaker was able to fight back until Mr. Fuji stole The Undertaker's urn from Paul Bearer. Yokozuna opened the urn, and smoke poured out. Meanwhile, Adam Bomb, Jeff Jarrett, The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Diesel then came to the ring to help Yokozuna. Eventually, Yokozuna and his allies were able to shut The Undertaker in the casket to end the match. They locked the casket and pushed it down the aisle until smoke started {{coming out of the}} casket. The Undertaker appeared on the video screen {{at the end of the}} aisle, vowing to return. The casket was shown exploding on the screen, although the casket in the arena did not explode. After the explosion was shown, a person resembling The Undertaker was seen rising <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the Civic Center. This role is rumored to have been played by Marty Jannetty.|$|E
2500|$|On January 22, 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, ACT UP activist John Weir and {{two other}} activists entered the studio of the CBS Evening News at the {{beginning}} of the broadcast. They shouted [...] "AIDS is news. Fight AIDS, not Arabs!" [...] and Weir stepped in front of the camera before the control room cut to a commercial break. The same night ACT UP demonstrated at the studios of the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour. The next day activists displayed banners in Grand Central Terminal that said [...] "Money for AIDS, not for war" [...] and [...] "One AIDS death every 8 minutes." [...] One of the banners was handheld and displayed across the train timetable and the other attached to bundles of balloons that lifted it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the station's enormous main room. These actions were part of a coordinated protest called [...] "Day of Desperation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Social Security's benefit formula {{provides}} 90% {{of average}} indexed monthly earnings (AIME) below the first [...] "bend point" [...] of $791/month, 32% of AIME {{between the first}} and second bend points $791 to $4781/month, and 15% of AIME in excess of the second bend point <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ceiling</b> cap of $113,700 in 2013. The low income bias of the benefit calculation means that lower paid worker receives a much higher percentage of his or her salary in benefit payments than higher paid workers. Indeed, a married low salaried worker can receive over 100% of their salary in benefits after retiring at the full retirement age. High-salaried workers receive 43% or less of their salary in benefits despite having paid into the [...] "system" [...] at the same rate—(see benefit calculations above.) To minimize the impact of Social Security taxes on low salaried workers the Earned Income Tax Credit" [...] and the Child Care Tax Credit were passed, which largely refund the FICA and or SECA payments of low-salaried workers through the income tax system. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0-20%) and second quintile (21-40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average federal income tax of -9.3% and -2.6% of income and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% of income respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average total federal tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively. However, these groups also have by far the smallest percentage of American household incomes – the first quintile earns just 3.2% of all income, while the second quintile earns only 8.4% of all income. Higher-income retirees will have to pay income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement benefits they may have.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{the station}} retains its {{original}} layout {{except for one}} closet that was built for electrical control equipment. Both the waiting room and the baggage room are now given over to museum displays. They are sided in narrow beadboard yellow pine, laid both horizontally and vertically, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vaulted <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> floors have three-inch (7.5 cm) tongue and groove planking.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} hall {{is laid out}} over a polished slate stone floor and carved oak paneling reaching <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oak-beamed <b>ceiling.</b> A staircase with a carved open strapwork- pattern balustrade graces the hall. Two torchieres and chairs original <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house are located {{to either side of}} the door as well as a chest belonging <b>to</b> Mrs. Carlile, <b>the</b> last private resident of the house.|$|R
2500|$|For workers the Social Security {{tax rate}} is 6.2% on income under $127,200 {{through the end}} of 2017. The worker Medicare tax rate is 1.45% of all income—employers pay another 1.45%. Employers pay 6.2% <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wage <b>ceiling</b> and <b>the</b> Medicare tax of 1.45 percent on all income. Workers defined as [...] "self employed" [...] pay 12.4% on income under $113,700 and a 2.9% Medicare tax on all income.|$|R

2500|$|Nonetheless, Chagall {{continued}} the project which took the 77-year-old artist a year <b>to</b> complete. <b>The</b> final canvas was nearly 2,400 square feet (220 sq. meters) and required [...] of paint. It had five sections which were glued to polyester panels and hoisted <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> images Chagall {{painted on the}} canvas paid tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> composers Mozart, Wagner, Mussorgsky, Berlioz and Ravel, {{as well as to}} famous actors and dancers.|$|R
50|$|Strict {{controls}} on external alterations to property have {{meant that the}} estate has retained its original appearance. All the houses have grey brick <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground floor <b>ceiling</b> level and above this they are pebbledashed in brilliant white stone.|$|R
50|$|Jones {{added another}} {{idiosyncrasy}} to Claude's id in another 1950 film, Two's a Crowd. Here, Claude is scared {{out of his}} mind by a diminutive dog named Frisky Puppy, newly adopted by Claude's owners. The main theme, however, is jealousy as Claude's attempts <b>to</b> oust <b>the</b> intruder repeatedly fail due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cat's intense cowardice - a running gag has Claude repeatedly shooting <b>up</b> and clinging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> after <b>the</b> pup playfully comes up behind him and barks. At the end, however Claude gets revenge by pulling the same trick causing <b>the</b> dog <b>to</b> comically leap <b>up</b> and cling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Jones repeated <b>the</b> scenario with slight variations in Terrier Stricken in 1952 and No Barking in 1954 (the latter featuring a cameo by Tweety Bird).|$|R

60|$|Instantly {{the room}} was populous with sounds of melodiousness, and mournfulness, and wonderfulness; the room swarmed with the unintelligible but delicious sounds. The sounds seemed waltzing in the room; the sounds hung {{pendulous}} like glittering icicles {{from the corners of}} the room; and fell upon him with a ringing silveryness; and were drawn <b>up</b> again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and hung pendulous again, and dropt down upon him again with the ringing silveryness. Fire-flies seemed buzzing in the sounds; summer-lightnings seemed vividly yet softly audible in the sounds.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{painting}} depicting {{the interior of the}} Mission San Antonio de Padua church, ca. 1900. The painting, which appears to be watercolor, pictures the altar {{at the back of the}} room at center, with two lone pews to either side of <b>the</b> walkway leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> above is vaulted and appears to have a window at its very top. Several smaller windows are visible along the top of the adobe wall at right, lined below by religious relics...|$|R
6000|$|... "O heavenly, heavenly flowers!" [...] exclaimed Miss Sharp, and smelt them delicately, {{and held}} them to her bosom, and cast <b>up</b> her eyes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> in an ecstasy of admiration. Perhaps she just looked first into <b>the</b> bouquet, <b>to</b> see {{whether there was a}} billet-doux hidden among the flowers; but there was no letter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Lord Eskdale, looking <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> 'I am {{thinking}} how you may prevent Tancred {{from going to}} Jerusalem, without, at the same time, opposing his wishes.' ...|$|E

50|$|The {{elevator}} scenes, {{some of the}} film's {{most infamous}} shots, were severely altered from their original scenes. Originally, the occupants ended <b>up</b> pressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> elevator and dropped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor when <b>the</b> elevator crashed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the shaft. This scene - shown in all test screening prints - was considered too graphic for a film intended to have a PG rating. Universal decided to cut {{this portion of the}} sequence {{and replace it with a}} frame of the people on the elevator's floor, with the notorious 'cartoon blood' rushing into the camera.|$|R
50|$|The deep vat {{building}} is a concrete structure constructed in 1939 with a low-pitched roof and parapetted ends. A double doorway {{is located on the}} east side.

50|$|The Central Hall's dome, awe inspiring to guests, {{measured}} 55 m {{from floor}} <b>to</b> <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> 589 m2 hall's architectural interior {{was designed by}} Alexander Marcel of the French Institute, and decorated by Georges-Louis Claude. Twenty-two Italian marble columns circled <b>the</b> parquet floor <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elaborate <b>ceilings.</b> <b>The</b> hall was carpeted with fine Persian carpets and had large mirrored wall panels and a substantial marble fireplace. To {{one side of the}} Central Hal was the Grillroom seating 150 guests, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other was the billiards hall, with two full-sized British Thurston billiard tables and a 'priceless' French one. The private banquet halls were quite large and elaborate.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evenings}} {{in his room}} he used to lift iron bars, cannon-balls, heave dumb-bells, and haul himself <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with his teeth. You could hear the thumps half a mile. He liked it.|$|E
60|$|The eyes winked three times, {{and then}} they turned <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{and down to the}} floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.|$|E
6000|$|... "And, oh, how {{beautiful}} he is!" [...] said the girl, putting {{her hands together}} and looking <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Marie in her heart of hearts wished {{that he was not}} half so beautiful, as then her chance of having him might be greater.|$|E
60|$|With a flush {{upon his}} olive cheeks and with pride {{smoldering}} {{in his dark}} eyes, he looked round him at the eager faces {{of the men who}} had been his comrades from Sluys and Cadsand to Crecy and Calais. They caught fire from that warlike gleam in his masterful gaze, and a sudden wild, fierce shout pealed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vaulted <b>ceiling,</b> a soldierly thanks for what was passed and a promise for what was <b>to</b> come. <b>The</b> King's teeth gleamed in a quick smile, and his large white hand played with the jeweled dagger in his belt.|$|R
6000|$|In the meantime, Mr. Finch had {{produced}} from a cupboard near the fireplace, two letters. The first he threw down impatiently on the table.

[...] "I would have spared you, Oscar, if I could. All our hopes depend, dear boy, on what you can say to guide us when you have read those lines." ...|$|R
