25|$|On the building's {{top level}} (the 40th floor), {{there is a}} bar for tenants and their guests, {{featuring}} {{a panoramic view of}} London. A restaurant operates on the 39th floor, and private dining rooms on the 38th. Whereas most buildings have extensive lift equipment {{on the roof of the}} building, this was not possible for the Gherkin, since a bar had been planned for the 40th floor. The architects dealt with this by having the main lift only reach the 34th floor, and then having a push-from-below lift to the 39th floor. There is a marble stairwell and a disabled persons' lift, which leads the visitor <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> in the dome.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E
2500|$|Ted {{refuses to}} believe that he has been hooked up, and {{continues}} waiting on Tiffany. When she shows <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> with her co-workers, Barney is excited to see that she and all her friends are pharmaceutical representatives, which he calls the [...] "hot-chick" [...] profession of their generation (like the nurse or stewardess was in the past). He hooks up with several of them, before meeting a particularly plain rep, declaring the era of the [...] "hot pharma girl" [...] over.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the pasture}} all the {{partners}} were gathered, for Toby {{had promised to}} tell them when he would begin operations; and as he drove <b>the</b> ponies <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> he shouted: ...|$|R
6000|$|But the Black Sheep ran <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> by <b>the</b> {{lane and}} waited with a glad heart till {{the little boy}} came. When he saw the sheep waiting for him he asked, ...|$|R
60|$|Toby was in {{the highest}} degree excited; {{it seemed as if}} his pet that had been killed was again before him, and he crowded his way <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of <b>the</b> cage, {{dragging}} Abner with him, until he was where he could have a full view of the noisy prisoners.|$|R
2500|$|At {{around midnight}} on November 7, 1881, Miller was {{drinking}} at Dick Darling's Broadway saloon {{with several of}} his friends including Bill Bowie, George Law Jr., Harry Rice, Charles Crawford and Billy Temple. After an hour, Tracy was seen peeking into the saloon from the front entrance. A few minutes later, he reentered the saloon and walked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> to order a whiskey sour. He then turned to Miller and said [...] "I came in here to kill you" [...] before drawing a revolver and pointing it at his head before shooting him in the stomach. Miller reached for his pistol but collapsed onto the floor. Miller was taken by ambulance to the New York Hospital where he died from his wounds shortly after his arrival. Tracy was arrested and tried for his murder, however he {{was found not guilty}} due to perjured testimony and returned to running his saloon.|$|E
60|$|They strode <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> while Murdoch {{went through}} an inner door. He {{appeared}} {{behind the bar}} directly after with Truscott.|$|E
60|$|The women involuntarily drew {{in their}} breath, {{and the whole}} gang sat with downcast, dejected faces. Meanwhile, Simon turned on his heel, and marched <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> of the boat for a dram.|$|E
60|$|He emptied his glass, got up, {{and stood}} {{at the side of}} the fire, with his heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> <b>to</b> dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither looked at it, nor at the fire, but {{steadily}} looked at me. It was only now that I began to tremble.|$|R
60|$|Before Dick could reply the Nilghai {{lifted up}} his voice with a shout {{that shook the}} windows, in 'The Men of the Sea,' that begins, as all know, 'The sea is a wicked old woman,' and after rading through eight lines whose imagery is truthful, ends in a refrain, slow as the clacking of a capstan when the boat comes unwillingly <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> where <b>the</b> men sweat and tramp in the shingle.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "chin up" [...] is {{bringing}} <b>the</b> chin <b>up</b> <b>to</b> touch <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> or go over <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> with a supinated palms-facing grip.|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed to}} the corner saloon, a low dive kept by a Chinaman and frequented by Mexicans and Indians. These poured out pellmell as the cowboys jangled <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> Jard Hardman's outfit coming to town had {{prepared}} the way for this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear Martin! hear him!" [...] cried Mr. Yorke. [...] "I {{must see}} and have this lad of mine brought <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> Nature meant {{him to live}} by his tongue. Hesther, your third son must {{certainly}} be a lawyer; he has the stock-in-trade--brass, self-conceit, and words--words--words." ...|$|E
6000|$|The brewer fetched it up {{from beneath}} the bar, {{but he did it}} reluctantly. In the midst of the hubbub thus produced, an {{abnormally}} tall and lanky fellow known as [...] "High" [...] Bedloe pushed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and made an effort to speak, and finally did say solemnly: ...|$|E
6000|$|Before Dick could reply the Nilghai {{lifted up}} his voice with a shout {{that shook the}} windows, in [...] "The Men of the Sea," [...] that begins, as all know, [...] "The sea is a wicked old woman," [...] and after wading through eight lines whose imagery is truthful, ends in a refrain, slow as the clacking of a capstan when the boat comes unwillingly <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> where <b>the</b> men sweat and tramp in the shingle.|$|R
60|$|They {{drove home}} under the sunset. Mounds of straw, and wheat-stacks like bee-hives, {{stood out in}} startling rose and gold, and the green-tufted stubble glistened. As the vast girdle of crimson darkened, the {{fulfilled}} land became autumnal in deep reds and browns. The black road before <b>the</b> buggy turned <b>to</b> a faint lavender, then was blotted to uncertain grayness. Cattle came {{in a long line}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> gates of <b>the</b> farmyards, and over the resting land was a dark glow.|$|R
6000|$|He was disappointed, for he {{had hoped}} to be able to speak with his new made friends a few moments before the weary night's ride commenced; but, failing in that, he went hastily back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monkeys' cage. Old Ben was there, getting things ready for a start; but the wooden sides of the cage had not been put up, and Toby had no {{difficulty}} in calling <b>the</b> aged monkey <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars.</b> He held one of the Fat Woman's doughnuts in his hand, and said, as he passed it through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animal: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'More murder,' he said. 'Ben Hatcher {{has just}} shot down two new-comers. They only arrived this afternoon, and {{knew nothing of}} what was going on. They walked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and gave an order. Ben Hatcher was {{standing}} there and made some insulting remark to them. They resented it, and he drew and shot them down at once.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{landlord}} 'ad {{just that}} moment come in, and Peter {{walked up and}} ordered a pint, and took his ten-pence change as bold as brass. Arter that Joe Barbcomb bought five more ha'pennies afore you could wink a'most, and every man wot sold one went <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and 'ad a pint and got tenpence change, and drank Joe Barlcomb's health.|$|E
6000|$|He got 'is {{chance at}} last, {{in quite a}} {{unexpected}} way. We was up 'ere at the [...] "Cauliflower" [...] one evening, and, as it 'appened, we was talking about Henery Walker's great-uncle, when the door opened, and who should walk in but the old gentleman 'imself. Everybody left off talking and stared at 'im, but he walked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and ordered a glass o' gin and beer as comfortable as you please.|$|E
60|$|At La Force many ladies were imprisoned, {{among them}} the Princess de Lamballe. They shared {{the fate of the}} male prisoners, being hewn to pieces by sabres. The head of the princess was cut off and stuck upon a pike, and was carried in triumph under the windows of the Temple, where the king and queen were confined, and was held <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of <b>the</b> room they {{occupied}} for them to see. Marie Antoinette, fearless for herself, fainted at the terrible sight of the pale head of her friend.|$|R
60|$|Sally sat {{so still}} and silent that I thought I had angered or {{offended}} her. But I {{did not care}} much, one way or another. Her coquettish fancy {{for me and my}} own trouble had sunk into insignificance. I did not look up at her, though she was so close I could feel her little, restless foot touching me. The horses in the corrals were trooping <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars.</b> Dusk had about given place to night, although in the west a broad flare of golden sky showed bright behind dark mountains.|$|R
50|$|The show {{opens with}} George Fowler (Andrew Laurich), a CDC prisoner, shown writing a six letter/digit code {{on his chest}} then burning a piece of paper. When he finishes, {{an image of a}} vampire briefly flashes near him. A prison guard comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell and informs him that he will be moved to maximum {{security}} prison. George goes straight <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> and implores him not to take him outside of the prison as the vampires chasing him are waiting for him. The guard informs him that this is the punishment he gets for beheading people.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not mind}} this money meagreness. The disdain I had learned for money from the oyster pirates had never left me. I didn't care over-weeningly for it for {{personal}} gratification; and in my philosophy I completed the circle, finding myself as equable {{with the lack of}} a ten-cent piece as I was with the squandering of scores of dollars in calling all men and hangers-on <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> to drink with me.|$|E
60|$|Just as {{the steamer}} came close <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> a heavy sea struck {{her on the}} port bow, driving her a little too near the pier. The captain shouted to the steersman, but the man either did not {{understand}} him, or did not act with sufficient promptitude, for the next wave sent them crashing on the portion of bulwark or breakwater that juts out {{from the head of}} the Aberdeen pier.|$|E
6000|$|In {{those days}} the cattlemen were the anointed. They were the grandees of the grass, kings of the kine, lords of the lea, barons of beef and bone. They might have ridden in golden chariots had their tastes so inclined. The {{cattleman}} {{was caught in}} a stampede of dollars. It seemed to him that he had more money than was decent. But when he had bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs, and a California saddle with silver nails and Angora skin /suaderos/, and ordered everybody <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for whisky--what else was there for him to spend money for? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{half an hour}} he {{roamed the}} arena, which was the {{greatest}} area of restricted freedom he had known in the ten weeks of his captivity. Then, a hooked iron rod, thrust through <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> caught and drew the bight of his trailing rope {{into the hands of}} the men outside. Immediately ten of them had hold of it, and he would have charged <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> at them had not, at that moment, Mulcachy entered the arena through a door on the opposite side. No bars stood between Ben Bolt and this creature, and Ben Bolt charged him. Even as he charged he was aware of suspicion in that the small, fragile man-creature before him did not flee or crouch down, but stood awaiting him.|$|R
60|$|Napoleon's aide-de-camp, Capitaine Raoul, {{accompanied}} {{by half a}} dozen lancers, comes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palisade which <b>bars</b> <b>the</b> immediate approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city gates.|$|R
60|$|Over {{our heads}} burned the {{wonderful}} Indian stars, {{which are not}} all pricked in on one plane, but, preserving an orderly perspective, draw the eye through the velvet darkness of <b>the</b> void <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>barred</b> doors of heaven itself. The earth was a gray shadow more unreal than the sky. We could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of the jackals, {{the movement of the}} wind in the tamarisks, and the fitful mutter of musketry-fire leagues away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. A native woman from some unseen hut began <b>to</b> sing, <b>the</b> mail-train thundered past on its way to Delhi, and a roosting crow cawed drowsily. Then there was a belt- loosening silence about the fires, and the even breathing of the crowded earth took up the story.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was early}} yet. Some {{of the boats}} might be {{discharging}} by torchlight. At any rate, he might hear of a ship starting in the morning. He {{went down to the}} wharf. There was plenty of bustle here; boats were landing fish, and larger craft were discharging or taking in cargo; but his inability to speak Dutch prevented his asking questions. He crossed {{to the other side of}} the road. The houses here were principally stores or drinking taverns. In the window of one was stuck up, [...] "English and French Spoken Here." [...] He went inside, walked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> and called for a glass of beer in English.|$|E
6000|$|He {{entered a}} place curiously like the saloons of ante-prohibition days, {{with a long}} greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind, a pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of {{something}} which resembled whisky, and with two men at the bar, drinking something which resembled beer, and giving that impression of forming a large crowd which two men always give in a saloon. The bartender, a tall pale Swede with a diamond in his lilac scarf, stared at Babbitt as he stalked plumply <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and whispered, [...] "I'd, uh--Friend of Hanson's sent me here. Like to get some gin." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{glance at}} Dillon's face {{showed that the}} blood had left his cheek; for, brave as the Irishman was, the {{prospect}} of being killed like a dog by this native swordsman could not but be terrible to him, and he did not doubt for a moment that he would be selected. Captain Muller walked leisurely <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> drank off a bumper of raw Geneva, and then turned and looked round the room. As his eyes fell on the uniform of the 5th, a look of satisfaction came over his face, and fixing his eyes on Dillon, he walked leisurely across the room.|$|E
5000|$|Solomons is home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> popular Tiki <b>Bar</b> of Solomons Island. The {{weekend of}} the annual opening of <b>the</b> Tiki <b>Bar</b> brings tens of {{thousands}} of visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tiki <b>Bar</b> and other Solomons Island establishments. Other popular local establishments include The Pier (with an outdoor bar which allows boats <b>to</b> pull <b>up</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar)</b> and <b>the</b> Ruddy Duck microbrewery (Located in neighboring Dowell, MD).|$|R
5000|$|... full beats - {{hanging from}} <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> with your hands, keeping legs {{straight}} and together, bringing feet <b>up</b> <b>to</b> level with <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and then swinging down, through vertical and back with feet returning <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The monastery school later {{received}} {{a monopoly on}} education {{in the city of}} Luxembourg and its catchment area reached <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> County of <b>Bar.</b> <b>The</b> children were taught the French and German languages, amongst other things.|$|R
