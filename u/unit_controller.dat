When a developer instantiates a gateway prototype (e.g., as shown in Listing 4), the IoT <b>units</b> <b>controller</b> (cf. Fig. 3) performs three main tasks.

40|$|This paper explores how contextual {{uncertainty}} {{and the use}} of the budgetary system explain cross-sectional variation in the organisational role of business <b>unit</b> <b>controllers.</b> We argue that there are complementarities between the role of the budgetary control system (i. e. coercive vs. enabling) and the role of the controller (i. e. corporate policeman vs. business partner). Thus, we explore both the direct effect of uncertainty on the role of the controller and the indirect effect through the role of the budgetary control system. Using survey data from 134 business <b>unit</b> <b>controllers,</b> we find that uncertainty provides a partial explanation of the variation in the role of budgetary control systems and in the role of controllers. In particular, our data suggest alignment between the coercive (enabling) use of the budgetary control system and the role of controllers acting as corporate policemen (business partners). These findings add to our understanding of the functioning of business <b>unit</b> <b>controllers</b> within their organisational context...|$|R

This accelerated the construction of electric traction railways and trolley systems worldwide.

Yonah's execution core contains a 12-stage pipeline, forecast to eventually {{be able to}} run at a maximum frequency of 2.33 - 2.50 GHz. The communication between the L2 cache and both execution cores is handled by a bus <b>unit</b> <b>controller</b> through arbitration, which reduces cache coherency traffic over the FSB, at the expense of raising the core-to-L2 latency from 10 clock cycles (in the Dothan Pentium M) to 14 clock cycles. The increase in clock frequency offsets the impact of the increased clock cycle latency. The power management components of the core features improved grained thermal control, as well as independent scaling of power between the two cores, resulting in very efficient management of power.|$|E
