50|$|The largest unit of {{the brigade}} is the Mountain-Reonnaissance Battalion also {{identified}} as Ranger Battalion and Special Mountain Battalion. It has officially {{become part of the}} special forces in 2009. The battalion deploys combat / reconnaissance units but is mainly focused on training and preparing military as well as civilian individuals for eventual service in higher tier units. About 310 men are on active duty while there is a constant rotational flow of recruits trying to pass the admission course which takes about half of the official <b>unit</b> <b>composition</b> space. As the designation already implies, the battalion is specialised on combat and reconnaissance in alpine and mountainous terrain mainly while also qualified to perform surgical operations in all other known areas. The Rangers are potential candidates for the special forces units as they undergo similar admission and survival courses, which also include basic diver training and paratrooper qualification. The Ranger battalion also functions as primary support force for the special forces battalion and naval special unit.|$|E
50|$|Most combat {{takes place}} through direct, {{line-of-sight}} engagements. For small arms fire from infantry units, weapon accuracy and range are factored into the damage calculation. Cover, {{which can be}} gained from map terrain, occupying a building, or an adjacent armored unit (such as an anti-tank gun), factors heavily into the calculation. Cover does not provide any protection against most types of indirect attacks (grenade, mortar, artillery), or specialized anti-personnel weapons (accurate sniper fire, flames.) Vehicles also receive cover, though through much more complicated mechanics, usually resulting in survivability bonuses - not unlike their infantry counterparts. In addition to range and accuracy, the direction of fire also has {{a major impact on}} the damage a vehicle takes, especially if weak spots are targeted, such as the rear armour of a tank. A head-on shot into the glacis of the tank will do much less damage than a shot to the side, or a direct shot into the rear of the hull. Although terrain cover does not offer the same protection for vehicles as it does for infantry, obscuring terrain increases the difficulty of scoring a target hit by reducing the target's exposed profile. Thus, combat outcome is as much a function of tactical deployment and battlefield terrain as it is of <b>unit</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E

While the microstrategies developed provide a good fit to the data, there is neither direct evidence for microstrategies as compared to other possible constructs nor an explicit statement of the theory underlying their construction. While the use of CPM-GOMS as an explanatory mechanism is a substantial advance, microstrategies have theoretical and practical limitations in terms of: microstrategies functioning as cognitive <b>units,</b> <b>composition</b> and structure, and dependency constraints.
