5|$|Arulpragasam's early {{compositions}} {{relied heavily}} on the Roland MC-505 music sequencer and drum machine. Her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and <b>unusual</b> <b>sound</b> samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive style to her music. Lyrically incorporating a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace.|$|E
25|$|Murmur is {{the debut}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band R.E.M., released on April 12, 1983 by I.R.S. Records. Murmur drew critical acclaim upon its release for its <b>unusual</b> <b>sound,</b> defined by lead singer Michael Stipe's cryptic lyrics, guitarist Peter Buck's jangly guitar style, and bass guitarist Mike Mills' melodic basslines.|$|E
25|$|Opened in January 1961, TC4 {{was similar}} {{in design and}} layout to its neighbour, TC3. It was {{designed}} as a light entertainment studio and contained a rather <b>unusual</b> <b>sound</b> system called ambiophony. It was upgraded to colour in 1970 and to HD and surround sound in 2008. It was home to many BBC sitcoms and the talk show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. This studio was demolished during the redevelopment of Television Centre.|$|E

25|$|Hello Master is {{the debut}} studio album by Canadian hard rock band Priestess. Recorded with {{producer}} Gus van Go, {{the album was}} initially released on October 18, 2005, by Indica Records in Canada and on later dates in other regions. Its lyrics discuss typical rock n' roll themes such as love, violence and death, and its <b>unusual</b> <b>sound</b> for a hard rock record of the time {{is the result of}} producer Gus van Go trying to emulate the sounds of classic rock and metal albums.|$|E
25|$|In {{their second}} year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs and, {{inspired}} by his guitar-playing dad, the pair began recording on GarageBand in their hall rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer. The band's <b>unusual</b> <b>sound</b> {{stems from the fact}} that due to living in student halls, where noise had to be kept to a minimum, they were unable to use bass guitars or bass drums. Thom Sonny Green suffers from Alport syndrome, a rare genetic disease which causes hearing and kidney failure. As a result, he is about 80 percent deaf.|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} a sinfonia in G minor, which {{illustrates}} falling rain and snow in descending phrases. In da capo form, is reminiscent both of a chaconne and a concerto. The four violas and continuo, with bassoon and cello parts specified, create an <b>unusual</b> <b>sound,</b> termed [...] "magically dark-hued sonority" [...] by Gardiner.|$|E

5000|$|Sicilian has {{a number}} of {{consonant}} sounds that, though not unique to Sicilian, certainly set it apart from the other major Romance languages. The most <b>unusual</b> <b>sounds</b> include, but are not limited to, the retroflex consonants or cacuminals.|$|R
5000|$|Under Ordunio's direction, [...] "Global Village" [...] {{ascended to}} greater heights and created more <b>unusual</b> <b>sounds</b> and {{experiments}} of music, {{such as the}} night a slow movement from a Mahler symphony and a Bruckner symphony were heard simultaneously.|$|R
500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an <b>unusual</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

As the helicopter fell in variously described gyrations, the tail cone either folded or separated. [...] In order to establish an approximate altitude for the flight, several comparative flights were conducted in a similar helicopter.

50|$|A segue {{into the}} next track has all members making <b>unusual</b> <b>sounds</b> with their voices, {{probably}} meant to be improvising their instruments, {{as some of the}} voices sound distinctly like imitations of the sounds of a guitar or a bass.|$|R
5000|$|The band's unique [...] "wall of crap" [...] {{technique}} was created {{at a time}} when the band lacked the knowledge and equipment for a traditional sound. Instead they would layer <b>unusual</b> <b>sounds</b> on top of each other creating something more distinct.|$|R
2500|$|This is an {{extremely}} <b>unusual</b> <b>sound,</b> and led the early Arabic grammarians to describe Arabic as the [...] lughat aḍ-ḍād [...] "the language of ḍād", since the sound {{was thought to be}} unique to Arabic. The emphatic lateral nature of this sound is in fact inherited from Proto-Semitic, and related sounds still occur in some South Semitic languages such as Mehri (where it is usually an ejective lateral fricative). A grapheme for this sound also exists in the South Arabian alphabet ( [...] ) and the Ge'ez alphabet ( [...] ፀ), although in Ge'ez it merged early on with [...] Its numerical value is 800 (see Abjad numerals).|$|E
2500|$|Aided by the {{uniqueness}} of his guitar– the Red Special– May was often able to create strange and <b>unusual</b> <b>sound</b> effects. For example, {{he was able to}} imitate an orchestra in the song [...] "Procession"; in [...] "Get Down, Make Love" [...] he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in [...] "Good Company" [...] he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a [...] "No synthesizers were used on this album" [...] sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners. May also used his guitar to create the chime effect in Bohemian Rhapsody.|$|E
2500|$|As {{he commented}} years later, after the disappointing {{commercial}} performance of Hearts and Bones, Simon {{felt he had}} lost his inspiration to a point of no return, and that his commercial fortunes were unlikely to change. While driving his car in late 1984 in this state of frustration, Simon listened to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys' instrumental [...] "Gumboots: Accordion Jive Volume II" [...] which had been lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer songwriter he was working with at the time. Lorne Michaels had introduced Paul to Heidi when Heidi was working as the bandleader for Lorne's [...] "The New Show". Interested by the <b>unusual</b> <b>sound,</b> he wrote lyrics to the number, which he sang over a re-recording of the song. It was the first composition of a new musical project that became the Grammy-award-winning album Graceland, a mixture of musical styles including pop, a cappella, isicathamiya, rock, zydeco and mbaqanga.|$|E

50|$|Ennio Morricone's {{music for}} A Fistful of Dollars and later Spaghetti Westerns {{was just as}} seminal and imitated.

2500|$|... flanger - {{to create}} an <b>unusual</b> <b>sound,</b> a delayed signal {{is added to the}} {{original}} signal with a continuously variable delay (usually smaller than 10 ms). [...] This effect is now done electronically using DSP, but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together. [...] As long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players (hence [...] "flanger"), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall out-of-phase with its partner, producing a phasing effect. [...] Once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its tachometer was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum. [...] This phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically.|$|E
