40|$|An {{international}} {{validation study}} on IN VITRO tests for skin corrosivity was conducted during 1996 and 1997 {{under the auspices}} of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM). The main objectives of the study were to assess the performances of selected IN VITRO tests in discriminating between: (a) corrosives and non-corrosives, for selected groups of chemicals and/or for all chemicals (single chemical entities only); and (b) known R 35 (<b>UN</b> <b>packing</b> <b>group</b> I) and R 34 (<b>UN</b> <b>packing</b> <b>groups</b> II & III) chemicals. Each test was evaluated for reliability and relevance by using a test set of 60 coded chemicals. In this paper, the test chemicals used in the validation study are identified, and physico-chemical and IN VIVO data/classifications for them are given; they include organic acids (6 C/ 5 NC), organic bases (7 C/ 3 NC), neutral organics (9 NC), phenols (2 C/ 3 NC), inorganic acids (6 C/ 1 NC), inorganic bases (2 C/ 2 NC), inorganic salts (1 C/ 2 NC), electrophiles (3 C/ 5 NC) and soaps/surfactants (3 NC).

40|$|As a {{follow-up}} to a prevalidation study on IN VITRO tests for replacing the IN VIVO rabbit test for skin corrosivity, an international validation study was conducted during 1996 and 1997 {{under the auspices of}} ECVAM. The tests evaluated were the rat skin transcutaneous electrical resistance (TER) assay, CORROSITEX TM, the Skin 2 TM ZK 1350 corrosivity test and EPISKIN TM. Each test was conducted in three independent laboratories. Sixty coded chemicals were tested. Two of the four test evaluated, the TER assay and EPISKIN, met the criteria agreed by the Management Team concerning acceptable underprediction and overprediction rates for them to be considered scientifically validated for use as replacements for the animal test for distinguishing between corrosive and non-corrosive chemicals for all of the chemical types studied. EPSKIN was the only test able to distinguish between known R 35 (<b>UN</b> <b>packing</b> <b>group</b> I) and R 34 (<b>UN</b> <b>packing</b> <b>groups</b> II & III) chemicals, for all of the chemical types included, on an acceptable number of occasions. The corrosive potentials of about 40 % of the test chemicals could not be assessed with CORROSITEX; however, it may be valid for testing specific classes of chemicals. The Skin 2 assay did not meet the criteria for it to be considered scientifically validated. JRC. (EI) -Environment Institut...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the strong interaction between}} background data format organization and foreground {{data in the}} context of speed and power efficient Sub-Word level Parallel (SWP) program generation. Such interaction, if not considered well, results in an excess of (<b>un)</b> <b>packing</b> operations that are typically required to match the format of data stored in memory to the one required by the sub-word parallel processing units. To avoid this overhead a careful selection of the data format for background storage is needed. We propose a conceptual methodology for efficiently exploiting such degree of freedom. The approach is demonstrated on two real-life application kernels, where source code level data format transformations are applied to the data in background memory such that a substantially better exploitation of the sub-word level functional units can be achieved by the compiler. A significant reduction in packing instruction overhead, data (up to a factor 4) and instruction memory accesses (up to 50 %) is obtained. This results in a substantial reduction of power consumed by the register file (less (<b>un)</b> <b>packing</b> operations), the data bus (less bus transactions), the data memory hierarchy (less accesses) and the instruction memory hierarchy (less accesses and more compact code). Also the execution time for the optimized application running on a TriMedia TM 1300 evaluation board shows substantial gains. ...|$|R

40|$|Synchronous {{hardware}} can be modelled as {{a mapping}} from input and state to output {{and a new}} state, such mappings {{are referred to as}} transition functions. It is natural to use a functional language to implement transition functions. The CaSH compiler is capable of translating transition functions to VHDL. Modelling hardware using multiple components is convenient. Components in CaSH can be considered as instantiations of functions. To avoid packing and unpacking state when composing components, functions are lifted to arrows. By using arrows the chance of making errors will decrease as it is not required to manually (<b>un)</b> <b>pack</b> the state. Furthermore, the Haskell do-syntax for arrows increases the readability of hardware designs. This is demonstrated using a realistic example of a circuit which consists of multiple components...|$|R
