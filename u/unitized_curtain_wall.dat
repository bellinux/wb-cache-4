In it, glass behaves as a brittle-elastic material, whereas an elastoplastic characteristic curve is assumed for mullions.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> {{system is}} widely used in {{high-rise}} buildings because of its many advantages. With the increasing demands for building energy efficiency, thermal performance has become an important consideration in developing <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems. Even though the relative impact of the edge effect becomes more important as the thermal performance of glazing and the frame increases, the percentages of the frame out of the total <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> area have not been considered in evaluating its thermal transmittance. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the effect of the frame ratio on the thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. The state of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> frame ratio is analyzed by investigating recently constructed office buildings. Eight cases of different frame ratios and three types of glazing U-values are selected, and the total thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> (Ucw) for each case was calculated by using TRISCO 12. 0 W. This study found that when the higher frame ratio is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system, the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is higher. Furthermore, the frame ratio has greater effect on the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> when high performance glazing is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system.

50|$|Thermal loads are induced in {{a curtain}} wall system because {{aluminum}} has {{a relatively high}} coefficient of thermal expansion. This means that over the span {{of a couple of}} floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions. In <b>unitized</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall,</b> a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by wiper gaskets.

Nowadays, <b>Unitized</b> <b>Curtain</b> <b>Wall</b> system is commonly used for new high-rise buildings, it becomes a major investment in both construction and long-term success of the building. Compared to reinforced concrete structure, <b>unitized</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is new technology in the construction industry. This dissertation {{will focus on the}} design and analysis of <b>unitized</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> for high-rise building, using finite element and structural analysis programme. The curtain wall systems nowadays, even the simpler types, are far more sophisticate products than their early counterparts, though many of the earliest walls are still performing admirably. More than fifty years of experience and development have eliminated the major difficulties of the pioneering designs, resulting in better products. Beginning with the relatively simple, but innovative concept of the early 1950 ’s, a series of window units and panels jointed and supported by simple framing members. Curtain wall system technology has developed, over the years, into a proliferation of highly engineered design. The author worked in construction industry for 5 years and working in Façade Consultancy for almost 2 years. I am currently engaging in various key Façade projects in Asia. I have found that some people simply think that curtain wall system is just an assembly of glass, aluminium, steel, screw and sealant. Curtian wall system, apart from its appearance, functions as an external enclosure to protect the building from weather and to achieve pressure-equalization between the outdoor and indoor environment. Its construction is not only an assembly of several components, but an advanced technology with involves sophisticated calculation.

Giydirme cephe sistemi tasarımında bina ölçeği ve kat yüksekliği arttıkça bakım ve onarım maliyeti de orantılı olarak artmaktadır. Bir binanın olası bakım ve onarım maliyetlerini azaltmak ve bina kullanımı süresince iç ve dış konfor koşullarının sürdürülebilmesi, binanın yaşam dönemi boyunca problem olabilecek faktörlerin belirlenmesi, test edilmesi ve test sonuçlarına bağlı olarak sistem tasarımlarının gerçekleştirilmesi önemlidir. Çalışma kapsamında, çok katlı binalara uygulanan bir panel giydirme cephe sisteminin dış ortama açık deney düzeneği üzerinde uzun dönemde göstereceği taşıyıcılık ve sızdırmazlık performansının belirlenmesi amacına yönelik olarak gerçek zamanlı ve gerçek boyutlarda deneysel çalışmalar yürütülmüştür. Deneysel çalışmalar, çok katlı binalarda üst katlarda rüzgâr yüklerinin artması ve iklimsel koşullardaki değişime bağlı olarak cephe performansının değişiminin belirlenmesi ilkesine dayanmaktadır.

Therefore, tests related to building façade system performance are of importance for assuring the comfort requirements and reducing the maintenance and repair costs as well as preventing the potential problems which may be faced during building’s lifetime. Full-scale preconstruction curtain wall mock-up testing is today normally considered a standard practice for buildings where the curtain wall is a custom application for high-rise buildings, and for buildings where a high confidence level is desired. Within {{the scope of this}} work, real time and full-scale performance tests in accordance with the load-bearing and impermeability criteria are performed on an outdoor test rig for a unitized glass curtain wall panel which is mostly applied on high-rise buildings. The study is based on the principle of the determination of performance change depending on wind pressure increase in upper stories of high-rise buildings and the variations of climatic conditions during the building’s lifetime. Full-scale mock-up testing of two identical <b>unitized</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> panels was carried out. During the testing process, one specimen was subjected to a prescribed fatigue process before conducting the standard test procedures while only the standard test procedures were applied on the other identical specimen. In total, six test sequences were conducted on the reference Specimen P and fatigued Specimen FP. The categories of the tests for P are air infiltration, water penetration under static pressure, wind resistance, seismic resistance as the standard tests. Water penetration under dynamic pressure tests and fatigue procedure were the additional tests for FP along with the standard tests. After each test sequence, quantitative results were determined and checked whether the limit values of the related standards were exceeded. Various experimental behavioral parameters of the two panels are presented with graphics. This thesis consists of six Chapters: In Chapter 1, the aim, scope, method and motivation for this study are given. The existing curtain wall systems are classified and general information was given considering the systems and the components in Chapter 2. Afterwards, minimum performance requirements to compensate the load-bearing and impermeability criteria are explained. Additionally, information regarding the unitized panel systems in particular is presented. Chapter 3 is the main chapter of the thesis and comprises of the testing sequence, full-scale experimental study, and quantitative test results. In Chapter 4, a numerical performance evaluation study is performed by using the experimental data obtained from the experimental study. Widely used numerical methods such as AHP, COPRAS, and TOPSIS were selected for the performance evaluation of the standard and fatigue tested panels by taking into account of multi-criteria as load-bearing and impermeability. With the help of these evaluation methods, comparative lifetime performances of the tested panels were obtained and critical level of the tested panels denoting the loss of performance was found. A general summary and evaluation of the thesis is given in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the results obtained from the experimental work and also includes the suggested potential future studies for fulfilling the topic covered in this thesis. The experimental study was carried out on a large test rig located at the Façade Testing Institute, at Çatalca. Air infiltration, static and dynamic penetration, resistance to wind load, seismic resistance and fatigue test procedures were conducted for the full scale façade specimens. The test specimens consist of two identically detailed <b>unitized</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems with 2, 40 m width, 4, 45 m height dimensions, and are comprised of aluminum framing members and insulating glass units. In total, 10 tests were conducted for the standard and fatigue specimens at five phases during 15 months with different intervals between each testing sequence. After completing each testing phase, the test specimens were exposed under environmental effects till the next phase. Air infiltration tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 1253 standard where the air infiltration limit value is set as 1, 5 "m" ^" 3 " "/" "m" ^" 2 " "h". Static water penetration tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 12155 standard and impermeability of the specimens were observed during the tests where quantitative data were not possible to obtain due to the testing procedure. Wind resistance tests have been conducted in accordance with TS EN 12179 standard, the 15 mm deflection limit value given by the standard was taken into consideration. Seismic resistance tests have been conducted in accordance with AAMA 501. 4 and AAMA 501. 7 standards where a horizontal movement/displacement was applied on the lower beams placed on the specimens in the amount stated in the standard. Potential damages were conducted following these tests. Dynamic water penetration tests have been conducted in accordance with AAMA 501. 1 standard. A ROTAX aircraft type engine was used as a wind generator simultaneously with high pressure water application on the specimen. The water penetration of the inner surface of the specimen was inspected during the tests. The fatigue procedure application has been performed in accordance with ETAG 17 standard. Suction was applied in accordance with the standard. At the end of the test, the specimen was scrutinied whether there is any deficiency or failure. Both specimens used in the experimental part of the study are identical and 5 performance tests were conducted on each one during a 450 day long test process. Generally accepted and prevalently used standard test procedures were applied on specimen P whereas two additional procedures were conducted on specimen FP to fatigue the façade system in order to obtain more realistic results regarding the long term performance of the <b>unitized</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> panels. These tests were defined as dynamic impermeability test comprising water spray application with high wind pressure and ETAG 17 comprising gradual increase in air pressure and sudden application of suction loads. A multi-criteria performance evaluation was conducted with the obtained experimental data by considering the load-bearing and impermeability criteria. Multiple criteria evaluation methods, namely AHP, COPRAS and TOPSIS, were used {{within the framework of the}} performance evaluation and the results were compared. One single and several best options to present the purpose or purposes were chosen by the performance evaluation method related with the decision making. The definition of the multiple criteria decision is being carried out by determining the criteria related to the problem as well as determining the suitability of the alternatives in relation to the chosen criteria. The multiple criteria decision process can be defined generally as defining the problem, determination of the assessment criteria, preparation of the criterion layers and their standardisation, the definition of the criterion weights and the application of the decision analysis. Assessment criteria have to be determined after defining the problem during the decision analysis. The criteria which were defined with regard to the purposes of the decision problem have to be measurable by a number indicating the choices of the decision maker. A total of 10 criteria have been identified in the study. The alternative with the highest numerical value received higher points during the scoring of the alternatives in the assessment. Therefore, a high score value indicates a high numerical result meaning that the relevant alternative provides values, which are closer to the borderlines values. The condition of being close to borderline values, proves that the relevant alternative provides more critical results in comparison to other results. The “critical level” was defined within the performance evaluation process and it indicates the values (%) of the obtained performance indicators as a result of the assessment results. The performance indicator data obtained from the calculations of the AHP, COPRAS and TOPSIS methods, were utilized during the numerical assessment process. Here, the critical levels of the samples at the 0 th, 90 th, 270 th, 390 th and 450 th days were calculated. As a result of the performance evaluations, it has been determined that it is not possible to ignore the climatic effects on the building structure in which the façade system is mounted. Acquirement of appropriate results in a <b>unitized</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> panel system which has been tested with adherence to the prevalently used experimental procedure, or in other words, the results which are not exceeding the limit values given in the standards, do not mean that this wall system will not experience any damage throughout its lifetime.

Currently, the majority of waste glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is simply disposed in landfills or dumping, which not only significantly threats the scarcity of land resources, but also raises risks for surrounding environment and human health. However, there is relatively little work in China which focuses on the management of glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> waste produced from demolition and reconstruction sites. Therefore, this study systematically reviews current application and further development of glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system in Shenzhen city (a mega city of China), and then analyzes the compositions and characteristics of the generation of waste glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> The {{results show that the}} total gross surface area of buildings that use glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system has approximately reached to 3 million m 2 in the region (Nanshan district in Shenzhen).

40|$|Metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> {{are widely}} used in {{commercial}} buildings and offer many advantages including space saving, high quality in manufacturing, light weight, significant aesthetic freedom, and rapid construction. However, their thermal performance is still low {{due to the fact}} that metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> consist of a large portion of glazing, and glass and metal are high heat conductors. In practice, metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> are referred to as "heat sink" in heating-dominant climate. The relatively low thermal resistance results in low surface temperature in cold winter, and thus may cause condensation and thermal discomfort problems in addition to high energy consumption. Initially, metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> grew within metal window industry and the current methodology and standards developed for evaluating window performance are also used for <b>curtain</b> <b>walls.</b> However, metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> differ from windows in that they have a much larger continuous glazing portion, more complex configuration and heat flow at the joints. Their overall performance depends on the interaction and integration of individual constituents as well as the performance of each component. However, the assessment of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> performance by existing standards is segmented and no study has addressed the overall thermal performance of <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> by treating them as integrated systems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the overall thermal performance of metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> using a developed holistic approach for the purpose of providing technical information on the improvement of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> design. A comprehensive research program has been designed and implemented to establish the overall performance of <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> by experimental testing, analytical and simulation studies. For the first time, extensive experimental testing has been conducted on full-scale specimen under field conditions reproduced in a large-scale environmental chamber. The two-story full-size specimen (3. 8 m by 6. 7 m) includes two commercially available <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems with different design details. The experimental program includes: (1) full-scale air leakage test, (2) thermal performance test, (3) measurement of local convection film coefficient, and, (4) measurement of local draft induced by <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> cold surface. The analytical and simulation studies include: (1) effect of design details on thermal transmittance using the simulation program FRAME, (2) effect of local film coefficients on the condensation resistance prediction using the simulation program FRAME, (3) effect of thermal performance of <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> on occupant thermal comfort and on energy consumption. Results from extensive testing and simulations have revealed the intricate links among the components, the overall wall assembly performance and the impact on the energy use and indoor comfort; and, therefore, provided solid technical information for manufacturers on the productive direction of future R&D and for designers on the selection of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems to achieve energy-efficient buildings with healthy and comfort indoor environment. The extensive testing provided a valuable set of experimental data to validate the current and future computer simulation programs...|$|R

40|$|Original article: The Tenth International Conference on Waste Management and Technology (ICWMT) Massive {{construction}} and demolition waste is generated in China's rapid development. Within {{this kind of}} waste, glass material produced form the widely applied <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system contributes a lot. Currently, the majority of waste glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is simply disposed in landfills or dumping, which not only significantly threats the scarcity of land resources, but also raises risks for surrounding environment and human health. However, there is relatively little work in China which focuses on the management of glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> waste produced from demolition and reconstruction sites. Therefore, this study systematically reviews current application and further development of glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system in Shenzhen city (a mega city of China), and then analyzes the compositions and characteristics of the generation of waste glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> The {{results show that the}} total gross surface area of buildings that use glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system has approximately reached to 3 million m 2 in the region (Nanshan district in Shenzhen). It also indicates that there is around 2 kg of waste which could be produced from the construction of glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> per m 2 and will generate more than 6000 tons of glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> waste, including the whole life cycle from manufactory and construction. In additional, several recommendations to sound management of the waste glass <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> are proposed based on the further review of the management strategies and process methods employed in developed counties.

40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{national}} {{greenhouse gas}} {{reduction in the}} building sector, heating and cooling energy in buildings should be reduced. The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various thermal bridges. In particular, a metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> comprises a number of thermal bridges at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce thermal bridges in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing thermal bridges. For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> were evaluated. The alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges. As results, the effective U-value of the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> In conclusion, the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> considerably influenced the savings in building energy needs by reducing thermal bridges...|$|R
