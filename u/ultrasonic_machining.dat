50|$|Ultrasonic {{vibration}} machining is {{a unique}} non-traditional manufacturing process because it can produce parts with high precision that are made of hard and brittle materials which are often difficult to machine. Additionally, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machining</b> is capable of manufacturing fragile materials such as glass and non-conductive metals {{that can not be}} machined by alternative methods such as electrical discharge machining and electrochemical machining. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>machining</b> is able to produce high-tolerance parts because there is no distortion of the worked material. The absence of distortion is due to no heat generation from the sonotrode against the work piece and is beneficial because the physical properties of the part will remain uniform throughout. Furthermore, no burrs are created in the process, thus fewer operations are required to produce a finished part.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to small-scale components, ultrasonic vibration machining {{is used for}} structural components because of the required precision and surface quality provided by the method. The process can safely and effectively create shapes out of high-quality single crystal materials that are often necessary but difficult to generate during normal crystal growth.

50|$|Because {{ultrasonic}} vibration machining {{is driven}} by microchipping or erosion mechanisms, the material removal rate of metals can be slow and the sonotrode tip can wear down quickly from the constant impact of abrasive particles on the tool. Moreover, drilling deep holes in parts can prove difficult as the abrasive slurry will not effectively reach {{the bottom of the}} hole. Note, rotary <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>machining</b> is efficient at drilling deep holes in ceramics because the absence of a slurry cutting fluid and the cutting tool is coated in harder diamond abrasives.

50|$|Since {{ultrasonic}} vibration machining {{does not}} use subtractive methods that may alter the physical properties of a workpiece, such as thermal, chemical, or electrical processes, it has many useful applications for materials that are more brittle and sensitive than traditional machining metals. Materials that are commonly machined using ultrasonic methods include ceramics, carbides, glass, precious stones and hardened steels. These materials are used in optical and electrical applications where more precise machining methods are required to ensure dimensional accuracy and quality performance of hard and brittle materials. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>machining</b> is precise enough {{to be used in}} the creation of microelectromechanical system components such as micro-structured glass wafers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>machining,</b> or {{strictly}} speaking the [...] "Ultrasonic vibration machining", is a subtraction manufacturing process that removes {{material from the}} surface of a part through high frequency, low amplitude vibrations of a tool against the material surface in the presence of fine abrasive particles. The tool travels vertically or orthogonal {{to the surface of the}} part at amplitudes of 0.05 to 0.125 mm (0.002 to 0.005 in.). The fine abrasive grains are mixed with water to form a slurry that is distributed across the part and the tip of the tool. Typical grain sizes of the abrasive material range from 100 to 1000, where smaller grains (higher grain number) produce smoother surface finishes.|$|E
5000|$|The colloquial sense {{implying}} conventional {{metal cutting}} is also growing obsolete because of changing technology over the decades.
