The Walsh catheter is particularly useful after prostatectomy for it drains the bladder without infection or clot retention. The Gibbon catheter has largely obviated the necessity of performing emergency prostatectomy.

The patient did not report any history of any penile trauma or local infection but has experienced transient swelling of the perineal region following urination. Initial surgical treatment consisted of surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. At this time reconstructive surgery was impossible and a suprapubic cystostomy was performed.

5000|$|Surgical {{repair of}} severe hypospadias may require {{multiple}} procedures and mucosal grafting. Preputial skin {{is often used}} for grafting and circumcision should be avoided before repair. In a minority of patients with severe hypospadias, surgery produces unsatisfactory results, such as scarring, curvature, or formation of <b>urethral</b> <b>fistulas,</b> diverticula, or strictures. A fistula is an unwanted opening through the skin along {{the course of the}} urethra, and can result in urinary leakage or an abnormal stream. A diverticulum is an [...] "outpocketing" [...] of the lining of the urethra which interferes with urinary flow and may result in posturination leakage. A stricture is a narrowing of the urethra severe enough to obstruct flow.

Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age. Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States. Severe to catastrophic complications, including death, are so rare that they are reported only as individual case reports.

"nCase Presentation: A 37 -year-old man was shot with firearm to the superior part of the right pelvis. He underwent delayed reconstruction surgery for urethral rupture. After 10 months of initial injury, he presented with inability to urinate, and history of progressive pain in the right hip joint accompanied by low-grade fever, which started {{two months after the}} initial injury. In retrograde urethrography and antegrade cystography, a 5 cm-long stricture and a fistula tract to the right hip joint were detected. Hip x-ray showed evidence of acetabular cavity and femoral head destruction diagnostic of complicated septic arthritis. The patient subsequently underwent reconstructive surgery for the urethral stricture and <b>urethral</b> <b>fistula</b> via a transperineal approach followed by total hip arthroplasty. "nConclusion: Hip joint contamination with urine following urethro-acetabular fistula may lead to severe and disabling complications such as septic arthritis.

40|$|Purpose: The {{most common}} {{techniques}} {{to reconstruct the}} urethra for severe hypospadias or epispadias involve use of the genital skin. Buccal mucosa free graft is usually used in a second operation due to a paucity of usable genital tissue. We report our experience using buccalmucosafreegraft as primary surgery for hypospadias and epispadias. Materials and Methods: Between 1989 and 2001 the urethra was reconstructed using buccal mucosa free graft as a primary operation in 22 patients 3 to 13 years old with middle or proximal hypospadias (20) and exstrophy/epispadias (2). In the first 5 cases of hypospadias the buccal mucosa was combined with bladder mucosa. In the 2 exstrophy/epispadias cases treated with the penile disassembly technique the distal part of the urethra was reconstructed with buccal mucosa. Results: At mean 5 -year followup 2 cases of <b>urethral</b> <b>fistulas</b> and 1 case of severe stenosis of the proximal anastomosis were observed, which required surgical correction. In 4 other cases mild stenosis of the anastomosis required urethral dilations {{in the first month}} after surgery. Conclusions: Buccal mucosa is an excellent source of graft material for urethral replacement in complex urethroplasties as primary surgery. It is readily available, elastic, resistant and technically easy to harvest. </br...|$|R

Comparing the graft caliber to the control urethra at 3 months, a larger caliber was found in the cell-seeded grafts (96. 6 % of the normal caliber) than in the acellular grafts (42. 3 %). Histology of acellular and cell-seeded grafts did not show any sign of inflammation, and spontaneous regrowth of urothelium could be demonstrated in all grafts. <b>Urethral</b> <b>fistulae,</b> sometimes associated with stenosis, were observed, which might be prevented by urethral catheter application.

The results of 299 primary hypospadias corrections were analyzed. All procedures were performed by three experienced pediatric urologists. Mean patient age at operation was 16. 3 months. Follow-up was between 6 months and 5. 5 years. Distal hypospadias repair was carried out in 242 patients, with tubularized incised plate reconstruction in 100 patients, advancement in 128, and the Mathieu technique in 14. During follow-up, complications occurred overall in 93 patients (31 %). For distal hypospadias complications occurred in 59 patients (24 %).

40|$|Purpose: Several {{urethral}} {{conditions may}} require tissue substitution. One collagen-base biomaterial that recently {{emerged as an}} option is small intestinal submucosa (SIS). The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the results of SIS and buccal mucosa for urethral substitution in rabbits. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six North Folk male rabbits were randomized into three groups. In all animals, a 10 · 5 mm urethral segment was excised, and the urethral defect was repaired using a one-layer SIS patch (group I [GI]); four-layer SIS (group II [GII]); or buccal mucosa (group III [GIII]). Urethrography was performed preoperatively and after 12 weeks. After sacrifice, graft retraction was objectively measured using Scion Image computer analysis and by calculation of ellipse area. The grade of fibrosis, inflammatory reaction, vascular/ epithelial regeneration, and collagen III/I ratio were analyzed by hematoxylin/eosin and Picrosirius red staining. Results: Urethrography confirmed a wide urethral caliber without any signs of strictures after surgery. <b>Urethral</b> <b>fistulae</b> was diagnosed in 8. 3 % of cases (1 animal each group).

40|$|Abstract Background A vaginal fistula is {{a devastating}} condition, {{affecting}} an estimated 2 million {{girls and women}} across Africa and Asia. There are numerous challenges associated with providing fistula repair services in developing countries, including limited availability of operating rooms, equipment, surgeons with specialized skills, and funding from local or international donors to support surgeries and subsequent post-operative care. Finding ways of providing services in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, without compromising surgical outcomes and the overall health of the patient, is paramount. Shortening the duration of <b>urethral</b> catheterization following <b>fistula</b> repair surgery would increase treatment capacity, lower costs of services, and potentially lower risk of healthcare-associated infections among fistula patients. There {{is a lack of}} empirical evidence supporting any particular length of time for <b>urethral</b> catheterization following <b>fistula</b> repair surgery. This study will examine whether short-term (7 day) urethral catheterization is not worse by more than a minimal relevant difference to longer-term (14 day) urethral catheterization in terms of incidence of fistula repair breakdown among women with simple fistula presenting at study sites for fistula repair service. Methods/Design This study is a facility-based, multicenter, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the new proposed short-term (7 day) urethral catheterization to longer-term (14 day) urethral catheterization in terms of predicting fistula repair breakdown. The primary outcome is fistula repair breakdown up to three months following fistula repair surgery as assessed by a urinary dye test. Secondary outcomes will include repair breakdown one week following catheter removal, intermittent catheterization due to urinary retention and the occurrence of septic or febrile episodes, prolonged hospitalization for medical reasons, catheter blockage, and self-reported residual incontinence. This trial will be conducted among 512 women with simple fistula presenting at 8 study sites for fistula repair surgery over the course of 24 months at each site.
