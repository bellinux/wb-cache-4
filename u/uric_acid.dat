5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result}} in other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> are {{not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Caffeine is a methylxanthine, and is hydrophobic. The {{structure}} of caffeine allows the molecule to pass freely through biological membranes including the blood-brain barrier. Absorption in the gastrointestinal tract reaches near completion at about 99% after only 45 minutes. Half-life of caffeine for most adults is between 2.5 and 4.5 hours when consumption {{is limited to}} less than 10 mg/kg. However, during neonatal development, half-life for the fetus is significantly longer and decreases exponentially after birth to reach a normal rate at about 6 months.Cytochrome P-450, a hemeprotein, acts in liver microsomes to metabolize caffeine into dimethylxanthines, monomethylxanthines, dimethyl <b>uric</b> <b>acids,</b> monomethyl <b>uric</b> <b>acids,</b> trimethylallantoin, dimethylallantoin, and derivatives of uracil. Most caffeine is metabolized by 3-methyl demethylation, forming the metabolite of paraxanthine. Many metabolites, in addition to caffeine, act within the body and are {{partly responsible for the}} physiological response to caffeine.|$|R

5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> is present (24-hour urine <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|The {{crystallization}} of <b>uric</b> <b>acid,</b> often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of <b>uric</b> <b>acid.</b> Underexcretion of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout {{at some point in their}} lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study, Heterometrus fastigiousus venom (HFV) was {{employed}} as antigen to produce species-specific scorpion antivenom (SAV) in albino mice (NIH) strain. To determine SAV efficacy, it was pre-incubated with 10 LD 50 of HFV and then injected subcutaneously into mice. Subsequently, mortality was observed after 24 hours. Minimum effective dose (MED) was 12. 5 LD 50 of HFV/mL of SAV. SAV effectiveness to reverse HFV-induced biochemical alterations in mice was analyzed by challenge method. Simultaneously, mice received subcutaneously 40 % of 24 -hour-LD 50 of HFV and intravenously SAV. After four hours, changes in serum glucose, free amino <b>acids,</b> <b>uric</b> <b>acids,</b> pyruvic acid, cholesterol, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase enzyme level were determined.

5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of research studies point to participation in endurance exercise training as having significant detrimental effects upon reproductive hormonal profiles in men. The means used for prevention and correction of fatigue are ineffective for sexual function recovery and have contraindications and numerous side effects. The search for substances effectively restoring body functions after overtraining {{and at the same}} time sparing the reproductive function, which have no contraindications precluding their long and frequent use, is an important trend of studies. One of the candidate substances is ribose used for correction of fatigue in athletes engaged in some sports. We studied the role of ribose deficit in metabolism of the testes under conditions of excessive exercise and the potentialities of ribose use for restoration of the endocrine function of these organs. 45 male Wistar rats weighing 240 ± 20 g were used in this study. Animals were divided into 3 groups (n= 15) : control; excessive exercise; excessive exercise and received ribose treatment. Plasma concentrations of lactic, β-hydroxybutyric, <b>uric</b> <b>acids,</b> luteinizing hormone, total and free testosterone were measured by biochemical and ELISA methods. The superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activities and <b>uric</b> <b>acids,</b> malondialdehyde, glutathione, ascorbic acids, testosterone levels were estimated in the testes sample. Acute disorders of purine metabolism develop in rat testes under conditions of excessive exercise. These disorders are characterized by enhanced catabolism and reduced reutilization of purine mononucleotides and activation of oxidative stress against the background of reduced activities of the pentose phosphate pathway and antioxidant system. Administration of D-ribose to rats subjected to excessive exercise improves purine reutilization, stimulates the pentose phosphate pathway work, inhibits oxidative stress of the testes, and saves the testicular endocrine function...|$|R
5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} {{waste products}} into <b>uric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{which can be}} excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber, from which they are expelled through the anus. Production of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{exists that}} nitric oxide (NO) may mediate both {{protective}} and pathological responses during brain hypoxia (HP). Reactive oxygen species {{have also been}} implicated in the pathophysiological response of the brain tissues to HP. Therefore, this study investigated whether a NO precursor, L-arginine (L-arg), a free radical scavenger, idebenone (ID), and their combination would reduce neurological injury resulting from hemic hypoxia (HP) in rats. Adult male Wistar albino rats were injected with sodium nitrite (60 mg/kg, s. c.) to establish hemic hypoxia. ID (100 mg kg(- 1), i. p.) and/or L-arg (100 mg kg(- 1), i. p.) were administrated 24 and 1 h prior to sodium nitrite intoxication, respectively. Hypoxia significantly decreased hemoglobin concentration, while significantly increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), total nitrate/nitrite, sialic, and <b>uric</b> <b>acids</b> concentrations. Moreover, brain lipid peroxides were significantly enhanced, while reduced glutathione, L-ascorbic acids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents, and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, were significantly reduced in the brain tissue. Pretreatment with either ID or L-arg altered {{the majority of the}} above-mentioned biochemical changes in hypoxic rats. Additionally, the combination of these two agents significantly reduced injury marker enzyme activities as well as serum sialic, and <b>uric</b> <b>acids</b> level (P > 0. 05 vs. control). Moreover, this combination exerted a synergistic antioxidant effect by blocking the induction of lipid peroxidation, preserving brain energy (ATP) content, and greatly reducing the hypoxic alterations in brain enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Histopathological examination of the brain tissue supported these biochemical findings. This study showed that ID and L-arg were capable of reducing neurological injury following HP in rat, and support the idea of the usefulness of L-arg and ID as prophylaxis from hypoxic brain injury.
