40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study of the spheres of urban influence with regard to all cities in China (not including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan Province of China) in the years 1990, 2000 and 2009. An optimized gravity model with comprehensive time distance was used to carry out a detailed analysis of the spatial patterns of Chinese spheres of urban influence and the spatial characteristics of <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations.</b> Such <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> are characterized by high density population and a developed economy, which are also considered as the national competition unit. This paper initially identifies four spatial patterns of <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> based on the spatial layout of city groups during their evolution. Some basic characteristics of <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> are outlined, including the number of cities, the size of cities and the functions of urban centers. These characteristics are examined by using statistical methods and Geographic Information System (GIS). The main findings from this research are that the development stages and structures of <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> in China vary significantly. It is also clear that the stages and evolution of spatial patterns are strongly affected and dominated by both policy and location factors...|$|R

30|$|Given the {{increase}} in economic transformation and enhanced modernization, a series of highly efficient <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> with a strong radiating effect, excellent urban system, and strong complementary functions has been formed and is being continuously optimized in the eastern China. <b>Urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> in the northeastern and midwestern regions are also under development. The Proposal on Formulating the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 – 2020) [10] on National Economic and Social Development, issued by the Central Committee of Communist Party of China, specified the following: “the radiating effect and leading role of <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> is to be emphasized; {{the development of the}} three major <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations,</b> including the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Province region, Yangtze River Delta mega region, and Pearl River Delta mega region should be optimized; and the <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> of Northeast China, Central Plain, middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Chengdu-Chongqing region, and Guanzhong Plain should be developed.” The Proposal also suggested that “a batch of central cities should be developed, and regional service function strengthened.” With the support of this policy, the radiating effect and leading role of central cities will gradually expand. Extra-large and megacities will continue to decentralize their economic and other functions as well as strengthen the infrastructure and sharing of public services with neighboring towns and cities and even neighboring provinces, thereby forming metropolitan areas with high commuting efficiency and integrated development. The construction of <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> and metropolitan areas will be implemented rapidly over the 5  years. As a result, the demand for public transit and commuting will also increase significantly. These changes will further increase the development potential of urban rail transit systems. In addition, the larger area of travel and commuting demand generated by the metropolitan areas and <b>urban</b> <b>agglomerations</b> is likely to create more opportunities for the development of different types of urban rail transit, such as urban rapid transit.|$|R
