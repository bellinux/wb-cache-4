40|$|I {{compare the}} {{predictions}} of two types of dynastic models for the persistence of wealth across generations: models that focus on <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risk</b> and intergenerational consumption smoothing but abstract from the fertility decision, such as Loury [1981] and Laitner [1992], and models without risk {{that focus on the}} fertility decision, such as Becker and Barro [1988]. I show that when both <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risk</b> and fertility decisions are present, a striking result obtains: wealthier parents have more children, but the transfer to each child is independent of wealth. Since this result is counterfactual, I also discuss extensions that can resurrect persistence.

40|$|<b>Uninsurable</b> <b>risks</b> have {{significant}} impact on expenses of private and public sectors of economy. In spite of several commercial insurance products and high quality of insurance services current trend of insurance industry is set to define exceptions of insurance protection. The highest losses caused by realization of <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risks</b> in the Czech Republic are constituted by consequences of floods, deluges and overflows. Recent history of flood occurrence emphasizes insufficiency of prevention, protection and loss solution. Due to these risk factors we have focused our research on issues of <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risks</b> in conditions of the Czech insurance market. The system solution is based on fund approach to ensure commercial insurance protection. Multi-Source System Solution of <b>Uninsurable</b> <b>Risks</b> is purposed {{in the form of}} fund with participation of the state authority. Our solution depends on pool creation and primarily should cover enormous claims development. Assumption of fund profitability encourages insurer motivation to become a pool member. Important part of research represents calculation of gross premium. Assessment of input data and calculation of premium are based on real published data and conform to real market development in the Czech Republic. Calculations are also based on our estimations of risk development. This research highlights the importance of <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risks</b> solution. Effective instrument able to protect lives and property is an innovative commercial insurance product. Our commercial solution is a way to strengthen the role of insurance in a field of <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risks.</b> The system solution is designed to conditions of the Czech insurance market and takes into account special domestic factors.

40|$|This paper {{reveals a}} {{positive}} effect of the corporate income tax on capital formation {{in the presence of}} liquidity constraints and <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risk.</b> In the model, individuals choose whether to become entrepreneurs or workers. Workers save by holding corporate equity and therefore are subject to double taxation, as the return on their savings is taxed at both the corporate and personal level. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, save by investing in their businesses and are only taxed at the personal level. This differential tax treatment of entrepreneurs results in an increase in capital accumulation as entrepreneurs must save in response to liquidity constraints and <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risk.</b> A calibrated version of the model is used to quantify the consequences of eliminating the corporate tax. Interestingly, the removal of the corporate income tax decreases capital formation: by eliminating double taxation, the return on workers ’ savings increases, which in turn reduces the number of entrepreneurs. Consequently, the stock of capital decreases since entrepreneurs have a higher marginal rate of saving than workers as they save not only for life-cycle motives, but also to self-insure against business risk and to start and finance their businesses...|$|E

We relate this measure to consumers' endowment and attributes and to measures of background risk and liquidity constraints.

We also find that households' attributes are of little help in predicting their degree of risk aversion, which is characterized by massive unexplained heterogeneity. However, the consumers' environment affects risk aversion. Individuals who are more likely to face income uncertainty or to become liquidity constrained exhibit a higher degree of absolute risk aversion, consistent with recent theories of attitudes towards risk in the presence of <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risks.</b> Risk aversion, heterogeneous preferences, household characteristics, background risk. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} convexification of the returns to {{schooling}} that characterized Latin American {{countries in the}} 1990 s: from a linear relationship {{at the end of}} the 1980 s, the wage pro…le became a convex function of the level of education. This was the result of the combined effect of an increase in the wage differentials between Higher and Intermediate education and a decline in the differential between Intermediate and Basic education. The aim of this paper is to quantify how much of the returns’ convexification can be explained by the general equilibrium effects of changes in the supply by education in response to a change in technology that increased the demand for skilled labour, given the level of credit constraints and <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risk</b> that characterized the economy. I develop and simulate a dynamic general equilibrium model of savings and educational choices under credit constraints and <b>uninsurable</b> <b>risk.</b> The parameters of the model are estimated using micro data from Mexico between 1987 and 2002. The results of the simulations show that the convexification of the returns was the result of the general equilibrium effects of an increase in the relative supply of Intermediate education in response to a skill-biased technological change. The supply of education did not increase proportionally at the Higher level due to the tightness of the credit constraints that decreased at Intermediate and remained binding at Higher education.
