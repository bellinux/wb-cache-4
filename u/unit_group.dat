25|$|The {{endomorphism}} {{ring of the}} {{abelian group}} Z/nZ is isomorphic to Z/nZ itself as a ring. Under this isomorphism, the number r corresponds to the endomorphism of Z/nZ that maps each element to the sum of r copies of it. This is a bijection {{if and only if}} r is coprime with n, so the automorphism group of Z/nZ is isomorphic to the <b>unit</b> <b>group</b> (Z/nZ)×.|$|E

5000|$|In {{algebraic}} number theory, a fundamental unit is a generator (modulo {{the roots of}} unity) for the <b>unit</b> <b>group</b> of the ring of integers of a number field, when that group has rank 1 (i.e. when the <b>unit</b> <b>group</b> modulo its torsion subgroup is infinite cyclic). Dirichlet's unit theorem shows that the <b>unit</b> <b>group</b> has rank 1 exactly when the number field is a real quadratic field, a complex cubic field, or a totally imaginary quartic field. When the <b>unit</b> <b>group</b> has rank ≥ 1, a basis of it modulo its torsion is called a fundamental system of units.
