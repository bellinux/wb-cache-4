25|$|The Realist Writers Group was a {{collective}} of writers, usually communists but also composed of left wing supporters and established in Australia in 1944. The first collective began in Melbourne {{and the movement}} spread to Brisbane in 1950, then to Sydney in 1952, Perth in 1960 and Newcastle in 1963. In 1960 a National Council of Groups was established to internationally link the branches with groups in New Zealand, Canada, the USA and countries under communist rule. The Realist Writers intentions were defined by their constitution as 'literary organizations {{of the working class}} movement... to carry forward the revolutionary and democratic traditions of Australian literature'. The first published journal came from the Melbourne branch titled Realist Writer and appeared quarterly from March 1952 to April 1954 when it was incorporated into Overland. The first two issues were edited by Bill Wannan and by Stephen Murray-Smith for the next seven. Noteworthy contributors included David Martin, Frank Hardy, Laurence Collinson, John Manifold, John Morrison, Eric Lambert and Katharine Susannah Prichard. A version of the Realist Writer appeared from the Sydney branch in renewed form in 1958 edited by Frank Hardy and from 1960 appeared three times a year until the groups began to disintegrate in the 1970s.
