With Czech specialists, all Pbv 501 IFVs were upgraded to Swedish Army standards (Pbv 501A) from 1996. A few were upgraded further to serve as command vehicles. There were 340 vehicles in service in 2006 when they were withdrawn from the I 2, I 12, and I 16 infantry regiments, and the P 4 armored regiment. 250 vehicles were in mint condition having driven less than 120 km. Sweden offered its BMP-1s, plus spare parts and training equipment for sale. The original plan had been to sell them to a single sovereign customer.

40|$|Part 13 : Short PapersInternational audienceIn {{an on-line}} transaction, a client usually have to present some authenticators (password, <b>user</b> <b>certificate</b> or both) to the server. However, those authenticators {{are exposed to}} {{client-side}} malware such that the malware is able to obtain the server-client messages, or impersonate the user to build another “secure” channel with the server. The present paper aims to patch this client-side security flaw with a novel password-input method. Specifically, it enables a user to input a password by clicking an on-screen CAPTCHA keyboard, rather than a keyboard typing. The CAPTCHA keyboard is designed to greatly increase the difficulty of password eavesdropping and phishing in a malicious environment given that the malware can not monitor the browser secret memory space. Our implementation shows that Firwfox browser incorporated with CAPTCHA Keyboard and smartcard is viable and transparent over HTTPS protocol...|$|E

40|$|To {{decide whether}} or not to trust a {{certificate}} of a user, the certification path from the root CA (RCA) to the end CA (ECA) should be verified together with the <b>user</b> <b>certificate</b> itself. Because CAs are a kind of stable and responsible entities, path validation can be treated in a special way different from the veri cation of end user certificates. In this paper we propose two efficient offline path validation schemes using trusted entities. In the first scheme, ECA has additional role of executing the path validation operation by himself and publishing the result as a self path validation statement (SPVS). In the second scheme, a trusted server executes the path validation operations for all CAs in the domain of RCA and publishes the result as a revoked CA certificate list (RCACL). End users can skip path validation operation if he can trust SPVS or RCACL. We discuss the efficiency and trust issues of proposed schemes compared with previous ones...|$|E

The access control models today are mostly static {{and they are}} not well-suited for the service-oriented environments where information access is dynamic in nature.
