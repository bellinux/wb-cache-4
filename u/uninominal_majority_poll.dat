50|$|The {{legislative}} election of 2016 unfolded differently compared to 2012 and 2008. On 24 February 2015, the Electoral Code Commission decided in principle {{for the future}} electoral law to return to party-list proportional representation, thereby relinquishing the first-past-the-post (uninominal) voting system as introduced in 2008. The option of turning the Parliament of Romania into a perfectly bicameral parliament, with some 300 deputies being elected on a closed list and 100 senators being elected by a single-round <b>uninominal</b> <b>majority</b> vote, had been discussed for years and even agreed upon between the ruling Social Democratic Party and the opposition. The new electoral law promulgated by President Klaus Iohannis on 20 July 2015 however didn't retain uninominal constituencies for the Senate. Closely sticking to the commission's recommendations, the new electoral law completely returned to party-list proportional representation.|$|R

If, as of May 20 th 1990 and till the autumnof 2004, parliamentary elections held in Romania were conducted in the form ofproportional representation, by voting on political party lists, in electoraldistricts strictly drawn by type and capital district, after the 2004 electiondebates around the modification of the voting system were approached withincreased interest and very intense discussions at the decision – making levelswere initiated. Thus, after lengthy debates in parliament and inside the civil society, and alsofollowing the referendum on 25 th of November 2007, initiated by the Presidentunder the Constitution of Romania (in consultation with the Parliament), it wasdecided that the Romanian electoral system would be modified from theproportional party lists voting method into the <b>uninominal</b> <b>majority</b> vote inelectoral constituencies and uninominal colleges (districts).

2500|$|Polls on the Canadian monarchy {{have been}} {{regularly}} conducted, since the 1990s, typically coinciding with a royal tour or other major royal event. In 2008, Peter Boyce wrote that successive polls since the 1990s showed an increasing disaffection with the monarchy, but also noted internal contradictions in specific poll results. Polls on the institution {{have been accused}} of using [...] "inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous wording." [...] Monarchists assert the use of the inaccurate word [...] "British" [...] in a poll question on the Canadian monarchy skews the results, while republicans say the same about the use of [...] "sever" [...] or [...] "abolish". It has also been noted, and confirmed by polls, that Canadians are not well educated about the monarchy and its role. In 2002, the <b>majority</b> <b>polled</b> thought the prime minister was head of state, only 5% knowing it was the Queen. Both republicans and monarchists in Canada have noted this fact in relation to polls on the monarchy.|$|R
