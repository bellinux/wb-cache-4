Their enduring following, described as [...] "cult-like", is notable in that their fanbase and legacy have continuously remained strong throughout their entire career whereas other bands from the 2000s emo scene have faded into obscurity. They have been widely praised by critics for creating artistic statements with their music instead of aiming for mainstream success like many of their contemporaries did. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork remarked, [...] "popular guitar music in 2017 has been undeniably shaped by Brand New, a band who has served not just as damaged role models but as a formative musical influence."

2500|$|Informal logic as a {{distinguished}} enterprise under this name emerged roughly {{in the late}} 1970s as a sub-field of philosophy.

Kahane's textbook was described on the notice of his death in the Proceedings And Addresses of the American Philosophical Association (2002) as [...] "a text in informal logic, [...] was intended to enable students to cope with the misleading rhetoric one frequently finds in the media and in political discourse.

2500|$|Meanwhile, in 1793, France {{declared}} war on Great Britain.
