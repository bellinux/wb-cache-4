Accessibility reflects {{the ability of}} a location providing people with access opportunities to human life and associated economy activities through connecting land use and transportation facilities. To investigate spatial distribution of transportation accessibility, we use the “natural cutting” method to visualize the defined index in each town included in the PRD region. A total of 373 nodes in the study area are classified into three classes by the ratio of transportation land usage to the land area that covers the concerned transportation infrastructures (or transportation land <b>use</b> <b>ratio,</b> R [...] i [...]). The first class area is defined as the area with the transportation land <b>use</b> <b>ratio</b> ranging from 3.06 to 7.93 %. The first class land use covers 29 nodes. The land surrounding Guangzhou Baiyun Songzhou Road has the highest transportation land <b>use</b> <b>ratio</b> (7.93 %). For the second class land, transportation land <b>use</b> <b>ratio</b> ranges 1.37 – 3.06 % and 134 nodes are covered, mainly distributed in Guangzhou, Foshan, Dongwan, and Shenzhen. The third class land includes 210 nodes with transportation land <b>use</b> <b>ratio</b> lower than 1.37 %. Thus, the layout of the transportation infrastructure development appears like “center + radiation” pattern in the PRD region. The central areas are mainly located in Guangzhou and Foshan, and the second center is in Shenzhen. Those central areas are connected with peripheral areas through freeways. Less highway infrastructures have been developed in the skirting areas. Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hongkong corridor has been formed in the east area of the PRD region. The transportation land <b>use</b> <b>ratio</b> is much lower in western and northern areas, which is a vulnerable factor in propelling the development inside the PRD region.|$|R

30|$|An {{interesting}} finding {{from our}} study was {{that the relationship between}} signal intensity and Pfirrmann’s was similar regardless of whether we used raw values or ratios. This suggests that raw scores may be acceptable for comparing between individuals. In particular we note that the relationship between disc height and Pfirrmann scores was similar regardless of whether we <b>used</b> <b>ratios</b> that allowed for a person’s height or not. Similarly the common practice of adjusting signal intensity by the CSF at a similar disc level did not influence the relationship with Pfirrmann scores. Earlier MRI imaging may have had greater spatially dependent inhomogeneity of signal intensity in the FOV than was present in our study. If however, significant spatially dependent inhomogeneity did exist it would seem logical that using some reference to allow for this would still be important to compare between discs and different scans. In our study we used a single 3 T scanner and followed a strict protocol. Where {{this is not the case}} the use of CSF reference may be more important. We would expect the findings to be similar on a 1.5 T scanner, allowing for differences in spatial resolution and the intrinsic reduction in signal to noise ratio.
