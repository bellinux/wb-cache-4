5|$|In June 2014, YouTube {{introduced}} videos {{playing at}} 60 frames per second, {{in order to}} reproduce video games with a frame rate comparable to high-end graphics cards. The videos play back at a resolution of 720p or higher. YouTube videos are available {{in a range of}} quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the VP9 format with stereo Opus audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> reports Windows XP, then H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video with stereo AAC audio is used instead.|$|E
25|$|Developed by the <b>User</b> <b>Agent</b> Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, the UAAG 1.0 {{became a}} W3C Recommendation on 17 December 2002.

Techniques for <b>User</b> <b>Agent</b> Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 was published as a W3C Note on the same day; it provides techniques for satisfying the checkpoints defined in UAAG 1.0.|$|E

25|$|Web {{crawlers}} typically {{identify themselves}} to a Web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request. Web site administrators typically examine their Web servers' log and use the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server and how often. The <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> field may include a URL where the Web site administrator may find out {{more information about the}} crawler. Examining Web server log is tedious task, and therefore some administrators use tools to identify, track and verify Web crawlers. Spambots and other malicious Web crawlers are unlikely to place identifying information in the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> field, or they may mask their identity as a browser or other well-known crawler.|$|E

The agent-based Grid scheduling system involves <b>user</b> <b>agents,</b> local scheduler agents, and super scheduler <b>agents.</b> <b>User</b> <b>agents</b> submit jobs to Grid Compute resources. Local scheduler agents schedule jobs on Compute resources. Super scheduler agents act as mediators between the local scheduler <b>agents</b> and the <b>user</b> <b>agents</b> and select the candidate local scheduler agents in the associated cluster to execute the jobs...|$|R

25|$|Default <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> {{strings of}} most browsers have pieces of strings {{from one or}} more other browsers, so that if the browser is unknown to a website, it can be {{identified}} as one of those. For example, Safari has not only “Mozilla/5.0”, but also “KHTML” (from which Safari’s WebKit was forked) and “Gecko” (the engine of Firefox).|$|E
25|$|Websites {{often include}} code to detect browser version {{to adjust the}} page design sent {{according}} to the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> string received. This may mean that less-popular browsers are not sent complex content (even though {{they might be able}} to deal with it correctly) or, in extreme cases, refused all content. Thus, various browsers have a feature to cloak or spoof their identification to force certain server-side content.|$|E

The XCAP (RFC 4825), carried by HTTP, allows <b>User</b> <b>Agents</b> to communicate their presence rules to a XCAP server, which rules the information exposed by the presence server.

2500|$|Due to {{technical}} improvements of the browser, the Internet Explorer developer team {{decided to change}} the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> (UA) string. The Mozilla/4.0 token was changed to Mozilla/5.0 to match the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> strings of other recent browsers and to indicate that Internet Explorer 9 is more interoperable than previous versions. The Trident/4.0 token was likewise changed to Trident/5.0. Because long, extended UA strings cause compatibility issues, Internet Explorer 9's default UA string does not include [...]NET identifiers or other [...] "pre-platform" [...] and [...] "post-platform" [...] tokens that were sent by previous versions of the browser. The extended string is still available to websites via the browser's [...]userAgent property, and is sent when a web page is displayed in compatibility mode.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally {{websites}} {{are written}} {{in such a way}} that they effectively block certain browsers. [...] One common reason for this is that the website has been tested to work with only a limited number of browsers, and so the site owners enforce that only tested browsers are allowed to view the content, while all other browsers are sent a [...] "failure" [...] message, and instruction to use another browser. [...] Many of the untested browsers may still be otherwise capable of rendering the content. [...] Sophisticated users who are aware of this may then [...] "spoof" [...] the <b>user</b> <b>agent</b> string in order to gain access to the site.|$|E
