40|$|Counterfeit {{equipment}} {{is becoming a}} major threat to nuclear safety globally. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) in India housing two VVER- 1000 reactors, imported from Russia is being delayed because of counterfiet, substandard and obsolete equitpment. The polar crane, the limb of the reactor, is defective as its hoisting capacity is less than 80 % of its nameplate capacity. The crane is used for installing the equipment inside the reactor building and also for removing spent fuel. The contract said {{that there will be no}} weld in the beltline of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). The received vessels have two circumferential welds on the beltline. RPV, the heart of the reactor is irreplaceable and hence determines the life of the reactor. RPV and polar crane are safety grade equipment. The core-damage frequency (CDF) of the reactor in the contract was 10 − 7 reactor-years, while the supplied reactor has a CDF of 10 − 5 reactor-years. Two <b>units</b> of <b>generator</b> <b>transformers</b> were received as damaged and these were dismantled and reassembled at the site.

40|$|International audienceReliability and {{availability}} of electric power system equipment (e. g., <b>generator</b> <b>units,</b> <b>transformers)</b> are often evaluated by defining and solving Markov models. Transition rates among the identified equipment states are estimated from experimental and field data, or expert judgment, with inevitable uncertainty. For model understanding and to guide validation and confidence building, it is of interest to investigate {{the effects of the}} uncertainty in the input transition rates on the output reliability {{and availability}}. To this aim, Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can be used for defining importance (sensitivity) indexes that allow a ranking of the transition rates with respect to their influence on the uncertainty in the output. In general, GSA requires a large number of model evaluations. In this paper, a metamodel is defined to estimate the performance index of interest (e. g. reliability or availability). The metamodel is built based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), a multidimensional polynomial model approximation whose coefficients are determined by evaluating the model in a reduced set of predetermined values of the input. The proposed approach is illustrated on a power generating unit...|$|R

40|$|Languages {{for music}} audio {{processing}} typically offer a large assortment of <b>unit</b> <b>generators.</b> There is great duplication among different language implementations, as each language must implement {{many of the}} same (or nearly the same) <b>unit</b> <b>generators.</b> Csound has a large library of <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> and could be a useful source of reusable <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> for other languages or for direct use in applications. In this study, we consider how Csound <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> can be exposed to direct access by other audio processing languages. Using Aura as an example, we modified Csound to allow efficient, dynamic allocation of individual <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> without using the Csound compiler or writing Csound instruments. We then extended Aura using automatic code generation so that Csound <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> can be accessed in the normal way from within Aura. In this scheme, Csound details are completely hidden from Aura users. We suggest that these techniques might eliminate most of the effort of building <b>unit</b> <b>generator</b> libraries and could help with the implementation of embedded audio systems where <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> are needed but a full embedded Csound engine is not required.
