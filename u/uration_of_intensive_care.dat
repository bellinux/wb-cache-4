40|$|<b>Intensive</b> <b>care</b> {{medicine}} {{is an expensive}} technology but, under certain circumstances also an effective one. Precisely how expensive {{and under what circumstances}} it is most effective are unclear. Studies purporting to address the question of the cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> medicine are inconclusive because of deficiencies in method. In this paper, a case is made for an economic evaluation <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care.</b> The research evidence is reviewed and shortcomings in the methods adopted and highlighted. Finally, the practical implications of this literature for both researchers and the managers <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> units are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The ascent <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> {{medicine}} from a subspecialty to {{a discipline}} {{in its own}} right in just over 25 years represents a marvellous achievement. Although the events resulting from the polio epidemic in Scandinavia in the 1950 s are the original forerunners <b>of</b> modern-day <b>intensive</b> <b>care,</b> Australia and New Zealand were among the first countries to recognize the importance of developing it as a specialty. 1 These two countries now also have one of the best developed systems for training in and practising <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> medicine. The establishment of a common medical faculty to oversee specialist training programmes in both countries has fostered a similar style <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> practice in the two nations. This review examines the development <b>of</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> as a specialty in Australia and New Zealand and discusses some exciting changes taking place with regard to training and research...|$|R
