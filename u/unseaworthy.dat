5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, the Allies {{required}} all German U-boats to be {{sailed to}} Harwich for surrender. UB-11 was one of eight U-boats deemed <b>unseaworthy</b> and allowed to remain in Germany. UB-11 was broken up by Stinnes on 3 February 1920.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{still remains}} {{a venue for}} {{recreational}} boating and large cruise ships. It is also a route for refugees and economic migrants, some traveling in small <b>unseaworthy</b> craft and others smuggled into shipping vessels. Some flee persecution while many are economic migrants attempting to reach countries where they believe their prospects are brighter.|$|E
5|$|While {{the design}} of Monitor was well-suited for river combat, her low {{freeboard}} and heavy turret made her highly <b>unseaworthy</b> in rough waters. Under the command of John P. Bankhead, Monitor put to sea on 31 December, under tow from , as a heavy storm developed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Using chalk and a blackboard, Bankhead wrote messages alerting Rhode Island that if Monitor needed help she would signal with a red lantern.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be <b>unseaworthy.</b>|$|E
5|$|UB-11s {{commanding}} officer at commissioning only remained {{in charge of}} the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more {{commanding officer}}s assigned {{through the end of the}} war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. UB-11 was reported in use as a training vessel at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, UB-11 was deemed <b>unseaworthy</b> and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Stinnes in February 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{explanation}} for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable {{for a number of}} reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered. Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become <b>unseaworthy.</b> That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something else could have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.|$|E
5|$|By January 1947 the Army {{no longer}} needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of earth moving {{equipment}} from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She continued to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 {{it was reported that}} the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered <b>unseaworthy.</b> Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade, and it would take at least a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered for sale, and was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Heffrons {{moved to}} Melbourne, Victoria. That same year in Victoria, Heffron was {{appointed}} an organiser for the Federated Clothing Trades of the Commonwealth of Australia and also joined the leftist Victorian Socialist Party. Later in 1921 {{he moved to}} Sydney, becoming {{the secretary of the}} New South Wales branch of the Federated Marine Stewards' and Pantrymen's Association of Australasia. As the union's state secretary, a role he would hold for ten years, he took a prominent role in maritime trade unionism in Sydney. In February 1924, when the Commonwealth and Dominion Line steamer Port Lyttelton was declared 'Black' by the Labor Council of New South Wales owing to various worker's disputes and the ship having been declared <b>unseaworthy,</b> Heffron and six other union representatives acted to advise members of the Seamen's Union to refuse to work on the Port Lyttelton. For this, in April the government of Sir George Fuller had Heffron and the six other unionists arrested on the charge of conspiracy to strike action. Although controversially refused bail by the trial judge, Heffron and his fellow defendants, represented by Richard Windeyer KC and H. V. Evatt, were found not guilty and released in July 1924 by the court, a verdict that had been returned by the direction of the judge. Later joining the Australian Labor Party, at the time he showed himself to be a supporter of party leader Jack Lang, supporting Lang's successful motion at the 1923 state conference to readmit James Dooley to the party.|$|E
25|$|On 6 May 1845, Alfred was {{condemned}} at Valparaiso as <b>unseaworthy.</b> However, Roepingh, Hamburg purchased and refitted her, renaming her Deutschland.|$|E
25|$|On {{her return}} to Hobart Town, Briggs sold Cyprus to the {{government}} there for £1700. The government needed a replacement for its existing brig, Duke of York, which had become <b>unseaworthy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Martha was {{launched}} at Quebec in 1810. In 1818 she transported convicts to Port Jackson, New South Wales. She {{remained in the}} South Pacific as a whaler until she was condemned in 1820 as <b>unseaworthy</b> and then sold for breaking up.|$|E
25|$|Though Masterson {{notes the}} charter as being {{cancelled}} in February 1942 and, the ship being considered <b>unseaworthy,</b> was converted by Australians into a floating warehouse other sources note that Mactan was {{converted to a}} Red Cross service facility and recreation vessel for Army officers in Sydney.|$|E
25|$|As Albion was sailing from Jamaica to London, Curry had to {{put into}} Charleston as she was in some distress. At Charleston the {{surveyors}} condemned her as <b>unseaworthy.</b> She was sold on 11 January 1816 for breaking up. Her cargo was put on Commerce, Wilson, master.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March 1826 Harleston {{put into}} Mauritius in an <b>unseaworthy</b> state while {{returning}} to London from Timor. The surveyors at Mauritius condemned {{her and she}} was then sold for breaking up. Her cargo of 200 tons of oil was transferred to Minerva, Norris, master, for shipment to London.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there was}} a Queen that was {{returning}} from Demarara to London {{when she had to}} put into Bermuda in distress. There this ship was surveyed, condemned as <b>unseaworthy,</b> and sold for breaking up. However, her master was Pearson, and it is not clear from either Lloyd's Register or the Register of shipping which vessel this was.|$|E
25|$|Haian was {{launched}} on 24 May 1872 from the Kiangnan Arsenal, {{ahead of her}} sister ship 19 months later. The cost of the two ships meant that Yuyuen was not initially manned as there was not sufficient funds remaining {{to pay for her}} crew. Meanwhile, Haian spent the majority of her early life as a training vessel. Both Haian-class frigates were known for being <b>unseaworthy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hind, Johns, master, from Surinam {{found her}} <b>unseaworthy.</b> Still, Johns decided to sail on to England, {{possibly}} after repairs. On 14 April 1815 Hind, Johns, master, from Surinam to London, ran on shore {{in the back}} of the Goodwin Sands. She was totally lost but her master and crew landed at Margate. Only four bales of cotton and 90 bags of coffee were saved.|$|E
25|$|On 29 May 1820, Martha {{arrived at}} Port Jackson in distress, Following “boisterous weather”. She was {{surveyed}} in June and condemned as <b>unseaworthy.</b> She was sold for breaking up in August. The whaler Tuscan, Captain Coleman (or Colman), undertook to carry Marthas oil back to London. Lloyd's List reported on 6 February 1821 that the Tuscan {{had arrived in}} the Thames with the cargo from Martha.|$|E
25|$|While the Model K did not attract {{orders from}} home, {{attempts}} to export it were more successful, {{resulting in an}} order for at least 51 aircraft in both flying boat and landplane versions from the Imperial Russian Navy in 1914. The crated aircraft were shipped via Vancouver and Vladivostok, resulting in serious delays in the aircraft being reassembled, such {{that many of them}} were <b>unseaworthy</b> due to their hulls having cracked.|$|E
25|$|Doña Paz was {{traveling}} from Leyte island to the Philippine capital of Manila. The vessel was seriously overcrowded, {{with at least}} 2000 passengers not listed on the manifest. In addition, it was claimed that the ship carried no radio and that the life-jackets were locked away. But official blame was directed at the , which {{was found to be}} <b>unseaworthy,</b> and operating without a license, lookout or qualified master.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, Southard and a {{business}} associate, Cornelius Vanderbilt, were accused of endangering the lives of Union soldiers by selling the government <b>unseaworthy</b> ships at inflated prices for the 1862 Banks expedition to New Orleans. Southard was also accused of charging an illegal 5% commission on the sales. Southard was eventually censured by Congress {{for his role in}} the scandal, but Vanderbilt escaped censure, reportedly due to his political influence.|$|E
25|$|The Casco-class monitor was {{a unique}} class of light draft monitor built {{on behalf of the}} United States Navy for the Mississippi theatre during the American Civil War. The largest and most ambitious ironclad program of the war, the project was dogged by delays caused by bureaucratic meddling. Twenty ships of the class were {{eventually}} built at great expense, but proved so <b>unseaworthy</b> when trialed that they were quickly sidelined, causing a public scandal.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July 1846, the Van Buren set {{to harbor}} in Belize, where it joined the United States Revenue Marines {{squadron}} of Captain John A. Webster and aided in a blockade of Mexico's eastern coast. The VanBuren {{in particular was}} stationed {{off the coast of}} Veracruz. On 4 October, the VanBuren was declared <b>unseaworthy,</b> and ordered to New York on 11 November 1846. She was decommissioned and sold on 1 June 1847 for $1,200.|$|E
25|$|A Lloyd's surveyor, Captain Arundel, and {{the manager}} of the State Implement Works, Frank Shaw, {{declared}} her seaworthy to return to Fremantle. But the crew distrusted her condition and demanded to be paid a premium to work her back to Fremantle. The SSS summonsed each crew member for refusal of duty, so the Police Court Bench obtained an independent survey of the ship by Captain Mills, wharfinger of Carnarvon. Mills declared the ship <b>unseaworthy</b> so the magistrates dismissed the case.|$|E
25|$|Off Cap Bon on 12 August a Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} {{launched an}} aerial torpedo at Brisbane Star. It damaged her bow, almost tearing it off, but she stayed afloat. She could make only , so she rounded Cap Bon and {{anchored in the}} Gulf of Hammamet. There the harbour master of Sousse in Vichy French Tunisia boarded the ship, declared her <b>unseaworthy</b> and ordered her to be detained and enter port. Brisbane Stars Master, Captain Frederick Riley, refused and the harbour master eventually withdrew.|$|E
25|$|Migrants from {{nations that}} do not have {{automatic}} visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the United States–Mexico border, the Mona Channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the Strait of Gibraltar, Fuerteventura, and the Strait of Otranto. These methods are often dangerous: migrants have been known to suffocate in shipping containers, boxcars and trucks, sink in shipwrecks caused by <b>unseaworthy</b> vessels or die of dehydration or exposure during long walks without water.|$|E
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the deep-water anchorage and improvements in port facilities, Stanley saw a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} visiting ships in the 1840s in part due to the California Gold Rush. A boom in ship provisioning and ship-repair resulted, aided by the notoriously bad weather in the South Atlantic and around Cape Horn. Stanley and the Falkland Islands are famous as the repository of many wrecks of 19th-century ships that reached the islands only to be condemned as <b>unseaworthy</b> and were often employed as floating warehouses by local merchants.|$|E
25|$|On {{her next}} voyage, {{which was also}} her first transpacific crossing, the {{problems}} recurred, and when she arrived in Hong Kong, Roach suffered the embarrassment of having his celebrated new vessel declared <b>unseaworthy</b> by the British authorities. Roach was forced to dispatch a team of workmen to effect on-the-spot repairs, and he now found himself denigrated in the American press as a builder of inferior ships. Even with the problems however, City of Peking had still managed to set a new speed record of 22 days on her first San Francisco to Hong Kong crossing.|$|E
25|$|Ellengowan {{remained}} a shipwreck {{for four years}} until she was eventually raised in 1885 by Charles Stuart Copeland, who intended to use the vessel to supply camps along the Roper and McArthur Rivers. The vessel's first trip since being raised was a charter from the government to take a customs officer, Alfred Searcy, in search of Macassan perahu along the Northern Territory coast. However, Ellengowan was so poorly repaired after its stay {{at the bottom of}} the Daly River, that upon its return to Port Darwin she was pronounced <b>unseaworthy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fifi {{went on to}} {{join the}} Anglo-Belgian {{flotilla}} in attacking and sinking her former consort, , after a prolonged engagement which left Fifi with only two shells remaining, before she scored a crucial hit. She supported further Allied operations on the lake, which involved working with land forces, but the flotilla {{did not participate in}} any offensive actions, and the last remaining German vessel, Graf von Götzen, was left unmolested. Fifi spent her last days as a government steamer, carrying passengers across the lake, until being scuttled as <b>unseaworthy</b> in 1924.|$|E
25|$|Very few Gozo boats still survive today. One {{of these}} is the Sacra Famiglia (G32), which was built in Kalkara in 1933. It had become <b>unseaworthy</b> by the 1970s, and was beached at Mġarr. The hulk was {{eventually}} purchased by a private individual who wanted to sell it to the Ministry for Gozo. It was then purchased by the Gozo Channel Company Limited, who handed it to Wirt Għawdex and sponsored its restoration. After the boat was restored by the Caruana brothers (the sons of its original builder), it was placed on permanent display at the Żewwieqa promenade in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Dart was {{launched}} in South America under a different name. She was taken in prize circa 1806. Once under British ownership she then performed one voyage as a South Seas whaler. She then traded as a merchantman before in 1810 receiving a letter of marque. She then did something quite unusual: she made a voyage to Africa where she captured five slave ships. After this Dart returned to normal trading, this time with South America. However, in 1813 as she was returning to London from Buenos Aires she stopped at Pernambuco, where she was condemned as <b>unseaworthy.</b>|$|E
25|$|After being {{transferred}} {{back to the}} control of the Secretary of the Treasury, the VanBuren began to sail out of its homeport of Charleston, South Carolina. Still under the command of the Revenue Cutter Service, the ship participated in the Mexican-American War, first in the Gulf of Mexico, and later {{as a member of a}} squadron under the command of Captain John A. Webster. With the squadron, the VanBuren aided in a blockade off the coast of Veracruz. On 4 October 1846, the ship's crew had the Van Buren declared <b>unseaworthy.</b> It was decommissioned, and then sold for $1,200 on 1 June 1847.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April, a {{deputation}} of strikers {{witnessed a}} test of four of the collapsible boats. Only one was <b>unseaworthy</b> {{and they said that}} they were prepared to recommend the men return to work if it was replaced. However the strikers now objected to the non-union strikebreaker crew which had come on board, and demanded that they be dismissed, which the White Star Line refused. 54 sailors then left the ship, objecting to the non-union crew who they claimed were unqualified and therefore dangerous, and refused to sail with them. This led to the scheduled sailing being cancelled.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} for the alleged size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely for a display of imperial power by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats on the Yangtze River when on court business, including when reviewing Zheng He's actual expedition fleet. The Yangtze River, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable for such large but <b>unseaworthy</b> ships. Zheng He {{would not have had}} the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships. The largest ships of Zheng He's fleet were the 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2001 Labor {{was well}} {{ahead in the}} opinion polls and seemed set to win the {{election}} due {{at the end of the}} year, but in August the Tampa affair occurred when the Howard government refused to allow the , a Norwegian freighter, to set down on Australian soil at Christmas Island several hundred asylum seekers whom the crew had rescued from an <b>unseaworthy</b> boat in international waters. Beazley's compromise stance was pilloried as wishy-washy. Beazley's momentum was also stalled by the September 11 attacks. When the November 2001 election was announced, Howard had taken a commanding lead in the polls and seemed set for a huge victory. But Beazley's dogged campaigning regained some of this ground and Labor suffered only a net loss of two seats to the Coalition.|$|E
