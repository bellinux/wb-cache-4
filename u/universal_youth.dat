40|$|A report {{published}} by the National Youth Agency (NYA) in England during 2008 found {{that the majority of}} social network site on-line interaction between youth work practitioners and young people took place 'under the radar'. 'Under the radar' or 'unsanctioned', in this context was defined as outside the relevant guidance and without the line manager's agreement. My research set out to find why and how this is taking place, and the meaning attached to this practice to the different role players. As part of my qualitative research I interviewed twenty-one youth work practitioners (paid and voluntary) from a variety of backgrounds and fourteen young people over the age of 16, who are accessing <b>universal</b> <b>youth</b> work. Youth work practitioners and young people differ in their reasons for wanting to 'friend' each other on social media and what this signifies; is it a professional or personal relationship or a hybrid of the two? Boundaries and expectations of the 'audience' become blurred and perforated. Combined with the ever-changing nature of the technology itself, maintaining or developing professional relationships through social network sites becomes challenging. This article explores the boundary management techniques used by young people and practitioners in online social network sites to maintain developed relationships.

40|$|Background There are few {{interventions}} that directly address self-harming behaviour among adolescents. At {{the request of}} clinicians in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in England and working with them, we redeveloped an adult SMS text-messaging intervention {{to meet the needs}} of adolescents under the care of CAMHS who self-harm. Methods We used Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to assess the feasibility of delivering it through CAMHS. We planned to recruit 27 young people who self-harm and their clinicians, working as dyads and using the intervention (TeenTEXT) for six months. Results Despite strong engagement in principle from CAMHS teams, in practice we were able to recruit only three clinician/client dyads. Of these, two dropped out because the clients were too unwell. We identified a number of barriers to implementation. These included: a context of CAMHS in crisis, with heavy workloads and high stress levels; organisational gatekeeping practices, which limited the extent to which clinicians could engage with the intervention; perceived burdensomeness and technophobia on the part of clinicians, and a belief by many clinicians that CAMHS may be the wrong delivery setting and that the intervention may have better fit with schools and <b>universal</b> <b>youth</b> services. Conclusions User-centred design principles and the use of participatory methods in intervention development are no guarantee of implementability. Barriers to implementation cannot always be foreseen, and early clinical champions may overestimate the readiness of colleagues to embrace new ideas and technologies. NPT studies have an important role to play in identifying whether or not interventions are likely to receive widespread clinical support. This study of a text-messaging intervention to support adolescents who self-harm (TeenTEXT) showed that further work is needed to identify the right delivery setting, before testing the efficacy of the intervention. This feasibility study was funded by The BUPA Foundation. Earlier developmental work was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC). The authors would like to thank everyone who helped with the earlier intervention development work and NeonTribe, who built the TeenTEXT software.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals, to which the Polish communist government aimed after world war II, was to subordinate the young generation. The rule over the young generation was the guarantee of power for next decades. It soon turned out that, the political organizations intended for the young did not get enough support, and in 1948 it was decided call up a new organization the Powszechna Organizacja "Służba Polsce" (The Universal Organization "Service to Poland"). As soon as in June of 1945, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers Party (PPR) said, that there is a necessity of embracing the whole youth from the age of 15 in one organization, "which will help to get to the part of the youth by the democratic camp, which was not reached by other democratic youth organizations". From the beginning the army supported this plan. Bringing up a <b>universal</b> <b>youth</b> organization, would allow the army to embrace with army training the whole young generation. Also very important were the economic aspects. It assumed, that the bringing up of "SP" would allow to mobilize a large, and cheap work force, which {{would be able to do}} certain urgent work quickly. On the 25 th February of 1948 the parliament (Sejm) passed through a law about general duty of preparation for work, the army and about physical education. In part III of the statute, were the rules of forming and the functioning of organization calls of the Powszechna Organizacja "Służba Polsce". Everybody between the ages 16 to 21, and the citizens which did not serve in the army up to the age of 30, had to service and work in the "SP". The youth was obligated to periodical work in brigades, occasional work, as well as finish military training. The integral part of the statute from 25 th of February were the punishment regulations. Every young person, who did not participated in the mandatory work for the "SP" was subjected to punishment of 3 month in jail or SO thousand zlotys in fine. The bringing up of "SP" was an act with no precedents in the history of the policy toward the youth from the Polish government. The Organization registered in completely to the policy of the Polish communists of bringing up a "new man". In spite of the propaganda, which showed the doubtful advantages of "SP", the society, and especially the older generation, was not fooled. The inhabitants of Polish country and cities, took the mandatory work in the paramilitary "SP" as a announcement of the forthcoming of world war three. Despite this in 1948 in the brigades of "SP" there were over 60 thousands of young people...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{comprehensive}} assessment {{of the effects of}} mandatory seatbelt laws on self-reported seatbelt use, highway fatalities, and crash-related injuries among high school age youths using data from the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) national, state, and local Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) from 1991 to 2005, a period spanning over 20 changes in state seatbelt laws. Our quasi-experimental approaches isolate the independent effects of seatbelt laws net of demographic characteristics, area and year fixed effects, and smooth area-specific trends. Across all data sources, we find consistent evidence that state mandatory seatbelt laws - particularly those permitting primary enforcement - significantly increased seatbelt use among high school age youths by 45 - 80 %, primarily at the extensive margin. Unlike previous research for adults, however, we find evidence against the selective recruitment hypothesis: seatbelt laws had consistently larger effects on those most likely to be involved in traffic accidents (drinkers, alcohol-involved drivers). We also find that mandatory seatbelt laws significantly reduced traffic fatalities and serious injuries resulting from fatal crashes by 8 and 9 %, respectively. Our results suggest that if all states had primary enforcement seatbelt laws then regular youth seatbelt use would be nearly <b>universal</b> and <b>youth</b> fatalities would fall by about 120 per year. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} {{of studies on}} risk factors for suicide have been conducted in developed countries, and less {{work has been done}} to systematically profile risk factors in developing countries. The current paper presents a selective review of sociodemographic, clinical, and environmental/situational risk factors in developing countries. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the profiles of risk factors in developing countries demonstrate some differences from those in developed countries. In some developing countries, at least, being female, living in a rural area, and holding religious beliefs that sanction suicide may be of more relevance to suicide risk than these factors are in developed countries. Conversely, being single or having a history of mental illness may be of less relevance. Risk factors that appear to be <b>universal</b> include <b>youth</b> or old age, low socioeconomic standing, substance use, and previous suicide attempts. Recent stressful life events play a role in both developing and developed countries, although their nature may differ (e. g., social change may have more of an influence in the former). Likewise, access to means heightens risk in both, but the specific means may vary (e. g., access to pesticides is of more relevance in developing countries). These findings have clear implications for suicide prevention, suggesting that preventive efforts that have shown promise in developed countries may need to be tailored differently to address the risk factor profile of developing countries...|$|R

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} adult centered world, global policy has placed young {{people at the}} centre of the civic engagement debate. A <b>universal</b> definition of <b>youth</b> civic engagement (YCE) is lacking. The current YCE literature is pre-dominantly northern hemisphere based. A growing consensus moots southern hemisphere knowledge regarding YCE and associated themes are under-represented among existing literature. There is potentially more to gain by engaging in a critically conscious dialogue between northern and southern hemisphere knowledge. Perhaps the most conspicuous absentee from the current YCE debates is the youth voice, especially girl 2 ̆ 7 s voices. Historically, in both hemispheres the lives of girls have been overlooked. Against a legislative backdrop that advocates young {{people have the right to}} be heard. Adults tend to apply YCE definitions to research which are too narrow and restrictive to fully appreciate youth understandings of their own engagements. The necessity to work with youth perspectives to gain a more in-depth understanding of YCE becomes apparent. Initially, this may appear straightforward, but a significant challenge arises. A rights-based methodology may facilitate young people to be heard, but crucially should do so without de-stabilising the cultural context. The reason being sources of resilience which sustain young people are believed to be embedded in everyday cultural systems. If these systems become undermined, the very well-being of young people may become threatened. This thesis through a participatory methodology underpinned by cultural competency and resilience set out to contextualise YCE in Zambia. The process creation of inter-relational and intergenerational deliberative spaces generated collective knowledge regarding YCE, risk and resilience. In addition, the study provides insights into gender and other factors that restrict or privilege access to and participation in YCE opportunities in the context.

"Because {{that would}} be egotistical, and the prime {{ingredient}} of my specific against getting stiff in the tastes is that spiritual grace which is the very antidote, the very antithesis of egotism. Up to a certain point, a certain time, we are usefully employed in cultivating our tastes, in refining them, and in defining them. We cannot be too strenuous in defining them; and, {{as long as we}} are young, the catholicity of youth will preserve us from a bigoted narrowness. In æsthetic matters--and I imagine we both understand that we are dealing with these--the youngest youth has no tastes; it has merely appetites. All is fish that comes to its net; if anything, it prefers the gaudier of the finny tribes; it is only when it becomes sophisticated that its appetites turn into tastes, and it begins to appreciate the flavor of that diseased but pearl-bearing species of oyster which we call genius, because we have no accurate name for it. With the appreciation of this flavor comes the overpowering desire for it, the incessant and limitless search for it.

40|$|Although, {{compared}} to boys, adolescent girls gamble less often and less problematically, prevalence studies still show {{significant numbers of}} at risk/problem gamblers among girls. However, girl gambling {{has been on the}} sidelines of adolescent gambling research. The available studies usually focus only on a narrow set of correlates often ignoring that adolescent gambling is a complex phenomenon determined by various factors. Also, they often measure gambling related consequences with instruments that are not specifically developed for use on adolescents. In order to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} adolescent gambling this study focuses on problem gambling among girls. We consider different social, cognitive, motivational and behavioral factors as predictors of girl problem gambling. A total of 1, 372 high-school girls from 7 Croatian cities participated in the study. They provided data on their gambling activities, peer gambling, cognitive distortions related to gambling, motivation for gambling, and levels of general risky behavior. As the only instrument developed specifically for use on adolescents, the Canadian Adolescent Gambling Inventory was used to examine adverse gambling consequences. Results show 7. 4 % of girls can be considered regular gamblers, and out of those who gambled at least once in their lifetime (n = 862), 11. 2 % already experience mild adverse consequences because of their gambling (at risk gamblers), with 3. 2 % experiencing serious consequences (problem gamblers). In general, girls seem to prefer lotto and scratch cards, but sports betting seems to be the preferred game of choice among regular girl gamblers. A hierarchical regression model confirmed the importance of much the same factors identified as risky for the development of problem gambling among adolescent boys—cognitive distortions, motives to earn money, to be better at gambling and to relax, the experiences of winning large and the drive to continue gambling, together with social factors such as having friends who also gamble, being involved in other risky and delinquent behavior and higher gambling frequency. Results call into question the importance of the motive to feel better for adolescent girls problem gambling.

Universal and indicated psychological interventions delivered through face-to-face modalities had ICERs below a threshold of 50 000 per DALY averted. That is, 7350 per DALY averted (95 % uncertainty interval (UI) : dominates - 23 070) for universal prevention, and 19 550 per DALY averted (95 % UI: 3081 - 56 713) for indicated prevention. Baseline ICERs were generally robust to changes in model assumptions. We conducted a sensitivity analysis which found that internet-delivered prevention interventions were highly cost-effective when assuming intervention effect sizes of 100 and 50 % relative to effect sizes observed for face-to-face delivered interventions.

40|$|The {{fastest growing}} {{part of the}} youth work field over {{recent years has been}} the faith-based sector. The number of {{full-time}} youth workers employed by the Church of England has outnumbered those employed by the state since the early twenty-first century (Brierley, 2003; Green, 2006), and this {{does not take into account}} the growth in numbers of youth workers employed by other Christian denominations or the effect of the most recent statutory funding cuts to young people’s services during the recession. There are also well established Jewish and Muslim youth work movements (Marsh, forthcoming; Khan, 2006). In addition to this there are smaller pockets of youth work provision in other faiths. This chapter is based on research undertaken with young people and their youth workers across the Christian denominations in Birmingham. After providing some information on the research study, the rest of the chapter is presented in three main sections. The first section outlines the main themes from my interviews. The second section presents an illustrative model of Christian youth work that has emerged from my research and explores how it might apply to wider faith-based youth work. The final section explores the themes presented in section one in relation to other research that has been undertaken with young people from a range of faith groups. The chapter explores the relevance of faith-based youth work to wider youth work values. In particular it explores the tensions between understandings of youth work as a process of informal education (Jeffs and Smith, 2005), with an emphasis on choice, conversation, relationships and voluntary participation, and understandings of Christian faith-based youth work (Collins-Mayo et al, 2010) which look for a greater emphasis on faith transmission. My research found that the emphases on choice, dialogue, relationships and participation in Christian youth work settings were crucial to young people’s engagement. I also found that there were tensions in Christian youth work between meeting social, spiritual and institutional agendas and explored the ways in which youth workers manage these tensions. The conflict between starting with the needs of young people and meeting institutional demands strikes a parallel with the wider youth work field where current debates are centred on the tensions between outcome-driven, targeted provision, and the soft outcomes that are often associated with <b>universal,</b> open access <b>youth</b> work. Churches often want to impose what they perceive as young people’s ‘spiritual needs’ on all those who engage with Christian youth work, whereas youth workers recognise that young people want to choose and negotiate these needs for themselves. Similarly, in the wider youth work field, funders often define young people’s specific ‘social needs’ whilst youth workers look for young people’s participation in defining these needs...|$|R
