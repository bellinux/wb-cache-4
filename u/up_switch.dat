5000|$|In {{interviews}} in 2003 and 2008, Michael Caine {{revealed that the}} ending would have had Croker [...] "crawl <b>up,</b> <b>switch</b> on the engine and stay there for four hours until all the petrol runs out... The van bounces back up so we can all get out, but then the gold goes over." [...] The bus containing the gold would crash {{at the bottom of}} the hill where the Mafia would pick it up. The sequel would then have Croker and his men trying to get it back.|$|E
5000|$|Ortmeier {{competed for}} the {{starting}} first base job in [...] spring training, but lost the competition to Rich Aurilia. At {{the request of}} the team, Ortmeier gave <b>up</b> <b>switch</b> hitting in favor of batting exclusively from the right side. In 2007, he batted [...]240 at the Triple-A level as a left-handed hitter. On April 9, 2008, Ortmeier batted as a right-handed hitter against a right-handed pitcher {{for the first time since}} [...] and hit a game winning RBI double against Heath Bell. In August 2008, he went back to switch-hitting.|$|E

50|$|The {{eventual}} {{result was}} the Bell 1ESS switch (electronic switching system 1). This was controlled by a 3B20 computer, a lock-step dual computer using reliable diode transistor logic. In the 1ESS's 3B20, two computers performed each step, checking each other. When they disagreed, they would diagnose themselves, and the correctly running computer would take <b>up</b> <b>switch</b> operation while the other would disqualify itself and request repair. The 1ESS switch was still in limited use as of 2012, and had a verified reliability of less than one unscheduled hour of failure in each thirty years of operation, validating its design.|$|E
50|$|Switch and Brenda then {{appear at}} an outdoor {{cafeteria}} {{and the same thing}} occurs. He sees Brenda's boyfriend mistreat her, he imagines himself as a superhero and manages to knock her boyfriend off his feet so he can run to Brenda and sing to her, but her boyfriend comes up and beats <b>up</b> <b>Switch</b> and despite his friends' encouragement to fight back, he is knocked unconscious. A yellow Aston Martin car strolls around the school and Brenda is seen in the shotgun, visibly miserable. Switch then finds the confidence to take action so he runs in front of the car and pulls the boyfriend out, a crowd of his supporters gather to cheer him on (The group also includes the boyfriend's posse) as he beats him repeatedly. The boyfriend tries to fight back, but Switch punches him one last time, sending him flying through the air (and in front of a jet). He faces Brenda, who unmasks him, and the two levitate together as the crowd of teenagers (Including the posse) look on. The last scene shows Switch and Brenda in the park, laughing together. It is ambiguous if the confrontation actually happened or if it was a fantasy and Brenda was with Switch the entire time. The video ends with the two sharing a passionate kiss and the camera pans to a heart carved into a tree, as shown {{in the beginning of the}} video.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—OpenFlow {{is an open}} {{standard}} that can be implemented in Ethernet switches, routers and wireless access points (AP). In the OpenFlow framework, packet forwarding (data plane) and routing decisions (control plane) run on different devices. OpenFlow switches {{are in charge of}} packet forwarding, whereas a controller sets <b>up</b> <b>switch</b> forwarding tables on a perflow basis, to enable flow isolation and resource slicing. We focus on the data path and analyze the OpenFlow implementation in Linux based PCs. We compare OpenFlow switching, layer- 2 Ethernet switching and layer- 3 IP routing performance. Forwarding throughput and packet latency in underloaded and overloaded conditions are analyzed, with different traffic patterns. System scalability is analyzed using different forwarding table size, and fairness in resource distribution is measured. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Open Network Administrator (ONA), {{a web-based}} network management tool. Network administrators interact with ONA over the web, and ONA interacts with routers, switches and access points, using telnet and/or SNMP. ONA provides a common web interface {{to a number}} of different vendors ’ network products, and provides granular access control, permitting network administrators across multiple departments to manage a network in a consistent manner. In addition to typical day-to-day operations like changing switch port speed, duplex, VLAN, etc., ONA performs a number of other maintenance operations, such as automatically backing <b>up</b> <b>switch</b> configurations, maintaining traffic graphs, and sending device reboot/up/down alerts via e-mail. ONA leverages some existing components, such as RRDtool [1] and CVSweb [2]. A summary of existing tools, both commercial and open source, is provided, with comparisons made to ONA. At the University of Waterloo, where there is both a central IT group and many sizeable decentralized autonomous IT groups, ONA rapidly gained widespread enthusiastic acceptance...|$|E
40|$|OpenFlow {{switching}} enables flexible {{management of}} enterprise network switches and experiments on regular network traffic. OpenFlow switches {{are in charge}} of packet forwarding, whereas a controller sets <b>up</b> <b>switch</b> forwarding tables on a per-flow basis, to enable flow isolation and resource slicing. The present work deals with Open vSwitch, a software implementation for Linux platforms of an OpenFlow switch. The current implementation includes both a specific kernel-module and a totally userspace version of the program. The bulk of the code is written in platform-independent C and is easily portable to other environments. In {{the first part of the}} work we perform the porting of the userspace version of the software to FreeBSD. Then, being the obtained performance unsatisfying, we proceeded reorganizing portion of the code and eliminating some inefficiencies. This led to performance about ten times greater than before. Finally, combining OVS with netmap, a recently developed framework for very fast access to network packets, we have been able to further increase the program performance of about four times, with peaks of 3. 0 Mpps...|$|E
