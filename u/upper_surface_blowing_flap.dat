40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large-scale subsonic jet transport model with an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>flap</b> system that would augment lift. The model had a 25 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 7. 89 and two turbofan engines with the engine centerline located at 0. 256 of the wing semispan. The lift of the flap system was augmented by turbofan exhaust impingement on the Coanda surface. Results were obtained for several flap deflections and engine nozzle configurations at jet momentum coefficients from 0 to 4. 0. Three-component longitudinal data are presented with two engines operating. Limited longitudinal and lateral data are presented with an engine out. In addition, limited exhaust and flap pressure data are presented...|$|E
40|$|Static {{aerodynamic}} loads measurements {{from wind}} tunnel tests of a full-scale <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> jet <b>flap</b> configuration are presented. The measured loads are compared with calculations using {{a method for}} predicting longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> jet <b>flap</b> configurations...|$|R
40|$|Externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> and <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> {{powered lift}} {{concepts}} were investigated in the Quiet Clean Short-Haul Experimental Engine Program and briefly discussed along with propulsion system requirements. Noise limits, emission standards, thrust requirements, and thrust-to-weight ratios {{are among the}} factors considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} acoustic {{data base}} and associated flow data {{are used in}} identifying the noise generating mechanisms of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> configurations of short takeoff and landing aircraft. Theory is developed for the radiated sound field of the highly sheared flow of the trailing edge wake. An empirical method is also developed using extensive experimental data and physical reasonings to predict the noise levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of concepts for reducing <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> noise {{at the source}} through flap modifications and special nozzles is reviewed. In particular, recent results obtained on the aerodynamic and acoustic performance of flaps with porous surfaces near the trailing edge and multi-slotted nozzles are reviewed. Considerable reduction (6 - 10 db) of the characteristic low frequency peak is shown. The aerodynamic performance is compared with conventional systems, and prospects for future improvements are discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the basic acoustic characteristics and noise reduction potential of an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> consisting of a rectangular nozzle and a single turning flap {{which was designed to}} approximate a typical takeoff setting is presented. The noise reduction concepts studied were: (1) replacing a section of the flap trailing edge with a porous material and (2) active modification of the flow field using blowing near the trailing edge. Diagrams of the airfoil section and test equipment are provided. Photographs of airflow conditions across the aerodynamic surface are included...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the <b>blown</b> flap/jet <b>flap</b> analogy has been undertaken. Analytical {{predictions}} were made using both improved lifting line and optimized vortex lattice models for the jet flap. Results were compared with experimental data for three propulsive lift systems; the jet augmented <b>flap,</b> the externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> and the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap.</b> Force increments due to changes in geometry and jet parameters were well approximated in most cases, although the absolute values of the aerodynamic forces were usually underestimated. The relatively simple jet-flap models gave performance predictions of accuracy comparable to more complex analyses...|$|R
40|$|Results {{from recent}} {{investigations}} in the Langley V/STOL tunnel of an externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> and an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> configuration in ground proximity are presented. Comparisons of longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics indicate that in ground proximity, drag is reduced for both configurations, but changes in lift are configuration dependent. Steady state {{analyses of the}} landing approach indicate an increase in flight path angle for both configurations in ground proximity because of the drag reduction. Dynamic analyses with a fixed-base simulator indicate that the resultant flight path during landing approach {{is dependent on the}} initial flight path angle and the control technique used...|$|R
40|$|Far-field {{noise data}} {{indicated}} that for practical <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> configurations, the noise radiated below the flap {{is dominated by the}} noise generated {{in the vicinity of the}} trailing edge. Sound field by turbulent mixing in the trailing edge wake is investigated experimentally and theoretically. Hot-wire measurements were made downstream of the trailing edge to determine the gross turbulence mixing characteristics of the flow. This information is used as input to a theoretical analysis of the sound field. Favorable agreement is found between predicted and measured far-field noise directivities at various frequencies and noise power spectra at various directions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} mean flow {{modification}} on the noise production of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> {{has been studied}} experimentally. Mean velocity profile at the nozzle exit was modified from the usual 'top-hat' shape to 'Gamma' and 'L'-shaped profiles. The 'L'-modification caused noise reduction around and above the peak frequency of the 'top-hat' spectrum when compared on an equal thrust per exit area basis. Modification to 'Gamma'-shaped profile resulted in a shift of the spectrum to lower frequencies and a lower overall noise reduction. These modifications alter {{the development of the}} large scale disturbances in the upper shear layer and trailing edge wake of the wall jet geometry...|$|R
40|$|Mean and {{fluctuating}} {{flow characteristics}} {{in the wake}} of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> configurations are presented. Relative importance of the longitudinal and the transverse components of the wake flow turbulence for noise generation are evaluated using correlation between the near-field noise and the wake turbulence. Effects of the jet velocity, the initial turbulence in the jet, and the flap deflection angle on noise and wake flow characteristics are studied. The far-field noise data is compared with the existing empirical prediction method. The measured wake flow properties are compared with an analytical model used in the existing USB wake flow noise theory. The detailed wake flow profiles, wake flow turbulence space-time correlations, wake flow turbulence cross-power spectra, and near-field noise third octave band spectra are presented in the appendices...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic loads {{measured}} on jet-powered STOL configurations are presented for externally <b>blown</b> and <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> models {{ranging in size}} from a small laboratory model up to a full-scale aircraft model. The implications of the measured loads for potential acoustic fatigue and cabin noise are discussed. Noise transmission characteristics of light aircraft structures are presented. The relative importance of noise transmission paths, such as fuselage sidewall and primary structure, is estimated. Acceleration responses of a historic building and a residential home are presented for flyover noise from subsonic and supersonic aircraft. Possible effects on occupant comfort are assessed. The results from these three examples show that aircraft noise can induce structural responses that are large enough to require consideration in the design or operation of the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Procedures for {{simulating}} transient effects {{associated with}} STOL aircraft landings and takeoffs were examined and a basis {{was developed for}} selection of an experimental approach based on consideration of simulation requirements, experimental techniques, facilities, and costs. The results are generally applicable to STOL aircraft employing {{any of the following}} powered lift systems: externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> augmentor wing, or internally ducted jet flap. Scaling relationships were developed to apply the simulation requirements to model test situations. Procedures for the derivation of aerodynamic forces from the measured data were discussed. Various means of expressing the aerodynamic data in forms convenient for use in performance or stability and control applications were described. Five different experimental techniques were presented that depend on two different types of experimental facilities, wind tunnels and test tracks, and involving different types of model motion, and factors pertinent to selection were summarized...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{presents}} {{results from}} two research studies that {{provide information on}} the fluctuating pressures generated {{by the use of}} powered-lift systems in STOL aircraft. Data are given for several chordwise and spanwise locations on large-scale models of an externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> (EBF) configuration and an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> (USB) configuration in which actual jet engines were used. Pressure levels were high enough to indicate that special design effort will be required to avoid acoustic fatigue failures of wing and flap sturctures. The observation that pressure levels did not decrease very much with increased distance from the engine exhaust center line suggests that a STOL aircraft fuselage, which is in relatively close proximity to the engines for aerodynamic reasons, will be subjected to unusually high external overall fluctuating pressure levels (OAFPLs) that may cause difficulty in control of the cabin noise level...|$|R
40|$|A speed-hold {{system for}} an {{experimental}} short takeoff and landing jet airplane {{has been designed}} using both classical root-locus and modern optimal control synthesis techniques. The purpose of the speed-hold system is to maintain airspeed during final approach {{in the presence of}} wind shears, gusts, engine failures, and pilot control inputs. Designs were based on using airspeed as a single measurement and two symmetrically deployed <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> as a single control. An optimal control law feeding back all the states and the integral of airspeed through constant gains provided superior performance in terms of speed tracking and control surface activity. However, when a constant-gain Kalman filter was inserted to estimate the states using only the measurement of airspeed, the performance of the optimal control law was reduced to {{the same as that of}} a much simpler classical proportional-path plus integral-path control law. To improve the performance of the optimal control law, additional measurements would be required...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} in the Ames 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large-scale subsonic jet transport model with an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> system. The model had a 25 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 7. 28 and four turbofan engines. The lift of the flap system was augmented by turning the turbofan exhaust over the Coanda surface. Results were obtained for several flap deflections with several wing leading-edge configurations at jet momentum coefficients from 0 to 4. 0. Three-component longitudinal data are presented with four engines operating. In addition, longitudinal and lateral data are presented with an engine out. The maximum lift and stall angle of the four engine model were lower than those obtained with a two engine model that was previously investigated. The addition of the outboard nacelles had an adverse effect on these values. Efforts to improve these values were successful. A maximum lift of 8. 8 at an angle-of-attack of 27 deg was obtained with a jet thrust coefficient of 2 for the landing flap configuration...|$|R
40|$|Results {{from wind}} tunnel and flight tests {{investigations}} for V/STOL aircraft are reviewed. Primary emphasis {{is given to}} technical results relating to three types of subsonic aircraft: a quiet STOL aircraft; a tilt rotor aircraft; and a turbofan V/STOL aircraft. Comparison and correlation between theoretical and experimental results and between wind tunnel and flight test results, is made. The quiet STOL aircraft technology results are primarily those derived from the NASA/Boeing Quiet Short Haul Technology (QSRA) program. The QSRA aircraft uses an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> and develops a usable engine-out landing approach lift coefficient of 5. 5 and landing distances less than 1, 000 ft. The tilt rotor aircraft technology results are those obtained from the NASA/Army/Navy/Bell (XV- 15 -TRRA) aircraft flight investigations. The TRRA is a twin rotor research aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing and cruise speeds of 300 knots. The turbofan V/STOL aircraft technology results are from static ground facility and wind tunnel investigations of a NASA/NAVY/Grumman full scale lift/cruise fan aircraft model, which features two tilting nacelles with TF- 34 engines...|$|R
40|$|Progress in {{vertical}} and short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) aircraft technology, in particular, during the 1970 to 1980 period at Ames Research Center is discussed. Although only {{two kinds of}} V/STOL aircraft (the helicopter and the British direct lift Harrier) have achieved operational maturity, understanding of the technology has vastly improved during this 10 year period. To pursue an aggressive R and D program at a reasonable cost, {{it was decided to}} conduct extensive large scale testing in wind tunnel and flight simulation facilities, to develop low cost research aircraft using modified airframes or engines, and to involve other agencies and industry contractors in joint technical and funding arrangements. The STOL investigations include exploring STOL performance using the rotating cylinder flap concept, the augmentor wing, upon initiation of the Quiet Short Haul Research Aircraft program, the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> concept. The VTOL investigations were conducted using a tilt rotor aircraft, resulting in the XV- 15 tilt rotor research aircraft. Direct jet lift is now being considered for application to future supersonic fighter aircraft...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} a full scale wind tunnel to determine the performance and aerodynamic characteristics of a twin engine, straight wing, <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> jet <b>flap</b> configuration. The model had two simulated high bypass ratio turbofan engines with rectangular nozzles exhausting onto the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the wing at the 35 percent chord station. The model was tested with an aspect ratio 8. 2 wing and with the wingtips removed to give an aspect ratio of 6. 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{utilizing a}} small turbofan engine {{was conducted to}} evaluate static turning performance and pressure and temperature environment of an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> wing and <b>flap</b> segment. The tests involved modifications of the engine primary nozzle to alleviate high-temperature problems on the wing and flaps without adversely affecting static turning performance over the desired range of flap deflection and thrust condition...|$|R
40|$|A highly noise {{suppressed}} TF 34 {{engine was}} used to investigate the noise of several powered lift configurations involving <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> (USB) <b>flaps.</b> The configuration variables were nozzle type (i. e. slot and circular with deflector), flap chord length, and flap angle. The results of velocity surveys at both the nozzle exit and the flap trailing edge are also presented and used for correlation of the noise data. Configurations using a long flap design were 4 db quieter than a short flap typical of current trends in USB flap design. The lower noise for the long flap is attributed primarily to the greater velocity decay of the jet at the flap trailing edge. The full-scale data revealed substantially more quadrupole noise in the region near the deflected jet than observed in previous sub-scale tests...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{tests of}} {{externally}} <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> {{with the engine}} under the wing and engine over the wing configurations were conducted. Flap noise data obtained on a TF- 34 aircraft are discussed. Noise data obtained during a free-jet forward-speed-effect analysis are presented. Noise sources associated with <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>flap</b> <b>blowing</b> are described. Results of a small scale configuration screening study and some large scale model test data are analyzed. The noise data for the engine over wing configurations are compared with the engine under the wing configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{results and}} {{analyses}} of aerodynamic and acoustic studies {{conducted on the}} small scale noise and wind tunnel tests of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> nozzle <b>flap</b> concepts are presented. Various types of nozzle flap concepts were tested. These are an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> concept with a multiple slot arrangement with seven slots (seven slotted nozzle), an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> type with a large nozzle exit at approximately mid-chord location {{in conjunction with a}} powered trailing edge flap with multiple slots (split flow or partially slotted nozzle). In addition, aerodynamic tests were continued on a similar multi-slotted nozzle flap, but with 14 slots. All three types of nozzle flap concepts tested appear to be about equal in overall aerodynamic performance but with the split flow nozzle somewhat better than the other two nozzle flaps in the landing approach mode. All nozzle flaps can be deflected to a large angle to increase drag without significant loss in lift. The nozzle flap concepts appear to be viable aerodynamic drag modulation devices for landing...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} forward {{speed on the}} noise of under-the-wing (externally <b>blown</b> <b>flaps,</b> EBF) and over-the-wing (<b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown,</b> USB) <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> {{configurations}} were measured in wind tunnel model tests with cold jets. The results are presented without correction for the effects (e. g., signal convection, shear layer refraction) associated with flight simulation in a wind tunnel or free jet facility. Noise decreases were generally observed at microphones forward of the wing. The reductions were larger at the low frequencies (below peak SPL) than at the high (above peak SPL). Noise increases of 10 dB or more were observed at the aft microphones, especially in the high frequency range...|$|R
40|$|Several basic noise {{components}} were described. These components are: (1) compact lift dipoles {{associated with the}} wing and flaps; (2) trailing edge noise associated with the last trailing edge; and (3) quadrupole noise associated with the undeflected exhaust jet and the free jet located downstream of the trailing edge. These noise {{components were}} combined to allow prediction of directivity and spectra for under the wing (UTW) slotted flaps with conventional or mixer nozzles, UTW slotless <b>flaps,</b> <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> (USB) slotless <b>flaps,</b> and engine {{in front of the}} wing slotted flaps. A digital computer program listing was given for this calculation method. Directivities and spectra calculated by this method were compared with free field data for UTW and USB configurations. The UTRC method best predicted the details of the measured noise emission, but the ANOP method best estimated the noise levels directly below these configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} recent wind tunnel {{investigations}} to provide fundamental {{information on the}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> (USB) jet <b>flap</b> concept demonstrated that the USB concept provides good high-lift performance. It is shown that the low speed performance is dependent upon the jet turning angle and turning efficiency and {{on the use of}} proper leading and trailing edge treatment to prevent premature flow separation. The best means of achieving good turning performance in any particular USB application must be determined from overall operational considerations in which high speed performance, structures and noise, as well as low speed performance, are evaluated. The large diving moments generated at high lift coefficients can be trimmed satisfactorily with a large, conventional horizontal tail; a high tail position is best from longitudinal stability considerations. Large rolling and yawing moments are introduced with the loss of an engine, but these moments can be trimmed satisfactorily through the use of asymmetrical boundary layer control and through the use of spoiler and rudder deflection as needed...|$|R
50|$|A type of Boundary Layer Control System, <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> pass engine-generated air or exhaust {{over the}} flaps to {{increase}} lift beyond that attainable with mechanical flaps. Types include the original (internally <b>blown</b> <b>flap)</b> which <b>blows</b> compressed {{air from the}} engine {{over the top of}} the <b>flap,</b> the externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> which <b>blows</b> engine exhaust over the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>surfaces</b> of the <b>flap,</b> and <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> which blows engine exhaust {{over the top of the}} wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing</b> was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.|$|R
40|$|Screening {{tests of}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> on {{externally}} <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> configurations were conducted. Noise and turning effectiveness {{data were obtained}} with small-scale, engine-over-the-wing models. One large model was tested to determine scale effects. Nozzle types included circular, slot, D-shaped, and multilobed. Tests were made with and without flow attachment devices. For STOL applications the particular multilobed mixer and the D-shaped nozzles tested were found to offer little or no noise advantage over the round convergent nozzle. High aspect ratio slot nozzles provided the quietest configurations. In general, <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> was quieter than lower <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> for equivalent EBF models...|$|R
50|$|In general, <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> {{can improve}} the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a Boeing 747 {{produces}} a coefficient of lift of about 2.45, external <b>blowing</b> (<b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> on a YC-14) improves this to about 7, and internal <b>blowing</b> (jet <b>flap</b> on Hunting H.126) to 9.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} a generic wing with a half span flap shows the mean flow effects of several <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> configurations. The effort compares and contrasts the thin-layer, Reynolds averaged, Navier-Stokes solutions of a baseline wing-flap configuration with configurations that have blowing normal to the flap surface through small slits near the flap side edge. Vorticity contours reveal a dual vortex structure at the flap side edge for all cases. The dual vortex merges into a single vortex at approximately the mid-flap chord location. <b>Upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> reduces {{the strength of the}} merged vortex and moves the vortex away from the <b>upper</b> edge. Lower <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> thickens the lower shear layer and weakens the merged vortex, {{but not as much as}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing.</b> Side <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> forces the lower surface vortex farther outboard of the flap edge by effectively increasing the aerodynamic span of the flap. It is seen that there is no global aerodynamic penalty or benefit from the particular blowing configurations examined...|$|R
50|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> {{remains a}} fairly rare concept in use, {{and has been}} seen only on a few other aircraft, such as the Antonov An-72.|$|R
40|$|A powered-lift, reduced thrust takeoff {{performance}} program utilizing quiet short-haul research aircraft {{has been}} conducted. It {{has been shown}} that the powered-lift <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> concept greatly enhances aircraft takeoff performance. The improvements include: (1) takeoff field lengths may be shortened by approximately 30 %; (2) Air Force critical field lengths may be shortened by approximately 60 %; (3) powered lift <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> aircraft have better handling and performance characteristics than comparable conventional aircraft; and (4) the low speeds associated with powered-lift takeoff enhance safety margins...|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design method {{for the application}} of <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing</b> to combat aircraft has been developed. Although, specifically addressed to combat aircraft or aircraft with low aspect ratios, aerodynamics of the method may be applied to other aircraft using <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing.</b> Even though the method is readily useable in its present form, there are areas where improvements can be made. These areas are addressed in the specific conclusions and recommendations. (orig.)

40|$|The hybrid <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> concept {{consists}} of wing-mounted turbofan engines {{with a major}} portion of the fan exhaust directed over the wing <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> to provide high levels of propulsive lift, but with a portion of the fan airflow directed over selected portions of the airframe to provide boundary layer control. NASA-sponsored preliminary design studies identified the hybrid <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> concept as the best propulsive lift concept to be applied to the Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) that is planned as a flight facility to conduct flight research at low noise levels, high approach lift coefficients, and steep approaches.
