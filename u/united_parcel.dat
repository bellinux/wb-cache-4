60|$|But {{almost at}} the same instant, the Selbys entered the church at the further end. Mr. Selby, with his red face and fluffy side-whiskers, had Maude upon his arm. She looked very pale and very sweet, with downcast eyes and solemn mouth, while behind her walked her younger sister Mary and her pretty friend Nelly Sheridan, both in pink dresses with broad pink hats and white curling feathers. The bride was herself in the grey travelling-dress with which Frank was already {{familiar}} by its description in her letter. Its gentle tint and her tenderly grave expression made a charming effect. Behind them was the mother, still young and elegant, with something of Maude's grace in her figure and carriage. As the party came up the aisle, Frank was to be restrained no longer. 'Get to his head!' cried Jack to Hale in an excited whisper, but their man was already hurrying {{to shake hands with}} Maude. He walked up on her right, and they took their position in two little groups, the happy couple in the centre. At the same moment the clang of the church-clock sounded above them, and the vicar, shrugging his shoulders to get his white surplice into position, came bustling out of the vestry. To him it was all the most usual, commonplace, and unimportant thing in the world, and both Frank and Maude were filled with amazement at the nonchalant way in which he whipped out a prayer-book, and began to rapidly perform the ceremony. It was all so new and solemn and all-important to them, that they had expected something mystic and overpowering in the function, and yet here was this brisk little man, with an obvious cold in his head, tying them up in as business-like a fashion as a grocer <b>uniting</b> two <b>parcels.</b> After all, he had to do it a thousand times a year, and so he could not be extravagant in his emotions.|$|R

40|$|In 2003 the Supreme Court {{confirmed}} in {{a ruling that}} cable and pipeline networks are immovable properties and also that the authorized constructor of a network is the legal owner of the network if the network is constructed in a parcel {{which is owned by}} someone else. This ruling is transposed into national law. On February 1, 2007 a new article was introduced in the Civil Code. In the second paragraph of Article 5 : 20 is regulated that a network that is being placed, in, on or above the subsoil of others, belongs to the authorized constructor of that network or its predecessor. Authorized construction may result from private law (building lease, contract) or public law (obligation to consent). The parcel owner – who is not the constructor of the network – is not the owner of the network on the bases that the network is durably <b>united</b> with the <b>parcel.</b> Determining the real status of networks has also resulted in the fact that a legal transfer of ownership of a network has to be registered in the public registers. Through amendment of Article 3 : 17 of the Civil Code the construction and removal of a network itself is also registrable as a fact. In the new ownership rule two key concepts are introduced, namely the concept of ‘network’ and the concept of the ‘authorized constructor’. With respect to ‘network’, the size of a network is determined by the legal description in specific (sector) regulations. In the absence of such a specific description, the size is determined by the ideas in practice. The network with all its components will be considered as one factual and functional unit. For acquisition of ownership of a network the construction of the network must be authorized by the parcel owner. In practice it turned out that it was difficult for the intended owner to deliver evidence which sufficiently shows that he or his predecessors were authorized to construct the network. To solve this problem an amendment is proposed on the basis of which the person who has acted as an owner on February 1, 2007 may register the ownership of the network on his name in the public registers. Although the new ownership rule, including the proposed amendment, has clarified the question about the ownership of networks, several new questions have arisen. For instance the question whether a supplement to the ownership rule is necessary so that besides the ownership also the use (construction, maintenance) of the network is regulated. Another question is whether the new ownership rule applies to networks that are constructed in the subsoil that is owned by the constructor himself. In this thesis these questions will be discusse...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like novelties"--and Count Otto {{smiled with}} an air of {{considerable}} resolution. He couldn't however be satisfied with a demonstration that only begged the question; and when they disembarked in New York he felt, even amid the confusion of the wharf and the heaps of disembowelled baggage, a certain acuteness of regret at the idea that Pandora and her family were about to vanish into the unknown. He had a consolation however: it was apparent that for some reason or other--illness or absence from town--the gentleman to whom she had written had not, as she said, come down. Vogelstein was glad--he couldn't have told you why--that this sympathetic person had failed her; even though without him Pandora had to engage single-handed with the United States Custom-House. Our young man's first impression of the Western world was received on the landing-place of the German steamers at Jersey City--a huge wooden shed covering a wooden wharf which resounded under the feet, an expanse palisaded with rough-hewn piles that leaned this way and that, and bestrewn with masses of heterogeneous luggage. At one end; toward the town, was a row of tall painted palings, behind which he could distinguish a press of hackney-coachmen, who brandished their whips and awaited their victims, while their voices rose, incessant, with a sharp strange sound, a challenge at once fierce and familiar. The whole place, behind the fence, appeared to bristle and resound. Out there was America, Count Otto said to himself, and he looked toward it with a sense that he should have to muster resolution. On the wharf people were rushing about amid their trunks, pulling their things together, trying to <b>unite</b> their scattered <b>parcels.</b> They were heated and angry, or else quite bewildered and discouraged. The few that had succeeded in collecting their battered boxes had an air of flushed indifference to the efforts of their neighbours, not even looking at people with whom they had been fondly intimate on the steamer. A detachment of the officers of the Customs was in attendance, and energetic passengers were engaged in attempts to drag them toward their luggage or to drag heavy pieces toward them. These functionaries were good-natured and taciturn, except when occasionally they remarked to a passenger whose open trunk stared up at them, eloquent, imploring, that they were afraid the voyage had been [...] "rather glassy." [...] They had a friendly leisurely speculative way of discharging their duty, and if they perceived a victim's name written on the portmanteau they addressed him by it in a tone of old acquaintance. Vogelstein found however that if they were familiar they weren't indiscreet. He had heard that in America all public functionaries were the same, that there wasn't a different tenue, as they said in France, for different positions, and he wondered whether at Washington the President and ministers, whom he expected to see--to HAVE to see--a good deal of, would be like that.|$|R
