5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was <b>used</b> <b>throughout</b> the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E
