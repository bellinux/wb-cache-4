In January 1940 the government announced {{the creation of a}} Department of Air, completely separate from that of Defence. Guest was appointed Minister of Air, a post he held from 28 March 1940 to 6 May 1946. He inaugurated and administered what became the second largest Empire Air Training Scheme, beginning with the establishment of three units at Salisbury, Bulawayo and Gwelo, each comprising a preliminary and an advanced training school.|$|E
5|$|Rura Penthe {{was created}} {{with a mixture}} of on-set and {{location}} shots, along with an establishing sequence created by Matte World. The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect.

5|$|Steam {{ships of}} the period, which burned coal to fire their boilers, were {{naturally}} tied to coaling stations in friendly ports. The German Navy lacked sufficient overseas bases for sustained operations, even for single ships operating as commerce raiders. The Navy experimented with {{a device to}} transfer coal from colliers to warships while <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> 1907, though the practice was not put into general use. Nevertheless, German capital ships had a cruising range of at least , {{more than enough to}} operate in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, {{which made it}} difficult to keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from the aft, {{made it difficult to}} keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E

Instead of ending at Kings Highway, it would end at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, with borings <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> 1970. Studies for the midtown people mover commenced in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E

5|$|During {{the days}} leading up to the {{scheduled}} start of practice at 3pm, Thursday, July 2, 1998, concerns rose on account of the massive wildfire outbreak that was <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> central Florida; thousands of people were forced to evacuate the area, and Interstate 95, the primary north–south thoroughfare through the region, was closed. At 10am on July 2, NASCAR announced that the race was being postponed; while July 25 was an open date, the decision was made to reschedule the race for October 17, to allow additional time for the wildfires to be controlled. At the time of the postponement, the race was sold out; this was the first time the summer race at Daytona International Speedway had achieved sellout status.|$|E
5|$|Efforts were <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> 1997 {{to secure}} {{federal funding for}} the highway and other {{infrastructure}} near the Mexican border, largely supported by Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Bob Filner, and Representative Bud Schuster, {{the chairman of the}} House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, visited the region before giving informal approval to the proposal. In 1999, Governor Gray Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E
5|$|Emigration {{patterns}} in the Nordic countriesFinland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Icelandshow striking variation. Nordic mass emigration started in Norway, which also retained the highest rate throughout the century. Sweden got <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> the early 1840s, and had the third-highest rate in all of Europe, after Ireland and Norway. Denmark had a consistently low rate of emigration, while Iceland had a late start but soon reached levels comparable to Norway. Finland, whose mass emigration did not start until the late 1880s, {{and at the time}} part of the Russian Empire, is usually classified as part of the Eastern European wave.|$|E

In 1915, when the railway lost 12percent of its revenue owing to disruptions in trade caused by the start of World War I, Harrison was concerned about longer-term changes <b>underway.</b> <b>In</b> the annual report that year he warned stockholders that automobile ownership could severely impact railroad passenger revenues. His words proved to be prophetic, as automobiles eventually resulted in the disappearance of most passenger train traffic.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, as {{a general}} strike was <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> the country to demand a renegotiation of the French role in Syria, Quwatli was {{appointed}} the Bloc's vice president of internal affairs, but {{was not part of}} the treaty negotiation committee which led talks with the French in Paris in March. A new treaty was established by the end of the month, although the French did not ratify it. Between then and fall, Quwatli spearheaded efforts to unify nationalists ranks in Syria, convincing LNA leader Sabri al-Asali to join the Bloc's highest governing body. By enlisting the support of many prominent pan-Arabists like himself, Quwatli strengthened his position within the Bloc, particularly in regards to his chief nationalist rival Jamil Mardam Bey.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{planning}} began {{for a new}} {{theme park}} adjacent to Universal Studios Florida. By the end of 1993, {{it was decided that}} one area of the future Islands of Adventure theme park would be themed after Marvel Comics, with a Hulk theme being selected for a thrill ride. The designers of the ride wanted to simulate being fired out of a cannon and subsequently set about prototyping a launch system. Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation had a working prototype in January 1995. Methods to achieve this acceleration were investigated into mid-1996. On-site construction of Islands of Adventure was <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> 1997, with Superior Rigging & Erection being responsible for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster. On May 28, 1999, Islands of Adventure officially opened to the public, with The Incredible Hulk being one of its debut attractions.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{director}} Martin Campbell {{confirmed the}} possibility of a Green Lantern trilogy. Warner Bros. originally planned on Green Lantern being the first entry of a new DC film franchise, and commissioned a script for a sequel from Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, and Marc Guggenheim while filming for the first film was <b>underway.</b> <b>In</b> August 2010, Michael Goldenberg was still attached to write the screenplay, based on the sequel treatment. The scene in the film's end credits showing a resurgence of the yellow power ring of fear, with Sinestro becoming corrupted by its dark power, teased the planned sequel. In September 2011 Warner Bros., dismayed by the film's negative reviews and disappointing box office return, abandoned plans for sequels.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{has one of}} the world's largest {{reserves}} of ilmenite (titanium ore), as well as important {{reserves of}} chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel. Several major projects are <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near Tôlanaro by Rio Tinto, extraction of nickel near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International, and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.|$|E
5|$|The Campo road {{served as}} a wagon road {{providing}} access to eastern San Diego County as well as Imperial County.

Efforts to convert the western half of the route to a freeway got <b>underway</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s, and the freeway was complete by 1962 west of the road that became SR125. Construction continued east to Avocado Road over the next few years. Various proposals for widening the highway have come from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), but local opposition resulted in the delay or cancellation of many of these proposals.|$|E
