When {{the two sets of}} shocks with the large electron heating were compared {{with the rest of the}} 52 bow shock crossings of the compiled series, these sets were found to correlate with an unusually high upstream solar wind flow speed. The highest correlation was found between the amount of electron heating, expressed by the difference in temperature between the downstream and upstream electrons (rather than their ratio), and the total change in the bulk flow energy per particle across the shock.

The simplified 1 D problem is recast in Hamiltonian formalism, the effective energy being invariant. This property is most efficient to address bifurcations and critical points leading to no-solution regions of the parameter space. Analytical investigation of these solutions indicates that taking into account the radiative front location and constraints on the <b>upstream</b> <b>temperature</b> reduces the operation space.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the abundance {{and distribution of}} branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in grain size fractions of 7 globally distributed river flank sediments and catchment soils {{in order to determine}} if and how the initial soil-brGDGT signature is influenced by hydrodynamic sorting upon entering a river and during subsequent transport from land to sea. BrGDGTs are hypothesized to form associations with high-surface-area fine-grained minerals in soils. Such associations, if maintained during transport, may impart resistance to degradation and promote downstream transport, reducing potential interferences by aquatic brGDGTs. We find that brGDGTs are indeed primarily associated with organic carbon (OC) bound to the clay-silt fraction (< 63 μm) in both soils and river sediments, and that these associations appear to be maintained during river transport. However, the relative distribution of individual brGDGTs among size fractions is relatively uniform, suggesting that brGDGTs are well mixed in river sediments and that OC-mineral associations are continuously renewed. Consequently, the brGDGT signature finally stored in continental margin sediments appears insensitive to differential particle transport processes. Nevertheless, the lower (<b>upstream)</b> <b>temperature</b> signal generally reflected by brGDGTs in river sediments may also be explained by a contribution of in situ produced brGDGTs leading to an underestimation of reconstructed air temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA composite study {{is carried out}} to deduce the structure of convective activity associated with easterly waves at five tropical Pacific radiosonde stations, Majuro, Ponape, Truk, Yap, and Koror, for the latter halves of 1974, 1975 and 1976. The data used include digitized satellite infrared radiation and albedo. The resultant structure, in general, shows maximum convective activity {{in or near the}} wave troughs. The distribution {{is similar to that of}} the humidity field composited previously by Bepristis (1977). In order to examine the possible effects of sea-surface temperature on tropical convection, the wave-organized convection and the seasonal-mean convective fields as indicated by the satellite data are compared to the seasonal mean seasurface temperature. It is found that west of Majuro the interannual and spatial variation of the 10 -degree <b>upstream</b> sea-surface <b>temperature</b> have a much better positive correlation with those of the wave-organized convective field than those of the seasonal mean. This result is consistent with that for the latter halves of 1972 and 1973 obtained by Delaney (1977) using subjectively-digitized satellite cloud data, and Bepristis' (1977) result of a positive correlation between the waves' upper-tropospheric thermal structure and the 10 -degree <b>upstream</b> sea-surface <b>temperature.</b> It suggests that the sea-surface temperature in the immediate upstream vicinity may exert a positive influence on the convective activity modulated by an easterly wave.

40|$|Shay, Michael A. Magnetic {{reconnection}} is {{a fundamental}} plasma process that converts energy stored in magnetic fields into kinetic energy. Reconnection is believed to occur in astrophysical, heliospheric and laboratory plasma. In this thesis we examine how magnetic energy is converted into electron and ion thermal energy during collisionless magnetic reconnection using fully kinetic 2. 5 D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. We find that both ion and electron heating are reasonably well correlated with the inflowing available magnetic energy per ion electron pair, or more succinctly, to an energy associated with the upstream Alfvén speed (micAup 2). We also show that while the upstream Alfvén speed is the primary factor controlling the heating, other factors, including {{the strength of a}} guide field and the electron to ion temperature ratio, affect the heating as well. Ion heating is found to be inversely proportional to the strength of the guide field relative to the reconnecting field. In anti-parallel reconnection, ion heating is suppressed by an upstream electron to ion temperature ratio greater than unity; conversely, electron heating is found to be enhanced by these upstream parameters. It is also shown that increasing the <b>upstream</b> ion <b>temperature</b> normalized to the Alfvén speed squared (β i) reduces the reconnection outflow velocity in the exhaust for anti-parallel reconnection. The firehose instability in the exhaust limits the field line (and thus the outflow) velocity and it is shown that v 0 = ⅓cAr 2 /√ Ti||/mi, where v 0 is the outflow velocity and Ti|| is the ion parallel temperature in the exhaust. While the <b>upstream</b> <b>temperatures</b> appear to cause the heating to deviate from scaling with mic Aup 2, the total heating (ion + electron) is significantly better correlated with micAup 2, giving ΔTi + Δ Te = 0. 14, micAup 2. This implies that the total fraction of magnetic energy released into thermal energy is a constant, and this constant fraction of magnetic energy is partitioned between electrons and ion. Finally, we show that parallel electric fields mediate the transfer of thermal energy between the electrons and the ions. This is achieved by slowing down inflowing ions and limiting the effectiveness of the Fermi reflection mechanism, and by trapping electrons in the reconnection exhaust to be repeatedly accelerated through the same process.

40|$|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) {{equations}} {{can yield}} significant error {{when applied to}} the interaction of turbulence with shock waves. This is often {{due to the fact}} that RANS turbulence models do not account for the underlying physical phenomena correctly. For example, in the presence of appreciable temperature fluctuations in the upstream flow, turbulence amplification across a shock is significantly affected by the magnitude of the temperature fluctuations and the sign of the upstream velocity-temperature correlation [Mahesh, J. Fluid Mech. 334, 353 (1997) ]. Standard two-equation models with compressibility correction do not reproduce this effect. We use the interaction of homogeneous isotropic turbulence with a normal shock to suggest improvements to the k-epsilon model. The approach is similar to that presented in an earlier work [Sinha, Phys. Fluids 15, 2290 (2003) ]. Linear inviscid analysis is used to study the effect of <b>upstream</b> <b>temperature</b> fluctuations on the evolution of turbulent kinetic energy k across the shock.

We derive the linearised equations {{for a general}} specific heat ratio as well as temperature and density power-law cooling functions, corresponding {{to a range of}} conditions relevant to interstellar atomic and molecular cooling processes. Boundary conditions corresponding to a return to the <b>upstream</b> <b>temperature</b> ($R$ = 1) and to a cold wall ($R$ = 0) are investigated. We find that for Mach number $M > 5 $, the strong shock overstability limits are not significantly modified. For $M < 3 $, however, shocks are considerably more stable for most cases. In general, as the shock weakens, the critical values of the temperature power-law index (below which shocks are overstable) are reduced for the overtones more than for the fundamental, which signifies a change in basic behaviour. In the $R$ = 0 scenario, however, we find that the overstability regime and growth rate of the fundamental mode are increased when cooling is under local thermodynamic equilibrium. We provide a possible explanation for the results in terms of a stabilising influence provided downstream but a destabilising effect associated with the shock front. We conclude that the regime of overstability for interstellar atomic shocks is well represented by the strong shock limit unless the upstream gas is hot.

The testing cell is composed of a high-pressure compressor casing with stator parts capable to regulate the seal inlet swirl and a rotor running on Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs), which serve as exciters (5 kN MAX Force over a 0 - 330 Hz frequency range per axis) and displacement transducers.
