50|$|This is the BE model viewer that is {{developed}} {{to visualize the}} generated boundary element models generated by the PLGen module or from <b>user</b> <b>text</b> input. This module has also some model editing capabilities that are considered a secondary benefit. Only advanced users who have thorough understanding of boundary element modeling can make use of this feature. The core component of this module is proposed to be a dataset that contains data tables of all the entities forming the model. This dataset {{can be thought of}} as a database that resides in the computer memory rather than on the computer hard disk. This technique is usually faster for data centric applications especially when the size of data is not large, as the case when using BEM. The dataset is populated using the data that already exist in the input text file (*.in) and then the populated dataset is used to visualize the model. The model data typically consist of material parameters, linear equation solver parameters, nodes coordinates, points coordinates, elements connectivity data, columns definition, cells definition and internal points coordinates.|$|E

40|$|Blessed by the Internet age, many online {{retailers}} (e. g., Amazon. com) have deployed recommender {{systems to}} help their customers identify products that may be of their interest {{in order to improve}} cross-selling and enhance customer loyalty. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most successful technique among different approaches to generating recommendations. Collaborative filtering automates the word-of-mouth process of recommendations by aggregating item ratings of other like-minded users. Although it has achieved huge success in both research and industry, traditional CF suffers a fundamental problem because of its dependence on users' numeric ratings as its sole source of user preference information. However, user ratings are often unable to fully represent user preferences. As a result, it is difficult to identify the true similarity among users based on ratings only. On the other hand, people are more and more comfortable with expressing themselves online using free-form text (e. g., blogs). As a result, <b>user</b> <b>text</b> reviews on different products have become a common source for consumers to share and receive information about products. Recent studies have also found that user reviews have significant impact on online businesses' sales. Inspired by the results of these studies, I propose an integrated approach to collaborative filtering called urCF (User Review enhanced Collaborative Filtering) that integrates <b>user</b> <b>text</b> reviews into memory-based collaborative filtering in order to better model users' preferences and in turn enhance the performance of CF-based recommender systems. This research uses existing text mining techniques to extract user opinions on item features. It proposes a new weighting scheme based on TF-IDF to measure the priority of item features in influencing users' overall opinions of different items. This study also explores and compares several different approaches to integrating user opinion information extracted from <b>user</b> <b>text</b> reviews into the user similarity measurement of traditional CF-based recommender systems. The proposed urCF system is evaluated against existing approaches using a dataset collected from Yahoo! Movies. The results show that the proposed urCF system significantly improved the performance of memory-based recommender systems...|$|E

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) allows {{machines}} and devices {{in the world}} to connect with each other and generate a huge amount of data, which has a great potential to provide useful knowledge across service domains. Combining the context of IoT with semantic technologies, we can build integrated semantic systems to support semantic interoperability. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic service platform (ISSP) to support ontological models in various IoT-based service domains of a smart city. In particular, we address three main problems for providing integrated semantic services together with IoT systems: semantic discovery, dynamic semantic representation, and semantic data repository for IoT resources. To show the feasibility of the ISSP, we develop a prototype service for a smart office using the ISSP, which can provide a preset, personalized office environment by interpreting <b>user</b> <b>text</b> input via a smartphone. We also discuss a scenario to show how the ISSP-based method would help build a smart city, where services in each service domain can discover and exploit IoT resources that are wanted across domains. We expect that our method could eventually contribute to providing people in a smart city with more integrated, comprehensive services based on semantic interoperability...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to create a}} program which will {{automatically}} create selected level of documentation from an information system for supporting science and research and enables user intervention. I solved the selected problem with creating a program in the PHP language which uses a private MediaWIKi which belongs to the KNOT research group and creates special headers on certain pages. In this work I created a detailed proposal of the procedure that generates and checks these headers and it can tell apart <b>user</b> <b>text</b> and work with him. According to this design, I implemented a program that serves as a platform and its functionality can be expanded by modules. The program periodically checks the information in the information system, as well as the contents of the headers, if the user did not manually change the content and if nothing else changed in the header, these headers can be skipped. This shortened the program running time more than twice, and has made it easy to add new functionalities. This solution prevents the loss of user data, greatly speeds up the control of the entire documentation and makes it more efficient. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the central}} skills in {{learning}} to ‘turn knowledge into wisdom ’ is critical reading: the ability to learn from text, to think analytically and critically and to develop an ethical and reasoned position as a result. However, it is often assumed that students will acquire {{the ability to read}} critically without active intervention from their teachers. This paper reports on a study of students ’ acquisition of critical reading skills across the first three semesters of a Bachelor of Education course. We defined critical reading as engaging in dialogue with texts—both listening to the voices of the text and responding to them, and used Luke’s four reader resources as a framework: code-breaker, text <b>user,</b> <b>text</b> participant and text analyst. Our data revealed that certain scaffolding strategies fostered students’ disposition towards critical reading, for example: embedding the reading into the assessment, classroom discussion and lectures; careful selection of reading materials of different genres; focusing on metacognitive reading strategies; and linking the reading to the students’ personal identities as future teachers. However, when these supportive teaching practices were discontinued, students abandoned the critical reading practices which they had acquired. We argue, then, that critical literacy practices have to be developed on a longitudinal basis by integration across a course structure...|$|E
