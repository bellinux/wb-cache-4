On July 19, the UFC announced that a second sample taken in-competition on July 9 {{tested positive for the}} same banned substance discovered in the previous out-of-competition sample. On August 23, the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) confirmed that Lesnar twice tested positive for the estrogen blocker clomiphene and he was suspended.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1999, the USOC {{launched}} USADA {{and operations}} {{were set to}} begin in October 2000. In 2003, one of USADA's first major undertakings was the revision of the then-current <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>anti-doping</b> policies {{in order to bring}} them into compliance with the newly adopted World Anti-Doping Code. One of the major adjustments made to the Code by USADA included reducing the standard of proof required in doping-related adjudication. Before modifications, the standard of proof was equal to that required in a <b>United</b> <b>States</b> court of law. After modification, USADA reduced the standard required to establish a doping violation to [...] "comfortable satisfaction of a hearing body".|$|R
25|$|The Council of Europe works {{mainly through}} conventions. By {{drafting}} conventions or international treaties, common legal standards are set for its member states. However, several conventions {{have also been}} opened for signature to non-member states. Important examples are the Convention on Cybercrime (signed for example, by Canada, Japan, South Africa and the <b>United</b> <b>States),</b> the Lisbon Recognition Convention on the recognition of study periods and degrees (signed for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada, the Holy See, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand and the <b>United</b> <b>States),</b> the <b>Anti-doping</b> Convention (signed, for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada and Tunisia) and the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (signed for example, by Burkina Faso, Morocco, Tunisia and Senegal {{as well as the}} European Community).

5|$|A {{sample for}} an out-of-competition drugs test that Chambers had {{provided}} in Germany on 1 August 2003 was re-examined in October and subsequently {{tested positive for}} banned substances. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> (USADA) were investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO); the workplace of both Chambers' coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte.

The BALCO Scandal uncovered drug use {{in a wide range}} of sportsmen and women, including sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a sweep of the podium at La Fl√®che Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> for distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several of his clients.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency,</b> but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E

25|$|In October 2012, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> {{released}} a report on doping by the U.S. Postal Service cycling team, implicating, amongst others, Armstrong. The report contained affidavits from riders including Frankie Andreu, Tyler Hamilton, George Hincapie, Floyd Landis, Levi Leipheimer, and others describing widespread use of Erythropoietin (EPO), blood transfusion, testosterone, and other banned practices in several Tours. In October 2012 the UCI acted upon this report, formally stripping Armstrong of all titles since 1 August 1998, including all seven Tour victories, and announced that his Tour wins would not be reallocated to other riders.|$|E
25|$|In June 2012, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> (USADA) accused Armstrong of doping and {{trafficking}} of drugs, {{based on}} blood samples from 2009 and 2010, and testimonies from witnesses including former teammates. Further, {{he was accused}} of putting pressure on teammates to take unauthorized performance-enhancing drugs as well. In October, USADA formally charged him with running a massive doping ring. It also sought to ban him from participating in sports sanctioned by WADA for life. Since all Olympic sports follow the World Anti-Doping Code, USADA's sanctions would have effectively ended Armstrong's competitive career. Armstrong chose not to appeal the ban, saying it would not be worth the toll on his family.|$|E
25|$|The test on Landis's stage 17 A {{sample had}} been {{performed}} by the French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD). LNDD is {{a division of the}} Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life and is accredited by WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency. In early August, Landis was found guilty of doping and was disqualified. Second place rider √ìscar Pereiro became the race's official winner. The decision of whether to strip Landis of his title was made by the International Cycling Union (UCI). Under UCI rules, the determination of whether a cyclist violated any rules must be made by the cyclist's national federation, in this case USA Cycling, which transferred the case to the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> (USADA).|$|E

50|$|In 2013, further {{amendments}} to the Code were approved, doubling the sanction for a first offence where intentional doping is established, but allowing for more lenient sanctions for inadvertent rule violations or for athletes co-operating with <b>anti-doping</b> <b>agencies.</b> The updated code came into effect on January 1, 2015.|$|R
50|$|Ruzavin was {{suspended}} from competition by RUSADA (the Russian <b>anti-doping</b> <b>agency)</b> in October 2014 due to abnormalities in his biological passport.

25|$|Papp has {{extensive}} academic training, and {{he earned}} a BA in History (summa cum laude) from the University of Pittsburgh, where {{he was elected to}} Phi Beta Kappa. He won a Coro Fellowship in Public Affairs and was a graduate student in the Heinz School of Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, before he later pursued an MBA at Chatham University. However, Papp's academic work and professional development were interrupted by his controversial and extensive involvement in multiple doping scandals in cycling, including those involving Floyd Landis, Kayle Leogrande, Frenchwoman Jeannie Longo, and Lance Armstrong. After cooperating extensively on various cases with the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency,</b> Papp was sentenced in 2011 on two counts of conspiracy to distribute performance-enhancing drugs. He has become a staunch anti-doping advocate and public speaker.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests‚Äîone in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E
