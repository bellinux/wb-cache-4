5|$|As {{a symbol}} of the Caliph's ritual role {{as the leader of the}} Muslim community, they were closely paralleled in {{official}} propaganda by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. In addition, the constant warfare on the Syrian marches was <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Abbasids as it provided employment for the Syrian and Iraqi military elites and the various volunteers (muṭṭawi‘a) who flocked to participate in the jihad.|$|E
5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British. When Arnold and his troops, {{making up the}} rear guard of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and {{set fire to the}} sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E
5|$|Other basic {{defensive}} measures {{included the}} removal of signposts, milestones (some had the carved details obscured with cement) and railway station signs making {{it more likely that}} an enemy would become confused. Petrol pumps were removed from service stations near the coast and there were careful preparations for the destruction of those that were left. Detailed plans were made for destroying anything that might prove <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> invader such as port facilities, key roads and rolling stock. In certain areas non-essential citizens were evacuated. In the county of Kent, 40% of the population was relocated; in East Anglia, the figure was 50%.|$|E

5|$|Three warrant {{officers}} survived: the gunner and carpenter were spared {{because they}} were considered <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship, and Southcott the master was spared so he could navigate. Southcott lived {{to be a key}} witness, along with Casey, who was also spared, and their eyewitness accounts and testimony were key to the trials of many of the mutineers. Three petty officers joined the mutiny, one midshipman, Surgeon's Mate Cronin, and Master's Mate Turner.|$|E

5|$|Whether the {{information}} Fuchs passed {{relating to the}} hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe's 1952 assessment, which concluded {{that by the time}} Fuchs left the thermonuclear program in mid-1946, too little was known about the mechanism of the hydrogen bomb for his information to be <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. The successful Teller-Ulam design was not devised until 1951. Soviet physicists later noted that they could see as well as the Americans eventually did that the early designs by Fuchs and Edward Teller were useless.|$|E

5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured.|$|E
5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, shall make further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy. In contrary to Article 37, many {{policies have been}} implemented by state and union governments which go against the DPSPs such as using intoxicating drinks as source of major tax revenue instead of implementing prohibition for better health of people, separation of judiciary from executive, uniform civil code for the citizen, etc. When the union government feels that a DPSP is no longer <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation, it shall be deleted from Constitution by bringing {{a constitutional amendment to}} remove ambiguity in policy making / direction. Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is diametrically opposite to any DPSP.|$|E
5|$|President Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, {{days after}} the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Expecting the Dutch colonial government to return, Djajakusuma and Ismail helped establish the Independent Artists (Seniman Merdeka) {{as a form of}} resistance. The group travelled throughout the city, spreading news of Indonesia's proclaimed independence while performing from an open-air truck. After the arrival of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, the group sometimes attempted to spy on the Europeans or hide information which would be considered <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> returning Dutch forces. Owing to this dangerous work, Djajakusuma began carrying a pistol, and went to Banten to ask a kyai to make him impervious to bullets.|$|E

5|$|During the siege, {{with the}} {{supplies}} {{in the city}} running shorter by the day, British troops {{were sent to the}} Boston Harbour to raid farms for supplies. Graves, apparently acting on intelligence that the Colonials might make attempts on the islands, posted guard boats near Noddle's Island. These were longboats that included detachments of Marines. Sources disagree {{as to whether or not}} any regulars or marines were stationed on Noddle's Island to protect the naval supplies. In response, the Colonials began clearing Noddle's Island and Hog Island of anything <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British. Graves on his flagship , taking notice of this, signalled for the guard marines to land on Noddle's island and ordered the armed schooner , under the command of his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves, to sail up Chelsea Creek to cut off the colonists' route. This contested action resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the capture and burning of Diana. This setback prompted Graves to move , which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved manoeuvrability if fired upon from land. He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.|$|E
5|$|The first manned mission flown from an {{independent}} Kazakhstan was Soyuz TM-14, launched on 17 March 1992, which carried the EO-11 crew to Mir, docking on 19 March before {{the departure of}} Soyuz TM-13. On 17 June, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and US President George H. W. Bush announced what would later become the Shuttle-Mir programme, a cooperative venture which proved <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cash-strapped Roskosmos (and led to the eventual completion and launch of Spektr and Priroda). EO-12 followed in July, alongside a brief visit by French astronaut Michel Tognini. The following crew, EO-13, began preparations for the Shuttle-Mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft, Soyuz TM-16 (launched on 26 January 1993), which was equipped with an APAS-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue, enabling it to dock to Kristall and test the port which would later be used by US space shuttles. The spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis, in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called Rezonans conducted on 28 January. Soyuz TM-15, meanwhile, departed with the EO-12 crew on 1 February.|$|E
5|$|Typically, ice traders hired {{vessels to}} ship ice as freight, {{although}} Frederic Tudor initially purchased his own vessel and the Tudor Company later bought three fast cargo ships {{of its own}} in 1877. Ice was first transported in ships {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when it was occasionally used as ballast. Shipping ice as ballast, however, required it to be cleanly cut in order to avoid it shifting around as it melted, which was not easily done until Wyeth's invention of the ice-cutter in 1825. The uniform blocks that Wyeth's process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into the limited space of a ship's hold, and significantly reduced the losses from melting. The ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust, and the hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering; other forms of protective dunnage used to protect ice included hay and pine tree cuttings. This requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with the growth in the New England lumber industry in the 1830s; sawdust had no other use at the time, and was in fact considered something of a problem, so its use in the ice trade proved very <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local timber industry.|$|E
