40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the problematics of Lactide polymerization in the melt. Theoretical part summarizes properties of lactic acid, lactides and polylactides as well as currently used methods of their preparation. In experimental part, a set of three experiments was designed, namely dependance of viscosity average molecular weight on catalyst concentration, polymerisation temperature and polymerisation time. This was achieved by measuring cinematic viscosity using <b>Ubbelohde</b> <b>viscosimeter.</b> As {{a result of these}} experiments, it was found that one of posssible combinations of conditions resulting in high molecular weight polymers is the following: concentration ratio of catalyst towards lactide 110 – 4, polymerisation teperature 160 °C and polymerisation time 3 hours...|$|E

In 	this paper，the author investigates theoretically how it changes when the form of upper vessel is taken into account. 	As the form of entrance of Saybolt and <b>Ubbelohde</b> <b>viscosimeter</b> is very complicated 	the author performed the theoretical calculation under the simple assumption that the cross sectional view is made of straight and arch 1 ines. The resu 1 ts show that: 	 1) If an inner radius of a vessel is five or more times larger than tha t of a pipe， 	the additional loss in entrance is about constant. 	 2) When the pressure loss in a vessel is taking into account， the additional loss 	increases if an inner radius of a vessel is less than ten times that of a pipe， and is 	about constant if the former is ten or more {{times larger than the}} latte...|$|E
