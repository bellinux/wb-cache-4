The NEA High Priority Request List for nuclear data presents a need for improved characterisation of the hafnium cross section in the resolved resonance region. This thesis presents new resonance cross section parameters for the six natural hafnium isotopes. Cross section measurements, supported by the NUDAME and EUFRAT projects, were performed at the IRMM Geel GELINA time-of-flight facility. Capture experiments were conducted on the 12 m, 28 m and 58 m flight paths using C_ 6 D_ 6 detectors and transmission experiments were performed at flight paths of 26 m and 49 m using a ^ 6 Li glass detector. The samples used were metallic natural hafnium discs of various thicknesses and hafnium oxide powders, with differing isotopic enrichments.

40|$|The recent {{analyses}} of the light curves provided by CoRoT have revealed pulsation spectra of unprecedented richness and precision, in particular, thousands of pulsating modes, and a clear distribution of amplitudes with frequency. In the community, some scientists have started doubting {{about the validity of}} the classical tools to analyze these very accurate light curves. This work provides the asteroseismic community with answers to this question showing that (1) it is physically possible for a star to excite at a time and with the observed amplitudes such a large number of modes; and (2) that the kinetic energy accumulated in all those modes does not destroy the equilibrium of the star. Consequently, mathematical tools presently applied in the {{analyses of}} light curves can a priori be trusted.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} of ultra-high energy cosmic ray acceleration in extragalactic radio sources, at {{the interface between}} the relativistic jet and the surrounding medium, is discussed {{as a supplement to}} the shock acceleration in `hot spots'. Due to crossing the tangential discontinuity of the velocity the particle can gain an amount of energy comparable to the energy gain at the shock crossing. However, the spectrum of particles accelerated at the jet side boundary is expected to be much flatter than the one formed at the shock. Due to this fact, particles accelerated at the boundary can dominate the overall spectrum at highest energies. In conditions characteristic to extragalactic jets' terminal shocks, the mechanism naturally provides the particles with E ~ 10 ^ 20 eV and complies with the efficiency requirements. The spectrum formation near the cut-off energy due to action of both the shock acceleration and the tangential discontinuity acceleration is modelled with the Monte Carlo particle simulations.

The photon calibrators have provided a valuable check on the official calibration, uncovering problems that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. We also present the first gravitational wave search sensitive to neutron star f-modes, usually considered the most efficient gravitational wave emitting modes. We find no evidence of gravitational waves associated with any SGR burst in a sample consisting of the 2004 December 27 giant flare from SGR 1806 − 20 and 190 lesser events from SGR 1806 − 20 and SGR 1900 + 14 which occurred {{during the first year of}} LIGO’s fifth science run. Gravitational wave strain upper limits and model-dependent gravitational wave emission <b>energy</b> <b>upper</b> <b>limits</b> are estimated for individual bursts using a variety of simulated waveforms. The unprecedented sensitivity of the detectors allows us to set the most stringent limits on transient gravitational wave amplitude...|$|R
