40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{introduction}} to the concept of <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> and its determinants. Particular attention is given to the influence of taxation. The concept of <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> relates to the rental, the rate of return to capital, that arises in a profit maximising situation in which further investment in capital produces no additional profit. This paper sets out in some detail the range of assumptions involved in obtaining alternative expressions for the <b>user</b> <b>cost.</b> The <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> refers to a before-tax capital rental, the rate of return that ensures that the (after-tax) cost of capital is equal to the post-tax returns over its life.

When OPMA was first released in February 2005, platform hardware management was being treated as a value added feature by OEMs. This resulted in a constant redesign of the management card infrastructure such that no two motherboard manufacturers could use the same card. Lack of standards and constant redesign resulted in higher end <b>user</b> <b>costs.</b> While PCI based management cards were available which could be plugged {{into a variety of}} platforms, the PCI bus did not provide direct access to all of the sensors needed to manage the hardware aspects of a platform. To gain full sensor access, custom headers had to be added to motherboards. Custom cables then linked these sideband signals between the card and the motherboard. PCI based platform management cards also consume a PCI slot which is a premium resource for many servers. This is especially true of those using the 1U rack format and those which need PCI slots for RAID interface cards that enhance system hard disk throughput.|$|E

The relationship between <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and rents might well be much tighter at the micro level; after all, house prices and rents (and their growth rates) can vary dramatically within cities, and rents are notoriously sticky. Furthermore, the use of indexes precludes both cross-sectional and dollar cost comparisons. In this study, we use Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CE) data to examine the relationship between <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and rents at the individual unit-level, in dollars, using unit-level information on house value, rent, taxes, and the like. This allows us to accurately estimate unit-specific <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and to control for unobservables like structure and neighborhood quality.

In keeping with most previous research, we find tremendous divergence between conventional measures of <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and net rents, thus ruling out index construction errors as a possible explanation. This divergence does not result from a faulty rent measure: we find that reported rents are sensible, in that they move similarly to official rent indexes, and are not simply out-of-pocket expenses. Instead, and most perplexing, we find a surprisingly close correspondence between net rents and a particular estimate of <b>user</b> <b>costs,</b> one implicitly assuming zero transactions costs and constructed using an appreciation measure that is both theoretically suspect and empirically a poor predictor of actual appreciation. <b>User</b> <b>costs</b> House price appreciation Forecasting Rental equivalence...|$|E

40|$|Most {{models of}} the rental housing market assume a close linkage between the level of {{residential}} rents and the after-tax <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> of rental housing capital. However, little empirical evidence exists to establish {{the strength of this}} linkage or the speed with which rents adjust to changes in <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> or tax policy. This paper develops and estimates an econometric model of the rental housing market in order to shed light on both of these issues. United States annual data for 1964 through 1993 are used to generate two-stage least squares estimates of a four equation structural model. Although the results are generally consistent with expectations and reveal several interesting relationships among the system variables, the estimates fail to identify a strong relationship between rent and <b>user</b> <b>cost.</b> About half of an increase in <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> is ultimately passed along as higher rent. The adjustment process also takes a long time, with only {{about a third of the}} long-run effect realized within ten years of a <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> shock. The fundamental reason for this result is that our estimate of the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> series, based upon widely accepted procedures, is much more volatile than the residential rent series. ...|$|R

These estimates contrast sharply with many previous studies that obtained small and/or statistically insignificant estimates of the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> elasticity using U. S. data.

If the supply curve for capital is upward sloping and shocks to demand are important (as {{they are likely to}} be over the business cycle), estimates of the <b>user</b> <b>cost</b> elasticity that rely on high-frequency movements in the variables will tend to be biased.

40|$|This paper constructs, for {{the five}} largest cities in the United States, <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and rents for the same structure, in levels (i. e., {{measured}} in dollars). The levels formulation is a major advantage over indexes since one can answer questions like "Is it cheaper to rent or to own?" or "Are houses overvalued?" because such questions are essentially about the levels of rents and house prices and their fundamentals. These new measures are constructed using Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) Interview data from 1982 to 2002, along with house price appreciation forecasts from Verbrugge (2007 a). Characteristics, current market value, and rental equivalence of owner-occupied housing are used in a regression framework to predict the rent associated with a structure with median characteristics in each city. The property value of this median house is used to construct a user cost estimate for this structure. We find that, for the median structure in each city, estimated <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> and rents diverge to a surprising degree, {{in keeping with the}} previously noted findings of Verbrugge (2007 a). It is not always cheaper to own: <b>user</b> <b>costs</b> sometimes lie well above rents.
