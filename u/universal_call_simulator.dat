This in mainly {{due to the}} lack of sensory feedbacks during the task. The presented work aims at studying proprioceptive vibrations for improving the navigation task, decreasing simulator sickness and improving the sense of presence. In this study, proprioceptive vibrations are used to stimulate the lower gluteus maximus muscles during the avatar displacement in the virtual world.

The core of this component is based on the discrete event Java-based <b>simulator,</b> <b>called</b> <b>Simulator</b> for Controlling Virtual Infrastructures (CVI-SIM)[22]. CVI-SIM was initially used to evaluate the performance of the proposed server placement heuristics[2]. It provides an extensible simulation environment that was developed to facilitate research on the control of (virtualized) infrastructures. CVI-SIM acts also as an emulator since it is designed to support importing actual resource specification files (e.g., GENI v 3 RSpec[23]).|$|R

The shape parameterization {{is based on the}} design element technique and a rational Bezicr body is used to serve as the design element. Practical implementation issues related to the introduction of design variables are discussed briefly. The design sensitivity calculation is based on the discrete approach. The proposed solution process layout is based on a stand-alone optimization program which makes use of compatiblc analysis programs <b>called</b> <b>simulators.</b> For illustrationpurpose an example problem containing shape and sizing design variables is formulated and solved. The range of use of the proposed approachis illustrated with three further examples...|$|R
