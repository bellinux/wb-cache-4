In Professor Ramadan's case and many others, the government is using immigration laws to stigmatize and exclude its critics and to censor and control the ideas that Americans can hear. Censorship of this kind is completely inconsistent with the most basic principles of an open society."Ramadan himself remarked:"The U.S. government's actions in my case seem, at least to me, to have been arbitrary and myopic.

50|$|One way to {{understand}} the moral sense is to {{draw an analogy between}} it and other kinds of senses. Beauty, for example, is something we see in some faces, artworks and landscapes. We can also hear it in some pieces of music. We clearly do not need an independent aesthetic sense faculty to perceive beauty in the world. Our ordinary five senses are quite enough to observe it, though merely observing something beautiful is no guarantee that we can observe its beauty. In the same way, a color-blind person is not necessarily able to perceive the green color of grass although he is capable of vision. Suppose we give a name to this ability to appreciate the beauty in things we see: one might call it the aesthetic sense. This aesthetic sense does not come automatically to all people with perfect vision and hearing, so it is fair to describe it as something extra, something not wholly reducible to vision and hearing. As the aesthetic sense informs <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is beautiful, we can analogically understand the moral sense as informing us of what is good. People with a functioning moral sense get a clear impression of wrongness when they see puppies being kicked, for example.|$|E

5000|$|The album artwork shows Lee's {{face with}} a {{distinct}} orange line through it, signifying that he is [...] "no longer a robot". The overall theme of [...] "no longer being a robot" [...] follows suit {{in all of the}} songs on the album, sending a message of freedom from sin through the gospel and not conforming to the ways of this world. It takes its idea from Romans 12:2, which reads, [...] "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then {{you will be able to}} test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will". Lee wanted to explore and redefine [...] "The Good Life," [...] arguing that [...] "though the world, the flesh, and the devil lie to <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the good life is, we don't have to be controlled by those lies. We don't have to be robots. We can choose life." [...] Lee wanted to [...] "challenge the lies we've been told, and present a more glorious picture." [...] It directly challenges and addresses such hot button issues like abortion, lust, the love of money, and excessive consumerism. Overall, Lee wanted to [...] "point his listeners to the grace found in the gospel".|$|E
5000|$|Writers who use {{oral history}} have often {{discussed}} {{its relationship to}} historical truth. Gilda O'Neill writes in Lost Voices, an oral history of East End hop-pickers: [...] "I began to worry. Were the women's, and my, memories true or were they just stories? I realised that I had no 'innocent' sources of evidence - facts. I had, instead, the stories and their tellers' reasons for remembering in their own particular ways.' [...] Duncan Barrett, one of the co-authors of The Sugar Girls describes some of the perils of relying on oral history accounts: [...] "On two occasions, {{it became clear that}} a subject was trying to mislead <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened - telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. ... often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives." [...] Alessandro Portelli argues that oral history is valuable nevertheless: [...] "it tells us less about events as such than about their meaning ... the unique and precious element which oral sources force upon the historian ... is the speaker's subjectivity." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} auditions episode, {{broadcast}} on 18 August, {{one of the}} auditionees in Cardiff, Zoe Alexander, a Pink tribute singer, tried to [...] "smash" [...] equipment after arguing with the judges about her claim that she was told to sing a Pink song after she sang [...] "So What". Barlow asked her to sing a second song, which was [...] "Next to Me" [...] by Emeli Sandé. After being criticised and given a [...] "no", Alexander threw down her microphone {{as she left the}} stage. Her father brought her back to the stage where she swore at the judges. She then stormed backstage, hit a camera operator, continued swearing and, when the cameras were turned off, hit a female producer of the show. Alexander was later cautioned by the police. She later claimed that her voice had been Auto-Tuned for the broadcast. Executive producer Richard Holloway said that every auditionee had a choice of five songs, adding: [...] "All the contestants that go in front of the judges, they're all spoken to by the production team as they have to get all the tracks to play so the conversation takes place between them and <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they want to sing and they go through their choices and the final decision about {{what they are going to}} sing when they walk on the stage is theirs, 100% theirs." [...] Alexander complained to Ofcom; her complaint was not upheld.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 May 2012, on the BBC's Question Time programme, Oborne commented {{following}} the jailing of a Rochdale sex trafficking gang, {{who had been}} convicted of rape, sexual activity with children and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children having raped, physically assaulted and sexually groomed girls as young as 12. Oborne said the victims had [...] "accepted the advances" [...] of their attackers and added: [...] "What does it tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> happened to our society that we have 12 year old girls, 13 year old girls, who are happy to give up their affection and their beauty to men in exchange for a packet of crisps?" [...] Some, such as Vicky Allan of The Herald, have claimed that this type of rhetoric amounts to victim blaming, saying that: [...] "there is a prevalent conviction that young girls are somehow asking for whatever they get as soon as they begin to behave in a sexual manner, or choose to involve themselves with men".|$|R

40|$|Pressures for {{religious}} reform—in any society or religious tradition—may {{lead to greater}} orthodoxy and orthopraxy, but can also invite opposition, social polarization, conflict, and violence. In this context {{the history of the}} Islamization of the Javanese is particularly interesting and significant.
