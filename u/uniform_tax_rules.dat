While strong administrative and political economy {{arguments in favor of}} uniform and neutral taxation remain, recent advances in optimal tax theory suggest that the information needed to implement the differentiated taxation prescribed by optimal tax theory may be easier to obtain than previously believed.

40|$|The Ramsey {{approach}} to optimal taxation and Ramsey <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> have amassed substance in economic theory. However, {{they are often}} criticized on grounds of practicality, fairness, feasibility and some other aspects of designing actual tax policy. This paper presents a collection of these views; it discusses how closely or remotely Ramsey rules are followed in designing tax policy. It presents some recent tax reforms in the US and in the UK that have closely, if not completely, followed the principle of distortion minimization. Despite the widely speculated difficulty associated with mapping normative <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> into positive policy design, {{it is possible to}} implement taxes that have strong correspondence to Ramsey tax formulas. This paper also discusses why some implemented <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> lack consistency with Ramsey principles, or why {{it is often difficult to}} establish correspondence between some implemented taxes and Ramsey <b>tax</b> <b>rules.</b> [...] Optimal Taxation,Policy Relevance,Ramsey <b>Tax</b> <b>Rules...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of international-capital mobility foreign direct investment is influenced by corporate income taxation and the <b>rules</b> how <b>taxes</b> paid in the host country are treated at home. In this paper the exemption, credit and deduction method are considered as <b>tax</b> <b>rules.</b> First, it is shown that under the exemption method there exist tax rate combinations that lead to a reversal of capital flows compared to a free-trade situation. Second, the decision on the <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> and the corporate tax rate is endogenized as outcome in a non-cooperative game. All <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> lead to the same inefficient outcome. Therefore, for each <b>tax</b> <b>rule</b> we analyze the conditions for Pareto-improving tax cooperation.

40|$|This paper reviews {{methods of}} {{comparing}} income tax progression. Section II deals with local measures of tax progression, Section III with global measures of tax progression, and Section IV with <b>uniform</b> <b>tax</b> progression. It is shown {{that all of}} this measures have specific drawbacks: they either ignore the income distribution altogether, aggregate over income intervals with pro-gression and regression, or they require that the same income distribution holds for comparisons of different tax schedules. However, realistic comparisons of tax progression ask for comparisons of different tax schedules associated with different income distributions. This is addressed in Section V for <b>uniform</b> <b>tax</b> progression with different income distributions. A respective condition of higher progression turns out as the sum of elasticities of the tax schedule and the density function of the income distribution. Alas, this is only a sufficient, not a necessary condition.

40|$|Based on {{the earlier}} work {{of one of}} the authors, this paper {{develops}} a unified methodology to compare tax progression for dominance relations under different income distributions. We address it as <b>uniform</b> <b>tax</b> progression for different income distributions and present the respective approach for both continuous and discrete cases, the latter also being employed for empirical investigations. Using dominance relations, we define tax progression under different income distributions as a class of natural extensions of <b>uniform</b> <b>tax</b> progression in terms of taxes, net incomes, and differences of first moment distribution functions. To cope with different monetary units and different supports of the income distributions involved, we utilized their transformations to population and income quantiles. Altogether, we applied six methods of comparing tax progression, three in terms of taxes and three in terms of net incomes, which we utilized for empirical analyses of comparisons of tax progression using data from the Luxembourg Income Study.

The aim of this book is to close this gap in tax law research and to analyse the provisions of international agreements and similar legal instruments under international law which provide for a special domestic law tax treatment for specific individuals and international organizations.

The EOp- and EO-criteria provide alternative methods for summarizing the efficiency-equality trade-off in the distribution of individual welfare. We also compare the results depending on whether we use income or money-metric utility as a measure of individual welfare. We estimate micro-econometric models of household labour supply and corresponding individual welfare measures based on 1995 Norwegian data for both married couples and singles. We then use these models to simulate behavioural responses and welfare gains and losses of various constant-revenue four-parameter <b>tax</b> <b>rules,</b> i. e. the <b>tax</b> <b>rules</b> defined by a lump-sum transfer (positive or negative), two marginal tax rates and a “kink point” that produces the same revenue collected with the observed 1995 rules.
