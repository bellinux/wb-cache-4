40|$|Planning as a volitional {{construct}} bridges the intention-behaviour-gap. However, {{there is}} little research on a person planning together with a partner. That is why this paper is about dyadic planning and its corresponding social and self-regulatory processes. A dyadic planning intervention is embedded in a longitudinal design. In the experimental group prostatectomy patients and their spouses were instructed to plan the patient’s pelvic floor exercise together. In the control groups, patients formed exercise plans by themselves, or were instructed to plan healthy eating dyadicly or individually. In the dyadic setting patients’ applied dyadic planning is associated with more exercise. This group-specific effect of dyadic planning is mediated by social control and action control. Pelvic floor exercise is associated with less urinary incontinence <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> post surgery. Future research should investigate gender differences in as well as microprocesses of dyadic planning...|$|R

The local information about the pattern of AB prescription in ARI is a necessary part for any program which aims logical use of AB. The current study was designed to find the frequency and types of AB administration for ARI in young children (< 2 years) in Mashhad, Iran. Method: This is an observational cohort study which was started in November 2005 and ended up at May 2006. The study group was composed of 1000 infants between 6 month and 20 months old. The children were followed monthly by telephone calls (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> after the first interview) and were asked about signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection and systemic antibiotic use during each month.

Additionally, the exigencies of the war meant that the government required the power to enact certain laws that under the Constitution it would not normally be able to do.

5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

Risk of HIV infectionin these cases has been estimated to be 0. 2 - 0. 3 percent for parenteral exposure. If an accidental exposure occurs, there are some post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) protocols that reduce the risk of transmission. The PEP protocol consists of report of needle sticks injury,prescription of two or three antiretroviral agents in the first 48 hours after exposure, and antibody testing of HCW for seroconversion <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month.</b> Health care workers have to be educated about PEP and each institution needs to adopt a clear protocol...|$|R

At the time, it was established UN practice to seek consent of the country where its peacekeepers were deployed, and the letter effectively required UNPROFOR to withdraw completely from Croatia. Such action would also require abolishment of the UNPAs, which had been identified as integral parts of Croatia by United Nations Security Council Resolution 815 of 30 March 1993. Two days later, the Secretary-General reported to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that UNPROFOR was unable to implement important elements of the Vance plan, enforce a ceasefire, or protect its own vehicles against hijackings in the UNPAs.|$|E

5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license {{a single piece of}} software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> or until the following breeding season.|$|E
