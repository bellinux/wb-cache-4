5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Eastern Han, {{following}} the <b>usurpation</b> of Wang Mang and the re-establishment of the Han, the tribal elites of Nanyue remained loyal to the Han. In 40, revolts against Han rule were led by the Trung sisters near the Red River Delta. The rebellion was defeated in 43 by the general Ma Yuan, a participant in the battles that followed Wang Mang's <b>usurpation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC {{was fought}} between Rome and Jugurtha of the North African kingdom of Numidia. It {{constituted}} the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion {{on the continent}} after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's <b>usurpation</b> of the throne of Numidia, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome felt compelled to intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his <b>usurpation.</b> Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{analyses}} {{the land}} <b>usurpations</b> into the municipal area of Plasencia (Cáceres) {{reported at the}} end of 15 th Century and beginning of 16 th Century. In these <b>usurpations</b> took part the practically totality {{of the members of the}} neighbouring nobility, the local knights and the villages located inside the municipal area. The <b>usurpations</b> mainly affected to Campo Arañuelo and the area comprised between the rivers Tagus and Almonte; i. e., the spaces with less demographic density. The main initiative against these abuses was sometimes taken by the city council, but also the royal small villages had an outstanding role at the defence of communal goods...|$|R
5|$|Conrad {{played an}} {{important}} role in the major political events of the day, including the election of Lothair of Supplinburg as King of Germany in 1125, whom he supported during the fight against the Hohenstaufen <b>usurpation.</b> During the papal schism of 1130 he played a role in the recognition of Pope Innocent II by the king.|$|E

5|$|Bajkam's {{unexpected}} death {{created a}} power vacuum in Baghdad, with disagreements between Daylamite and Turkish forces prompting the former {{to join the}} defeated al-Baridi. With their assistance, he marched on Wasit and Baghdad, capturing them, but was soon forced to flee due to the disorder that followed his <b>usurpation</b> of power. A Daylamite chief named Kurankij replaced him as de facto ruler of Baghdad, but he imposed tyrannical rule, and al-Muttaqi appealed to the former amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq for assistance.|$|E

50|$|It {{was during}} the Crisis of the Third Century that the {{traditional}} imperial approach of a single imperial magistrate based at Rome became unable to cope with multiple and simultaneous invasions and <b>usurpations</b> that required the emperor to be everywhere at once. Further, it was their absence which caused <b>usurpations</b> to occur {{in response to a}} local or provincial crisis that traditionally would have been dealt with by the emperor.|$|R
5|$|Hamdan was {{defeated}} in 895 and imprisoned with his relatives, but his son Husayn ibn Hamdan managed to secure the family's future. He raised troops for the Caliph among the Taghlib in exchange for tax remissions, and established a commanding influence in the Jazira by acting as a mediator between the Abbasid authorities and the Arab and Kurdish population. It was this strong local base which allowed the family to survive its often strained relationship with the central Abbasid government in Baghdad during the early 10th century. Husayn was a successful general, distinguishing himself against the Kharijites and the Tulunids, but was disgraced after supporting the failed <b>usurpation</b> of Ibn al-Mu'tazz in 908. His younger brother Ibrahim was governor of Diyar Rabi'a (the province around Nasibin) in 919 and {{after his death in}} the next year he was succeeded by another brother, Dawud. Sayf al-Dawla's father Abdallah served as emir (governor) of Mosul in 905/6–913/4, was repeatedly disgraced and rehabilitated, until re-assuming control of Mosul in 925/6. Enjoying firm relations with the powerful Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, he later played {{a leading role in the}} short-lived <b>usurpation</b> of al-Qahir against al-Muqtadir in 929, and was killed during its suppression.|$|E
5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the Sack of Moguntiacum and the Sack of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by <b>usurpation,</b> in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E
5|$|Rome had, in {{the earlier}} Punic Wars, gained large tracts of {{territory}} in Africa, which they consolidated in the following centuries. Much of that land had been granted to the kingdom of Numidia, a kingdom on the north African coast approximating to modern Algeria, in return for its past military assistance. The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC was fought between Rome and Jugurtha of Numidia and constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. In response to Jugurtha's <b>usurpation</b> of the Numidian throne, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome intervened. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his <b>usurpation</b> and was granted half the kingdom. Following further aggression and further bribery attempts, the Romans sent an army to depose him. The Romans were defeated at the Battle of Suthul but fared better at the Battle of the Muthul and finally defeated Jugurtha at the Battle of Thala, the Battle of Mulucha, and the Battle of Cirta (104 BC). Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery, ending the war.|$|E

5|$|When John of Gaunt died in 1399, Richard disinherited John's son, Henry, who invaded England in {{response}} {{with a small}} force that quickly grew in numbers. Meeting little resistance, Henry deposed Richard to have himself crowned Henry IV of England. Richard died in captivity early the next year, probably murdered, bringing {{an end to the}} main Plantagenet line. None of Henry's heirs were free from challenge on the grounds of not being the true heir of Richard II and that the Lancastrian dynasty had gained the throne by an act of <b>usurpation.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{personal}} banner of the Sovereign, {{use of the}} Royal Banner of Scotland is restricted under the Act of the Parliament of Scotland 1672 cap. 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17, and any unauthorised use of such is an offence under the Act. In 1978 a St Albans linen merchant, Denis Pamphilon, was fined £100 daily for <b>usurpation</b> of the banner on decorative bedspreads until he desisted, and both Rangers F.C. and the Scottish National Party have been admonished by the Court of the Lord Lyon for their improper and non-authorised use of the banner. Despite such action, the flag continues to feature {{on a variety of}} merchandise and souvenirs produced commercially for Scotland's economically important tourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{senators}} and equites combined military service with civilian posts, a career path {{known as the}} cursus honorum, typically starting with a period of junior administrative posts in Rome, followed by 5–10 years {{in the military and}} a final period of senior positions in either the provinces or Rome. This tiny, tightly-knit ruling oligarchy of under 10,000 men monopolised political, military and economic power in an empire of c. 80 million inhabitants and achieved a remarkable degree of political stability. During the first 200 years of its existence (30 BC – 180 AD), the empire suffered only one major episode of civil strife (the Civil War of 68–9). Otherwise, <b>usurpation</b> attempts by provincial governors were few and swiftly suppressed.|$|E

5|$|Solomon was {{succeeded by}} his nephew Sergius, who proved {{completely}} inadequate {{in dealing with}} the situation. The Moors launched a general revolt and inflicted a severe defeat on the Byzantines in Thacia in 545. Sergius was recalled, while the army mutinied again, this time under Guntharis, who captured Carthage and installed himself there as an independent ruler. His <b>usurpation</b> did not last long as he was assassinated by Artabanes, {{but it was not until}} the arrival of John Troglita in late 546 and his subsequent campaigns that the province was to be pacified and brought again securely under Byzantine imperial control.|$|E
5|$|When Stone lectured in {{the dress}} {{in the fall}} of 1851, hers was the first Bloomer most of her audiences had ever seen. But by then, the dress had become controversial. Although {{newspapers}} had initially praised the practicality of the new style, they soon turned to ridicule and condemnation, now viewing the trousers as a <b>usurpation</b> of the symbol of male authority. Many women retreated in the face of criticism, but Stone continued to wear the short dress exclusively for the next three years. She also wore her hair short, cut just below her jaw line. After Stone lectured in New York City in April, 1853, the report of her speeches in the Illustrated News was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer dress.|$|E
5|$|When {{the council}} {{objects to the}} Duke's {{increasing}} <b>usurpation</b> of power and abrogation of the constitution, Süß suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. Süß tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, {{as a sign of}} their gratitude, the Jews of Württemberg will provide all the requisite funds. Süß argues that he would be most effective if the Duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from the laws of Württemberg. The Duke demurs at first but ultimately grants Süß's request.|$|E

5|$|Burnell was {{the chief}} and most {{influential}} of Edward I's advisers {{during the first half}} of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He heard many requests and petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king's major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell's tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell's death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in 1275, 1285, and 1290. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the <b>usurpation</b> of royal rights. Keeping the peace in the realm and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was dealt with in the statutes from 1285, along with a number of other issues. The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.|$|E
5|$|During January and February 1170 {{the king}} sent Barre on a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket. The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this <b>usurpation</b> {{of the right of}} the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.|$|E
5|$|Following King Henry I's {{death in}} 1135, the {{succession}} was disputed between the Henry's nephews—Stephen and his elder brother, Theobald II, Count of Champagne—and Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually {{known as the}} Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. Matilda's brother, and King Henry's only legitimate son, William died in 1120, leaving Matilda as Henry's only legitimate offspring. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to England, where her father married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died in 1135, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald acquiesced to his brother's <b>usurpation.</b>|$|E
