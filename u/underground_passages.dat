5|$|The major {{industry}} {{of this period}} was flintstone mining. One of the largest Neolithic (middle to late periods) flint mines in Europe with over 700 vertical shafts and preserved <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> was located in Krzemionki Opatowskie near Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski. The axes produced from the material obtained there were exported to distant parts of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the close}} precincts of the Bijaymandal, a domed {{building}} is seen {{which has a}} unique architectural façade of two openings on each of its three sides, interpreted as an annex to another building (based on <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> seen in the adjoining structure). However, the purpose for which this dome was built is not known.|$|E
5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four stirrup towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed around {{the outside of the}} castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards the end of this phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> installed, and foreworks added around the outside of the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Libava fortress was the most expensive and ambitious project of the Russian army on the Baltic sea. The massive concrete fortifications with eight cannon batteries was built to protect the city and its population from German attacks.

25|$|The fort {{includes}} more than two kilometers of <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> added between 1852 and 1860, with ceilings six meters thick. The fort was upgraded after the Franco-Prussian War {{as part of the}} Séré de Rivières program. A police barracks now occupies the former ditch on the west side, while a variety of buildings occupy the former glacis. The former casemates, barracks and magazine have been redeveloped as offices.|$|E
25|$|In 1831 {{the need}} for better {{facilities}} to contain the convicts within Hobart Town was answered by {{the opening of the}} Campbell Street Gaol with its magnificent Penitentiary Chapel, and open execution yard. Law Courts were soon added, and remained in use until 1983. The gaol features <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> and solitary confinement cells. Port Arthur the site of the secondary punishment penitentiary opened in 1830. By 1835 it had grown to house 800 convicts, many of whom regularly served in chain gangs. It operated until 1877.|$|E

Additionally, they discovered {{at the site}} formations of travertine, a form of calcite created when water flows through limestone and dissolves calcium carbonate, which is later redeposited. Further investigation revealed that deep beneath the Delphi region lies bituminous deposit, rich in hydrocarbons and full of pitch, that has a petrochemical content as high as 20%. Friction created by earthquakes heat the bituminous layers resulting in vaporization of the hydrocarbons which rise to the surface through small fissures in the rock.|$|E

25|$|Today, the {{enlarged}} {{building is}} {{the property of}} the federal government. It is listed by the INAH as in good conditionand at almost 500 years old, is the oldest preserved colonial era civil structure in Mexico. The building is made of local stone, using the old pre-Hispanic structure as a foundation. It contains merlons for defensive purposes, which was common for the era. There is a cylindrical tower on the northwest corner, but his was added in the late 19th century. Local lore states that there are <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> between the palace and the cathedral complex. However, none have been found and similar stories are common in other parts of Mexico with large colonial structures.|$|E
25|$|The Xuanpingmen {{gate was}} the main gate between the city and suburbs. The {{district}} north of the Weiyang Palace was the most exclusive. The main market, called the Nine Markets, was the eastern economic terminus of the Silk Road. Access to the market was from the Northeast and Northwest gates, which were the most heavily used by the common people. The former connect with a bridge over the Wei River to the northern suburbs and the latter connected {{with the rest of}} China to the east. An intricate network of <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> connected the imperial harem with other palaces and the city. These passages were controlled by underground gatehouses and their existence was unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Fort de la Pompelle {{was built}} between 1880 and 1883 to {{complete}} the fortification belt around Reims that was started by General Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. This secondary work was planned to support the principal forts of Witry-les-Reims, Nogent-l'Abbesse, Brimont, Saint-Thierry, Fresnes and Montbré. The relatively small rectangular fort {{was surrounded by a}} ditch defended by two-level caponiers. With a surface area of , it was provided with six 155mm de Bange 1881 guns, four 138mm guns and a variety of lesser pieces. An artillery company of 277 men garrisoned the fort. In 1917-18 a number of <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> were cut from the chalk to provide access points a few hundred meters {{to the rear of the}} fort.|$|E

25|$|On {{the hill}} {{there were also}} shops, workshops, {{warehouses}} and dwelling which probably belonged to the craftsmen and the servants. The narrow streets were covered with cobbles. The foundations of churches, water tanks and bolyar houses have been excavated. The walls which are 12 meters high follow the crown of the hill. The main gate was situated in the western section of the fortress and was defended by a complex fortification which included three towers, three gates and a drawbridge above the steep cliffs. Tsarevets had five more gates. There were also secret <b>underground</b> <b>passages.</b> Below the heights, along the river was built a second wall ring which surrounded the hill. In {{the vicinity of the}} Great Lavra monastery were discovered the foundations of a stone bridge which spanned over the Yantra river.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} pictorial {{representations of}} Jesus' Nativity come from sarcophagi in Rome and Southern Gaul of around this date. They are {{later than the}} first scenes of the Adoration of the Magi, which appears in the catacombs of Rome, where Early Christians buried their dead, often decorating {{the walls of the}} <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> and vaults with paintings. Many of these predate the legalisation of Christian worship by the Emperor Constantine in the early 4th century. Typically the Magi move in step together, holding their gifts in front of them, towards a seated Virgin with Christ on her lap. They closely resemble the motif of tribute-bearers which is common in the art of most Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cultures, and goes back at least two millennia earlier in the case of Egypt; in contemporary Roman art defeated barbarians carry golden wreaths towards an enthroned Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Grey Company of Dunedain {{remains in}} Dunland, where {{following}} their rescue from imprisonment in Tur Morva, the Rangers drove the traitorous Falcon Clan underground. The Ranges occupy {{the city itself}} and fight off several smaller ambushes, but don't have the force to assault the Dunlendings in the tunnels under Methedras, for the Falcon Clan knows them much better, resulting in a stalemate. The Sons of Elrond bid Halbarad to continue the journey south, yet many Rangers refuse to leave without having vengeance for their fallen brothers. The Ranger Saeradan, with Halbarad's permission, leaves the company and takes a wagon with {{the bodies of the}} fallen north, to prevent their defilement in the hostile lands. Upon reaching Enedwaith he makes an important discovery - the Oathbreakers of the Forsaken Road, responsible for an earlier attack on the Rangers, have left those lands and are travelling back to the Stone of Erech, hoping to be relieved of their eternal curse. In Tur Morva the Ranger Golodir refuses to wait for vengeance any longer and enters the caverns accompanied only by his friend Corunir. There they discover that the Falcon Clan has tricked them again and used the <b>underground</b> <b>passages</b> to cross the Misty Mountains into the lands of Rohan. In Isengard, the Ranger Lothrandir is still holding out against physical and mental abuse by Saruman's servants, but the Wizard has patience and is determined to break him.|$|E
