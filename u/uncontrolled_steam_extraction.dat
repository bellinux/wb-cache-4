40|$|AbstractFlexibility {{in power}} plants with amine based carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture is widely {{recognised}} {{as a way}} of improving power plant revenues. Despite the prior art, its value as a way to improve power plant revenues is still unclear. Most studies are based on simplifying assumptions about the capabilities of power plants to operate at part load and to regenerate additional solvent after interim storage of solvent. This work addresses this gap by examining the operational flexibility of supercritical coal power plants with amine based CO 2 capture, using a rigorous fully integrated model. The part-load performance with capture and with additional solvent regeneration, of two coal-fired supercritical power plant configurations designed for base load operation with capture, and with the ability to fully bypass capture, is reported. With advanced integration options configuration, including boiler sliding pressure control, <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>steam</b> <b>extraction</b> with a floating crossover pressure, constant stripper pressure operation and compressor inlet guide vanes, a significant reduction of the electricity output penalty at part load is observed. For instance at 50 % fuel input and 90 % capture, the electricity output penalty reduces from 458 kWh/tCO 2 (with conventional integration options) to 345 kWh/tCO 2 (with advanced integration options), compared to a reduction from 361 kWh/tCO 2 to 342 kWh/tCO 2 at 100 % fuel input and 90 % capture. However, advanced integration options allow for additional solvent regeneration to a lower magnitude than conventional integration options. The latter can maintain CO 2 flow export within 10 % of maximum flow across 30 – 78 % of MCR (maximum continuous rating). For this configuration, one hour of interim solvent storage at 100 % MCR is evaluated to be optimally regenerated in 4 h at 55 % MCR, and 3 h at 30 % MCR, providing rigorously validated useful guidelines for the increasing number of techno-economic studies on power plant flexibility, and CO 2 flow profiles for further studies on integrated CO 2 networks...|$|E

30|$|Due to the <b>steam</b> <b>extraction</b> in {{the turbine}} the yield of {{electrical}} power is reduced, see (3) and (5). The reduction {{depends on the}} pressure of the <b>steam</b> <b>extraction</b> which is again influenced by the required feed flow temperature in the district heating system. The concept of the approach is that the loss of electrical power due to heat extraction can be estimated by the increase of the exergy in the district heating flow. Consequently the influence of the temperatures in the district heating system is accounted for. Even if the power loss coefficient (β) is available for a realized CHP plant, this influence is rarely available.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is likely}} that a {{significant}} number of existing pulverised coal-fired power plants will be retrofitted with post-combustion capture as part of a global rollout of carbon capture and storage. Previous studies have demonstrated that the energy penalty for post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture can be greatly minimised by effective integration of the capture system with the power cycle. Nevertheless, the power output of the site is, in most cases, reduced and the volume of electricity sales would drop. For other plants, the existing steam cycle {{may not be able to}} be integrated effectively for <b>steam</b> <b>extraction,</b> or space and access around/to the steam cycle may be impossible. As an alternative to <b>steam</b> <b>extraction,</b> it is possible to retrofit existing coal plants with a gas turbine combined cycle plant (CCGT) to maintain, or even increase, the site power output. The gas turbine can be integrated to the existing coal plant in various ways to supply all the heat, or a fraction of the heat, and the power required for the capture systems. An important consideration is whether carbon emissions from both, the combined cycle and the retrofitted coal plant are captured, or from the latter only. This paper examines these different options for carbon capture retrofits to existing coal plant and presents a novel configuration with the sequential combustion of gas turbine flue gas in the existing coal boiler while capturing carbon emissions from the combustion of coal and natural gas...|$|R
