Expanding further on the basis for the prequel, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} new album, Blink-182 created {{an entirely new}} logo, a [...] "smiley face" [...] with Xs for each eye and five arrows {{on the left side}} of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo {{originated}} at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: [...] "It just had to be a cool kind of happy face but I wanted arrows. You know, like The Jam were my favorite band, they always had arrows in their logos and stuff. It was just kind of inspired by pop-art." [...] Hoppus seconded this sentiment: [...] "He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea." [...] Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his good friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. [...] "His style, incorporated into Blink's, didn’t make us too gangster: it just gave <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side", Barker later remembered.|$|E
2500|$|On Australia Day 2015 Abbott {{announced}} that Queen Elizabeth had accepted his recommendation that her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, be appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia. The appointment was criticised by Shorten who said: [...] "It's {{a time warp}} where we're giving knighthoods to English [...] royalty. Some people (have) wondered whether it was an Australia Day hoax." [...] Adam Giles, Northern Territory chief minister and Country Liberal Party leader, said: [...] "I {{woke up this morning}} and read the wires and was confused between Australia Day and April Fool's Day," [...] adding [...] "It makes <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a joke. It's Australia Day, we're not a bunch of tossers." [...] Abbott later stated that he had made a captain's call and not consulted with his cabinet colleagues over the appointment. Abbott faced criticism from some parliamentarians in his own party and the Nationals over the proposed appointment.|$|E

6000|$|... "So we did. But I didn't {{think that}} hired man would wake up. Neither of <b>us</b> made <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of noise. He {{must be a}} light sleeper." ...|$|R
60|$|STRAKER. No prickly {{pears and}} broiled rabbits, you know. Don't {{tell me you}} can't do <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> better than that if you like.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a very}} dreary {{production}} and does not 'lighten and brighten' <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> The whole volume should be called The Lucubrations of a Stage Irishman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye're a raight hard un!" [...] {{returned}} the workman. [...] "Willn't ye gie <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> o' time? Willn't ye consent to mak your changes rather more slowly?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And there's {{this here}} man never letting <b>us</b> have <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> o' peace; but keeping on about being good and upright till 'tis carried {{to such a}} pitch as I never see the like afore nor since!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't half like leaving you," [...] {{returned}} Sam. [...] "This learned gentleman here {{is rather}} a shifty sort of chap; and {{it strikes me}} that two of <b>us</b> isn't <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too much to watch him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear. He'll knock <b>us</b> about <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> but he don't want a rope round his neck, you be sure. And he ain't so bad neither, when he's {{not in the}} drink. He's {{sorry he}} hit me now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now let <b>us</b> make <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of <b>a</b> scuffle; {{and will}} you fire a shot or two, gentlemen? They will be {{watching}} us with glasses from the shore, and will see that we make a fight for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I hope it's {{something}} that'll do <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of good," [...] he said. [...] "We need it. The Germans are miles {{ahead of}} us with regard to all new-fangled ideas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{talk like}} a fool," [...] {{interrupted}} {{the master of}} the steamer. [...] "Those boys are no more responsible for our ill luck than you or I. The ice knocked <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too hard, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has a {{place in}} London;--such a place! You shall go and see it some day, though he won't thank <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> for taking you there. He has the queerest old man to wait upon him, and he never sees anybody from day to day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] said Dick Moy to the mate, shortly after, {{when they}} were all, except the watch, {{assembled}} below round the galley stove, [...] "are you goin' to let <b>us</b> 'ave <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> o' that there letter, accordin' to promise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] the {{old woman}} said; [...] "but this is hard news. I had hoped {{that you would be}} with <b>us</b> for <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> my boy, for we're getting on fast in life, and may not be here when you return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hadn't <b>us</b> {{better have}} <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> o' breakfast afore we start?' said Riderhood. 'It ain't good to freeze a empty stomach, Master.' ...|$|R
60|$|FALDER. There {{were all}} sorts there. And what I mean, sir, is, that if we'd been treated {{differently}} the first time, and put under somebody that could look after <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> and not put in prison, not {{a quarter of}} us would ever have got there.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the most}} {{singular}} case I ever knew," [...] said Sir Simon Slope {{that night to}} one of his friends. [...] "We certainly should have hanged him but for the two accidents, and yet neither of them brings <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> nearer to hanging any one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|The nigger stared {{like a man}} {{addressed}} unexpectedly in {{a foreign}} language.

Come on, old man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Charley pondered a moment, {{and then}} answered, [...] "The tide has edged <b>us</b> over <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{out of our}} course, but if the fog lifts right now, as {{it is going to}} lift, you'll find we're not more than a {{thousand}} miles off McNear's Landing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Davies {{also said}} of the song, [...] "It was a change of style for <b>us,</b> we got <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> posher! Our {{material}} started to get <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more melodic after that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, DO," [...] says Aunt Sally; [...] "it ain't <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{of trouble}} to <b>us,</b> not <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> in the world. You must stay. It's a long, dusty three mile, and we can't let you walk. And, besides, I've already told 'em {{to put on}} another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't {{disappoint}} us. Come right in and make yourself at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] I went on, [...] "you seem to {{overlook}} {{what used to}} weigh with <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> This canadium {{side of the business}} and the Capern chance has rushed you off your legs. After all--it's stealing, and in its way an international outrage. They've got two gunboats on the coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the mainmast, {{and pretty}} nigh drowned we were {{before we got}} there. I suppose the tide must have taken <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> further up than it did you. We got here well nigh two hours ago, though we got a good meal and dried our clothes at a farmhouse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to see {{you looking}} so fit," [...] he remarked. [...] "They did <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too well down at Bristow, I thought. It's all very well for you children," [...] he continued, with a smile, [...] "but when a man gets to my time of life he misses a night's rest." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the neighbourhood, though, was not that deadly, judging by the Bunin's diary entry for 1 August 1944: [...] "Nearby there were two guards, there were also one German, and one Russian prisoner, Kolesnikov, a student. The three of <b>us</b> talked <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> Saying our farewells, a German guard shook my hand firmly".|$|R
5000|$|In a 2013 radio interview, Dustin Schoenhofer of Walls of Jericho {{claimed that}} the band had finally severed ties with Trustkill Records, stating that while the label helped the band get established, they [...] "owe <b>us</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of money" [...] and did not fully support the band while {{engaging}} in heavy festival touring.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a deuced pity. The {{governors}} {{had settled}} everything, {{and we should}} have been awfully jolly. I'd have gone in for all the things you go in for; and though your governor was screwing <b>us</b> up <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> there would have been plenty of tin to go on with. You couldn't think of it again?' ...|$|R
