40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a method for}} removing geometric distortions in taken images of rectangular planar patterns (such as maps, pictures, or posters) {{in the absence of}} any calibration information or explicit knowledge of the imaging device. Our approach removes lens distortion form single-view images. The method is based on Least-Square-Error (LSE) approximations and Hough transforms. We approximate the lens distortion by considering only lower-order terms of the lens distortion. We further apply plane homography to <b>undistort</b> the perspective view and use texture fusion of different views to remove flash lights. Our algorithm transforms images of a planar pattern into an appealing image by eliminating different types of distortion (lens, perspective, flash light) ...|$|R
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are <b>undistorted,</b> due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and <b>undistorted</b> in post-production.|$|E

The projection system uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution projectors on each dome, using custom-made semi-circular fisheye lenses to project <b>undistorted</b> images {{at a rate}} of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4feet by two feet) and are approximately 80feet tall and 85feet wide. The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre-show of the ride. The animation reference was provided by Film Roman, the animation studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers.|$|E
40|$|Thermoformed {{plastic parts}} are {{pervasive}} in modern products. Decorating these thermoformed parts {{is a critical}} step in their manufacture. For parts with significant relief, decorating the part after it is formed can be prohibitively expensive. Prior to thermoforming, the plastic which is in flat sheets or rolls can easily be fed through a printer. However, during thermoforming the plastic flows and stretches {{to conform to the}} shape of the mold distorting the original decoration. This paper describes a device called the Image-Based Three-Dimensional Digitizer (IB 3 D) which measures the plastic deformation using vision techniques. Knowing the deformation allows us to pre-distort the graphic printed on the flat sheets such that as the plastic flows into the thermoforming mold the decoration <b>undistorts.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Europe specialises {{more than}} its main global {{competitors}} in industries with relatively high carbon emissions, such as minerals and chemicals, rather than in high-tech industries and services. This would have a real effect on Europe’s competitiveness in a world regulated by carbon pricing schemes such as the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme – even if other blocs apply them as the EU does. Furthermore, {{in the absence of}} fair and <b>undistorting</b> carbon pricing schemes worldwide, there is a real risk that business will resort to regulatory arbitrage which will entail a shift in where emissions take place – but no reduction in global emissions. In any case, the issue of which economies are ‘carbon competitive’ will gradually become a much bigger part of the global trade conversation...|$|R
40|$|TecPIV is a MATLAB-based, {{open source}} {{application}} aiming to facilitate and accelerate the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis of analogue tectonic models. Since tectonic modelling experiments are usually slow, low sensitivity but high resolution digital cameras {{can be employed}} to monitor displacements and calculate strain from PIV analysis. The presented workow package provides an integrated environment to import raw les, calibrate, enhance, <b>undistort</b> and rectify {{the views of the}} model, calculate the incremental displacements between successive images, the spatial derivatives, and the Eulerian cumulative displacements. The calibration procedure employs a combination of linear and polynomial functions allowing correction of both lens and parallax distortions. The cross-correlation uses a parallelized FFT-method to accelerate the processing of large images. The performance is tested using synthetic images designed to evaluate the precision of the produced velocity field for various settings as well as the ability to capture sharp features characteristic of experimental tectonics...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel camera calibration algorithm for square, circle, and ring planar calibration patterns. An iterative refinement approach is proposed that utilizes the parameters obtained from traditional calibration algorithms as initialization to perform undistortion and unprojection of calibration images to a canonical fronto-parallel plane. This canonical plane is {{then used to}} localize the calibration pattern control points and recompute the camera parameters in an iterative refinement until convergence. <b>Undistorting</b> and unprojecting the calibration pattern to the canonical plane increases the accuracy of control point localization and consequently of camera calibration. We have conducted an extensive set of experiments with real and synthetic images for the square, circle and ring pattern, and the pixel reprojection errors obtained by our method are about 50 % {{lower than those of}} the OpenCV Camera Calibration Toolbox. Increased accuracy of camera calibration directly leads to improvements in other applications; we demonstrate recovery of fine object structure for visual hull reconstruction, and recovery of precise epipolar geometry for stereo camera calibration. 1...|$|R
40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) is a {{promising}} {{candidate for the}} next generation of human computer interaction. However, a great number of obstacles have to be overcome in order to make AR become widelyacceptable. Among those obstacles, tracking is one of the major well-known challenges. The state-of-the-art in AR proved that PTAMM is one of the most promising tracking systems. However, it is quite difficult to develop AR applications based on PTAMM system because of its monolithic architecture. Therefore, modularizing it for seamless integration is needed. On the other hand, PTAMM distorts graphic results instead of <b>undistorting</b> the video images, the result of which is a distorted augmented view. In this paper, we present PTAMM-Plus, which refactored and extended PTAMM by developing a well-formed API, re-arranging threads, and improving the undistortion mechanism. Using PTAMM-Plus, AR developers may easily build AR applications independently on top of PTAMM. By rearranging threads and undistortion mechanism, presented PTAMM-Plus also enhanced performance and accuracy. In this paper, a testing oriented approach in software development was applied when implementing the PTAMM-Plus. ...|$|R
40|$|Across a {{majority}} of pedestrian detection datasets, it is typically assumed that pedestrians will be standing upright {{with respect to the}} image coordinate system. This assumption, however, is not always valid for many vision-equipped mobile platforms such as mobile phones, UAVs or construction vehicles on rugged terrain. In these situations, the motion of the camera can cause images of pedestrians to be captured at extreme angles. This can lead to very poor pedestrian detection performance when using standard pedestrian detectors. To address this issue, we propose a Rotational Rectification Network (R 2 N) that can be inserted into any CNN-based pedestrian (or object) detector to adapt it to significant changes in camera rotation. The rotational rectification network uses a 2 D rotation estimation module that passes rotational information to a spatial transformer network to <b>undistort</b> image features. To enable robust rotation estimation, we propose a Global Polar Pooling (GP-Pooling) operator to capture rotational shifts in convolutional features. Through our experiments, we show how our rotational rectification network can be used to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art pedestrian detector under heavy image rotation by up to 45...|$|R

40|$|Bio-inspired imaging {{polarization}} navigation {{which can}} provide navigation information and {{is capable of}} sensing polarization information has advantages of high-precision and anti-interference over polarization navigation sensors that use photodiodes. Although all types of imaging polarimeters exist, they may not qualify for the research on the imaging polarization navigation algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a Lens Distortion and Rectification Unit (LDRU). The unit is well suited for lens undistortion and for stereo head rectification in embedded real-time systems. The proposed architecture has been realized on a prototyping system based on an Altera STRATIX EP 1 S 60 FPGA resulting in a performance of 35 frames per second for a 1024 × 1024 pixels input image. 2. INDRODUCTION Modern applications such as robot assembling automation, upcoming mobile robot platforms for homes, and car safety features require both, 3 D perception and object classification, for navigation and object manipulation [9]. Real-time performance of approximately 30 frames per second is mandatory and a very critical design issue. Em-bedded stereo vision sensors, consisting of a sensor head and a calculation unit, are very well suited for stereoscopic perception but require huge computational effort. Due to mounting tolerances within the sensor head, resulting in a maximum relative shift and revolution of these two camera images, rectification is absolutely necessary to reduce the matching effort. In our employed method it is done by applying a remap with offline calculated coefficients. The camera lenses also {{have an impact on the}} source image, resulting in a distortion in border areas which is reversed by a second remap. By <b>undistorting</b> and rectifying the original camera images, the computational effor...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} both the local and international media during the May 2000 coup, {{to determine whether the}} coverage was fair and to suggest solutions for the future. It will first discuss and compare literature that has been written on the Fiji coups, focusing on literature on the media and the coups in particular. According to Fowler (1991) the role of a journalist is to collect facts, report them objectively and present them fairly and without bias in language which is designed to be unambiguous, <b>undistorting</b> and agreeable to readers. However, in most times this is not the case. A thematic content analysis will be done on news articles that appeared in The Fiji Times, The New Zealand Herald and The Australian to find common themes during the coverage of the crisis. A lot of criticism of the both the local and international media’s role during the May 2000 coup emerged after the crisis. Critics included editors and journalists of the local and international media and political and historical analysts who knew the ‘real reasons’ behind the coup and did not see this being reported. A summary of interviews with journalists and editors who covered the coup, both local and overseas, will give an insight into their thoughts and reactions during the coup. It will also determine whether the journalists suffered from the Stockholm syndrome. The Stockholm syndrome describes the behaviour of kidnap victims or people who associate a lot with the captors, and who over time become sympathetic to their captors. The name is derived from a 1973 hostage siege in Stockholm, Sweden when at the end of six days of captivity at a bank; several kidnap victims actually resisted rescue attempts, and afterwards refused to testify against their captors. During the Fiji coup, apart from Speights supporters, journalists were the only ones who {{spent a lot of time}} with the coup leader either at press conferences or staying at Parliament to get good stories. As a result, some journalists began to ‘sway’ towards Speight or began to experience the Stockholm syndrome which was reflected in their stories. The thesis concludes that a few journalists in Fiji did suffer from the Stockholm syndrome. It also concludes that a crisis manual is needed for media organisations in Fiji to avoid the same mistakes being repeated as in the last three coups. The overseas media on the other hand need to attach themselves to the local media to avoid parachute journalism and inaccurate reporting. Overseas media organisations need to assign special reporters to Pacific Island affairs to understand the culture and other complex issues which would help in reporting their issues fairly and accurately...|$|R

In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and <b>undistorted</b> sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E
