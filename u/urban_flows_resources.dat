40|$|Assessing {{contemporary}} society ́s {{burden on the}} planet has been an ongoing project of many research teams in many disciplines. The recent emergence and proliferation of efforts to understand the role that cities play {{has led to the}} near-simultaneous development of various frameworks, methodologies and working models that capture <b>urban</b> <b>resource</b> <b>flows</b> and account for expenditures by industry, households and infrastructure networks; including power, water, and transportation. This paper introduces an <b>urban</b> <b>resource</b> <b>flow</b> model and describes the organization of its various elements with respect to two key fields; urban economics and ecology. The central organizing principle of this framework is the delineation of three fundamental urban activities occurring within a context of socioeconomic and biogeochemical material and energy transfers. These three urban activities are the direct link to key theoretical elements of both urban economics and ecology and thus facilitate a cooperative relationship between the evolving understanding of <b>urban</b> <b>resource</b> <b>flows</b> and economic and ecological urban thinking...|$|R

In particular we consider models of (i) resource availability, (ii) energy demand and (iii) more general <b>resource</b> <b>flows.</b> We also critique this and from this discuss work that is underway to improve the scope of more complete <b>resource</b> <b>flow</b> models as well as probability with which users will be able to identify optimal configurations of available parameters describing their urban models. Finally we conclude by discussing ways in which building models could be coupled with models of land use and transport interaction for more complete prediction of urban sustainability and how this might evolve with time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{presented here}} examined at which {{spatial and temporal}} resolution urban metabolism should be analysed to generate results that are useful for implementation of urban planning and design interventions aiming at optimization of <b>resource</b> <b>flows.</b> Moreover, it was researched whether a lack of data currently hampers analysing <b>resource</b> <b>flows</b> at this desired level of detail. To facilitate a stakeholder based research approach, the SIRUP tool – “Space-time Information analysis for Resource-conscious Urban Planning” – was developed. The tool was applied in {{a case study of}} Amsterdam, focused on the investigation of energy and water flows. Results show that most urban planning and design interventions envisioned in Amsterdam require information on a higher spatiotemporal resolution than the resolution of current urban metabolism analyses, i. e., more detailed than the city level and at time steps smaller than a year. Energy-related interventions generally require information on a higher resolution than water-related interventions. Moreover, for the majority of interventions information is needed on a higher resolution than currently available. For energy, the temporal resolution of existing data proved inadequate, for water, data with both a higher spatial and temporal resolution is required. Modelling and monitoring techniques are advancing for both water and energy and these advancements are likely to contribute to closing these data gaps in the future. These advancements can also prove useful in developing new sorts of urban metabolism analyses that can provide a systemic understanding of <b>urban</b> <b>resource</b> <b>flows</b> and that are tailored to urban planning and design...|$|R

40|$|This {{project has}} been done in {{conjunction}} with the Auckland Council’s proposal on Auckland’s Future Plans of increasing its population and to make Auckland “the world’s most liveable city”. The goal of a liveable city is to express our shared desire to create a city where people can enjoy a high quality of life {{and at the same time}} to improve standards of living. Currently Auckland employ a linear <b>urban</b> metabolism <b>flow</b> of <b>resources,</b> energy and wastes. From the research carried out during this research, this <b>flow</b> of <b>resources,</b> energy and waste isn’t a type of system that would be able to sustain itself over the time. This made me wonder about how a typical Auckland suburb could be redesigned and intensified using the circular urban metabolism principles to enhance liveability, sustainability, resilience and affordability. This project focuses on using Ken Yeang’s theory on Eco-Cells and redesigning it so that the principles suits Auckland’s culture and also the climate. These principles would be employed in Mount Roskill to test where the eco-cell principles help to intensify the community and help Auckland to become “the world’s most liveable city. ” This test would be carried out in two scales; the rst being the master-plan which shows how the principles of eco-cells works in the community level and the other scale to design a building which would show how the principle works in a building level. For the eco-cell, the following goals would be achieved. They are to: - Create an integrated and vibrant community; - Create a walkable neighbourhood with diversity of jobs, recreational activities and also residential types; - Lead the neighbourhood towards carbon neutrality; and - Improve quality of life and create desirable lifestyle...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we analyze <b>urban</b> traffic <b>flow</b> using taxi {{trajectory}} data {{to understand}} the characteristics of traffic flow from the network centrality perspective at point (intersection), line (road), and area (community) granularities.

Third, correlation analysis between the centrality indices and corresponding <b>urban</b> traffic <b>flow</b> is performed.

40|$|Cities {{are under}} {{constant}} and increasing pressure because of global changes, fast urbanization and growing resources demand. Those threats force urban systems to find development opportunities and solutions {{to minimize the}} demand and to shift from linear to circular economy, in which recycling and reusing are key activities [1]. Urban Metabolism (UM) analysis has become an important tool {{for the study of}} urban ecosystems. The problems of large metabolic throughput, low metabolic efficiency and disordered metabolic processes are a major cause of unhealthy urban systems. Nowadays, the most critical <b>urban</b> <b>resource</b> <b>flow</b> is water, followed by energy and materials: water is vital for our survival and the largest component in terms of sheer mass [2]. Furthermore, climate change increases geohydrological risks (landslides, floods and sinkholes), especially in Italy, causing damages and threats to the population, requiring a better management of the water cycle. However, due to the complexity of contemporary urban phenomena, it is difficult to understand what happens within those urban systems and to answer to these current pressures. Applying the UM at the city level presents some limitations {{due to the lack of}} data and the generalizations required at this scale. The traditional approach considers the city as a â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cblack boxâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d, quantifying in-flows and out-flows. Indeed, resources availability depends strongly on local context characteristics that enable the reduction of input water flows, maximizing the reuse of wastewaters and closing water loops. Along with the new challenges of sustainable design, it is possible to define different scenarios and roadmaps for compact cities, developing decision support systems that follows the principles of urban metabolism at the local scale. This research presents a project to evaluate the local water potential in a portion of the compact city of Rome in order to improve the local metabolism through a more efficient use of the resource. The innovative methodology will enable sustainable actions through the identification and assessment of a set of green projects to suggest pathways that enhance the modification of water metabolic flows...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the analytical approach for estimating the wind energy potential at locations around buildings in urban areas that are suitable for installing Small Wind Turbines (SWT). This development is performed in three steps. In order to analyze the flow pattern in a typical urban geometry, the first step consisted of a series of numerical simulations, where an assumed urban configuration (specified building size and respective distances between the buildings) was varied with an incremental value, and for each analyzed configuration different incoming wind conditions (different reference wind velocity) were incrementally imposed. In the second step the velocity profiles in the characteristic cutlines around the central building under investigation were extracted from the respective realizations of <b>urban</b> <b>flow</b> numerical solutions, and an analytical expression was derived approximating all extracted velocity profiles to fit the best an assumed flow pattern. The derived analytical expression was cross-plotted with the results of a fully three-dimensional realistic <b>urban</b> <b>flow</b> numerical solution, and the obtained matching level was satisfactory. Finally, using the derived expression, in the third step the estimation of SWT energy output was defined based on the average wind velocity information at given location and the related urban configuration characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of materials and energy is an important concern when cities and regions produce goods and services. To examine this requires an evaluation tool which {{can deal with the}} complex system of resources, energy inputs, products and wastes involved. This paper evaluates the urban material and energy flow efficiencies of 31 cities in China using a combination of the Data Envelopment Analysis model and Principal Component Analysis method. The results show that the <b>urban</b> <b>flow</b> system is composed of several input and output principal components, including energy, materials, urban capital investment, overall output, wastes, and others. In 2010, 16 cities were efficient as judged by the material and energy inputs and outputs. The remaining 15 cities were not efficient, primarily due to product shortfalls and waste excesses. Since 2000, half of the analyzed cities experienced a decline in the <b>urban</b> <b>flow</b> efficiencies, while only six cities showed a positive trend. The reasons include excess inputs of coal, coke, electricity, cement, investment, as well as output shortfalls in terms of overall output, wastes, services, agriculture and transport. We conclude that key priorities for improving urban systems with material and energy flow inefficiency are the use of urban renewable supplies, focus on sustainable endogenous development model, and improvement management of waste output, in order to increase efficiency and sustain economic growth.

40|$|International audienceUnderground {{structures}} {{have been}} shown to have a great influence on subsoil resources in urban aquifers. A methodology to assess the actual and the potential state of the groundwater <b>flow</b> in an <b>urban</b> area is proposed. The study develops a three-dimensional modeling approach to understand the cumulative impacts of underground infrastructures on <b>urban</b> groundwater <b>flow,</b> using a case in the city of Lyon (France). All known underground structures were integrated in the numerical model. Several simulations were run: the actual state of groundwater flow, the potential state of ground- water flow (without underground structures), an intermediate state (without impervious structures), and a transient simulation of the actual state of groundwater flow. The results show that underground structures fragment groundwater flow systems leading to a modification of the aquifer regime. For the case studied, the flow systems are shown to be stable over time with a transient simulation. Structures with drainage sys- tems are shown to {{have a major impact on}} flow systems. The barrier effect of impervious structures was negligible because of the small hydraulic gradient of the area.

40|$|A morphometric {{analysis}} of a southern European city and the derivation of relevant fluid dynamical parameters for use in <b>urban</b> <b>flow</b> and dispersion models are explained in this paper. Calculated parameters are compared with building statistics {{that have already been}} computed for parts of three northern European and two North American cities. The aim of this comparison is to identify similarities and differences between several building configurations and city types, such as building packing density, compact versus sprawling neighborhoods, regular versus irregular street orientation, etc. A novel aspect of this work is the derivation and use of digital elevation models (DEMs) for parts of a southern European city. Another novel aspect is the DEMs’ construction methodology, which is low cost, low tech, and of simple implementation. Several building morphological parameters are calculated from the urban DEMs using image processing techniques. The correctness and robustness of these techniques have been verified through a series of sensitivity tests performed on both idealized building configurations, as well as on real case DEMs, which were derived using the methodology here. In addition, the planar and frontal area indices were calculated as a function of elevation. It is argued that those indices, estimated for neighborhoods of real cities, may be used instead of the detailed building geometry within urban canopy models as those indices together synthesize the geometric features of a city. The direct application of these results will facilitate the development of fast <b>urban</b> <b>flow</b> and dispersion models...|$|R
