In {{this work}} he {{called attention to}} the unhealthy conditions of the prisons in Paris. He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and <b>unequal</b> <b>treatment</b> of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Studies {{have shown}} that <b>unequal</b> parental <b>treatment</b> is {{associated}} with relationship quality between siblings. However, {{it is unclear how}} it affects the relationship between full and half-siblings. Using data from the Generational Transmissions in Finland project (n = 1, 537 younger adults), we study whether those who have half-siblings perceive more <b>unequal</b> parental <b>treatment</b> than those who have full siblings only. In addition, we study how <b>unequal</b> parental <b>treatment</b> is associated with sibling relationship between full, maternal, and paternal half-siblings. First, we found that individuals who have maternal and/or paternal half-siblings {{are more likely to have}} encountered <b>unequal</b> maternal <b>treatment</b> than individuals who have full siblings only. Second, we found that <b>unequal</b> parental <b>treatment</b> impairs full as well as maternal and paternal half-sibling relations in adulthood. Third, <b>unequal</b> parental <b>treatment</b> mediates the effect of genetic relatedness on sibling relations in the case of maternal half-siblings, but not in the case of paternal half-siblings. After controlling for <b>unequal</b> parental <b>treatment,</b> the quality of maternal half-sibling relationships did not differ from that of full siblings, whereas the quality of paternal half-sibling relationships still did. Fourth, the qualitative comments (n = 206) from the same population reveal that <b>unequal</b> parental <b>treatment</b> presents itself several ways, such as differential financial, emotional, or practical support...|$|R

40|$|Presumption of Equality {{requires}} that individuals be treated equally {{in the absence}} of relevant information that would discriminate between them. Our objective is to make this principle more precise, if viewed as a principle of fairness, and to determine why and under what conditions it should be obeyed. Presumption norms are procedural constraints, but their justification can be sought in the possible or expected outcomes of the procedures they regulate. This is the avenue pursued here. The suggestion is that {{in the absence of}} information that would discriminate between the individuals, equal treatment minimizes the expected unfairness of the outcome. A related suggestion is that equal treatment under these circumstances also minimizes the maximal possible unfairness of the outcome. Whether these suggestions are correct or not depends on the properties of the underlying unfairness measure. The required properties are specified. The essay also considers the normative status of equal lotteries on <b>unequal</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R
25|$|After 1890, a {{coalition}} of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000.

2500|$|According to statute, Qing {{society was}} divided into {{relatively}} closed estates, of which in most general terms there were five. Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively minuscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding literati, there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status. They {{were divided into two}} categories: one of them, the good [...] "commoner" [...] people, the other [...] "mean" [...] people. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as liangmin, a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to jianmin meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional four occupational groups of scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants were [...] "good", or having a status of commoners. On the other hand, slaves or bondservants, entertainers (including prostitutes and actors), and those low-level employees of government officials were the [...] "mean people". Mean people were considered legally inferior to commoners and suffered <b>unequal</b> <b>treatments,</b> forbidden to take the imperial examination.|$|R

25|$|Drug use {{discrimination}} is the <b>unequal</b> <b>treatment</b> people experience {{because of the}} drugs they use. People who use or have used illicit drugs may face discrimination in employment, welfare, housing, child custody, and travel, in addition to imprisonment, asset forfeiture, {{and in some cases}} forced labor, torture, and execution. Though often prejudicially stereotyped as deviants and misfits, most drug users are well-adjusted and productive members of society. Drug prohibitions may have been partly motivated by racism and other prejudice against minorities, and racial disparities have been found to exist in the enforcement and prosecution of drug laws. Discrimination due to illicit drug use was the most commonly reported type of discrimination among Blacks and Latinos in a 2003 study of minority drug users in New York City, double to triple that due to race. People who use legal drugs such as tobacco and prescription medications may also face discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the income}} limit for {{allowances}} varied {{according to the}} position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women’s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life. In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of <b>unequal</b> <b>treatment</b> regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

During the experiment, the participant was not only informed of the offer given by her/his proposer, but also informed of the division scheme of another proposer-responder pair. It turned out that participants {{were more likely to}} accept unequal offers and reported higher fairness ratings when other responders received unequal offers compared to equal offers. Stronger bilateral anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus (dACC) activities were observed when only participants (but not other responders) received equal offers, whereas greater right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity was found when both of them received unequal offers, especially when participants accepted the unequal offers. Taken together, the results demonstrated that whether others in like circumstances were offered equally or not also {{plays an important role in}} responders’ fairness-related social decision making...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{data mining}} has been {{deemed to be}} an {{effective}} means for disclosing evidences and hidden causes of discrimination. If data mining succeeds in finding associations proving the fact that discriminatory treatments has strong relations with sensitive attributes, discrimination is obviously irrefutable. In this thesis, I propose a modified approach of the traditional data mining process to unveil and represent discrimination in a “rich semantic” form for semi-structured business data with multiple-valued treatments based on support from ontology. First, input data are preprocessed to be well-structured with semantic relations, which considerably support discrimination exploration later. The framework then seeks possibly discriminatory relations between the <b>unequal</b> <b>treatments</b> and protected-by-law attributes, e. g., race, religion, sex. These discriminatory relations will be represented in the form of association rules through the notion of matching pairs of itemsets with different sensitive attributes and equal non-sensitive ones that are subject to different treatments. By combining data mining and reasoning service over the ontology, the achieved rules are semantically enriched by object properties between classes (concepts). Thus, they are more valuable and interesting than the flat association rules. In order to address the drawback of local knowledge, the solution of “kNN as Situation Testing” is provided. Besides, a number of measures of discrimination are provided for the purpose of quantifying the level of discrimination to obtain a precise vision of how different sensitive attributes negatively affect the decision and even on each other.
