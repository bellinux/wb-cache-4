5000|$|Other {{common names}} include <b>garden</b> <b>rocket,</b> or more simply rocket (British, Australian, South African, Irish and New Zealand English), and eruca.

Arugula (...) , the common name now widespread in the United States and Canada, entered American English from non-standard (dialect) Italian. (The standard Italian word is rucola, a diminutive of the Latin [...] "eruca"). The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first appearance of [...] "arugula" [...] in American English to a 1960 New York Times article by food editor and prolific cookbook writer Craig Claiborne.|$|R

Most of the tested cultivars were found to susceptible to moderately susceptible and good hosts, except for white radish which was resistant and poor host to the tested nematode. Susceptible cultivars were clearly damaged by the nematode infection and roots appeared to be heavily galled. Gall index values of all tested cultivars were ranged from 2. 0 - 5. 0, whereas, reproduction factor (Rf) values and number of eggs per gram root were significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) varied among tested cultivars. They were ranged from 0. 156 - 65. 5 and 114. 0 - 27638. 2, respectively, where the minimum values are recorded for white radish and maximum ones for squash cv. Masha’el F 1...|$|R
