Yet, such claims were based on estimates of casualties caused by command-detonated mines, punji sticks and other booby traps, and proved to be wildly inaccurate.

Regardless, it also highlighted the inherent weakness of the search-and-clear operations that would later become standard operating procedure for the US Army in Vietnam. The Ho Bo Woods were again targeted by the Americans in January 1967, during a much larger operation known as Operation Cedar Falls.

50|$|In any {{integrated}} {{energy delivery}} <b>utility</b> <b>operation</b> model, {{there are different}} functional modules like GIS, Billing & metering solution, ERP, Asset management system that are operating in parallel and supports routine operations. Quite often, each of these functional modules need to exchange periodic or real time data {{with each other for}} assessing present operation condition of the network, workflows and resources (like crew, assets, etc.). Unlike other power system segments, distribution system changes or grows every day, and this could be due to the addition of a new consumer, a new transmission line or replacement of equipment. If the different functional modules are operating in a non-standard environment and uses custom APIs and database interfaces, the engineering effort for managing shall become too large. Soon it will become difficult to manage the growing changes and additions which would result in making system integrations non- functional. Hence utilities cannot make use of the complete benefit of functional modules and in some cases; the systems may even need to be migrated to suitable environments with very high costs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Utility</b> <b>operation</b> with {{frequent}} fuel switching {{is a common}} practice, forced by cheaper coal availability in the international market. Additionally, a substitution of coal by cheaper local secondary fuels, ranging from forest wood to sewage sludge and industrial or domestic residues, is gaining importance. Switching between different fuels, even if these do not differ much from the design coal, enhances operational problems arising from ash deposition. In order to prevent operational problems, through comprehension of the phenomena taking place within the furnace, appropriate sampling and characterization of the deposits are necessary. Methods commonly used for analysis of ash deposits and their characterization are summarized in this paper.

The preference for the siting and sizing of DG installations by DNOs is simulated using a multi-year multi-period optimal power flow.
