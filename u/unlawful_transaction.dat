For they regard wealth obtained from <b>unlawful</b> <b>transactions</b> to be as much a subject of reproach as a fair profit from reputable sources is of commendation.

5000|$|The {{cultivation}} of cannabis, {{even on a}} very small-scale home grown basis for personal use only, can legally be prosecuted. However, {{an unknown number of}} enthusiasts of small-scale home-cultivation grow the plants {{with a high degree of}} secrecy due to the legal punishment they could face if prosecuted, and due to potential social stigma as well. In neighboring Spain, small-scale {{cultivation of}} cannabis plants for personal use only, is tolerated by the authorities and there are many grow shops across the country selling their products physically and online. In 2003 another update to the [...] "Portuguese drugs law" [...] brought the criminalization of the possession of cannabis seeds, except certified industrial hemp seed. This law made the buying of cannabis seeds from legal and financially transparent online cannabis seed shops based in other European Union member states, such as neighboring Spain or the Netherlands, an <b>unlawful</b> <b>transaction</b> when performed by Portuguese residents. The provision of seeds and tools to produce and consume cannabis is also illegal in the country. Production and distribution of hemp products is legal but regulated. There are a small number of hemp shops in Portugal and hemp products are legal.|$|E

40|$|If the 1707 Act of Union {{removed the}} {{immaterial}} {{legal and political}} border between England and Scotland by merging them into the single kingdom of Great Britain, it could not erase the almost impassable natural boundary dividing the twin sisters. This tangible geographical barrier remained as a magnificent reminder of a former separation, thus questioning {{the disappearance of the}} national frontier. The confrontation between abstract and concrete boundaries, which is at stake in historical Scotland, is staged in Walter Scott’s The Heart of Midlothian set a few decades after the Union. The heroine’s physical journey across the Anglo-Scottish border gradually takes on a more symbolic significance as she trudges through the marches to redeem her sinful sister. In studying the novel, I will analyse the series of embedded tangible boundaries present on the British territories and show how they are constantly crossed by the protagonists. This physical crossing of concrete borders often goes with the mental crossing of abstract barriers. Overstepping a physical boundary can lead to transgressing moral and societal limits as it is exemplified with the Scottish Borders, a den of iniquity and <b>unlawful</b> <b>transactions.</b> External borders can thus embody more internal boundaries and serve to map territories of the mind...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a long-running}} debate among legal {{scholars}} regarding the propriety and enforceability of SEC attempts to mandate disclosures of antisocial or illegal corporate activities {{that do not}} materially impact a company 2 ̆ 7 s financial statements. This debate was recently revived by the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 99, Materiality in Financial Statements (SEC 1999), which suggests that quantitatively immaterial information relating to <b>unlawful</b> <b>transactions</b> or regulatory non-compliance should be considered for disclosure. This issue {{has important implications for}} the accounting profession, although it has generally been ignored in the accounting literature. This paper reviews legal and ethical considerations raised by the issue of qualitative disclosures, and also presents the results of a preliminary empirical test of the impact of such disclosures on financial statement users 2 ̆ 7 judgments. The results {{of this study indicate that}} investors consider the nondisclosure of immaterial illegal acts to be unethical, and reject suggestions that such information lacks moral intensity. The results also suggest that immaterial illegal acts have a significant effect on investors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the quality of corporate management and the likelihood of investment in a company. This effect was more pronounced when the illegal act was combined with self-dealing on the part of corporate executives...|$|R

However, {{a greater number}} of scandals involving medical practitioners and others in the kidney trade has surfaced periodically in every state in India. The present regulatory system has failed mainly due to the misuse of Section 9 (3) of the THOA, which approves the consent given by a live unrelated donor for the removal of organs for the reason of affection or attachment towards the recipient or for any other special reason. Currently in India, approximately 3500 – 4000 kidney transplants and 150 – 200 liver transplants are performed annually. However, the availability of organs from brain-dead persons is very low. As a result, live related or unrelated donors form the main source of organ transplantation.
