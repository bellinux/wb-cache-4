5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Beiyang Fleet. Jingyuen was part of a flotilla which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Jingyuan first saw action during the First Sino-Japanese War. At the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894, {{she was one of the}} surviving Chinese cruisers, although suffered fire damage. She was sunk the following February during the Battle of Weihaiwei from a shot fired from a captured Chinese fort. She sank <b>upright</b> <b>in</b> shallow water, and Admiral Ding Ruchang gave orders for her to be destroyed by a naval mine. She was raised the follow year for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The lower teeth are more slender and <b>upright</b> <b>in</b> shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand <b>upright</b> <b>in</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the fleet}} was repaired, they sailed out on 20 October to Weihaiwei. While in the harbour, they found {{themselves}} under attack by the Imperial Japanese Army in January 1895 as the Battle of Weihaiwei commenced. As Japanese forces {{took control of the}} sea forts {{on either side of the}} harbour, the fleet found itself under bombardment during the day and torpedo boat attack during the night. One such attack during the night of 5 February saw Laiyuan sunk by a torpedo and capsized. Jingyuen was undamaged, but underwent a near-miss by a torpedo. On 9 February, while Jingyuen was operating in the eastern part of the harbour, was struck below the waterline and sank <b>upright</b> <b>in</b> shallow water. The shot was fired from one of the captured Chinese forts. To avoid eventual capture by the Japanese, Ruchang ordered for a naval mine to be placed below decks on Jingyuen and detonated later that day, destroying her. She was raised and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|A National Army relief column {{including}} the detachments under Husher, Fleetwood and Devine assembled at Lurkers' Ridge {{during the morning}} of 12 February. Under the command of Captain Tony Clark, it flanked through the townships south of the Alamo, engaging ZIPRA guerrillas along the way, then turned north to relieve Dyck. The Elands led the way, with Devine himself standing <b>upright</b> <b>in</b> the turret {{of one of them}} with a machine gun. At one point this was shot out of his hands, prompting him to briefly stop the advance so he could jump down into the street to collect it. By the time the relief column reached the Alamo at 13:00, C Company had been pocketed for 16 hours. Four wounded 1RAR soldiers were evacuated, and Dyck left the building to point out targets for Devine's armoured cars. During the afternoon, A Company relieved D Company at Lurker's Ridge, and the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas withdrew into the townships and the surrounding country, sporadically exchanging fire. Devine was sent to Essexvale to engage the rest of ZIPRA's armoured battle group, which surrendered when he arrived; the T-34 tanks were later found by the Zimbabwe National Army to be nonfunctional. By the evening of 12 February, the rebellion was over.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing machine oil found <b>upright</b> <b>in</b> its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made on axial {{reflexion}} of the kidneys and kinking of the ureter, {{to be caused by}} a change in posture, by taking pyelography of 105 individuals. The following observations were made: 1. It was shown that downward displacement of the kidneys, if it was within 5 cm., was normal in both men and women. There was a greater downward displacement in men than in women, and in the left kidneys than in the right one. 2. The normal position occupied by the lower pole of a kidney in terms of spinal vertebral height corresponded to lumbar III-IV in supine position and lumbar IV <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> position. <b>In</b> both <b>upright</b> and supine positions, the positions occupied by the kidneys were higher than that occupied by the right one. 3. Many individuals had a smaller pelvic-spinal angle <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> position than <b>in</b> supine position. Some, however, showed abnormal angles. 4. The pelvic long axis showed a markedly smaller value <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> position than <b>in</b> supine position; in some, the value of pelvic long axis <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> position was less than two-thirds as much as the value of pelvic long axis in supine position. 5. Downward displacement of the kidneys caused a deformity of the ureter to occur. Generally speaking, the deformity was seen in upper one-third of the ureter in many instances...|$|R
