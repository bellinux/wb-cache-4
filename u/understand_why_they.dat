5|$|A monstrous, mutated Fifield {{returns to}} the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus captain, Janek, speculates that the {{structure}} was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him {{in an attempt to}} explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> wanted to destroy humanity.|$|E

He then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to confirm this.

The festival was curated by the band Tortoise, with whom Herren toured as the opening act in May 2001. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was released on June 11, 2001 through Warp on vinyl, compact disc and download. It was Warp's second release by an American musician, following Richard Devine's Lipswitch which had been released in the previous January. The album did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. Herren was not happy on how the album was promoted, saying: [...] "I couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were treating me like I was 10. They were ignoring all the cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record." [...] He felt the album [...] "would have been easier to package if I'd been from the Bronx.

500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Sarsgaard earned {{critical}} {{recognition in}} Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry, {{where he was}} cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film {{is based on the}} real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. Boys Don’t Cry received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to The Boston Globe, [...] "Peter [...] Sarsgaard... makes the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling monster, he's a guy you wouldn't look [...] twice at a bar or a convenience store." [...] A contributor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote [...] "It's a marvelous performance supported ably by... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him [...] "likeable, sympathetic even" [...] was because he wanted the audience [...] "to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> would hang out with me.

2500|$|The {{original}} Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for {{a benefit}} concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again.

They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} glacial climate in the North Atlantic region is the recurrence of abrupt shifts between cold stadials and mild interstadials.

However, it is poorly <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were more clearly expressed during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3, * 60 – 27 ka BP) than during Termination 1 (T 1, * 18 – 10 ka BP) and especially around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, * 23 – 19 ka BP). One clue may reside in varying climate forcings, making MIS 3 and T 1 generally milder than LGM.

It happened that late that afternoon Peter visited the Old Pasture and saw her again. She and some of her friends were busily walking about close to the feet of the cows, where they seemed to be picking up food.

2500|$|Creighton Miller, a {{teammate}} of Yonakor's at Notre Dame, took an assistant coaching position {{after the war}} with the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). While Yonakor selected by the Philadelphia Eagles {{in the first round}} of the 1945 NFL Draft, Miller convinced him to sign with the Browns instead. The Browns won the AAFC championship in each of the four years Yonakor played for the team between 1946 and 1949. He started out as primarily a pass-rushing defensive end in 1946, but was also used as an offensive end when receiver Dante Lavelli was injured in 1947. After watching one of the Browns' early games, Leahy said that the Browns were good, but [...] "I don't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> don't throw more passes to Yonakor". He had just six receptions for 95 yards and two touchdowns in 1947, however, and was shifted back to working mostly on defense in 1948. Yonakor completed coursework at Notre Dame between seasons with the Browns and got his degree in 1948. Yonakor got into contractual disputes three times with Paul Brown, the Browns' head coach and general manager, and frequently held out for raises. His highest salary with the Browns was $9,500 in 1949.|$|E

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{menopause}} in women with intellectual disabilities (ID) save that its onset is earlier than in the general population, and earlier still in women with Down’s syndrome (DS). This study directly explored menopausal experiences in women with ID, both with and without DS, with the aim of identifying levels of knowledge of the menopause and of its health and reproductive implications. Methods Information was collected from 45 women with ID (17 DS, 28 non-DS; age 35 – 65 years) using a semi-structured interview. Results: Menopausal experiences of the women with and without DS were very similar. Most of the women were unaware of menopause-associated changes in their body and few <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> menstruated. Difficulties in disentangling behavioural consequences of menopausal symptoms from behaviours arising from other causes were evident. A need for better health education training and more accessible health resources was identified. Conclusions: Promoting better awareness of menopause-related health issues in women with ID seems warranted. Appropriately-tailored health education materials need to be made more readily available. </p...|$|R
