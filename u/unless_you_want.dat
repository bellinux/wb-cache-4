25|$|In The Horse and His Boy, Lewis {{uses the}} {{cultural}} settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen {{to develop a}} theme of freedom in contrast to slavery. Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must {{make way for the}} strong: For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which is that everyone who is less important has {{to get out of the}} way for everyone who is more important; <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a cut from a whip or a punch from the butt end of a spear.|$|E

The song then progresses into the chorus: [...] "I {{can be good}} / I can be sex / I can be anything / I can be everything / I can be mom." [...] A male vocalist accompanies the singer's lyrics, [...] "Unless {{you want to be}} man / <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to hold hands / <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be dad". After Gaga sings [...] "I'm gonna drink my tears and cry / 'cos I know you love me baby" [...] during the techno-inspired bridge, she alludes to the alleged affair between Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy with the lyrics [...] "Put your hands on me / John F. Kennedy / I'll make you squeal baby", singing in an impassive and monotonous manner.|$|E

In one characteristic excerpt she said that, [...] "There's a feeling of movement in telling a story {{and there is a}} flow. A cut that is off-rhythm will be disturbing and you will feel it, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it to be like that. On Jaws, each time I wanted to cut I didn't, so that it would have an anticipatory feeling — and it worked." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{movie and}} Close were praised by The New York Times: [...] "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that {{a touch of}} desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." [...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't ever want to put this disaster in your player, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to {{hear the sound of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{is a broad}} {{practical}} bent to {{both the}} Perl language and the community and culture that surround it. The preface to Programming Perl begins: [...] "Perl is a language for getting your job done." [...] One consequence {{of this is that}} Perl is not a tidy language. It includes many features, tolerates exceptions to its rules, and employs heuristics to resolve syntactical ambiguities. Because of the forgiving nature of the compiler, bugs can sometimes be hard to find. Perl's function documentation remarks on the variant behavior of built-in functions in list and scalar contexts by saying, [...] "In general, they do what you want, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> consistency." ...|$|E
500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though {{this effort to}} improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we do not see the dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (<b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after all, is a tale with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E

500|$|Senior {{executives}} at publishers Michael Joseph {{and at the}} Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, {{who worked for the}} Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered [...] "large sums of money" [...] to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as the Church reportedly believed that the CIA was driving investigations into its tax affairs in the U.S. According to Cynewulf, Miller's mail and phones were intercepted and his home was under constant surveillance. The newspaper reported that Cynewulf had chased its reporter and photographer through the streets of Bristol, armed with a pistol which he fired at them, saying, [...] "You'd better go now <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to end up in a wooden box. Do you want to be another Hungerford martyr?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Bundy supporter Mike Vanderboegh's comment, [...] "Don't poke the wolverine {{with a sharp}} stick, Harry , <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your balls ripped off", a writer for The Nation framed the remark {{as part of a}} larger, right-wing obsession with castration.

2500|$|Mike Vanderboegh, {{a militia}} leader who {{remained}} in Nevada after the standoff, accused Senator Harry Reid of provoking a “civil war” and said not to [...] "poke the wolverine with a sharp stick, Harry, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your balls ripped off."

Andreotti and Lima allegedly arrived at the meeting in a bullet-proof Alfa Romeo, belonging to the Salvo cousins. He had come to protest the killing. However, according to Marino Mannoia, Bontade told Andreotti: [...] "We are in charge in Sicily and, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the whole DC cancelled out, you do as we say."

2500|$|Hughes married Kate Murphy of San Antonio (d. 1980) in 1910. In 1981 Holocaust denier David Irving {{claimed that}} Hughes {{had a girlfriend}} whom he {{referred}} to as “JP” in his diary. Recent research has discovered that “JP” refers to Elizabeth Prismall, who was a British secretary on Hughes’ staff. The nature of their relationship was indeed close, but {{it is by no}} means certain that the two were having an affair. Hughes, of his own volition, informed Kate of Mrs. Prismall’s presence explaining in a letter dated March 8, 1943, [...] "I have taken Mrs. Prismall to the mess several times and during the past few days….So you’ll soon here [...] that Hughes has a girl friend [...] along with the rest.

2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Had Microsoft {{brought the}} first Zune to market {{at the same}} time as the iPod, or even the Zune HD at the time of the iPod Touch, it might have been a serious {{competitor}} to those players. [...] "By that point, iPod had become the world's de facto digital entertainment device," [...] he recalled. [...] "To beat it, Microsoft needed to offer something that would make Apple's device look pitifully old-fashioned. The Zune HD didn't do that. Its design marked it as being different from an iPod, but that was pretty much the only difference. There was no reason to buy the Zune <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to stand apart from the Apple cult. And there was a cost to standing apart from Apple: Because of its popularity, there were millions of apps and accessories for the iPod. As good as it was, the Zune HD couldn’t match Apple’s sheer market power." [...] Nevertheless, it was an effective enough product that Manjoo had started using it as his primary music player." ...|$|R
2500|$|The 12-metre {{class rules}} stipulated that the hull {{had to be}} the same {{thickness}} throughout and could not be made lighter in the bow and stern. The other challengers demanded that core samples be taken from the plastic hull to show its thickness. At one press conference Dennis Conner asked, [...] "Why would you build a plastic yacht ... <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to cheat?" [...] Despite attempts to defuse the situation, the [...] "cheating comment" [...] added to the controversy surrounding the Louis Vuitton challenge races. Chris Dickson, skipper of the Kiwi Magic (KZ 7), took the controversy in stride and with humor, and Conner has subsequently stated his regret over his comment. New Zealand syndicate head Sir Michael Fay's comment was that core samples would be taken [...] "over my dead body". Eventually some small holes were drilled to test the hull, and ultrasonic testing was done to rule out air pockets in the construction. The boat was found to be within class rules, and the issue was set aside. Fay ceremoniously lay {{down in front of the}} measurer before the samples were taken.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Louis Vuitton Cup protests were lodged by the French Kiss team, {{challenging}} whether KZ 7 was {{in compliance}} with the 12 Metre formula. A Lloyd's Register of Shipping had been present throughout the construction of the boats, and he had checked each part of the laminate and the amount and type of resin used against the building schedule which Lloyd's had approved. As the round robins progressed and the New Zealanders continued to be fast, the controversy surrounding the fiberglass hulled boat intensified, brought famously to the fore at a media conference where Tom Blackaller and Dennis Conner answered questions about their concerns {{of whether or not the}} fiberglass boat met the 12 Metre standard. At one point Conner stated [...] "There have been seventy-eight 12 Metres built, all in aluminum. Why would <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to build one in glass... <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to cheat." [...] New Zealand had twice been measured, and twice certified by Lloyds before the first race of the series. Some small holes were drilled into the hull to check thickness, and the hull ultra-sonically checked for pockets of air in the construction of Kiwi Magic. All proved negative. These were provided for inspection by race officials. The boat was found to have a hull thickness consistent with the 12 Metre formula and the matter was settled.|$|R

5000|$|Once in Hollywood, Maas {{negotiated}} {{a contract with}} Preferred Pictures to adapt Percy Marks's novel The Plastic Age for film. Based on this, she was signed to a three-year contract with MGM for $350 per week, though in her words: [...] "I had the peculiar feeling that wily Louis B. Mayer was less interested in my writing ability than in signing someone {{who had worked for}} Ben Schulberg and Al Lichtman." [...] It was in this period that she wrote Dance Madness and The Waning Sex. Her recollections of that period: I wrote a movie called The Waning Sex. It was a title I was given and we wrote the title around it. I got into a lot of fights with the co-writer on the film, F. Hugh Herbert. It was rough. I would work so hard on some of the scripts and the minute I'd turn it in, someone else would take credit for it. You'd be ticketed as a troublemaker. <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to quit the business, you just kept your mouth shut." [...] Thus Maas' introduction to studio politics did not go well and her MGM contract was not renewed. During 1925 - 1926 she wrote treatments and screenplays for Tiffany Productions, including the well-received flapper comedies That Model from Paris and The First Night.|$|R
