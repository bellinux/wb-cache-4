40|$|The SIMMER-code {{family has}} played an {{outstanding}} {{role in the}} framework and history of mechanistic safety code development for liquid metal cooled reactors with fast neutron spectrum. Its <b>unmatched</b> <b>position</b> {{is related to the}} extended simulation range from normal operation conditions, via transients and accidents, core melting and core destruction to in-vessel relocation phenomena and post accident heat removal conditions. SIMMER-III is a two-dimensional (2 D), SIMMER-IV a three-dimensional (3 D), multi-velocity-field, multi-phase, multi-component, Eulerian, fluid-dynamics code system coupled with a structure model for fuel-pins, hexcans and general structures, and a space-, time- and energy-dependent transport theory neutron dynamics model. An elaborate analytical equation-of-state (EOS) closes the fluid-dynamics conservation equations. The code has originally been developed for the severe accident simulation of sodium cooled fast reactors. However, the general philosophy behind the SIMMER development was to generate a very versatile and flexible tool, applicable for the safety analysis of various reactor types with different neutron spectra and coolants. The multi-physics and multi-scale code family SIMMER is developed in a joint effort of different laboratories, where currently the mai...|$|E
40|$|A dual-beam {{near-infrared}} (NIR) spectrometer {{was constructed}} and evaluated, The instrument {{was designed to}} work with the two monochromatic beams produced by each one of the two acoustooptic tunable filters (AOTFs) evaluated, capable of scanning the wavelength range 800 - 1600 or 1500 - 2400 nm. Two temperature-controlled, cooled InAs detectors were employed for comparison of the two monochromatic beams produced by the AOTF. Data were obtained in a controlled ambient temperature, (25 +/- 1) degreesC, and were compared for their intensity and wavelength coincidence for each of the 300 values of radio frequency (85 - 160 and 56 - 92 MHz) applied to the AOTF. The results show that the two beams present good concordance {{as a function of the}} wavelength (mean Delta lambda < 0. 30 inn for both AOTFs investigated, The normalized intensities of the two beams were quite different, and their ratio values (0. 9 to 1. 2) depend on the wavelength. inversion of intensities was observed in the present case and can be attributed to the <b>unmatched</b> <b>position</b> of the two detectors and to the difference in responsivity. On the other hand, the use of the two beams revealed that it can provide a robust way to correct for light-source intensity fluctuation as high as 10 %. The mean standard deviation for long-term operation and for a zero absorbance baseline was reduced three times when the dual-beam instrument was employed. The instrument has also been evaluated for determination of water in fuel ethanol, The results for water content demonstrate the good analytical performance of the spectrometer with a relative error of 0. 07 and 0. 03 % (w/w) for water determination in the ranges 0. 20 - 10. 0 and 0. 20 - 3. 00 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of various earth-abundant Ni species, such as NiS, Ni, Ni(OH) (2), and NiO, as a co-catalyst in a ZnxCd 1 -xS system for visible-light photocatalytic H- 2 production was investigated {{for the first}} time. The loading of Ni or NiS enhanced the photocatalytic activity of ZnxCd 1 -xS because they could promote the electron transfer at the interface with ZnxCd 1 -xS and catalyze the H- 2 evolution. Surprisingly, Ni(OH) (2) -loaded ZnxCd 1 -xS exhibits a very high photocatalytic H- 2 -production rate of 7160 mu mol h(- 1) g(- 1) with a quantum efficiency of 29. 5 % at 420 nm, which {{represents one of the}} most efficient metal sulfide photocatalysts without a Pt co-catalyst to date. This outstanding activity arises from the pronounced synergetic effect between Ni(OH) (2) and metallic Ni formed in situ during the photocatalytic reaction. However, the loading of NiO deactivated the activity of ZnxCd 1 -xS because of their <b>unmatched</b> conduction band <b>positions.</b> This paper reports the optimization of the ZnxCd 1 -xS system by selecting an appropriate Ni-based co-catalyst, Ni(OH) (2), from a series of Ni species to achieve the highest photocatalytic H- 2 -production activity {{for the first time and}} also reveals the roles of these Ni species in the photocatalytic activity...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe new {{millennium}} has seen {{an increase in}} vascular residency vacancies. The American Board of Vascular Surgery recently proposed new training paradigms, but their impact on recruitment remains unknown. We surveyed vascular fellows regarding factors and timing of career decisions to determine an optimal strategy for recruitment. MethodsSurveys were sent electronically to vascular residents for completion. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Additional data {{were obtained from the}} National Resident Matching Program. ResultsOf the 90 fellows that responded, 84 % committed to vascular surgery during residency. Of these, 18 % decided during postgraduate year 1, 54 % by year 2, 84 % by year three, and 95 % by year 4. Sixteen percent of all trainees decided in medical school. Seventy-three percent of residents performed a minimum of 20 to 50 cases before reaching a decision. Among the group deciding between years 2 to 4 of residency, {{there was a significant difference}} in the number of vascular rotations before career commitment (P =. 0001). In the 2004 Match, 21 % of vascular residency positions were unfilled, up from 12 % in 2003, 9 % in 2002, and 4 % in 2001. ConclusionsLeaders in the field of vascular surgery have proposed focused training through the new paradigms. The incline in <b>unmatched</b> vascular residency <b>positions</b> over the past 4 years highlights the importance of a strategic plan to optimize recruitment. Few current trainees decided early in training about career choice, and volume appears critical to the decision process. Utilizing the current matching system (an 18 -month process) and without any proactive change in recruitment, an integrated program after medical school would be reasonable for only 16 % of applicants, or the 3 + 3 option for 54 % of residents. For the new paradigms to be successful and to prevent more unfilled positions, increased medical student integration into vascular rotations and early active exposure to endovascular and open procedures during general surgical training will be necessary across the country...|$|R
