40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the demographic features and clinical outcome {{of children with}} Factor XIII deficiency. STUDY DESIGN: Observational case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 1996 to December 2006. METHODOLOGY: Records of all hospitalized pediatric patients with discharge diagnosis of FXIII D, {{on the basis of}} factor XIII assay 5 mol/L urea test were retrospectively reviewed and abstracted on a pre-specified proforma. Demographic features, coagulation profile, family history and outcomes were noted. RESULTS: A total of 10 charts were reviewed. There were 5 boys and 5 girls. Almost all the children (9 / 10) were less than 5 years of age, out of whom 5 (50 %) were infants, and 3 were neonates. Bruises and prolonged bleeding after trauma was the major presenting complaints in 80 %, followed by prolonged bleeding from the umbilical stump in 2 patients. Nine patients had past history of prolonged <b>umbilical</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Two patients had history of FXIII D in siblings, while 2 had history of prolonged bleeding in other family members (cause unknown). Consanguinity was present in 80 % of the families. Initial coagulation screen were normal in all patients. Two patients had intracranial hemorrhage, proved on neuro-imaging, were managed with plasma infusions and required craniotomy. The rest were managed conservatively with plasma transfusions. All were discharged alive in good clinical condition. Almost all were followed regularly in clinic with monthly cryoprecipitate transfusions. CONCLUSION: Although factor XIII deficiency is a rare genetic disorder in children with history of bruising, prolonged <b>umbilical</b> <b>bleeding,</b> family history of bleeding and consanguinity with normal initial coagulation screen (PT, APTT and platelets), FXIII D should be ruled out...|$|E

40|$|Background: Factor XIII (FXIII) {{deficiency}} is {{a bleeding}} disorder and it inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. {{in areas where}} consanguineous marriage is common, it has high prevalence. Iran as a Middle East country comprise {{the high rate of}} consanguinity in nearly half of patients with severe congenital FXIII deficiency (FXIIID). The most common mutation in Iranian population is Trp 187 Arg. In these patients occure life- threatening bleeding including central nervous system (CNS) <b>bleeding,</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>bleeding</b> and recurrent miscarriage that have high rate of morbidity and mortality. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate morbidity and mortality rate among these patients and the reasons for it. Materials and Methods:In this systematic review we  studied all published paper in the field of FXIIID factor deficiency in Iran until 2015 via searching in databases and search engine such as Sciencedirect, scientific information database (SID), PubMed and Google scholar. Results: Among 308 patients with FXIIID, 108 cases had experienced CNS bleeding (CNSB) that in 23 cases had associated with rebleeding. in 72 patients have occured different types of neurological complications after  central nervous system bleeding. A total of 63 recurrent miscarriages were observed in 30 women and 21 deaths were registered due to <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>bleeding</b> or mucosal bleedings.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Endometriosis is {{a common}} {{gynecological}} condition and presents mainly with involvement of the pelvic organs. Extrapelvic presentations in almost {{all parts of the}} body {{have been reported in the}} literature. However, umbilical endometriosis that is spontaneous or secondary to surgery is uncommon and accounts for only 0. 5 % to 1 % of all endometriosis cases. Case presentation A 35 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with <b>umbilical</b> <b>bleeding</b> during periods of menstruation. Her umbilicus had a small nodule with bloody discharge. An ultrasound was performed and a diagnosis of possible umbilical endometriosis was thus made. The nodule shrunk in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues but continued to persist. The patient underwent a wide local excision of the nodule with a corresponding umbilical reconstruction. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of umbilical endometriosis. The patient was asymptomatic at follow-up, but nevertheless warned of the risk of recurrence. Conclusions Pelvic endometriosis {{is a common}} condition, but the diagnosis of primary umbilical endometriosis is difficult and differentials should be considered. This case strongly suggests that a differential diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered when an umbilical swelling presents in a woman of reproductive age. </p...|$|E

40|$|Every {{child with}} severe or {{moderate}} haemophilia A or B, born in Sweden {{during the period}} 1970 - 1990, was traced in the national haemophilia register, all 117 case records being surveyed for mode of delivery and perinatal complications. Of the 117 deliveries. 13 were by caesarean section and the remaining 104 vaginal. Of the 13 caesarean sections, 2 were performed because the woman was a haemophilia carrier the remaining 11 (5 emergency, 6 elective) for other reasons. Neonatal complications were: subgaleal or cephalic haematoma (n = 12), intracranial haemorrhage (n = 4), <b>umbilical</b> <b>bleeding</b> (n = 4), haematuria (n = 1), retro-orbital bleeding (n = 1) and abnormal bleeding after surgery. injection or venepuncture (n = 28).

40|$|Congenital {{fibrinogen}} {{disorders are}} rare diseases affecting either the quantity (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia) or the quality (dysfibrinogenemia) or both (hypodysfibrinogenemia) of plasmatic fibrinogen. Afibrinogenemia is often diagnosed at birth following prolonged <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>bleeding</b> and {{is characterized by}} spontaneous bleeding in all tissues, while hypofibrinogenemic patients are more often asymptomatic. Spontaneous spleen ruptures, painful bone cysts, cardiovascular events, and intrahepatic inclusions can complicate the clinical course of patients with quantitative fibrinogen disorders. Clinical manifestations of dysfibrinogenemia are very heterogeneous, from absence of symptoms to major bleeding or thrombosis, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and renal amyloidosis. Hypodysfibrinogenemic patients can suffer from both major bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. Pregnancy of women with congenital fibrinogen disorders is a high-risk situation. Owing {{to the absence of}} controlled randomized studies, clinical management is mainly based on expert consensus. For the treatment and/or the prevention of bleeding, plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrates are the optimal choice. Treatment of thrombosis may be challenging. More specifically, management strategies should be tailored to each patient, taking the personal and familial history of bleeding and thrombosis, the genotype, and the specific clinical situation into account...|$|R

As these mutations were known in the family, DNA obtained from cord blood of the youngest sister was analysed for mutations in exons 6 and 7 only. We postulate that the diagnosis was facilitated by determining the two different mutations in the genotype of this family. The analysis showed that she was heterozygous for the exon 7 mutation. Hence, she was not at risk of experiencing haemorrhagic diathesis. This diagnosis avoided the administration of FXIII concentrate to the newbor...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{report a}} {{recently}} observed case of primary umbilical endometriosis (UE), {{with the main}} aim to discuss the management of this rare condition. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 24 -year-old woman complained of a painful nodule on her <b>umbilical</b> region, <b>bleeding</b> with her menstrual cycle. Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic superficial mass in the umbilicus and no signs of intra-abdominal endometriosis. Excision of the nodule under local anesthesia was performed. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of umbilical endometriosis. Neither symptoms nor signs of local recurrence have been observed after 24 months. DISCUSSION: UE {{should be taken into}} account in differential diagnosis of umbilical disorders even in young nulliparous women with no typical symptoms of pelvic endometriosis. Although there is a substantial agreement about the necessity of surgery, treatment options are either local excision of the lesion or removal of the whole umbilicus with or without laparoscopic exploration of the peritoneal cavity. The decision should be tailored for the individual patient, taking into consideration the size of the lesion, the duration of symptoms and the presence of possible pelvic endometriosis.

40|$|Background: Iran has a {{large group}} of {{patients}} with severe congenital factor XIII deficiency (FXIIID) and Trp 187 Arg mutation that is most disease causing mutation of FXIII in the world is only observed in southeast of Iran with 352 patients with FXIIID. 743 patients with FXIIID was observed in 17 provinces of Iran but Tehran city with more than 12 million population has no any registered patient with FXIIID. Here we described first case with severe congenital FXIIID in Tehran Province with underline FXIII mutation. Methods: A neonate with prolonged <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>bleeding</b> was referred to hemophilia center. Patient was screened by routine coagulation tests and by clot solubility test. After observation of normal routine tests and abnormal clot solubility patient was underwent a full sequencing of FXIII-A gene. For confirmation of detected mutation in FXIII-A gene, exon 4 was amplified by PCR and cleaved by Eco 130 I restriction enzyme.

40|$|Wolfgang Korte 1, 21 Center for Laboratory Medicine, 2 Center for Hemostaseology and Hemophilia, St Gallen, SwitzerlandAbstract: Circulating factor XIII (FXIII) {{consists}} of two active (A) and two carrier (B) subunits in tetrameric form. Congenital FXIII deficiency is a rare autosomal-recessive trait that mostly results from an FXIII A-subunit deficiency. Classic coagulation assays, such as prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time, are not sensitive to FXIII; therefore, specific FXIII assays are necessary to detect the deficiency. The clinical picture of congenital FXIII deficiency comprises abortions, <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>bleeding,</b> increased surgical bleeding, intracerebral hemorrhage (which can, unfortunately, be the very first sign of severe FXIII deficiency), menorrhagia, and wound-healing disorders. Given the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, continued prophylaxis is to be recommended in severe deficiency, even in the actual absence of bleeding symptoms. Functional FXIII half-life decreases in consumptive processes (eg, surgery), explaining why increased dosing is needed in such situations. A recombinant FXIII (rFXIII) subunit-A molecule, which is expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been evaluated for replacement therapy in congenital FXIII deficiency. The bleeding frequency under continued rFXIII prophylaxis during a year-long treatment period was significantly lower compared to on-demand treatment. Importantly, no severe spontaneous bleedings occurred, and bleeding requiring additional intervention only occurred after relevant trauma. Treatment with rFXIII proved to be safe: antibodies against rFXIII detected in four patients were not considered clinically relevant. No allergic reactions were observed. These data show that rFXIII can be used safely and effectively for continued prophylaxis in congenital FXIII deficiency; {{it is conceivable that}} this also holds true for treatment of acute bleeding, but clinical proof of this is pending.
