40|$|Enhancement of the {{heterogeneous}} {{electron transfer}} (HET) activities of graphene materials toward redox-active molecules assumes {{a crucial role}} in numerous graphene-based electrochemical technologies. Here we discover that carbon-nanotube-supported reduced graphene oxide (rGO/CNT) exhibits <b>unusually</b> <b>higher</b> HET activities (including electrocatalytic performance toward dopamine, electron transfer kinetics with Ru(NH₃) ₆[superscript 3 +/ 2 +] and Fe(CN) ₆[superscript 3 –/ 4 –], and direct electron transfer efficiencies with cytochrome c and horseradish peroxidase) than does CNT-free rGO with an identical electrochemical surface area and surface chemistry. Through examination of the electronic structure combined with Gerischer–Marcus calculations, the critical factors responsible for this anomalous enhancement of the HET activities in rGO/CNT are identified to be a high density of π electronic states, up-shifting of the Fermi level, and appearance of a pronounced quantum-capacitance-dominating character. These results indicate a general strategy to improve the HET properties of graphene by using a π-electron-rich substrate to modulate electronic structure, and provide insight into the importance of the quantum capacitance in graphene electrochemistry...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} report on the {{study carried out on}} {{high-pressure}} free-radical initiated oxidated copolymerization of styrene (STY) with alpha-methylstyrene (AMS) at various temperatures (45 - 65 degreesC) at constant pressure (100 psi) and then at various pressures (50 - 300 psi) keeping the temperature (50 degreesC) constant. The compositions of the copolyperoxides obtained from the H- 1 NMT spectra were utilized to determine the reactivity ratios of the monomers. The reactivity ratios indicate that STY forms an ideal copolyperoxide with AMS and the copolyperoxide is richer in AMS. The effect of temperature and oxygen pressure in the reactivity ratios of the monomers was studied. The rates of copolymerization (R-p) were used to determine the overall activation energies (E-a) and activation volume (DeltaV(#)) of copolymerization. The <b>unusually</b> <b>higher</b> values of the DeltaV(#) {{may be due to the}} pressurizing fluid oxygen which itself is a reactant in the copolymerization, the side reactions, and the chain-transfer reactions occuring during copolymerizations...|$|R

40|$|Growing Role of Switzerland in Commodity Trade Ondřej Sláma Abstract This thesis assesses {{causes and}} {{consequences}} of Switzerland becoming the world's leading commodity hub. In both the replication and the extension of existing esti- mates, I find support for the hypothesis that Switzerland declares <b>unusually</b> <b>higher</b> (re-) export prices for commodities which are also on average under-priced as devel- oping country exports to Switzerland. The transfer pricing manipulation process implies a potential capital loss for commodity exporting countries along with other movement of either illicit or illegal financial flows. The highest annual estimate of $ 117 billion loss for developing countries trading with Switzerland suggests substan- tial issue in times of development aid turmoil. I attribute such grievous matters to Switzerland's low effort to meet international norms {{of international trade and}} trade transparency. The transfer pricing manipulation might also serve as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption, or tax and tariff evasion and avoidance, as the data imply.

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} {{the problem}} of stock market efficiency and market anomalies. Specifically, we look on European stock markets and possible presence of four seasonal effects - January, Halloween, Turn-of-the-month and Monday effects. These seasonal anomalies imply that returns for specific period are <b>unusually</b> <b>higher</b> or lower than returns {{for the rest of}} the time, which presents a challenge for the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The empirical side of this problem is the possible opportunity for excessive profit from trading on stock markets that could be based on the seasonal anomalies. Firstly, we summarize previous research in the field and attempts of explanation of individual effects. Further, we present the tools needed for our analysis - Ordinary Least Squares regression with dummy variables and few extensions. Data used for the analysis consists of 32 European stock indices. The actual analysis is performed as a comparison of returns on stock for certain specified periods. The evidence on January and Monday effects is found not strong enough to confirm the presence of such anomalies. On the other side, there is enough significant evidence on the presence of Halloween and Turn-of-the-month effects. Moreover, we are unable to explain the Halloween effect as manifestation of January effect. Powered [...] ...|$|R
