5|$|The Song {{military}} was chiefly organized {{to ensure that}} the army could not threaten Imperial control, often at the expense of effectiveness in war. Northern Song's Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who had no control over the imperial army. The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong).|$|E
5|$|Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps {{believed}} that Charles might have remained along the Rhine and defeated the French armies {{one after the}} other. Unlike the divided command of the French, the Austrians enjoyed <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b> After Ettlingen, Phipps thought that the correct French strategy was for the two French armies to join. However, this {{was not part of}} Carnot's plan, which was for each army to operate against the Austrian flanks. Carnot's strategy had succeeded in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign and he expected that it would win again. However, in 1794 the Coalition was made up of several countries with different vulnerabilities, while in 1796 Charles could issue a command and expect it to be obeyed. The next clash would be the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{position}} was directly {{south of the}} inter-army boundary between the British Fifth and Second Armies. As a result, the Canadian Corps was to attack with support of formations from the British Fifth Army {{to the north and}} the I Anzac Corps and X Corps to the south. The offensive was executed in a series of attacks each with limited objectives, delivered at intervals of three or more days. The execution dates of the phases were tentatively given as 26 October, 30 October and 6 November with a final smaller action on 10 November. To permit time to facilitate inter-divisional relief, there was a planned seven-day pause between the second and third stages, during which the Second Army took over the XVIII Corps area of the Fifth Army, north of the Canadian Corps with the II Corps on 2 November, to assure <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> over {{the central part of the}} attack front.|$|E

50|$|According to Cdr. Hooshang Samadi, {{commander}} of the Navy's Takavar Battalion, the main problems during the initial days of the battle was the lack <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> in <b>command,</b> as well as lack of heavy weapons, ammunition, and ambulances.|$|R
50|$|Ambassador Herbst {{related the}} Interagency Management System to the Goldwater-Nichols Act, saying “I {{think that the}} Interagency Management System under National Security Presidential Directive 44 is roughly {{analogous}} to Goldwater-Nichols. This National Security Presidential Directive and our agreement as we implement it have established interagency coordination which {{did not exist in}} the past.” In the short term Ambassador Herbst saw the Interagency Management System as a way to immediately meet challenges faced in Iraq by coordinating with the military in a way that engaged civilians and the interagency. He articulated the results of future engagements in Afghanistan and foresaw a way to avoid duplicate efforts and reach <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> effort between <b>command</b> structures.|$|R
5|$|The defence {{coordination}} was {{not helped}} by the poor relations between the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine Commanders-in-Chief, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring and Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder. The system required both services to work together, but it produced co-operation difficulties. A {{solution to the problem}} was twofold. Fighter units defending the North Sea coast were subordinated to Luftgaukommando XI (Air District Command 9) in Hannover. These fighter units would function as an autonomous fighter command, or Jagdfliegerführer (Fighter Flyer Leaders). The command of Fighter Command unit was given to Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher, a former commander of II./Jagdgeschwader 77. Schumacher had served in the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy) during the First World War and as an officer cadet had seen combat at the Battle of Jutland. It was hoped with his naval background and easy personality it would ease any difficulties with naval service cooperation. Nevertheless, Schumacher and his counterpart in the Navy were of the same rank, so each lacked authority over the other, an arrangement that lacked the needed <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 1935, still {{struggling}} {{with the issue of}} a separate air arm, the Army activated the General Headquarters Air Force for centralized control of aviation combat units within the continental United States, separate from but coordinate with the Air Corps. The separation of the Air Corps from control of its combat units caused problems of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> that became more acute as the Air Corps enlarged in preparation for World War II. This was resolved by the creation of the Army Air Forces (AAF), making both organizations subordinate to the new higher echelon.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparations}} for the Union campaign did not proceed smoothly, and Halleck seemed more concerned with his standing in relation to General-in-Chief George B. McClellan than he did with understanding the Confederate Army was divided and could be defeated in detail. Further, he could not agree with his peer, Buell, now in Nashville, on a joint course of action. He sent Grant up the Tennessee River while Buell remained in Nashville. On March 11, President Lincoln appointed Halleck the commander of all forces from the Missouri River to Knoxville, Tennessee, thus achieving the needed <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command,</b> and Halleck ordered Buell to join Grant's forces at Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River.|$|E

50|$|The {{immediate}} {{causes of}} the Swiss defeat were their failure to capture the enemy artillery during the early phase of the battle {{and the arrival of}} the Venetians. But also contributing to the Swiss defeat were their lack of discipline and their ineffective command structure. Earlier in the same year of 1515, the Swiss diet had granted to each captain the authority to decide whether their company would continue their campaign or retreat. This made it impossible for the Swiss forces to act as a <b>unity.</b> The system <b>of</b> <b>command</b> consisted two captains elected as commanders-in-chief, besides the captains of the individual companies, as well as one representative elected by the men-at-arms of each canton. These commanders would vote on the policy of the Swiss army. In practice, this system broke down {{as soon as it was}} put to the test: the captains decided to honour the agreement not to attack, while the representatives of the troops, especially those of Uri, Schwyz and Glarus, decided to attack regardless, motivated by the prospect of rich spoils.|$|R
25|$|Johnston's forward {{defense was}} broken. As Grant had anticipated, Polk's {{position}} at Columbus was untenable, and he withdrew soon after Donelson fell. Grant had also cut the Memphis and Ohio Railroad that previously had allowed Confederate forces to move laterally {{in support of}} each other. General P.G.T. Beauregard had arrived from the East to report to Johnston in February, and he commanded all Confederate forces between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers, which effectively divided the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> so that Johnston controlled only a small force at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Beauregard planned to concentrate his forces {{in the vicinity of}} Corinth, Mississippi, and prepare for an offensive. Johnston moved his force to concentrate with Beauregard's by late March.|$|E
25|$|Following the Armistice, Ryan {{resigned}} on November 27, leaving {{both the}} BAP and DMA, {{as well as}} the original Aircraft Board, leaderless. In addition certain powers, primarily those of dealing legally with the government-owned Spruce Production Corporation, had been delegated to Ryan by name, not to his position as Director of Aircraft Production, and as such could not be legally conferred on any successor. Maj. Gen. Charles Menoher was appointed to the vacancy on January 2, 1919, but the patchwork nature of laws and executive orders that had created the various parts of the Air Service prevented him from exercising all their legal powers and ending the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> problems caused by dual authority.|$|E
25|$|The General Staff {{produced}} a mobilization plan {{that in the}} event of war would create a field force of six armies, 18 corps, and 54 divisions. Each army would have an Air Service attack wing (one attack and two pursuit groups) and an observation group, each corps and division would have an observation squadron, and a seventh attack wing-observation group would be reserved for the Expeditionary Force's general headquarters. A single bombardment group was planned, relegating bombardment to the most minor of roles. All aviation units would be under the command of ground officers at all levels. While promoting <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> within the service as its most important principle, the plan obviated concentration of forces by its air units. This structure provided the principles by which the Air Service and Air Corps operated until 1935.|$|E

25|$|As Fechteler's CINCLANT successor, McCormick {{inherited}} Fechteler's long-delayed {{appointment as}} the first supreme allied commander of NATO naval forces in the Atlantic. Fechteler's nomination for the post was announced on February 19, 1951, but had been stalled by British opposition led by former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who took offense at the concept of subordinating the Royal Navy to an American admiral and demanded that a British admiral be appointed instead. Incumbent Prime Minister Clement Attlee confirmed Fechteler's nomination in July, but Fechteler almost immediately vacated command of the Atlantic Fleet to become chief of naval operations, giving Churchill the opportunity to reopen the issue when he resumed the premiership in October. Churchill now argued {{that there was no}} need for a single supreme naval commander, suggesting that the Atlantic instead be divided into American and British sectors, but the United States insisted on <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> and Churchill ultimately had to yield to American pressure, reluctantly consenting to McCormick's appointment in January 1952.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, on February 8, 1962, {{by order}} of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Felt created the U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) as a sub-unified command headed by General Paul D. Harkins. As Harkins' {{superior}} {{in the chain of}} command, Felt was criticized for exercising excessive control over MACV field operations. Felt denied many of Harkins' equipment requests, interfered with details of Harkins' tactical planning, forbade Harkins to communicate with the Joint Chiefs of Staff without advance permission from CINCPAC, and actually bypassed Harkins to direct certain tactical operations himself from his headquarters in Hawaii. Many observers argued that reporting to CINCPAC was hindering MACV operations and that MACV should be an independent command under the direct supervision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but Felt and his successors as CINCPAC blocked multiple attempts to remove MACV from their control, arguing that allowing MACV to bypass the unified regional commander would violate the principle of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> in the region.|$|E
25|$|By 1796 Hoche had a {{free hand}} because, unlike earlier governments, the French Directory {{did not need to}} approve every operation. With <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>command</b> and near-dictatorial powers, his expeditions {{continuously}} pressed the insurgents. An earlier truce worked in his favor by allowing the rebels to briefly enjoy peace; afterward they were less inclined to fight. Elsewhere, French victories over the First Coalition armies made Royalist prospects look dim. At length, rebel leaders Jean-Nicolas Stofflet and François de Charette were captured and executed. By March 1796 the south bank of the Loire River was pacified and Hoche deployed 15,000 infantry and two cavalry regiments against the Chouans on the north bank. By May the Chouannerie was quelled after most of the leaders were captured or gave up. In return for peace, Hoche promised that the priests had religious freedom while the young men would not be conscripted into the army. About 2,000 Republican deserters fighting for the rebels surrendered and their only punishment was to return to the Republican army. The hard-liners were not pleased with Hoche's lenient terms and wished that Willot had been in charge. However, the Directory was so thankful for Hoche's efforts that it publicly proclaimed him Pacificateur and bought him a pair of pistols, two good horses and riding tack.|$|E
