When Liz asks why Jack is taking a bus to Washington he replies [...] "ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes the rest of <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put on a show," [...] a reference to controversial travel methods by several CEOs {{en route to a}} November 19 congressional hearing. The dilemma over bailout money also bears resemblance to federal bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler. In describing how he plans to destroy Jack's image, Devon says [...] "by the time I'm done you're going to make AIG look like the Lehman Brothers of microwaves," [...] a reference to two notable corporations from the financial crisis. Devon also says that in his search for an organization more powerful than GE he selected the American government because, [...] "American Idols not on until January." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he had}} {{not always}} planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was {{simultaneously}} on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. [...] " [...] is going to have to figure out how to compartmentalize, the way that all of <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do in the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us," [...] he added. [...] "That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet we still have to figure out a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories." ...|$|E
