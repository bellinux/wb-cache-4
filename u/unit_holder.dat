The recent devolution of decision-making responsibility from centralised authorities to local school-based management has resulted in changes in leadership provision in schools. Consequently, school restructuring has created new expectations {{of those who are}} in leadership positions to rethink the leadership paradigm, to develop effective and purposeful leadership, and to promote learning communities based on collaborative and collegial models. As New Zealand has experienced fourteen years of SBM, useful insights could be gained regarding the way that teachers and principals perceive school leadership. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how teachers and principals, in one school district in New Zealand, perceived school leadership (deputy principal, assistant principal, senior teacher/management <b>unit</b> <b>holder)</b> in terms of leadership style and leadership management strategies. As well, the study considered the characteristics of leadership that teachers and principals considered as important and being given emphasis in their school. An examination was also made of how teachers perceived their engagement in school decision-making and whether their perceptions are influenced by other factors. A case study method was selected involving a survey of teachers and a survey of principals, semi-structured follow up interviews of teachers, semi-structured interviews of senior teachers and a document analysis relating to school management strategies.

40|$|The {{concept of}} mutual fund emerged in Netherlands in 18 th century and {{introduced}} in India by Unit Trust of India in 1960 s. As {{the mutual fund}} industry provides an option of diversified investment structure with varying degree of risk, {{it was supposed to}} be the most lucrative market for Indian investors. It was believed that it will surely tap the savings of common man. But in practice it failed to become a primary choice for investment to Indian investor. During almost six decades (1965 - 2011) the value of assets under management of mutual fund industry experienced great swings. As against the developed countries where almost every second investor is a mutual <b>unit</b> <b>holder,</b> the product could not get much popularity in India.

The study uses principal component analysis as a tool for factor reduction. The paper explored three factors named as fund/scheme related attributes, monetary benefits and sponsor's related attributes (having respectively six, four and four variables) which may be offered to investors for securing their patronage.

The preparation procedure of stir cake is very simple. First, monolithic cake is synthesized {{according to the}} in situ polymerization of monolith; then, the cake is inserted in an original <b>unit</b> (<b>holder),</b> which is constructed from a syringe cartridge and allows the magnetic stirring of the cake during the extraction process. The effects of dimension of monolithic cake and unit design on the extraction performance were optimized in detail. To demonstrate the usability of this new extraction approach, poly(vinylimidazole-divinylbenzene) was prepared and acted as the extractive cake. The analysis of steroid hormones in milk samples by the combination of stir cake with high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection, was selected as a paradigm for the practical evaluation of stir cake sorptive extraction. Under the optimized extraction conditions, low detection limits (S/N = 3) and quantification limits (SIN = 10) of the proposed method for the target analytes were achieved within the range between 0. 33 - 0. 69 and 1. 08 - 2. 28 mu g/L, respectively. The method also showed good linearity, repeatability, high feasibility and acceptable recoveries. Because the monolithic cake does not contact with the vessel wall during stirring, there is no friction loss of extractive medium and the stir cake {{can be used for}} more than 1000 h...|$|E

40|$|In late 2005, {{a number}} of German open ended funds {{suffered}} significant withdrawals by <b>unit</b> <b>holders.</b> The crisis was precipitated by a long term bear market in German property investment {{and the fact that}} these funds offered short term liquidity to <b>unit</b> <b>holders</b> but had low levels of liquidity in the fund. A more controversial suggestion was that the crisis was exacerbated by a perception that the valuations of the fund were too infrequent and inaccurate. As units are priced by reference to these valuations with no secondary market, the valuation process is central to the process. There is no direct evidence that these funds were over-valued but there is circumstantial evidence and this paper examines the indirect evidence of the process to see whether the hypothesis that valuation is an issue for the German funds holds any credibility. It also discusses whether there is a wider issue for other funds of this nature or whether it is a parochial problem confined to Germany. The conclusions are that {{there is reason to believe}} that German valuation processes make over-valuation in a recession more likely than in other countries and that more direct research into the German valuation system is required to identify the issues which need to be addressed to make the valuation system more trusted. ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{graduation}} from Yale, Plank {{returned to his}} hometown of Minneapolis and with two partners formed Northwest Business Service, an accounting, tax and small business advisory firm. Through this enterprise, he became familiar with the types of investments then being offered in {{oil and gas exploration}} and production. Recognizing that investors’ interests in this field could be better served through a different concept, Plank and two childhood friends, Truman Anderson and Chuck Aranao, formed Apache Corporation in 1954 with $250,000 in investor capital. Apache offered its first oil and gas investment program in 1956.Apache initially diversified beyond oil and gas into commercial real estate, purchasing office towers and shopping centers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Apache’s real estate business achieved only minimal success, and when Oklahoma and Texas cut oil production allowables by as much as 90 percent in the late 1950s, the company sold off its real estate holdings and began acquiring successful entrepreneurial businesses including small telephone companies, an auto parts chain, the tree crop business and aerosol can and plastic pipe companies.Conflict in the Middle East, the rise of OPEC and America’s increasing dependence on foreign oil led Plank to revise Apache’s strategy once again in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The company gradually divested its non-energy holdings and by the late 1980s was focused exclusively on oil and gas.Apache funded much of its early growth through the creation of drilling funds, investment programs that provided significant tax advantages to <b>unit</b> <b>holders.</b> To provide its <b>unit</b> <b>holders</b> greater liquidity, in 1971 Apache formed Apache Exploration Company (Apexco) as the oil and gas operating arm of its drilling programs. Apexco was innovative in that it provided the first-ever vehicle for program participants to exchange their illiquid units for publicly traded stock.In 1981, under Plank’s leadership, Apache created Apache Petroleum Company (APC), the nation’s first master limited partnership (MLP). This new investment vehicle consolidated interests in 33 Apache oil and gas programs formed between 1959 and 1978. [...] APC units were traded on the New York and Midwest Stock Exchanges, providing liquidity to <b>unit</b> <b>holders</b> while preserving the tax advantages of their original limited partnership interests.|$|R

40|$|In this contribution, the English commonhold system, {{which enables}} the {{development}} of freehold units in a multi-unit development, is critically re-visited. Provision is made for {{the development of}} freehold apartments on land with a registered commonhold title. At the date of registration, a management body for the scheme, the commonhold association, must be in place. Each purchaser of a unit in the relevant building obtains freehold property on purchase. The property and management of the building housing the units and of the common areas of the scheme are, by contrast, withheld from <b>unit</b> <b>holders</b> and vested in the commonhold association, which is a special kind of body corporate. Since the coming into force of the English legislation, a set of defects have been detected. This contribution re-assesses the main problem areas and makes a number of reform suggestions drawing on material from a number of jurisdictions, notably South Africa, France and Germany. Avoidable problems are likely to arise with any conversions to commonhold from the predominant English long lease system, owing to the narrowness of the conversion rules. The manner in which ownership of units and the common parts are regulated, a key aspect in any such system, merits re-assessment. It seems that here the English rules survive comparison. The rules pertaining to constitution of the commonhold association fail to provide sufficient safeguards for unpaid scheme creditors. The rules relating leasing of commonhold units seem inadequately thought out. There is a conspicuous absence of real remedies for non-payment of assessments by <b>unit</b> <b>holders.</b> The effect of these and other aspects may help to explain why commonhold has had a limited numerical impact.
