The catalytic mechanism of malonyl-CoA synthetase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum was investigated by steady-state kinetics. Initial-velocity studies and the product-inhibition studies with AMP and PPi strongly suggested ordered Bi <b>Uni</b> <b>Uni</b> Bi Ping Pong Ter Ter system as the most probable steady-state kinetic mechanism of malonyl-CoA synthetase. Michaelis constants were 61 microM, 260 microM and 42 microM for ATP, malonate and CoA respectively, and the value for Vmax, was 11. 2 microM/min. The t. l. c. analysis of the 32 P-labelled products in a reaction mixture containing [gamma- 32 P]ATP {{in the absence of}} CoA showed that PPi was produced after the sequential addition of ATP and malonate. Formation of malonyl-AMP, suggested as an intermediate in the kinetically deduced mechanism, was confirmed by the analysis of 31 P-n. m. r. spectra of an AMP product isolated from the 18 O-transfer experiment using [18 O]malonate. The 31 P-n. m. r. signal of the AMP product appeared at 0. 024 p. p. m. apart from that of [16 O 4]AMP, indicating that one atom of 18 O transferred from [18 O]malonate to AMP through {{the formation of}} malonyl-AMP. Formation of malonyl-AMP was also confirmed through the t. l. c. analysis of reaction mixture containing [alpha- 32 P]ATP.

40|$|The XL-I form of xenobiotic/medium-chain fatty acid:CoA ligase was {{purified}} to apparent homogeneity from bovine liver mitochondria {{and used}} to determine the reaction mechanism. A tersubstrate kinetic analysis was conducted by varying the concentrations of ATP, benzoate and CoA in turn. Both ATP and benzoate gave parallel double-reciprocal plots against CoA, which indicates a Ping Pong mechanism, with either pyrophosphate or AMP leaving before the binding of CoA. Addition of pyrophosphate to the assays changed the plots from parallel to intersecting; addition of AMP did not. This indicates that pyrophosphate is the product that leaves before binding of CoA. Based on end-product inhibition studies, it was concluded that the reaction follows a Bi <b>Uni</b> <b>Uni</b> Bi Ping Pong mechanism, with ATP binding first, followed in order by benzoate binding, pyrophosphate release, CoA binding, benzoyl-CoA release and AMP release. A similar mechanism was obtained when the ligase was examined with butyrate as substrate. However, butyrate activation was characterized by a much higher affinity for CoA. This is attributed to steric factors resulting from the bulkier nature of the benzoate molecule. Also, with butyrate there is a bivalent cation activation distinct from that associated with binding to ATP. This activation by excess Mg(2 +) results in non-linear plots of 1 /v against 1 /[ATP] for butyrate unless the concentrations of Mg(2 +) and ATP are varied together...|$|E
40|$|Long chain acyl-CoA {{synthetase}} (ACSL; {{fatty acid}} CoA ligase: AMP forming; EC 6. 2. 1. 3) catalyzes {{the formation of}} acyl-CoA through a process, which requires fatty acid, ATP and coenzymeA as substrates. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the principal ACSL is Faa 1 p (encoded by the FAA 1 gene). The preferred substrates for this enzyme are cis-monounsaturated long chain fatty acids. Our previous work has shown Faa 1 p is a principal component of a fatty acid transport/activation complex that also includes the fatty acid transport protein Fat 1 p. In the present work hexameric histidine tagged Faa 1 p was purified to homogeneity through a two-step process {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 % η-dodecyl-β-maltoside following expression at 15 °C in Escherichia coli. In order to further define the role of this enzyme in fatty acid transport-coupled activation (vectorial acylation), initial velocity kinetic studies were completed to define the kinetic parameters of Faa 1 p in response to the different substrates and to define mechanism. These studies showed Faa 1 p had a Vmax of 158. 2 nmol/ min/mg protein and a Km of 71. 1 μM oleate. When the concentration of oleate was held constant at 50 μM, the Km for CoA and ATP were 18. 3 μM and 51. 6 μM respectively.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of cholic acid, CoA and ATP to yield cholyl-CoA was investigated by kinetic {{analysis of the}} reaction as catalysed by guinea pig liver microsomes. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for divalent cation for activity so all kinetic analyses were carried out in excess Mn 2 +. A trisubstrate kinetic analysis was conducted by varying, {{one at a time}} ATP cholate and CoA. Both ATP and cholate gave parallel double reciprocal plots versus CoA, which indicates a ping-pong mechanism with either pyrophosphate or AMP leaving prior to the binding of CoA. Addition of pyrophosphate to the assays changed the parallel plots to intersecting ones; addition of AMP did not. This indicates that pyrophosphate is the first product. The end-product, AMP, was a competitive inhibitor versus ATP, as was cholyl-CoA at saturating concentrations of cholate. Both AMP and cholyl-CoA were uncompetitive inhibitors versus CoA. Based on this information, it was concluded that the reaction follows a bi <b>uni</b> <b>uni</b> bi ping-pong mechanism with ATP binding first, and with the release of the final products, AMP and cholyl-CoA, being random. CoA showed substrate inhibition at high but non-saturating concentrations and this inhibition was competitive versus ATP, which is consistent with the predicted ping-pong mechanism. The ability of cholyl-CoA, but not cholate or CoA, to bind with high affinity to the free enzyme was suggestive of a high affinity of the enzyme for the thioester link...|$|E

Pantothenate synthetase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, {{and found to}} be a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 33 kDa. Initial velocity, product, and dead-end inhibition studies showed the kinetic mechanism of pantothenate synthetase to be Bi <b>Uni</b> <b>Uni</b> Bi Ping Pong, with ATP binding followed by D-pantoate binding, release of PPi, binding of β-alanine, followed by the release of pantothenate and AMP. Michaelis constants were 0. 13, 0. 8, and 2. 6 mM for D-pantoate, β-alanine, and ATP, respectively, and the turnover number, kcat, was 3. 4 s- 1. The formation of pantoyl adenylate, suggested as a key intermediate by the kinetic mechanism, was confirmed by 31 P NMR spectroscopy of [18 O]AMP produced from 18 O transfer using [carboxyl- 18 O]pantoate. Single-turnover reactions for the formation of pyrophosphate and pantothenate were determined using rapid quench techniques, and indicated that the two half-reactions occurred with maximum rates of 1. 3 (0. 3 and 2. 6 (0. 3 s- 1, respectively, consistent with pantoyl adenylate being a kinetically competent intermediate in the pantothenate synthetase reaction. These data also suggest that both half-reactions are partially ratelimiting. Reverse isotope exchange of [14 C]-β-alanine into pantothenate in the presence of AMP was observed, indicating the reversible formation of the pantoyl adenylate intermediate from products.

40|$|The GH 3 {{family of}} acyl-acid-amido synthetases {{catalyze}} the ATP-dependent formation of amino acid conjugates to modulate levels of active plant hormones, including auxins and jasmonates. Initial biochemical studies of various GH 3 s show that these enzymes group into three families based on sequence relationships and acyl-acid substrate preference (I, jasmonate-conjugating; II, auxin- and salicylic acid-conjugating; III, benzoate-conjugating); however, {{little is known}} about the kinetic and chemical mechanisms of these enzymes. Here we use GH 3 - 8 from Oryza sativa (rice; OsGH 3 - 8), which functions as an indole-acetic acid (IAA) -amido synthetase, for detailed mechanistic studies. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that the OsGH 3 - 8 requires either Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + for maximal activity and is specific for aspartate but accepts asparagine as a substrate with a 45 -fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and accepts other auxin analogs, including phenyl-acetic acid, indole butyric acid, and naphthalene-acetic acid, as acyl-acid substrates with 1. 4 – 9 -fold reductions in kcat/Km relative to IAA. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicate that the enzyme uses a Bi <b>Uni</b> <b>Uni</b> Bi Ping Pong reaction sequence. In the first half-reaction, ATP binds first followed by IAA. Next, formation of an adenylated IAA intermediate results in release of pyrophosphate. The second half-reaction begins with binding of aspartate, which reacts with the adenylated intermediate to release IAA-Asp and AMP. Formation of a catalytically competent adenylated-IAA reaction intermediate was confirmed by mass spectrometry.

Phosphopantetheine, {{the product of the}} first three enzymatic steps, is ultimately attached to apo-acyl carrier proteins (ACP) to generate active, holo-ACP, which is reported to participate in up to 13 % of all characterized biochemical reactions including essential steps in fatty acid metabolism. Phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the second step of CoA biosynthesis. PPCS from Enterococcus faecalis and human were cloned, purified, and characterized. While PPCS from both species exhibited similar ordered Bi <b>Uni</b> <b>Uni</b> Bi Ping Pong mechanisms, significant differences in substrate selectivity were found between the bacterial and human PPCS homologues. E. faecalis PPCS was CTP-specific, while human PPCS could use both ATP and CTP in addition to being able to bind UTP and GTP. The CTP specificity of E. faecalis and other bacterial PPCS contrasted with the lack of nucleotide specificity of human PPCS suggests that selective inhibition of bacterial PPCS as a potential anti-bacterial should be feasible. A high throughput screen was conducted against a library of 41, 000 small molecules and 11, 000 natural product extracts to find novel inhibitors of bacterial PPCS. Several small molecules and natural product extracts were confirmed to be inhibitors of bacterial PPCS, and the inhibition mechanism for one inhibitor was determined. Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT), the enzyme involved in the fourth step of CoA biosynthesis, was also studied, leveraging the technologies developed in the previous PPCS studies. PPAT from E. faecalis was cloned, purified, and characterized.

The highly purified enzyme has a specific activity of 27. 0 nmoles of oxaloacetate formed per mg of protein and gave two bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pyruvate caxboxylase containing band constituted approximately 80 % {{of the total}} protein. The enzyme-catalysed reaction requires pyruvate, MgATP and HCO- 3 and is activated by Mg 2 + and K+ ions. The enzyme is inhibited by preincubation with avidin and by oxalate. The enzyme shows only about of its maximum activity {{in the absence of}} acetyl-CoA, which activates the enzyme with an A 0. 5 value of 25 muM. Activation by this effector is sigmoidal, with a Hill coefficient of about 3. 0, and it is antagonised by L-aspartate, which has a Hill coefficient of between 2. 0 and 4. 0 depending on the concentration of acetyl-CoA. CoA is able to replace acetyl-CoA, with an A 0. 5 value of 1. 3 muM and a Hill coefficient of 3. 0. Kinetic analysis of the reaction has shown its mechanism to be of the non-classical Ping Pong Bi Bi <b>Uni</b> <b>Uni</b> type with kinetically significant abortive complexes, enzyme-HCO- 3 -MgADP and enzyme-HCO- 3 -Pi. Apparent Km values and inhibition constants were determined for the substrates and product inhibitors of the enzyme. The enzyme was inactivated on incubation at 0 °C or at pH 8. 0, 15 °C, with a change in s 20,W value in each case which indicated that a halving of molecular weight was occurring. The molecular weight of the inactive form of the enzyme found at pH 8. 0 was shown to be 290 000, implying a value of 580 000 for the molecular weight of the native enzyme. The subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 130 000, suggesting that the native enzyme is tetrameric. This suggestion is supported {{by the fact that the}} sedimentation similar to that found for other pyruvate carboxylases which have been shown to be tetrameric. It has been shown that pyruvate carboxylase can exist in biotin-deficient A. globiformis in both apoenzyme and holoenzyme forms. The apoenzyme is converted to holoenzyme on addition of biotin to biotin-deficient cells, in the absence of protein synthesis. The total amount of pyruvate carboxylase in cells of A. globiformis appears to be determined largely by the nature of the carbon source used for growth. During growth at biotin concentrations of between 40 pg/ml and 1 ng/ml, the amount of pyruvate carboxylase holoenzyme appears to be directly dependent upon the concentration of biotin in the medium in cells grown on lactate, glycine and glucose. The results have been discussed by comparison with other pyruvate carboxylases. Kinetic and regulatory properties are broadly similar to those of other pyruvate carboxylases but the structural characteristics are markedly different from those of any other pyruvate carboxylases so far studied...|$|E

The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is typically biflagellate, but forward genetic screens have identified uniflagellar mutants. All uniflagellar mutants (<b>uni</b> 1, <b>uni</b> 2, and <b>uni</b> 3) contain ultrastructural defects in the basal body or transition zone and preferentially assemble a flagellum {{from the older}} basal body. The <b>UNI</b> 2 gene encodes a novel coiled-coil protein with a potential homolog in the human genome. We rescued the <b>uni</b> 2 mutant phenotype with an HA-epitope tagged gene construct. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the <b>Uni</b> 2 protein migrates as at least two molecular-weight variants that {{can be converted to}} a single form with phosphatase treatment. Synthesis of <b>Uni</b> 2 protein is induced during cell division cycles; accumulation of the phophorylated form coincides with assembly of transition zones and flagella {{at the end of the}} division cycle. Immunofluorescence staining of the <b>Uni</b> 2 protein in interphase cells demonstrated that it localizes to four distinct spots coinciding with the location of basal bodies and probasal bodies Immunogold labeling confirmed <b>Uni</b> 2 protein localization on probasal bodies and the distal end of basal bodies at the precise point of triplet to doublet microtubule transition between the basal body and flagellum. Using the <b>Uni</b> 2 protein as a marker of basal bodies during the cell cycle, we observed the sequential assembly of new probasal bodies beginning at prophase. Double mutant strains with <b>uni</b> 1,uni 2 or <b>uni</b> 2,uni 3 genotypes showed enhanced defects in flagellar assembly. Immunoblot analysis showed that phosphorylation of the <b>Uni</b> 2 protein is significantly reduced in <b>uni</b> 1 mutant cells but is similar to wild-type levels in <b>uni</b> 3 mutant cells. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated enhanced transition zone defects in the <b>uni</b> 1,uni 2 double mutant cells. Serial transverse sections through basal bodies in <b>uni</b> 1 and <b>uni</b> 2 single and double mutant cells revealed a previously undescribed defect in the transition from triplet to doublet microtubules between the basal body and flagellum. The transition defect was correlated with an inability to form axonemes. These mutants provide the first mechanistic insights into the pathway mediating the transition of triplet to doublet microtubules during flagellar assembly and suggest an overlap in the pathways mediating microtubule transition and basal body maturation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{life cycle cost}} analysis, which compares construction, maintenance, and lighting costs needed to manage a highway tunnel. As regards the decision making process, it often considers only construction costs. Instead even maintenance and lighting, especially related to road tunnels, cause important cash flows. Therefore, both construction and managing costs have to be planned, {{in order to assess}} the cheapest solution. The lighting system of a road tunnel must guarantee the visual guidance for users moving at design speed and without hazardous actions. In this case study, the authors designed the pavement according to Italian standards and the lighting system according to Italian and European technical rules (<b>UNI</b> and <b>UNI</b> EN standards). They used LED technologies to maximize energy saving and road safety. The examined case study shows the importance of the surface pavement material, since it may contribute to the inter-reflected light and reduce electric energy consumption...|$|R
