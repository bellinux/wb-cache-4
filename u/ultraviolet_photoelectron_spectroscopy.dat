Our investigation is aimed at finding a material combination where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the organic dye are situated in between the valence and conduction bands of the inorganic matrix {{in order to promote}} electron and hole transfer from the matrix to the dye.

In this case, up to three metal atoms can react with a given Alq 3 molecule to form the trivalent anion. The anion formation results in a splitting of the N 1 s core level and {{formation of a new}} feature in the previously forbidden energy gap. Virtually identical spectra are observed in the Al/LiF/Alq 3 system, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} radical anion is also formed when all three of these constituents are present. This is support by a simple thermodynamic model based on bulk heats of formation. In the absence of LiF or similar material, the reaction of Al with Alq 3 appears to be destructive, with the deposited Al reacting directly with the quinolate oxygen. We proposed that in those circumstances where the radical anion is formed, it and not the cathode metal are responsible for the electron injection properties.

50|$|The monomer has an {{aromatic}} fluorene core -C13H6- {{with two}} aliphatic n-octyl -C8H17 tails {{attached to the}} central carbon. Polydioctylfluorene (PFO) {{can be found in}} liquid-crystalline, glassy, amorphous, semi-crystalline or β-chain formation. This variety is on account of the intermolecular forces that PFO can participate in. The secondary forces present in PFO are typically van der Waals, which are relatively weak. These weak forces makes it a solid that can also be used as a film on a substrate. The glassy films formed by PFO chains form solutions in good solvents, meaning it is at least partially soluble. These van der Waals also add complexity to the microstructure of PFO, which is why it has a wide range of solid formations. The solid formations though, typically form low density due to the low cooling rate of the polymer. The density of polydioctylfluorene is measured by using the process of <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopy.</b> Chain stiffness is also prominent in PFO, because of this it is predicted that the molecular weight is a factor of 2.7 lower than polystyrene, which can produce an approximation of 190 repeat units in a standard PFO chain. By changing the strain and temperature applied to the polymer’s structure results in an alteration of the PFO’s properties. Thermal treatment such as friction transfer {{can be applied to the}} structure, this is a way to alter the properties. The friction transfer aligns the structure to become crystalline or liquid crystalline. Polymer 196 is the most commonly studied type of polydioctylfluorene. In studies, polymer 196 has shown the most promising properties and the best crystallinity. Within the crystal structure of polymer 196 octyl side chains are inserted between the layer of the polymer to provide more space for efficiency in structuring the material.|$|E

In master’s thesis I present graphene and its properties, describe the crystal structure and show the theoretical calculation of the dispersion relation of energy bands in graphene, using the tight binding method.

In the experimental part, I present the formation of graphene films on the surface Ni(111), which I have created by chemical vapor deposition of ethylene. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, I have determined the type of produced graphene film and distinguished different graphene phases (epitaxial and rotated) from the carbide phase. I have found that the temperature of the sample and the concentration of dissolved carbon in the substrate (this is associated with the pressure and the time of ethylene dosing) play crucial role on the type of the graphene phase formed on Ni(111). Using helium atom scattering I have measured surface roughness during ethylene dosing. Measurements have shown that the carbide phase is more ordered than graphene phases.

Upon adsorption on CeO 2 (111) at 300 K, nickel remains in a metallic state. Heating to elevated temperatures (500 – 800 K) leads to partial reduction of the ceria substrate {{with the formation of}} Ni 2 + species that exists as NiO and/or Ce 1 −xNixO 2 −y. Interactions of nickel with the oxide substrate significantly reduce the density of occupied Ni 3 d states near the Fermi level. The results of core-level photoemission and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure point to weakly bound CO species on CeO 2 (111) which are clearly distinguishable from the formation of chemisorbed carbonates. In the presence of Ni, a stronger interaction is observed with chemisorption of CO on the admetal. When the Ni is in contact with Ce+ 3 cations, CO dissociates on the surface at 300 K forming NiCx compounds that may be involved in the formation of CH 4 at higher temperatures. At medium and large Ni coverages (> 0. 3 ML), the Ni/CeO 2 (111) surfaces are able to catalyze the production of methane from CO and H 2, with an activity slightly higher than that of Ni(100) or Ni(111).

Even though the rf-PECVD N 2 treatment leads to higher N-doping levels in the FLGs (4. 06 at%) as compared to the ECR process (2. 18 at. %), the ferromagnetic behaviour of ECR FLG(118. 62 x 10 ⁻⁴ emu/gm) was significantly higher than the rf-PECVD (0. 39 x 10 ⁻⁴ emu/gm) and pristine graphene (3. 47 x 10 ⁻⁴ emu/gm). While both plasma processes introduce electron donating N-atoms in the graphene structure, distinct dominant nitrogen bonding configurations (pyridinic, pyrrolic) were observed for each FLG type. While, the ECR plasma introduces more sp 2 type nitrogen moieties, the rf-PECVD process {{led to the formation of}} sp 3 coordinated nitrogen functionalities, as confirmed through Raman measurements. The samples further characterised using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and X-ray, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>photoelectron</b> <b>spectroscopies</b> revealed an increased electronic density of states and a significantly higher concentration of pyrrolic groups in the rf-PECVD samples. Due to the formation of reactive edge structures and pyridinic nitrogen moieties, the ECR functionalised FLGs expressed highest saturation magnetisation behaviour with the lowest field hysteretic features. In comparison, the rf-PECVD samples, displayed the lowest saturation magnetisation owing to the disappearance of magnetic edge states and formation of stable non-radical type defects in the pyrrole type structures. Our experimental results thus provide new evidence to control the magnetic and electronic properties of few layered graphene nanoflakes via control of the plasma-processing route...|$|R

The depth distribution of implanted 121 Sb ions at low dose is characterised by a truncated bell-shaped distribution, with mean implantation ranges of 250 Å for 90 KeV implantation and 370 Å for 150 keV implantation. However, owing to surface sputtering, the maximum in the implantation profile shifts toward the surface with increasing ion dose and for 90 keV ions at doses above 3 × 10 16 cm 2, the implantation profile is sputter limited with maximum implant concentration at the surface. Electrical activation of the implanted ions is achieved at temperatures lower than those required to cause complete sintering of the small grains of the as-deposited films.
