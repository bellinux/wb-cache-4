The edge corresponding with the latter, is the best marked, and is generally slightly hollowed out, as if a piece had been broken off. The tergo-lateral margin is curved and protuberant. The umbo projects a little over the scutal margin of the terga.|$|E

In this study, we attempt to compare and analyze the dosimetric aspects of 3 DRT over IMRT in the whole breast radiotherapy. Methods and Materials:  Both right and left sided computed tomography simulations of 14 women with early stage breast cancer were used for our retrospective study to compare the 3 DCRT and IMRT. The dose prescribed was 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the whole breast PTV. The PTV was defined by adding <b>unequal</b> <b>margins</b> to the directional safety margin status of each lumpectomy cavity (i. e., medial, lateral, superior, inferior and deep margins measured from the tumor front after the examination of the surgical specimen: 2, 1. 5, and 1 cm for resection margins 2 cm, respectively). And than modified so that it was no longer closer than 3 mm to the skin surface and was no deep than the lung –chest interface. The prescribed dose delivered in 5 fractions per week schedule. Treatment plans were compared for target minimum dose, maximum dose, mean dose, conformity index, heterogeneity index and doses to organs at risk were compared and analysed. Results: The target coverage was achieved with 90 % prescription to the 95 % of the PTV. Conformity to the PTV was significantly higher with 3 DCRT technique than IMRT. 3 DCRT technique seems better in sparing critical organs parameters like lung V 20 and Mean, heart, V 25, Maximum, both lungs V 20, Mean and Dose to the Normal Healthy tissue. Conclusion: We conclude from our study that treatment technique selection for whole Breast irradiation {{is an important factor in}} sparing the adjacent normal structures and in determining the associated risk. 3 DCRT produces better conformity and heterogeneity indices of the target volume, also reduces dose to OARs the 3 DCRT reduces the risk of radiation induced heart diseases.

40|$|Since 1984 when milk quotas were {{introduced}} in Italy, the dairy chain has evolved with relevant consequences for the market competition. The Aglink-Cosimo simulations predict after the phasing out period, a growing milk market competition, driven by a fairly optimistic demand outlook among the EU- 27 economies; for Italy it is expected a milk supply exceeding the present level by about 3 %, and milk deliveries increasing at a slightly higher rate. Purpose {{of this paper is}} to examine the present situation of the dairy chain in Italy characterized by asymmetries at various levels in structures (number of competitors, size of the farm/firms, collusion among participants), affecting the market efficiency. Evidences are provided by six simulations for the price transmission and ten simulations for welfare distribution using different conjectural hypotheses. The results show that the price transmission from the farm gate to the retail level are lower when the concentration is higher, while the welfare distribution depends on the price set at the farm gate. The conclusion recommend to reconsider the price support, otherwise most of the farmers will leave the sector because on unbearable production costs and <b>unequal</b> <b>margin</b> distribution...|$|R
50|$|Lopha {{species have}} thick, {{strongly}} ribbed shells with <b>unequal</b> valves. The <b>margins</b> of the valves have a characteristic zig-zag pattern. The lower valve shows finger-like outgrowths, {{by which the}} molluscs adhere to the substrate. These molluscs are stationary, epifaunal, suspension feeders, as they feed by filtering sea water to extract the nutrients.|$|R
30|$|Research devoting more policy {{modelling}} {{that accounts}} for imperfect markets was scarce {{at the beginning of}} this century (McCorriston 2002), but a number of application has been developed since then. The work of Russo et al. (2011) highlights that, in presence of market power, benefits from decoupling agriculture support are smaller than under perfect competition (or even negative). They use an approach that relies on shifts in supply, demand or policy to identify and measure market power. Goodhue and Russo (2011) examine the interactions between agriculture policy and market power in the USA flour milling industry. Using a non-parametric approach, they demonstrate that USA wheat millers are able to increase their margins when farmers receive payments through marketing. In other words, market power might allow redistributing benefits from government intervention. Sexton (2013) develops a theoretical model that takes into account vertical coordination, i.e. contracts between farmers and processors in presence of substantial investment costs and product differentiation. He finds that under these conditions buyers matter about the future, and they would pay farmers as much or more than a under a competitive market, but in other settings where vertical coordination is not an issue, the exercise of market power would prevail. Rosa et al. (2015) perform an application of the oligopoly model of McCorriston, further developed by Sheldon, in the Italian dairy chain and found that demand elasticity has a modest impact on consumer surplus, but market power and price changes at farm level are the most important determinants of welfare distribution. They conclude that the measures contained in the single CMO may contribute to avoid the <b>unequal</b> <b>margin</b> distribution caused by the growing market asymmetry.|$|R
40|$|Aster tianmenshanensis G. J. Zhang & T. G. Gao, a {{new species}} of Asteraceae from {{southern}} China is described and illustrated based on evidence from morphology, micromorphology and molecular phylogeny. The new species is superficially similar to Aster salwinensis Onno in having rosettes of spatulate leaves and a solitary, terminal capitulum, but it differs by its glabrous leaf <b>margins,</b> <b>unequal</b> disc floret lobes and 1 -seriate pappus. The molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on nuclear sequences ITS, ETS and chloroplast sequence trnL-F, showed that the new species was nested within the genus Aster and formed a well supported clade with Aster verticillatus (Reinw.) Brouillet et al. The new species differs from the latter in having unbranched stems, much larger capitula, unequal disc floret lobes, beakless achenes and persistent pappus. In particular, A. tianmenshanensis has very short stigmatic lines, only ca. 0. 18 mm long and less than 1 / 3 {{of the length of}} sterile style tip appendages, remarkably different from its congeners. This type of stigmatic line, as far as we know, has not been found in any other species of Aster. The very short stigmatic lines plus the unequal disc floret lobes imply that the new species may have a very specialized pollination system, which may be a consequence of habitat specialization. The new species grows only on the limestone cliffs of Mt. Tianmen, Hunan Province, at the elevation of 1400 m. It could only be accessed when a plank walkway was built across the cliffs for tourists. As it is known only from an area estimated at less than 10 km 2 and a walkway passes through this location, its habitat could be easily disturbed. This species should best be treated as Critically Endangered based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Categories and Criteria B 2 a...|$|R
