5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid</b> can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
25|$|Trichiasis in dogs is {{hair from}} the eyelid growing in the wrong {{direction}} and rubbing on the eye, causing irritation. It usually occurs at the lateral <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid,</b> especially in the English Cocker Spaniel.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of {{laetrile}} treatment are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. These symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, cherry red skin color, liver damage, abnormally low blood pressure, droopy <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid,</b> trouble walking due to damaged nerves, fever, mental confusion, coma, and death.|$|E

25|$|Horner's syndrome* {{results from}} {{damage to the}} {{sympathetic}} innervation of the eye. Signs include enophthalmos (sunken eye), miosis (small pupil), elevated third eyelid, and ptosis (drooping of the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid).</b> Usually the syndrome in dogs is idiopathic, {{but it can also}} be caused by trauma, tumors, or ear infections.|$|E
25|$|Fragments of mummy wrappings and cartonnage, {{as well as}} {{scattered}} {{pieces of}} human remains were discovered {{on the east side}} of the burial chamber of the pyramid. The remains amounted to a left hand, a left clavicle still covered with skin, fragments of skin likely from the forehead, <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid</b> and the left foot and a few bones.|$|E
25|$|The newest {{model is}} the {{multipurpose}} conical orbital implant, {{which was designed to}} address the issues of the postoperative anophthalmic orbit being at risk for the development of socket abnormalities including enophthalmos, retraction of the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid,</b> deepening of the superior sulcus, backward tilt of the prothesis, and stretching of the lower eyelid.1 after evisceration or enucleation, These problems are generally thought to be secondary to orbital volume deficiencies which is also addressed by MCOIs.|$|E
50|$|The holotype, a gravid female, {{measured}} 13 mm in snout-vent length. The <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> carry horn-like, elongate tubercles. The toes {{are approximately}} ⅓ webbied; the unwebbed portions bear lateral fringes.|$|R
5000|$|Megophrys montana is a {{relatively}} large frog: males can reach 92 mm in snout-vent length and females 111 mm. As their common name suggests, these frogs have [...] "horns": their <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> have horn-like elongations.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's an appointment?' inquired his friend, a town young man, with a Tussaud {{complexion}} and well-pencilled brows {{half way}} up his forehead, {{so that his}} <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> appeared to possess the uncommon quality of tallness.|$|R
25|$|Goblet {{cells are}} found {{scattered}} among the epithelial lining of organs, {{such as the}} intestinal and respiratory tracts. They are found inside the trachea, bronchi, and larger bronchioles in the respiratory tract, small intestines, the large intestine, and conjunctiva in the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid.</b> In the conjunctiva goblet cells {{are a source of}} mucin in tears and they also secrete different types of mucins onto the ocular surface. In the lacrimal glands, mucus is synthesized by acinar cells instead.|$|E
25|$|The eyelids {{of a bird}} are {{not used}} in blinking. Instead the eye is {{lubricated}} by the nictitating membrane, a third concealed eyelid that sweeps horizontally across the eye like a windscreen wiper. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds when they are under water. When sleeping, the lower eyelid rises to cover the eye in most birds, {{with the exception of}} the horned owls where the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid</b> is mobile.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with in turning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), hypotonia, ptosis (drooping of the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid),</b> microcephaly (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} some {{empirical studies}} aimed at singling out {{the meanings of}} specific items of gaze and {{of some of their}} parameters. It argues that the values on some parameters of gaze items are not comparable to phonemes in a verbal language, but rather to morphemes, since by themselves they convey some specific meanings. The different positions of the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>eyelids</b> are combined and the meanings conveyed by their possible values are investigated. It is found that wide open <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> and raised lower eyelids convey activation and effort, while half open and half closed <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> convey de-activation and relaxation. These embodied morphemes, stemming from particular physical states, become part of the meanings of gaze items conveyed by the combination of these eyelid position...|$|R
50|$|Stellwag's sign {{is a sign}} of {{infrequent}} or incomplete blinking {{associated with}} exophthalmos or Graves orbitopathy. It is accompanied by Dalrymple's sign, which is a retraction of the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> resulting in an apparent widening of the palpebral opening.|$|R
25|$|The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular {{branches}} {{leave the}} skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory {{information from the}} scalp and forehead, the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid,</b> the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including {{the tip of the}} nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the meninges (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the lower eyelid and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the external ear and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve carries touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry taste sensation (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branches—the lingual nerve—carries sensation from the tongue.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{tracking}} device {{is a tool}} created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of electromagnetic energy was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare {{was the first to}} use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid.</b> The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying membrane and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually. In 1889, Edmund B. Delabarre invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a rotating drum by means of a stylus with a direct mechanical connection to the cornea. Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of the eyes were developed and used {{from the end of the}} 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and eye caps.|$|E
25|$|The {{red-headed}} krait is {{an extremely}} venomous snake, although bites are reported rarely. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their own. When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles {{are the first to}} suffer: the muscle that elevates the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid</b> and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may have a real struggle to keep his or her eyelids open. This medical condition is known as bilateral ptosis and it is a classic, tell-tale sign of severe envenomation. Other common symptoms include diplopia, dysphagia, vomiting, headache, and hypersalivation. Sometime later the symptoms of paralysis tend to worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing. Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed κ-flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of antivenin or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the chemical messenger carrying signals from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular synapse.|$|E
50|$|Floppy eyelid {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} whose most prominent features often include floppy <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> {{that can be easily}} everted, as well as papillary conjunctivitis. It is often associated with patients with high body mass index and obstructive sleep apnea.|$|R
50|$|It is {{brownish}} {{with two}} yellowish stripes on its back. These stripes, which begin on the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids,</b> may diverge or converge, {{resulting in a}} pattern resembling a lyre or an hourglass. Some specimens may be very dark, with less distinct markings.|$|R
5000|$|The holotype, {{an adult}} male, {{measured}} 55 mm in snout-vent length. The <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> bear characteristic [...] "horns", triangular fleshy appendages. Also the heels have well-developed dermal appendages. Body is somewhat elongate. Skin of upper {{parts of the}} body is coarse and glandular.|$|R
500|$|The {{condition}} {{known as}} split eyelid is a congenital defect common to several polycerate British breeds, and is genetically {{linked to the}} multi-horned trait. In mild cases, the eyelid shows a [...] "peak" [...] but does not impair vision or cause discomfort. Extreme cases (Grade 3 or higher) result in a complete separation of the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid</b> in the middle.|$|E
500|$|The fins {{are small}} and very thin. The {{pectoral}} fins are rounded and lobe-like. The two dorsal fins are positioned about between the pectoral and pelvic fins. Each dorsal fin bears a slightly grooved spine in front; the second dorsal spine is longer than the first. The anal fin is absent, and the caudal peduncle lacks keels or notches. The upper lobe of the caudal fin {{is larger than the}} lower and has a notch in the trailing margin. The skin, excluding on the fins, is densely covered with irregularly arranged, nonoverlapping dermal denticles. Each denticle has a swollen rhombic shape with 10–40 facets on the crown. The viper dogfish is black with distinct darker markings on the underside. These markings contain large numbers of tiny light-producing photophores; more photophores are found sparsely scattered over the rest of the body, as well as in a translucent patch on the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid.</b> The fins are translucent, and the tip of the caudal fin upper lobe is blackish. The largest known male is [...] long and weighs , and the largest female is [...] long and weighs [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{prominent}} {{facial features}} include the [...] long black tufts on the ears, two black stripes from the forehead to the nose, the black {{outline of the}} mouth, the distinctive black facial markings, and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth. The eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid,</b> probably an adaptation to shield the eyes from the sun's glare. The ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages. The coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, though black caracals are also known. The underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter, often with small reddish markings. The fur, soft, short and dense, grows coarser in the summer. The ground hairs (the basal layer of hair covering the coat) are denser in winter than in summer. The length of the guard hairs (the hair extending above the ground hairs) can be up to [...] long in winter, but shorten to [...] in summer. These features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season, typically in October and November. The hindlegs are longer than the forelegs, so that the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump.|$|E
5000|$|Persistent edema of rosacea (also {{known as}} [...] "Chronic upper facial {{erythematous}} edema," [...] "Morbihan's disease," [...] or [...] "Rosaceous lymphedema") is a hard, nonpitting edema {{found on the}} areas involved, those mainly being the forehead, glabella, <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids,</b> nose, and/or cheeks.|$|R
50|$|Blepharitis is dryness and itching on the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids.</b> This {{condition}} is often seeing {{in young people}} {{and can lead to}} reddish dry eye and scaly eyebrows. To relieve the itching sensation, one may need to apply warm compresses and use topical corticosteroid creams.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVETo {{assess whether}} a suture {{technique}} in upper blepharoplasty {{may be the}} cause of differences in the occurrence of suture abscess formation and focal inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODSA Level I, randomized controlled trial. The upper blepharoplasty wound was closed with a running intradermal suture. External intradermal suturing implied that this suture was started by initially passing it through the intact skin adjacent to the wound. In contrast, internal intradermal suturing meant the intradermal suture was not started in the adjacent skin but simply within the wound itself. One week and 6 weeks after surgery, the presence of suture abscesses and focal inflammation was assessed at the entrance and exit of the sutures. RESULTSAfter 1 week, 12 abscesses (40. 0 %) were found at the medial side of the externally sutured <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> and 4 abscesses (13. 3 %) in the internally sutured <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> (p =. 02). The presence of erythema and edema after 1 week was also significantly lower in internally sutured <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> (p =. 02). CONCLUSIONIn this series, the method of starting the suture (internal vs external) at the medial side of an upper blepharoplasty wound was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of medial wound inflammation and suture abscess formation at a 1 -week follow-up...|$|R

2500|$|A {{few hours}} after birth, he {{suffered}} a seizure, and then doctors found blood between his brain and scalp. Twice {{in the first two}} days of his life, a priest was called to give the last rites. Between the ages of three until about 11, Spencer underwent a series of operations by eye surgeon Fred Hollows. The deadening of the eyelid muscle led to permanent ptosis (drooping of the <b>upper</b> <b>eyelid)</b> and noticeable facial asymmetry. He later received a transplant from a donor (who had been in a motorcycle accident) in an operation, allowing him to [...] "open" [...] that eye.|$|E
40|$|Signs of {{an aging}} face {{beginning}} at the periorbital region are easily noticeable and may require surgical correction. The hanging of <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids,</b> tired look, and sunken <b>upper</b> <b>eyelids</b> are common symptoms and signs. Most of the described techniques of blepharoplasty for the aging emphasize on the excision of the hanging eyelid skin which will leave patients with long scar. However, eyebrow and eyelid ptosis are common among aging people. Therefore, undertaking only an upper blepharoplasty does not necessarily yield good aesthetic results. This paper describes a modified blepharoplasty technique with limited incision. The operation also includes eyebrow reposition and/or correction of eyelid ptosis that further improve results. An asymmetry of the frontalis muscle could cause asymmetry in the eyelid folds post-operatively. However, botulinum toxin injection may correct this problem...|$|R
