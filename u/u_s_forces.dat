Phase III was a major upgrade which significantly enhanced the computer hardware and software for most components of the system, a new CWAR the AN/MPQ-62, added single-scan target detection capability, and upgraded the HPI to AN/MPQ-61 standard by addition of a Low-Altitude Simultaneous Hawk Engagement (LASHE) system. LASHE allows the Hawk system to counter saturation attacks by simultaneously intercepting multiple low-level targets. The ROR was phased out in Phase III Hawk units.|$|E

In 1944, Japanese cavalry brigades had not yet been in combat against <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>forces,</b> it was not certain whether this old-fashioned gun with unmodified box trails and hydrospring recoil remained in general use or if it had been superseded by a more modern weapon.

Relations between American Immigrants and Native Americans were generally peaceful. In the case of the Santa Fe Trail, this was due to the friendly relationship of the Bents of Bent's Fort with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, {{and in the case of}} the Oregon Trail, to the peace established by the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Signed in 1851 between the United States and the plains Indians and the Indians of the northern Rocky Mountains, the treaty allowed passage by immigrants and the building of roads and the stationing of troops along the Oregon Trail.|$|E

He was appointed assistant provost marshal of that city, and subsequently assistant adjutant general of the district of Appomattox. He was mustered out of the service at Richmond on 13 June 1865, having received highly commendatory letters from the generals on whose staff he had served.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, another scholar at al-Hikma University, Mrs. Margaret Makiya, {{received}} a small {{grant from the}} Gulbenkian Foundation to transcribe the Svoboda diaries. During this period and later, she transcribed 31 of the diaries held in the Sarkis library and planned to transcribe them all eventually. In 1985, Professor Henry Svoboda, head of the Architectural Consultancies of Iraq and a descendant of Anton Svoboda, conceived a project to use a few poor photocopies of the diaries and the Makiya transcriptions for writing {{a family history of}} 19thcentury Iraq. In this project he solicited the assistance of one of his staff, the architect Nowf Allawi, who was fluent in French, English, and Arabic. The work proceeded slowly for twenty years and came nearly to an end with the sudden illness and tragic death of Professor Svoboda in 2005. Subsequently, Ms. Allawi decided to keep the project going in honor of her mentor and friend. However, the events of 9/11/2001 and the following invasion of Iraq by <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>forces</b> made research in Baghdad impossible, at which point, in 2006, Ms. Allawi, who was seeking the assistance of an academic community, made contact with Prof. Walter G.

Alfred Torbert's two divisions of charged down the Valley Pike shattering Early's left flank and getting behind his infantry. Early counterattacked with Brig. General Gabriel Wharton's two brigades of infantry, temporarily halting the horsemen. The division of Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt regrouped and crushed the entrenched Confederate left while Crook's infantry hit Wharton and Gordon head on driving {{them back to}} the Smithfield Redoubt where they made another brief stand. At the same time, the division of Brig. Gen. William W.

Averell continued his attack routing Confederate cavalry who attempted to rally at Star Fort and then pressing on toward Winchester. Col. Thomas Munford's Confederate brigade drove Averell's advance back on Fort Hill, buying enough time to allow thousands of Early's troops to avoid entrapment and capture before Colonel James Schoonmacher's brigade secured the heights. The Confederate army was in full retreat, [...] "whirling through Winchester."
