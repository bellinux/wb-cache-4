The production crew had intended for the engine room scene where Michael goes to detonate the bomb and sees Libby to be shot in the freighter's engine room; instead, they built a new engine room set based on that inside the freighter. It was [...] "so stifling hot" [...] at around [...] and the crew found that [...] "to get air conditioning down here … was an impossible task", according to the Kahanas real life chief engineer Bob Bower.

2500|$|The {{fire started}} just seconds into the band's opening song, their 1991 Billboard Mainstream Rock hit [...] "Desert Moon", when {{pyrotechnics}} {{set off by}} tour manager Daniel Biechele ignited flammable acoustic foam {{on both sides and}} the top centre of the drummer's alcove {{at the back of the}} stage. The pyrotechnics were gerbs, cylindrical devices that produce a controlled spray of sparks. Biechele used three gerbs set to spray sparks [...] for 15 seconds. Two gerbs were at 45-degree angles, with the middle one pointing straight up. The flanking gerbs became the principal cause of the fire. The foam was installed in two layers, with highly flammable <b>urethane</b> <b>foam</b> above polyethylene foam, the latter being difficult to ignite but releasing much more heat once ignited by the less dense urethane. Burning polyurethane foam instantly develops opaque, aggressive, dark smoke along with deadly carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide gas when burning. Inhaling this smoke only 2-3 times would cause rapid loss of consciousness and eventually, death by internal suffocation.|$|E

Dissolved air is essential to foam forma-tion, and cell size is regulated by "cavitation" (extraction of dissolved gases). Greater cavi-tation gives faster nucleation and finer cells. Cavitation, controlled by outlet orifice diame-ter in the high pressure/low shear mixing head and by rotor speed in the low pressure/ high shear head, does not occur in the low pressure/intermediate shear head so air must be added. Additional factors influencing cell size are the presence of fluorocarbons or finely di-vided solids. Constant surfactant concentra-tion is important for foam stability...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{alternative}} chlorofluorocarbons, CFC- 123 and CFC- 141 b, {{have been}} proposed as substitute blowing agents for CFC- 11 in rigid <b>urethane</b> <b>foams.</b> Both of these have similar boiling points to CFC- 11 but substantially reduced ozone depletion potentials. Mobay Corporation has evaluated both of these {{in a variety of}} systems to determine their potential use as blowing agents for rigid <b>urethane</b> <b>foams</b> in appliance applications. Due to the different molecular weights compared to CFC- 11, there is theoretically 11 weight percent more CFC and 15 weight percent less CFC- 141 b required in foam formulation to obtain equivalent gas volumes. Using the same gas volumes as CFC- 11, CFC- 123 and CFC- 141 b gave poorer flowability resulting in higher foam densi-ties. With CFC- 123, depending on the formulation, the nature of the isocyanate, the chemical structure and on the technique of foam preparation, there was a remarkable difference in densities and physical properties. The highest densities and the poorest physical properties were found in PMDI polyurethane foams because of a plasticiz-ing effect of the CFC- 123 in the polymer. However, in TDI polyurethane foams, densities and properties were more comparable to foams with CFC- 11. CFC- 123 also showed good performance in rigid polyisocyanurate foams. In all systems, CFC- 141 b was closer to CFC- 11 m overall properties. Both alternatives produced as theoretically expected, higher k-factor foams than CFC- 11. In corresponding foam systems, we measured up to 15 percent higher ther-mal conductivities. The k-value retention of foams made with CFC- 123 and CFC- 141 b appeared to be similar to CFC- 11...|$|R

40|$|Closed cell {{polyurethane}} and, particularly, polyisocyanurate foams are a {{large family}} of flexible and rigid products {{the result of a}} reactive two part process wherein a urethane based polyol is combined with a foaming or "blowing" agent to create a cellular solid at room temperature.

40|$|A {{recent study}} {{estimates}} that, by 2025, over 15 % {{of the three}} trillion dollar global chemical sales will be derived from bio-derived sources. Many of these bioproducts would be manufactured in bio-refineries by the deployment of rapidly emerging industrial biotechnology. It is expected that bio-derived chemicals will come from three sources: direct production using conventional thermochemical and catalytic process, biorefining, and expression in plants. Direct production is already a reality, {{as evidenced by the}} production of propane diol and polylactic acid from corn-derived glucose and others. There has been recent commercialization of bio-derived plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride, polyester resins for coatings and inks, biopolyols for <b>urethane</b> <b>foams</b> and others based on vegetable oil and carbohydrate renewable sources. Chemical biorefineries, on the other hand, based on various platforms such as carbohydrate/ cellulose, oil, and glycerin, a co-product of biodiesel production, and algae are in the pilot stage.
