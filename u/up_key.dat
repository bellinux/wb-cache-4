25|$|Haydar's staunch {{refusal to}} partake in any coup {{reinforced}} his loyalty in Hafez's eyes. Haydar later confronted Rifaat in March 1984, when Rifaat attempted his coup. The Defense Companies under Rifaat's command began setting up checkpoints and roadblocks in Damascus, began to forcibly occupy State buildings, Police Stations, began to disarm the Police, and {{even tried to}} infiltrate his forces into the Defence Ministry HQ. Haydar deployed his Special Forces against the Defense Companies of Rifaat {{on the streets of}} Damascus, using his Anti-Tank platoons to directly challenge Rifaat's T-72 Tank units which were threatening government buildings. Haydar also ordered his sniper platoons which were deployed by parachute or from helicopters, to take <b>up</b> <b>key</b> positions near the residences of known Defense Company commanders in order to psychologically terrorize them. Sniper units also tactically besieged the Mezzeh Airbase and some other vital Defense Company bases and installations. Potential civil war was only averted through the action of Hafez, who intervened and placated Rifaat by making him Vice President, before sending him off into exile.|$|E
500|$|On 12April, {{opposition}} leaders appear on private television, where they disclose their plan to unseat Chávez. Carmona is {{sworn in as}} president while images play of unrest on the streets. Defying media censorship, Chávez's supporters disseminate the story {{that the president did}} not resign. On 13April, they gather to protest outside Miraflores, while palace guards plot to retake the building. The guards take <b>up</b> <b>key</b> positions and, at a prearranged signal, take members of the new government prisoner. The state television channel is relaunched and urges the army to back Chávez. [...] "Full military control" [...] is returned to the Chávez administration and the president arrives at the palace amid celebratory scenes. Chávez makes an address in which he says it is fine to oppose him, but not the Constitution of Venezuela. The closing titles say Carmona fled to Miami while under house arrest, and that Ortega went into hiding, only reappearing to help lead the opposition after Chávez said there would be no repercussions. Most of the dissident generals, after being expelled from the army, fled to the US. Others remained as part of the opposition.|$|E

The comic was {{published}} on January 28, 2014, and sees David set <b>up</b> <b>key</b> themes for Captain America: The Winter Soldier: [...] "Black Widow and Rumlow...They're okay with doing what they're told. Cap, however, is way more suspicious and wants a clearer idea of what's going on, and is annoyed that S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't big on being forthcoming." [...] On Cap's relationships with new partners Black Widow and Brock Rumlow, [...] "I think {{he sees her}} as a valued ally, but [...] tends to be suspicious of the outfit that she works for. He trusts her as someone to have his back in a fight, but I think also believes that if S.H.I.E.L.D. told her to put a knife in his back, she would do so without hesitation, {{and that can be}} problematic. Rumlow, meantime, is an eager partner, but Cap doesn't trust him at all. First, there's the suspicion aspect. And second, I think Cap is still gun-shy because {{the last time he had}} a partner. Bucky wound up dying—or at least so he believes—and he's not anxious for history to repeat itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Qizilbash had {{provided}} {{the backbone of}} the Safavid army {{from the very beginning of}} Safavid rule and they also occupied many posts in the government. As a result, effective power in the state in the early days of the dynasty was held by the Qizilbash, leaving the shah often powerless. To counterbalance their power and as a decisive answer to this problem, Abbas turned to the newly introduced members of Iranian society (an initiative put in place by Shah Tahmasp I) the ghulams (a word literally meaning [...] "slaves"). From these newly introduced slaves, the Shah created a gunpowder force, reaching numbers up to 37,000 soldiers, completely funded by the Crown. This weakened the power that the Qizilbash had against the crown significantly as they no longer had a [...] "military monopoly" [...] in Persia. Like the janissaries of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire, these ghulams were mainly Georgians, Circassians and Armenians who had been brought into Iran en masse (by conquest and slave trade), had converted or had been converted to Islam, and had taken up service in the army, royal household or the civil administration, and were loyal only to the shah. Under Abbas' leadership this new grouping in Iranian society (also called the third force) grew in influence and power, with many thousands of ethnic Georgians, Circassians and Armenians becoming an integral part of Iranian society and taking <b>up</b> <b>key</b> government, royal household and military positions.|$|E
2500|$|Land {{clearing}} operations {{had been}} undertaken by 1st Field Squadron since {{the occupation of}} Nui Dat to improve base defences and observation. Later they were extended for tactical purposes to open <b>up</b> <b>key</b> routes within Phuoc Tuy by removing vegetation to deny cover and concealment to the Viet Cong, and also provided arable land for villagers {{as part of the}} Pacification program. In March 1968, a dedicated Land Clearing Team was formed by 17th Construction Squadron elements at Nui Dat to supplement existing arrangements. One particular operation, codenamed [...] "Cooktown Orchid" [...] conducted in April 1968, saw a large element of Plant Troop deploy under infantry and armoured protection to clear undergrowth and trees {{in the foothills of the}} Long Hai mountains. Land clearance operations proved quite dangerous for the plant operators who were exposed to land mines and booby traps, as well as to attack by small arms and other direct fire weapons. During this operation one D8 bulldozer was destroyed, and a sapper injured when an RPG round hit the dozer he was operating. In 1969 the squadron continued with land clearing tasks within the 1 ATF area of operations. During the operation, numerous bunker systems were uncovered and the D8 dozers detonated many mines. In August 1969, 9 Troop assisted in replacing a sabotaged bridge with a [...] floating pontoon bridge. The enemy had blown the bridge on National Route 51, [...] south-east of Saigon. The troop, working with the US Engineers, took only 13 hours to re-open the road.|$|E

When she was young, her desire to become the Grand Princess led her to be swayed by Dyspear into the Forest of Despair, where she had her {{memories}} removed and became known as Dyspear's daughter, Twilight. This in turn led to Hope Kingdom falling into despair, allowing Dyspear to revive. Serving as Dys Dark's second-in-command, Twilight was a merciless and cold-hearted girl who used black Dress <b>Up</b> <b>Keys</b> to power <b>up</b> the other generals, allowing them to summon more powerful Zetsuborgs, and often regarded the Cures as [...] "fake princesses".

However, thanks to both the Cures' powers and Kanata's music, she is purified {{and returned to her}} original form as Towa. Towa later becomes the fourth Princess Pretty Cure, Cure Scarlet. In the epilogue, she became the current queen, succeeding her mother. Her Dress <b>Up</b> <b>Keys</b> are Scarlet, Hanabi (Fireworks), Phoenix, Sun and Pumpkin.|$|R
