The {{aim of this}} method is to minimize the error probability of discrimination by constructing the <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> model when the data of <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> is lack. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is introduced to model the statistical characteristics of target’ HRRPs. The unknown-target model, which describes statistical distribution of unknown-target’ HRRPs, is proposed. The statistics of <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> can be computed approximately via finite known-target models in training database. The experimental results for measured data show that the discrimination rate of proposed method is about 88 %, which is {{higher than that of}} discrimination method without unknown-target model...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of target {{recognition}} in sensor networks, the requirement of adding intelligence largely corresponds to the capability of recognizing <b>unknown</b> <b>targets,</b> i. e., targets without any a priori information, and of modifying the knowledge base dynamically to incorporate the newly discovered knowledge. In this paper, a collaborative <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> recognition algorithm is presented. The algorithm involves four enabling components, training set preprocessing, local node classification, collaborative classification based on local results derived from multiple sensors, and dynamic update of the training set when new target classes are discovered. At each local node, the probability of {{the hypothesis that the}} target belongs to an <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> class is calculated using an entropy-based metric. Then Dempster’s rule of combination is applied to combine the estimation results from multiple sensors of the same cluster formed based on geographical closeness and a confidence is derived. If the fused confidence is above a predefined threshold, which means there is not enough knowledge available to decide the target class, it is then considered to be an <b>unknown</b> <b>target.</b> We apply the above <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> recognition algorithm on a data set collected from a field demo that uses both the acoustic and seismic signals for target classification. The experimental results show that by using our approach, about ¢¤£¦ ¥ <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> samples can be recognized correctly, {{while at the same time}} the known target classification accuracy stays above §¦¨¤ ¥...|$|R

The algorithm outlined here {{is similar to}} the work of [15, 16] but the target state is augmented by the target length ℓ and does not include the <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> power. The reason is that the <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> power is a variable based on the point target assumption in [15, 16].

40|$|In {{order to}} {{correctly}} identify a remote target, an efficient and robust target signature identification technique is required. Radar target identification based on complex natural resonances (CNRs) has drawn {{the interest of}} many researchers following {{the development of the}} singularity expansion method (SEM). As evident from the literature, statistical techniques such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) have produced a better identification result, in the presence of noise, compared to some other SEM-based identification methods such as the extinction pulse (E-pulse) technique. However, one of the issues related to a resonance based target classifier is that it requires the commencement of the late time period for the <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> response to be determined accurately in order to avoid false alarms during target classification process. For automatic target recognition (ATR) applications, usually such information is not known a priori. In view of this problem, a modified GLRT technique that utilizes time-frequency analysis is presented in this paper. The improved GLRT method does not require prior knowledge of the beginning of the late time period for the transient response of the <b>unknown</b> <b>target.</b> Simulation results using various targets show that our method is comparable to the original GLRT technique when the commencement of the late time period for the <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> response is correctly determined and outperforming the original GLRT technique when the commencement of the late time period for the <b>unknown</b> <b>target</b> response is incorrectly determined...|$|R

In this paper, we identify the mathematical structure of single- and multi-frequency subspace migration without any geometric consideration of <b>unknown</b> <b>targets</b> and explore its certain properties.

30|$|Automated target {{tracking}} and recognition (ATR) {{is an important}} capability in many military and civilian applications. In this work, we mainly focus on tracking and recognition techniques for infrared (IR) imagery, which is a preferred imaging modality for most military applications. A major challenge in vision-based ATR is {{how to cope with}} the variations of target appearances due to different viewpoints and underlying 3 D structures. Both factors, identity in particular, are usually represented by discrete variables in practical existing ATR algorithms [1 – 3]. In this paper we will account for both factors in a continuous manner by using view and identity manifolds. Coupling the two manifolds for target representation facilitates the ATR process by allowing us to meaningfully synthesize new target appearances to deal with previously <b>unknown</b> <b>targets</b> as well as both known and <b>unknown</b> <b>targets</b> under previously unseen viewpoints.|$|R

This study examines how hypertext links between organizations on the World Wide Web influence this process. A hypertext link between a trusted organization and an unknown organization has been shown to increase the extent to which consumers perceive that there is a relationship between the two organizations. Perceptions regarding the relationship between organizations have been shown to influence trust in the unknown organization. In the current study, these past findings are extended by examining how the type of link (an advertising link versus a link sent to a partner) and the direction of the link (from a trusted organization to an unknown organization or vice versa) influence the trust transfer process...|$|R

We address this question by providing experimental evidence that actionable, useful information can indeed be obtained {{in a manner that}} preserves the privacy of innocent parties and that holds government agencies accountable. In particular, we present practical, privacy-preserving protocols for two operations that law-enforcement and intelligence agencies have used effectively: set intersection and contact chaining. Experiments with our protocols suggest that privacy-preserving contact chaining can perform a 3 -hop privacy-preserving graph traversal producing 27, 000 ciphertexts in under two minutes. These ciphertexts are usable in turn via privacy-preserving set intersection to pinpoint potential <b>unknown</b> <b>targets</b> within a body of 150, 000 total ciphertexts within 10 minutes, without exposing personal information about non-targets.
