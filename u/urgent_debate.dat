40|$|This {{companion}} {{volume to}} Burman's Deconstructing Developmental Psychology {{helps us to}} explain why questions around children and childhood - their safety, their sexuality, their interests and abilities, their violence - have so preoccupied the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In this increasingly post-industrial, post-colonial and multicultural world, this book identifies analytical and practical strategies for improving how we think about and work with children. Drawing in particular on feminist and postdevelopment literatures, the book illustrates how and why reconceptualising our notions of individual and human development, including those informing models of children's rights and interests, will foster more just and equitable forms of professional practice with children and their families. The book brings together completely new, previously unpublished material alongside revised and updated papers to present a cutting-edge and integrated perspective to the field.

40|$|The German and Austrian {{origins of}} some of India’s leading art historians from the 1930 s to the 1960 s is an understudied {{dimension}} of art historiography that questions the knowledge hierarchies of the British Empire {{and the role of}} foreigners in Indian nation building. The article focuses on three figures who held key positions in the Indian art world (Ernst Cohn-Wiener, Hermann Goetz and Rudolf von Leyden) and argues that such German-speaking exiles played a determining role in <b>urgent</b> <b>debates</b> of the time. Participating in the circulation of foreign art and ideas in India, especially in Bombay and Baroda, they significantly impacted on the selective process of the history of art. Far from propagating an esoteric, Hindu-centred perspective on Indian art, as did many Indian nationalist art historians, émigrés championed an inclusive take on art by integrating its Muslim as well as Hindu heritage. In addition they helped launch some of India’s most innovative artists. The article thus opens up broader discussions on art and nationalism, the building of a canon and the appropriation of modernism before and after Indian independence...|$|R

Prior to seawall closure in April 2006, Saemangeum was considered to be the single most important shorebird site in the Yellow Sea (Barter, 2002). The SSMP documented (following seawall closure) very major declines of several species of shorebirds within the Saemangeum reclamation area and adjacent wetlands (Moores et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2006; Moores et al., 2007), and through further coordinated survey effort (e.g. the 2008 Birds Korea National Shorebird Survey), declines of species such as spoon-billed sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus (critically endangered) and great knot Calidris tenuirostris at the national level too. SSMP and other shorebird data gathered in 2008 is to be published in time for the Tenth Conference of the Parties of the Ramsar Convention (to be held in Changwon City, South Korea, between October 28 and November 4, 2008), to inform and influence the increasingly <b>urgent</b> <b>debate</b> on the need to better conserve the intertidal habitats and biodiversity of the Yellow Sea.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} a practical exposition {{of some of}} the most <b>urgent</b> <b>debates</b> in contemporary art history. Focussing on deconstruction, formalism, and cultural theory as critical methodologies within the theory of art, it examines a range of cultural expressions and contemporary currents of thought relative to the problem of vision and visuality. As a terrain of enquiry whose key words emerge in this account as representation, reception, and identity politics, vision and visuality (here called visualism) in the literature refers to four things: a critical standpoint, a rejection or retreat from authority, a symbol or iconology, visibility as alterity. Thus from the perspective of new enquiries visualism emerges as a key category of postmodern analysis. As a discourse, it shapes the contingencies that, in this assessment would productively reformulate the relationship of theory with current visual art practices. The problem of the visual is at the same time the problem of a split between art and cultural theory, also between art production and the theory of art. Hence it can be productively reformulated as a model for performing or negotiating a form of disruptive linkage; this is what brings this study to a critical sense of the potentialities of thinking beyond postmodern representation as a strategic counterproduction. The work, then, articulates several implicated connections. For example, the linguistic and graphic elements at work in the interpretation of visual texts; the materiality of art-objects and the situatedness of experience that co-determine artistic production and the reception of meaning; a sense of process that renders theory as contingency, i. e. as indeterminate, mythical, and continually in flux. The work advances by thinking the conjunctions between individual art theorists (Jacques Derrida, Michael Fried, and Svetlana Alpers) and representative Canadian artists: Geneviève Cadieux, Attila Richard Lukacs, and Robert Houle. Since this dissertation expresses a series of possibilities beyond conventional aesthetic and discursive reductions, a process, a theory, and a method, its best description is as a conduit for new alignments, meanings, conditions, and effect...|$|R
40|$|Anticipation is {{increasingly}} central to <b>urgent</b> contemporary <b>debates,</b> from climate {{change to the}} global economic crisis. Anticipatory practices {{are coming to the}} forefront of political, organizational, and citizens’ society. Research into anticipation, however, has not kept pace with public demand for insights into anticipatory practices, their risks and uses. Where research exists, it is deeply fragmented. This paper seeks to identify how anticipation is defined and understood in the literature and to explore the role of anticipatory practice to address individual, social, and global challenges. We use a resilience lens to examine these questions. We illustrate how varying forms of anticipatory governance are enhanced by multi-scale regional networks and technologies and by the agency of individuals, drawing from an empirical case study on regional water governance of Mälaren, Sweden. Finally, we discuss how an anticipatory approach can inform adaptive institutions, decision making, strategy formation, and societal resilience...|$|R
40|$|Labor and Global Justice: Essays on the Ethics of Labor Practices under Globalization {{combines}} {{conceptual and}} theoretical perspectives across {{a multiplicity of}} relevant differences, both geographical and disciplinary, to develop a transnational perspective on labor and justice.

In this work the reuse is discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} those who construct and use hypermedia as teaching aids, that is, as courseware. The case of the reuse of courseware highlights how the discussion regarding only technological aspects is limited. Indeed, in new software applications new dimensions of the problem are emerging which make the question of reuse more complex and multifaceted. As regards to the technical dimension, typical of traditional software development projects, two new dimensions take a central stage in the case of courseware, a rhetorical dimension and an aesthetic dimension of the problem. These dimensions suggest that the concept of the software product and as a consequence its design needs to be rethought.
