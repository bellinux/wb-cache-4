50|$|SRiMech - Many robots are {{incapable}} of running inverted, due to their shape, weaponry, or both. A SRiMech (self-righting mechanism) is an Active Design element that returns an inverted robot to mobility in the <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> The SRiMech is typically an electric or pneumatic arm or extension on the upper surface of the robot which pushes against the arena floor to roll or flip the robot upright. Most flippers, some lifters, and even some carefully-designed axes can double as SRiMechs. Even a vertical spinning weapon {{may be used as}} a crude self-righting device. Team Nightmare's lightweight vertical spinner Backlash was designed such that when flipped it would hit the ground with the spinning disc and kick back upright. The first successful unaided use of a SRiMech in competition was at the 1997 U.S. Robot Wars when the immobilized Vlad the Impaler used a dedicated pneumatic device to pop back upright in a match against Biohazard.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advanced}} diabolo {{style is}} vertax (vertical axis; {{also known as}} [...] "Excalibur"). This is where the diabolo is [...] "turned vertically" [...] by means of [...] "whipping" [...] and is continually spun in this <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> The person spinning it needs to rotate their body {{to keep up with}} the constant whipping action due to the momentum and centripetal motion at which the diabolo spins. Although the number of tricks seems limited, people are finding more ways to perform with this style, including vertax genocides, infinite suicides, and many suns, orbits, and satellites. It is also possible to have two diabolos in one string in vertax, this feat has been achieved by diabolo duo Tr'espace and a small number of other diaboloists. It has also been done in the form of a fan. Most of these tricks are accomplished by street performers in competitions, notably the GEDC and the Taipei PEC. Some cutting-edge skilled vertax jugglers include William (Wei-Liang) Lin (in 2006, ranked #1 in the world), Ryo Yabe (multiple diabolos), Higami (a Japanese juggling group, noted for inventing the first 'infinite suicide vertax'), and Jonathan P. Chen (noted for inventing the vertax genocide); these jugglers are former and multiple winners of the above-mentioned cups. Eric and Antonin (France) and Nate and Jacob Sharpe (USA) have contributed greatly to the development of vertax passing techniques. Finally, Alexis Levillon invented many vertax tricks including vertax integrals, furthered multidiabolo vertax, and has also invented the [...] "Galexis" [...] style, where one diabolo is horizontal, while the other is in vertax.|$|E
40|$|Reasor et al. (2004) {{examined}} the tilting of a vortex by shear {{and found that}} a damping mechanism intrinsic to the dry adiabatic dynamics suppresses departures from an <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> This realignment occurs through projection of the tilt asymmetry onto two types of vortex Rossby waves: sheared vortex Rossby waves, in which the radial shear of the swirling flow axisymmetrizes tilt asymmetries, and a quasi-mode, or discrete, vortex Rossby wave that, {{in the absence of}} damping, causes precession of the upper vortex until it realigns with the lower one (thereafter undergoing repeated cycles of tilting and realignment). With damping, the vortex achieves a downshear-left equilibrium tilt.

40|$|A hybrid {{controller}} for swinging up rotary inverted pendulum is proposed in this paper. The controller composes of two parts. The first {{part is the}} PD position control to swing up the pendulum from its hanging position by moving the rotary arm clockwise and anticlockwise repeatedly until the pendulum swings up around the upright position. The second part is a Fuzzy Logic Controller which will be switched to balance and stabilize the pendulum at its <b>upright</b> position. <b>State</b> feed back control designed by LQR is also done for stabilization of the pendulum. The proposed intelligent {{hybrid controller}} is compared with the conventional controller; the effectiveness and reliability are shown by the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedA {{pendulum}} is statically unstable in its <b>upright</b> inverted <b>state</b> {{due to the}} Earth's gravitional attraction which points downward. However, {{with proper}} forcing, the pendulum can be stabilized in its <b>upright</b> inverted <b>state.</b> Special interest is on periodic vertical forcing applied to the pendulum's base to stabilize it around the upright inverted equilibrium. Many researchers have studied how to stabilize the system by varying various parameters, in particular its amplitude and frequency. Most {{have focused on the}} single degree of freedom inverted pendulum case, which with linear assumption can be described via Mathieu's equation. The system stability can then be characterized by Floquet theory. Our focus is on searching for the periodic solutions inside the linearly stable region of the pendulum's inverted state when the pendulum is under proper periodic forcing. Our research shows that under appropriate excitation by controlling the forcing amplitude and frequency, the pendulum can maintain certain periodic orbits around its inverted state which we characterize in a systematic way.; In this thesis, we applied four different kinds of geometric realizations of the system response: system time traces, system phase portraits, three dimensional views of the system phase portrait as a function of input forcing, and the system's power spectral density diagram. By analyzing these four diagrams simultaneously, we characterize different kinds of multi-frequency periodic behavior around the pendulum's inverted state. To further discuss the effect of the nonlinearity, we applied perturbation techniques using the normalized forcing amplitude as a perturbation parameter to carry out the approximate periodic solutions on a single degree of freedom inverted pendulum nonlinear model.; We also discuss the multiple degree of freedom inverted pendulum system. Both numerical simulation and experiments were performed and detailed comparisons are discussed. Our numerical simulations show close qualitative agreement with experiments...|$|R
30|$|Why {{might we}} see {{stronger}} evidence for holistic processing for inverted stimuli relative to upright stimuli? Given that the literature suggests {{we find the}} opposite, we have no clear account. However, besides the usual possibility of sampling error, we do note that experts encounter fingerprints in various orientations during casework. They usually immediately orient them upright and then {{spend a great deal}} of time looking at the upright version. However, most of the exposure to upright prints involves the engagement of more localized feature processing such as minutiae comparisons, which could be a more analytic process based on local features. However, inverted fingerprints usually involve the extra step of first orienting the print. The appearance of an inverted fingerprint might engage a more holistic process that is involved in deciding whether and how to orient the print to an <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> At this point, such an account must remain somewhat speculative as the literature does not offer a precedent for stronger holistic effects for inverted stimuli.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{learning}} method for implementing human-like sequential movements in robots. As {{an example of}} dynamic sequential movement, we consider the "stand-up" task for a two-joint, three-link robot. In contrast {{to the case of}} steady walking or standing, the desired trajectory for such a transient behavior is very difficult to derive. The goal of the task is to find a path that links a lying state to an <b>upright</b> <b>state</b> under the constraints of the system dynamics. The geometry of the robot is such that there is no static solution; the robot has to stand up dynamically utilizing the momentum of its body. We use reinforcement learning, in particular, a continuous time and state temporal difference (TD) learning method. For successful results, we use 1) an efficient method of value function approximation in a high-dimensional state space, and 2) a hierarchical architecture which divides a large state space into a few smaller pieces. 1 Introduction Recently, there have been [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The tilt of Saturn’s {{spin axis}} to its orbit plane is 26 N 7, while that of Jupiter is only 3 N 1. We offer an {{explanation}} for this puzzling difference owing to gravitational perturbations of Saturn by the planet Neptune. A similarity between the precession period of Saturn’s spin axis and the 1 : 87; 106 yr precession period of Neptune’s slightly inclined orbit plane implicates a resonant interaction between these planets as responsible for tilting Saturn from an initially more <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> We make a case that Saturn was captured into this resonance during {{the erosion of the}} Kuiper belt, which decreased the rate of regression of Neptune’s orbit plane. Penetrating the resonance pumped up Saturn’s obliquity to its current value. The spin axis may also be librating in the resonance with an amplitude k 31, and we discuss possible causes of this and the implied constraint on Saturn’s moment of inertia. Matching the current pole position to the predicted outcome could place constraints on early solar system processes...|$|E

The control laws are comparatively studied based on swing-up time from a given initial <b>state</b> to the <b>upright</b> position. The <b>State</b> Dependent Riccati Equation is found effective for designing the swing-up control law under saturating control input. The control law is extended to a linear combination of sine function of the angle and the angular velocity, and a variable structure control with a sliding mode given by the linear combination.

50|$|What is also {{important}} to note is that simply shaving the beard of the youth does not entirely signify their status of manhood. It also required the relinquishing of the Bulla necklace, which warded off evil spirits and ideologies, such as jealousy, and dedication of belongings to household gods. However, this action is more concerned with the Liberalia, a Ludi that can be easily confused with the Juvenalia, with the exception that this festival was held in March and had a definitive date for those coming of age. In the Liberalia, much unlike the Juvenalia, young men who had reached the age of sixteen would now (potentially) shave their beards, remove their Bulla and don the Toga Virilis, or <b>upright</b> toga, which <b>stated</b> their adulthood in society. During processions of this festival, priests and priestesses would adorn themselves with certain dried goods and carry delicacies throughout the streets in order to feast at an altar in celebration.|$|R
40|$|A new {{paradigm}} for the resiliency of tropical cyclone (TC) vortices in vertical shear flow is presented. To elucidate the basic dynamics, the authors follow previous work and consider initially barotropic vortices on an f plane. It {{is argued that}} the diabatically driven secondary circulation of the TC is not directly responsible for maintaining the vertical alignment of the vortex. Rather, an inviscid damping mechanism intrinsic to the dry adiabatic dynamics of the TC vortex suppresses departures from the <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> Recent work has demonstrated that tilted quasigeostrophic vortices consisting of a core of positive vorticity surrounded by a skirt of lesser positive vorticity align through projection of the tilt asymmetry onto vortex Rossby waves (VRWs) and their subsequent damping (VRW damping). This work is extended here to the finite Rossby number (Ro) regime characteristic of real TCs. It is shown that the VRW damping mechanism provides a direct means of reducing the tilt of intense cyclonic vortices (Ro. 1) in unidirectional vertical shear. Moreover, intense TC-like, but initially barotropic, vortices are shown {{to be much more}} resilient to vertical shearing than previously believed. For initially upright, observationally based TC-like vortices in vertical shear, the existence of a ‘‘downshear-left’ ’ tilt equilibrium is demonstrated when the VRW damping is nonnegligible. On the basis of these findings, the axisymmetric component of the diabatically driven secondary circulation is argued to contribute indirectly to vortex resiliency against shear by increasing Ro and enhancing the radial gradient of azimuthal-mean potential vorticity. This, in addition to the reduction of static stability in moist ascent regions, increases the efficiency of the VRW damping mechanism. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{reproduce}} {{an animal}} model of landmine blast injuries for studying its mechanism and characteristics. Methods　Fifteen healthy New Zealand white rabbits (body weight 1. 9 - 2. 4 kg) were prepared as experimental animals. Punctiform burster {{was used to}} simulate the landmine, and it was electrically detonated far away to produce landmine blast injuries on unilateral hind limb of rabbits in <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> The vital signs before and 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h and 12 h after injuries were recorded. Autopsy of dead animals was performed immediately and the survivors were sacrificed for pathological examination 6 h and 12 h after the injury. Macroscopic and microscopic changes in the injured limb and distant organs were observed. Fifteen random adult body weights were generated by random number table, and the explosive energy of M 14 landmine (about 29 g TNT explosive energy) was simulated, to compare the ratio of explosive force equivalent to weight calculated between experimental animals and randomly selected adults. Results　No significant {{change in blood pressure}} was observed at different time points before and after injuries. A broom-like change was found in the injured limb by the general observation. The subareas and pathological changes of injured limb coincided with the typical limb injuries produced by landmine explosion. Damage in different degrees was found in distant organs, and the wound characteristics and injury of major organs were in accordance with the reports of relevant literature. The ratio of explosive equivalent to weight of experimental animals (0. 50 ± 0. 04 g TNT/kg) was similar to that of randomly selected adults (0. 51 ± 0. 05 g TNT/kg). Conclusion　The present animal model could simulate the landmine explosive injuries, and may be used in research of landmine explosive injuries.

40|$|Objective To {{study the}} {{characteristics}} and mechanism of mine blast injury that wading in shoal of different depths through an animal model. Methods Ninety-six healthy adult New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2. 19 ± 0. 12 kg were randomly divided into land group (n= 16), limb wading group (n= 16, the water depth reaching {{up the middle}} of the thighs of rabbits), and chest wading group (n= 16, the water depth reaching up the thoracic xiphoid), stress test group (n= 30), fake injury group (n= 18). Punctiform burster was used to simulate landmine. Electric ignited the simulated mine away, causing landmine explosion injury to rabbits' one-sided hind limbs in <b>upright</b> <b>state.</b> High-speed photography was used to observe the movement of water accompanying the simulated mine explosion. Arterial blood serum markers of myocardial injury (CK-MB, cTnI) and nerve injury (MBP, NSE) were detected before injury, and 3, 6 and 12 h after injury, and echocardiography, electrocardiography, CT, DSA and other examinations were implemented at the same time. Survival animals were killed 12 h after injury for anatomy to record their injuries to the limbs and distant organs. The histopathological examination was done to define the injury characteristics further. Results Feet and distal tibia were broken, and closed femoral fractures and arterial damage were often found away from the stump in limb wading group. This type of injury was different from the mop-like tearing tissue in the land group. Chest, abdominal organs and the brain, spinal cord injury in wading group were more severe than those in land group. There were higher incidences of chest, abdominal organs and spinal cord injury in chest wading Group. Conclusion The energy transfer of underwater explosion is affected by water depth and limbs or trunk mutually, which is an important mechanism of the complex and serious injuries in the wading group. The wading depth is an important factor affecting severity of the injury. Based on characteristics and unique mechanism of wading explosion, emergency treatment and the principle of early treatment for injury warrant further explored.

40|$|Introduction: There are few data {{regarding}} {{the influence of}} normal life activity {{on the presence of}} gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in cystic fibrosis (CF). In the present study, the influence of body position and postprandial time on the incidence of GERD has been assessed. Material and methods: Ninety CF patients aged from 2 to 18 years were introduced into the study. In all children, esophageal 24 -hour pH monitoring was performed. Results: GERD was detected in 54 patients (60 %). In most patients, however, GERD was asymptomatic. The total number of reflux episodes per hour in the supine position was significantly lower than in the remaining time (p&#x 003 C; 0. 0001). Having excluded the 2 h-postprandial time, the difference was still statistically significant (p&#x 003 C; 0. 002). The total number of reflux episodes per hour in 1 h- and 2 h-postprandial time was significantly higher than in the upright position excluding the respective postprandial time (p&#x 003 C; 0. 0001). No statistically significant difference in the number of episodes lasting longer than five minutes per hour in the supine and in the <b>upright</b> position was <b>stated.</b> There were more episodes lasting longer than five minutes per hour in the postprandial time than in the upright position in the remaining time (1 h- and 2 h-postprandial time excluded &# 8211; p&#x 003 C; 0. 004 and p&#x 003 C; 0. 002, respectively). RI was higher in the upright than in supine position (p&#x 003 C; 0. 0001). However, after the exclusion of 2 h-postprandial time, no significant differences in RI were found. In conclusion, a high frequency of GERD in CF patients regardless of the presence/absence of typical clinical manifestation was documented. Reflux index was higher in postprandial time. In the supine position, there was a tendency towards less frequent and longer lasting reflux episodes...|$|R

Exclaim! described the band as moving past the sometimes overreaching progressive sounds for a more modern and straight-up rock sound. The reviewer further described the album style as [...] "taking the sounds of bands as disparate as Opeth, Norma Jean and the general vibe of cold symphonic black metal, and combining a bit of a simplified, melodic groove to it, creating something new entirely."
