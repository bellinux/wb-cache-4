5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|Carson {{began her}} career as an aquatic {{biologist}} in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won her a U.S. National Book Award, recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, The Edge of the Sea, and the reissued version of her first book, <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> Wind, were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.|$|E

50|$|The {{expressway}} comprises a 3.5-kilometre (2.2-mile) underground tunnel, {{while the}} rest are at grade or depressed, {{with a view of}} the Singapore Strait. The underground tunnel includes a 420-metre (459-yard) stretch that travels <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed,</b> 150 metres (164 yards) away from the Marina Barrage. This had posed particular engineering challenges in the tunnel construction as large amounts of water were let out from the barrage from time to time.

5|$|Submarine {{films like}} Robert Wise's 1958 Run Silent, Run Deep {{constitute}} a distinctive subgenre {{of the war}} film, depicting the stress of submarine warfare. The genre makes distinctive use of the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> For example, in the 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges and the many times repeated ping of sonar, {{as well as the}} threatening sounds of a destroyer's propellor and of an approaching torpedo.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes occurs {{as a result}} of a pool of relatively fresh water that sometimes forms during the summer months <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> ice as it melts.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} Vengeur du Peuple {{was used as}} {{propaganda}} by the National Convention and Bertrand Barère, who {{gave birth to the}} legend that the crew had gone down with the ship fighting, rather than surrender. The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle repeated the tale in his , yielding a rebuttal by Rear-Admiral John Griffiths, who had witnessed the events. Although discredited in naval history circles, the legend lived on as a folk tale, inspiring numerous representations and a fictional account by Jules Verne in Twenty Thousand Leagues <b>Under</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Australian Arts Minister confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea.</b> According to Australian film industry sources, pre-production started in late September 2014 with filming expected to commence in February 2015. This was officially confirmed by Disney and Ian Walker the Queensland Arts Minister on October 2, 2014, stating that filming will take place exclusively in Australia, being the largest production to ever shoot in the country. Village Roadshow Studios and Port Douglas were officially confirmed as filming locations. Production began in Australia on February 17, 2015 and wrapped on July 9, 2015.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a {{revised version of}} an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E

5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area before the last {{glaciation}} between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> The oldest signs of habitation on the marshes are prehistoric Clactonian flint blades possibly from 400,000 years ago, but few other prehistoric remains have been recorded here.|$|E

5|$|Submarine {{films have}} their own {{particular}} meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|The South Downs {{dominate}} Eastbourne and the Eastbourne Downland Estate can be {{seen from}} most of the town. These were originally chalk deposits laid down <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> during the Late Cretaceous, and were later lifted by the same tectonic plate movements that formed the European Alps, during the middle Tertiary period. The chalk can be clearly seen along the eroded coastline {{to the west of the}} town, in the area known as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters, where continuous erosion keeps the cliff edge vertical and white. The chalk contains many fossils such as ammonites and nautilus. The town area is built on geologically recent alluvial drift, the result of the silting up of a bay. This changes to Weald clay around the Langney estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Pacific Northwest Coast feature killer whales throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded killer whales {{as the most powerful}} animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of killer whales living in houses and towns <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka'wakw, the killer whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka'wakw mythology, killer whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the killer whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.|$|E
