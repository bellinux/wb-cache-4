40|$|The {{control of}} state aid is an unique feature of {{competition}} {{policy in the}} European Union. This paper sets out to show the balance between Member States and the European Union {{in the area of}} state aid policy. After a brief overview of the principles underlying the enforcement of state aid law in the Member States, we will describe the basic principles underlying the division of responsibilities between the Commission and national courts in state aids matters, then we will discuss the two main responsibilities facing national courts – protecting competitors against <b>unlawful</b> <b>aid</b> and ensuring effective recovery of illegal and incompatible aid...|$|E
50|$|In February 2011 and January 2012 the group, {{supported}} by other organisations and environmentalists, lodged formal complaints with the European Union's Directorate General for Competition, {{alleging that the}} Government was providing <b>unlawful</b> State <b>aid</b> {{in the form of}} subsidies for nuclear power industry, in breach of European Union competition law.|$|R
25|$|In January 2012, the {{campaign}} group Energy Fair, {{supported by a}} number of other organisations and environmentalists, filed a formal complaint with the European Commission over alleged <b>unlawful</b> State <b>aid</b> in the form of subsidies for nuclear power industry, in breach of European Union competition law. It claims that the subsidies arise from underwriting commercial risk and decommissioning costs, protection against terrorist attacks, the disposal of nuclear waste, and by providing 'institutional support' in the form of various government funded or subsidised bodies such as the National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Institute, and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority without providing corresponding levels of support for renewable technologies, without which nuclear power would not be commercially viable, so distorting the energy market. The group claims that the subsidies divert resources from renewable technologies that would 'cut emissions more deeply, more quickly, more cheaply, and with none of the risks and other problems with nuclear power'.|$|R
40|$|The European Commission has {{controlled}} State {{aid that}} would distort competition and affect trade between Member States. The State aid control is, in fact, {{one of the}} most important provisions of EU law, aiming at ensuring the process of competition and the integrated internal market. However, its State aid control does not seem very successful, since the current data indicate that the number of <b>unlawful</b> State <b>aid</b> is still significant, although the overall amount of granted aid has not increased considerably despite the current financial crisis in the EU. In particular, it does not give an impression that there are proper guidelines of the State aid exemption to a certain sector, such as R&D. This article discusses about its control of State aid for R&D that can cause incentive loss of the R&D investments due to its comparative advantage. Even though the Commission stresses that State aid for R&D should serve as an incentive for firms to commence R&D activities, it is still difficult to decide which R&D aid can encourage them to carry out R&D efforts effectively. When the Commission lacks the legal techniques to implement an adequate balance test of positive and negative effects of State aid, its State aid policy will fail to contribute to achieving social and pro-competitive goals of the EU.

40|$|This case {{arose from}} a {{decision}} of the Italian authorities to extend an existing regional aid scheme – a social security concession for the south of Italy - to the cities of Chioggia and Venice in the north, which fell outside the designated regional aid areas approved {{on the basis of}} Article 107 (3) (a). This measure was not notified to the Commission in advance and, following an investigative procedure, the Commission reached a decision requiring the recovery of aid except insofar as it had been paid either to SMEs, to firms located in designated assisted areas, concerned the employment of ‘hard-to-place’ employees or to specified municipal companies. The recovery decision was contested before the General Court. The Commission claimed that the applicants lacked standing, but this was rejected by the Court which found that belonging to a closed class of actual beneficiaries of an aid scheme affected by the obligation to repay aid was sufficient to differentiate them from all other persons. On substance, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the measures were compensation for additional costs arising from their location in the Venice lagoon (not State aid), that the Commission had failed to account of the situation of undertakings other than selected municipal companies, and that the Commission had infringed Article 107 (3) (c) in relation to regional aid. The substantive claims were rejected by the General Court. The applicants also challenged the legality of the recovery order, arguing that the measure was a mere extension in time and territory of a measure dating back to the 1970 s. This was not accepted by the General Court which accordingly dismissed the actions. The applicants appealed the General Court’s judgment before the Court of Justice. For its part, the Commission, by cross appeal, sought the annulment of the General Court’s judgment insofar as it declared the applicants’ actions admissible. The Court of Justice upheld the General Court’s ruling on the standing of the applicants, though it found that the General Court had erred in law in finding that it was not for the national authorities to verify in each individual case whether the conditions for the existence of aid were met. The Court of Justice dismissed the main appeals of the applicants against the judgment of the General Court and confirmed the order for the recovery of the <b>unlawful</b> <b>aid...</b>|$|E
40|$|European Union (EU) law {{has played}} a key role in {{enforcing}} the EU BEPS agenda, while also introducing limits to the application thereof. The European Commission (EC) sees a clear link between aggressive tax planning and competition law. Against this background, EU State aid law has been employed to challenge the business models of multinational enterprises. At present there are a number of opened cases, where a decision either by the EC or the General Court of the EU is pending. These cases deal with the application of EU State aid law on inter alia tax regimes (e. g. exemption of interest and royalty payments), transfer pricing, and the misapplication of law. The approach the EC is taking in those cases, especially in matters of competence, raises a number of questions, which can only be addressed in a definitive manner by the EU Courts. Similar issues may arise in the field of positive harmonization through the recently adopted Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). For instance, given that a general anti-abuse rule has been included in Art. 6 ATAD and has therefore become EU law, the EC and the EU Courts are competent to decide whether it should be applied in certain situations, and whether non-application thereof may amount to <b>unlawful</b> State <b>aid.</b> However, EU free movement law should be respected by Member States when implementing anti-BEPs measures. Accordingly, so far, the limitation on benefits clause contained in double tax treaties has been challenged by the EC, while the compatibility of the anti-avoidance rules against hybrid mismatches with EU free movement law is questionable...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Public service {{broadcasting}} (PSB) {{finds itself}} {{currently in the}} eye of the storm. It has been for some time now the target of sustained criticism on the grounds that it is a relic from the age of spectrum scarcity, a paternalistic curb on viewer sovereignty and consumer choice, an unjustified intervention in an increasingly competitive marketplace. The amount of funding it receives, its governance, and also, more and more, the extent of its remit are under close scrutiny. Since the beginning of the nineties, public service broadcasters (PSBs) across Europe have been faced with a cascade of appeals at European Union level against the allegedly anti-competitive nature of the licence fee and other forms of state support received by them. Initially these attacks were spearheaded by commercial operators claiming that the state financing of PSBs constituted <b>unlawful</b> state <b>aid</b> under Article 107 TFEU (ex Article 87 (1) EC). The first complaint was filed in 1992 by two Spanish commercial broadcasters regarding the public funding of regional broadcasting channels and of the national broadcaster TVE. It was followed by numerous other complaints against the PSBs of almost all the Member States of the European Union of the Fifteen. In a nutshell, Private broadcasters alleged that the public service remit was not defined in a sufficiently precise manner, that there was no adequate independent supervision, that the licence fee was excessive, and that it distorted competition in advertising and other commercial markets. The 1997 Amsterdam Protocol has not shielded Member States’ institutional and regulatory arrangements for organizing and funding PSB from scrutiny. It clarified that it is for the Member States to define the remit, but preserved the Commission’s competence to assess the effect of national funding mechanisms on trade and competition. However, financial and content-related supervision are intertwined...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contains}} {{an examination of}} the exemption from paying transport charges for producers, under European Union sector specific regulation and the European Union state aid rules. In the Netherlands and several other EU Member States, the energy authorities have decided that producers of electricity will not be charged for using the electricity network for transportation. These energy authorities are responsible for setting the tariffs and the related methodologies. The charges are meant to be paid to the network operator and thereby ensure that this network operator can recover the costs that are made to provide the service of transport to users of the network. Both producers and consumers are users of the network. Producers inject electricity that will be transported to consumers. These consumers take the electricity off the network. This article assesses whether exempting producers from contributing to the payment of these charges, can be considered legitimate under European Union law. First, the relevant provisions from the Third Energy Package are assessed. This legislative package does not contain provisions containing strict rules with regard to the allocation of transport tariffs on the electricity market. It does however contain the principle of non-discrimination. Whether or not this principle is infringed by the measure containing the exemption is doubtful. Secondly, the exemptions will be tested under the EU state aid doctrine. Whether or not the state aid rules are infringed by the exemption will depend of the interpretation of the specific elements of the state aid rules. Applying a broad interpretation of the state aid conditions will lead {{to the conclusion that the}} measures containing the exemption can constitute <b>unlawful</b> state <b>aid</b> as prohibited by the Treaty. Nevertheless, it is not that convincing that this conclusion would be the same if these conditions would be interpreted in a more strict way. It would thus be useful to notify the measures to the European Commission, in order for them to carry out investigations...|$|R
5000|$|Two main {{strategies}} have pushed {{a transition to}} renewable power. First, under the Electricity Act 1989 sections 32-32M, the Secretary of State was able to place renewables obligations on energy generating companies. Large electricity generating companies (i.e. the big six, British Gas, EDF, E.ON, nPower, Scottish Power and SSE) had to buy fixed percentages of [...] "Renewable Obligation Certificates" [...] from renewable generators {{if they did not}} meet set quotas in their own electricity generators. This encouraged significant investment in wind and solar farms, although the Energy Act 2013 enabled the scheme to be closed to new installations over 5MW capacity in 2015 and all in 2017. In Solar Century Holdings Ltd v SS for Energy and Climate Change a group of solar companies challenged the closure decision by judicial review. Solar Century Ltd claimed they had a legitimate expectation from the government in its previous policy documents for [...] "maintaining support levels". The Court of Appeal rejected the claim, because no unconditional promise was given. As a replacement, under EA 2013 sections 6-26 created a [...] "contracts for difference" [...] system to subsidise energy companies' investment in renewables. The government owned [...] "Low Carbon Contracts Co." [...] pays licensed energy generators money under contracts lasting, for example, 15 years, reflecting the difference between a predicted future price of electricity (a [...] "reference price") and a predicted future price of electricity with more renewable investment (a [...] "strike price"). The LCCC gets its money from a levy on the energy companies, which pass costs onto consumers. This system was apparently seen by the government as preferable to direct investment by taxing polluters' profits. The second strategy to boost renewables was the Energy Act 2008's [...] "feed-in tariff". Electricity produced with renewables has to be paid a certain price by electricity companies: a [...] "generation" [...] rate (even if the producer uses the energy itself) and an [...] "export" [...] rate (when the producer sells to the grid). In PreussenElektra AG v Schleswag AG a large energy company (now part of E.ON) challenged a similar scheme in Germany. It argued that the feed-in tariff operated like a tax to subsidise renewable energy companies, since non-renewable energy companies passed the costs on, and so should be considered an <b>unlawful</b> state <b>aid,</b> contrary to TFEU article 107. The Court of Justice rejected the argument, holding that the redistributive effects were inherent in the scheme, as indeed they are in any change to private law. Since then, feed-in tariffs have been considerably successful at promoting small scale electricity production by homes and business, and solar and wind in general.|$|R
