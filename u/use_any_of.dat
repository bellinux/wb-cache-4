5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs. All of the {{characters}} have their own special items which are unique to them, like Mario and Luigi with Fireballs, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong with Giant Bananas, Bowser and Bowser Jr. with Bowser Shells, Yoshi and Birdo with Eggs, Peach and Daisy with Hearts, Wario and Waluigi with Bob-ombs, Koopa Troopa (who previously appeared in Super Mario Kart) and Paratroopa with Triple Shells, Toad and Toadette with Golden Mushrooms, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi with Chain Chomps. Petey Piranha and King Boo have the unique ability to <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other characters' special items excluding Luigi's Green Fireball and Birdo's Pink Egg. There are 21 karts in all and the character's weight class (light, middle, or heavy) determines the kart {{in which they can}} ride as well as their speed, acceleration, and weight attributes.|$|E

25|$|Hardware {{expansion}} boards could <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> {{the upper}} memory area for ROM addressing, so the upper memory blocks were of variable size {{and in different}} locations for each computer, depending on the hardware installed.

25|$|Most school {{bands and}} orchestras below a {{university}} level use less expensive, more durable timpani with copper, fiberglass, or aluminum bowls.

CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.|$|E
25|$|In Design mode, {{players can}} edit color {{palettes}} for existing commanding officers (after the player has unlocked the palettes) or {{create their own}} maps.

There are also certain rules the player must adhere to in order for the map to be considered playable.

25|$|Increasingly, British {{foreign policy}} {{thinking}} {{turned away from}} acting as a great imperial power. During the 1960s there was much speculation that Prime Minister Harold Wilson's continual refusals to send any British troops to Vietnam, even as a token force, despite President Lyndon B. Johnson's persistent requests, was partially due to the Americans failing to support Britain during the Suez Crisis. Edward Heath was dismayed by the US opposition to Britain during the Suez Crisis; as Prime Minister in October 1973 he refused the US permission to <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the UK's air bases to resupply during the Yom Kippur War, or to allow the Americans to gather intelligence from British bases in Cyprus.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutional}} {{provisions in}} relation to use of the official language in legislation at the State level largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their official language, Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> these {{have the same rights}} to their mother tongue with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.|$|E

The West Boca Branch opened on February 20, 2009. It is on State Road 7 just north of Yamato Road. The Glades Road Branch Library, {{formerly known as the}} Southwest County Regional Library, is on 95th Street and Glades Road, between Lyons Road and State Road 7. It closed for renovations in early 2009 and reopened as the Glades Road Branch Library on May 29, 2010.

25|$|NWT {{residents}} {{have a right}} to <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the above languages in a territorial court and in debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the NWT government only publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages when the legislature asks it to. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested. In practical terms, English language services are universally available, and {{there is no guarantee that}} other languages, including French, will be used by any particular government service except for the courts.|$|E

25|$|As a {{follow-on}} to the Avro 618 Ten the Eighteen was {{a larger}} aircraft but used a modified Avro Ten wing. The wing {{was moved to}} the shoulder position with the engines mounted on the wing and a new larger fuselage was used. When the design was completed in February 1933 it was the largest aircraft designed by Avro. The new fuselage was a fabric-covered welded steel structure with seats for 16 passengers, a baggage area and a toilet. The nose section was made of wood and originally had a semi-circular glazed front, although this was later changed to a more conventional-type windscreen. The wooden wing was designed to <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the engines in the Armstrong-Siddeley family and the first aircraft was built with two Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar VID engines with four-bladed propellers.|$|E
25|$|Commercial bonsai growers may <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> {{the other}} means of obtaining starter bonsai material, from seed {{propagation}} to collecting expeditions, but they generally sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already. The grower trains the source specimens {{to a greater or}} lesser extent before sale, and the trees may be ready for display as soon as they are bought. Those who purchase commercially grown bonsai face some challenges, however, particularly of buying from another country. If the purchaser's local climate does not closely match the climate in which the bonsai was created, the plant will have difficulties surviving and thriving. As well, importing living plant material from a foreign source is often closely controlled by import regulations and may require a license or other special import arrangement on the buyer's part. If a local commercial bonsai grower does not exist, buying from a distant one may be unsatisfactory.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} any {{citizen of the}} canton may request service and {{official}} documents such as ballots in their language of choice, that all three languages {{may be used in}} court, and that a member of the cantonal parliament is free to <b>use</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the three languages. Since 1991, all official texts of the cantonal parliament must be translated into Romansh and offices of the cantonal government must include signage in all three languages. In practice, the role of Romansh within the cantonal administration is limited and often symbolic and the working language is mainly German. This is usually justified by cantonal officials on the grounds that all Romansh speakers are perfectly bilingual and able to understand and speak German. Up until the 1980s it was usually seen as a provocation when a deputy in the cantonal parliament used Romansh during a speech.|$|E
