5|$|There {{are three}} main forms of {{manslaughter}} in English law: voluntary manslaughter, cases which would otherwise amount to murder {{but for some}} legally recognised mitigating factor; and involuntary manslaughter which includes cases of gross negligence manslaughter and <b>unlawful</b> <b>act</b> manslaughter.|$|E
5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action {{by a public}} authority from occurring in the first place. It may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant is aware that the authority is about to take an unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an <b>unlawful</b> <b>act.</b> Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from <b>unlawful</b> <b>act</b> manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E

25|$|Lord Diplock {{rejected}} this argument, {{and instead}} upheld {{the validity of}} a presumption of trafficking where possession of a quantity of prohibited drugs higher than the minimum specified in section 15 of the MDA has been proved. Where {{the difference between an}} offence and some lesser offence was the particular purpose with which that <b>unlawful</b> <b>act</b> was committed, there was nothing unfair about requiring the accused to prove his actual purpose. This was because the accused alone is armed with the knowledge of the purpose of the illegal act.|$|E
25|$|On 7 December, Anti-Treaty IRA gunmen shot two TDs, Sean Hales and Pádraic Ó Máille, in Dublin as {{they were}} on their way to the Dáil. Hales was killed and O'Máille was badly wounded. After an {{emergency}} cabinet meeting, the Free State government decided on the retaliatory executions of four prominent Republicans (one from each province). Accordingly, on 8 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four members of the IRA Army Executive, who had been in jail since the first week of the war - Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey - were executed in revenge. O'Connor and Mellows particularly were revered heroes of the War of Independence. This was arguably an <b>unlawful</b> <b>act,</b> as the four Republicans had been captured before the Dáil passed the legislation authorising executions. Later on the same day the Dáil debated the executions and retrospectively approved them by a vote of 39-14. One of the poignant aspects of the incident was that O'Connor and Kevin O'Higgins were formerly close friends, and O'Connor had been best man at O'Higgins' wedding just a few months previously. Historian Michael Hopkinson reports that Richard Mulcahy had pressed for the executions and that Kevin O'Higgins was the last member of cabinet to give his consent.|$|E
500|$|The typical {{case will}} be of a non-fatal offence against the person that causes death. There must be a {{criminal}} act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe. Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions [...] {{where there is no}} need to show intent [...] would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, can be dealt with by gross negligence manslaughter. Judges have often failed to identify a single <b>unlawful</b> <b>act</b> on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (mens rea) for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This mens rea might be very low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an <b>unlawful</b> <b>act</b> also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime.|$|E

500|$|In R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, {{ex parte}} Rose Theatre Trust Co. (1989), the High Court of England and Wales adopted a narrow and more {{restrictive}} approach to public standing. Justice Konrad Schiemann held {{that to have}} standing, an applicant must expressly or impliedly have [...] "a greater right or expectation than any other citizen of this country to have that decision taken lawfully". On the facts, an individual interested in seeing {{the remains of a}} historically significant theatre in London called The Rose preserved and made accessible to the public lacked sufficient interest to challenge the Secretary of State for the Environment's decision not to list the theatre as a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The applicant, a trust company formed by a number of such people, did not have any greater claim to standing than its individual members. Despite the fact that this decision could potentially leave an <b>unlawful</b> <b>act</b> by a minister unrebuked, the judge considered that: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} that the action be dangerous was confirmed in R v Newbury, which applied the previous reasoning on R v Church: [...] "the <b>unlawful</b> <b>act</b> must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise it as an act which must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm". This is an (almost completely) objective test, it disregards whether the defendant in particular foresaw the danger, and requires only that it would create a risk of some harm. The ordinary person knows only what the defendant did, at least {{in relation to the}} susceptibility of the victim. R v Ball did, however, create a class of dangerous [...] that of the act itself [...] where the jury knew more than the defendant; in this case, whilst the defendant knew he was loading a blank cartridge, the jury was entitled to ascribe knowledge that it might be a live cartridge to the reasonable man. This has been criticised, and may not have been necessary. The act need not be directed at the victim: the killing of an innocent bystander by mistake could be manslaughter.|$|E

2500|$|Victim's {{conscious}} actions R v. Blaue is {{a criminal}} law application of the [...] "thin skull rule" [...] in criminal law. The defendant visited {{the home of a}} Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an <b>unlawful</b> <b>act,</b> namely wounding with intent. [...] "But for" [...] his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable).|$|E
2500|$|While {{the law on}} {{disclosure}} and misrepresentation aims to make contracting parties informed (or not disinformed), the law also says agreements may be avoided when, in a very general sense, a person's free will was impaired. Complete exercise of [...] "free will" [...] is rare for most people, because they make choices within a constrained range of alternatives. The law still holds people to nearly all contracts (if consumer, employment, tenancy, etc. legislation is not activated) except where someone was under duress, unduly influenced or exploited while in a vulnerable position. Like misrepresentation, the victim may avoid the contract, and the parties restore their property to reverse unjust enrichment, subject to the victim's claim for damages, so long as none of the four equitable bars to rescission lie (i.e. no excessive lapse of time, affirmation of the contract, intervention of an innocent third party's rights and counter-restitution is possible). The most straight forward claim, for duress, involves illegitimate threats. The common law long allowed a claim if duress was of a physical nature. So long as a threat {{is just one of}} the reasons a person enters an agreement, even if not the main reason, the agreement may be avoided. Only late in the 20th century was escape allowed if the threat involved illegitimate economic harm. A threat is always [...] "illegitimate" [...] if it is to do an <b>unlawful</b> <b>act,</b> such as breaking a contract knowing non-payment may push someone out of business. However, threatening to do a lawful act will usually not be illegitimate. In Pao on v Lau Yiu Long the Pao family threatened to not complete a share swap deal, aimed at selling their company's building, unless the Lau family agreed to change a part of the proposed agreement to guarantee the Paos would receive rises in the swapped shares' prices on repurchase. The Laus signed the guarantee agreement after this threat, and then claimed it was not binding. But the Privy Council advised their signature was only a result of [...] "commercial pressure", not economic duress. The Laus' considered the situation before signing, and did not behave like someone under duress, so there was no coercion amounting to a vitiation of consent. However, contrasting to cases involving business parties, the threat to do a lawful act will probably be duress if used against a vulnerable person. An obvious case involving [...] "lawful act duress" [...] is blackmail. The blackmailer has to justify, not doing the lawful act they threaten, but against a person highly vulnerable to them, the demand of money.|$|E
