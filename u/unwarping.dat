However, because of variations in the optical return from the low-precision encoder disk, quadrature phasing and signal amplitude vary over a mechanical turn.

40|$|Abstract—Three-dimensional (3 -D) {{reconstruction}} of histo-logical slice sequences offers great {{benefits in the}} investigation of different morphologies. It features very high-resolution which is still unmatched by in-vivo 3 -D imaging modalities, and tissue staining further enhances visibility and contrast. One important step during reconstruction is the reversal of slice deformations introduced during histological slice prepa-ration, a process also called image <b>unwarping.</b> Most methods use an external reference, or rely on conservative stopping criteria during the <b>unwarping</b> optimization to prevent straight-ening of naturally curved morphology. Our approach shows that the problem of <b>unwarping</b> is based on the superposition of low-frequency anatomy and high-frequency errors. We present an iterative scheme that transfers the ideas of the Gauss-Seidel method to image stacks to separate the anatomy from the deformation. In particular, the scheme is universally applicable without restriction to a specific <b>unwarping</b> method, and uses no external reference. The deformation artifacts are effectively reduced in the resulting histology volumes, while the natural curvature of the anatomy is preserved. The validity of our method is shown on synthetic data, simulated histology data using a CT data set and real histology data. In the case of the simulated histology where the ground truth was known, the mean Target Registration Error (TRE) between the unwarped and original volume could be reduced to less than 1 pixel on average after 6 iterations of our proposed method. ...|$|E

Ideally the position in a gel image corresponds to one or several properties of the molecules, such as size and net charge, but in practise the separation pattern is often warped, that is, geometrically distorted. This thesis presents methods for <b>unwarping</b> and analysing electrophoresis gel images. There are three main contributions in the thesis: (i) An image analysis method for simultaneous <b>unwarping</b> and classification of multi-track 1 -D gels using a database of track profiles. The main advantage of this method is that the two analysis steps are done automatically and simultaneously. The method is motivated by and applied to pulse-field electrophoresis gels from a genotyping of potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria. (ii) A physical model and methods for individual <b>unwarping</b> and pair-wise alignment of 2 -D gel images.

To connect two neighbouring panoramic images the correlation was used. To speed up the algorithm we used pyramidal data structures.

40|$|A {{family of}} axially {{symmetric}} mirror shapes are proposed for panoramic imaging. These shapes keep the {{resolution in the}} image invariant to changes in elevation in the scene. In other words, this family of shapes achieves solid angle pixel density invariance. An analysis of range finding using two coaxial, axially symmetric resolution invariant mirrors in a coaxial pair is presented. The resolution invariance property of these mirrors mean that when the image captured is <b>unwarped</b> the resultant image will not suffer from variable image quality. This problem is present in <b>unwarped</b> images captured with any mirror shape not designed for resolution invariance. The resolution invariance of these mirrors is especially important {{in the case of}} stereo panoramic mirrors where one view of the scene is captured within the other and thus will have lower resolution. It is necessary to clearly identify two views of an object to undertake range finding. The proposed mirror shapes will be useful for mobile robotics and machine vision.

We are able to single out generic features such as singularity formation, isotropisation at particular values of the flow parameter and evolution characteristics. Subsequently, motivated by warped braneworlds and extra dimensions, we look at Ricci flows of warped spacetimes.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for the registration of multiple surveillance cameras through the automatic alignment of image trajectories. The algorithm {{address the problem}} of recovering the relative pose of several stationary cameras that observe one or more objects in motion. Each camera tracks several objects to produce a set of trajectories in the image. Using a simple calibration procedure, we recover the relative orientation of each camera to the local ground plane in order to projectively <b>unwarp</b> image trajectories onto a nominal plane of correct orientation. <b>Unwarped</b> trajectory curves are then matched by solving for the 3 D to 3 D rotation, translation, and scale that bring them into alignment. The relative transform between a pair of cameras is derived from the independent camera-to-ground-plane rotations and the plane-to-plane transform computed from matched trajectories. Registration aligns-cameras with respect to each other in a single camera frame (that of the reference camera). The approach recovers both the epipolar geometry between all cameras and the camera-toground rotation for each camera. After calibration, points that are known to lay on a world ground plane can be directly backprojected into each of the camera frames. The algorithm is demonstrated for two-camera and three-camera scenarios by tracking pedestrians as they move through a surveillance area and matching the resulting trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Rapid and {{efficient}} imaging {{of the brain}} to monitor brain activity and neural connectivity is performed through functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using the Echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. An entire volume of the brain is imaged by EPI {{in a few seconds}} through the measurement of all k-space lines within one repetition time. However, this makes the sequence extremely sensitive to imperfections of magnetic field. In particular, the error caused by susceptibility induced magnetic field inhomogeneity accumulates over the duration of phase encoding, which in turn results in severe geometric distortion (warping) in EPI scans. EPI distortion correction through <b>unwarping</b> can be performed by field map based or image based techniques. However, {{due to the lack of}} ground truth it has been difficult to compare and validate different approaches. In this paper we propose a hybrid field map guided constrained deformable registration approach and compare it to field map based and image based <b>unwarping</b> approaches through a novel in-vivo validation framework which is based on the acquisition and alignment of EPI scans with different phase encoding directions. The quantitative evaluation results show that our hybrid approach of field map guided deformable registration to an undistorted T 2 -weighted image outperforms the other approaches. I...|$|E

For this purpose we develop and employ a recently proposed N = 1 conformal superfield description of the 5 D supergravity couplings to abelian vector and hypermultiplets. In particular, we obtain a unique relation of the ”radion ” to chiral superfields as in global 5 D SUSY and we can embed the universal hypermultiplet into this formalism.
