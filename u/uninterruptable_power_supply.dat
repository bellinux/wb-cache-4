40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a ZVS-PWM {{three-phase}} current fed pushâpull dcâdc converter is proposed. When compared to single-phase topologies, the three-phase dcâdc conversion increases the power density, uses the magnetic {{core of the}} transformer more efficiently, reduces the stress on switches, and requires smaller filters since the frequency for its design is higher. The proposed converter employs an active clamping technique by connecting the primary side of the transformer to a three-phase full bridge of switches and a clamping capacitor. This circuit allows the energy from the leakage inductances to be reused, increasing {{the efficiency of the}} converter. If appropriate parameters are chosen, soft-commutation of the switches (ZVS) can also be achieved. The soft-commutation improves the efficiency even further, allows higher switching frequencies to be used, and reduces the electromagnetic interference significantly. Applications such as fuel cell systems, transportation, and <b>uninterruptable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> are some examples that can benefit from the advantages presented by this converter.

The Hâ control theory dealing with the model and disturbance uncertainty. This is a relatively new method for the controller design of VSCs. However, there are still several successful examples. In [11], the authors developed a tuning strategy for designing multiple-loop lag-lead compensators for <b>uninterruptable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> (UPSs) based on the Hâ robust control theory. The Hâ tuned compensator was asymptotically stable with guaranteed performance. In [12], a robust control scheme with an outer Hâ voltage control loop and an inner current control loop was designed for a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). The Hâ voltage controller was effective in both balanced and unbalanced sag compensation as well as load disturbance rejection. In [13], a Hâ current controller was designed for a grid connected to a power factor correction (PFC). It was possible to explicitly specify the degree of robustness with variations in the parameters using the proposed method. A mixed-sensitivity method was used to synthesize the Hâ controller. A high pass weight function was used to guarantee a robust performance and to avoid possible oscillations caused by the capacitor connected in parallel. However, none of the previous works focused on VSCs with an LCL filter. In this paper the Hâ method is further developed; the ability to achieve LC resonance attenuation is enhanced. Alternatively, from the previous work, the LC resonance in this paper is modeled as a noise channel and the corresponding weight functions are proposed to provide a robust performance.|$|R
