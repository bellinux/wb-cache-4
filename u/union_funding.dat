25|$|The European Union {{is helping}} Niue convert to {{renewable}} energy. In July 2009 a solar panel system was installed, injecting about 50kW into the Niue national power grid. This is nominal 6% {{of the average}} 833kW electricity production. The solar panels are at Niue High School (20kW), Niue Power Corporation office (1.7kW) and the Niue Foou Hospital (30kW). The EU-funded grid-connected PV systems are supplied under the REP-5 programme and were installed recently by the Niue Power Corporation on the roofs {{of the high school}} and the power station office and on ground-mounted support structures in front of the hospital. They will be monitored and maintained by the NPC. In 2014 two additional solar power installations were added to the Niue national power grid, one funded under PALM5 of Japan is located outside of the Tuila power station – so far only this has battery storage, the other under European <b>Union</b> <b>funding</b> is located opposite the Niue International Airport Terminal.|$|E

In 2017, a further feasibility study will be undertaken into the possibility of an underground light rail system.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{visit to}} the station by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on 3 July 2009, it became {{apparent}} that Rio Tinto Alcan were hoping to be able to demonstrate Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology at the station in the future, using [...] "pre-combustion" [...] CCS technology. This would have involved treating the coal prior to burning so that less CO2 was produced, with any remaining CO2 being pumped under the North Sea into an aquifer. However, due to the economic climate, Rio Tinto did not commit the funding for the project themselves, and did not secure any of the required £1billion European <b>Union</b> <b>funding</b> available for demonstration of CCS technology. In November 2009 it was announced that a variety of energy experts were preparing for the £1billion bid to the Government for investment. The plans included a pipeline into the North Sea, and the upgrading of one of the station's generating sets from 140MW to around 375MW, to safeguard the supply of electricity to the aluminium smelter.|$|E
