25|$|Other {{individuals}} {{have questioned the}} assumptions that link systems of organ gifting with the equitable distribution of human organs arguing that the voluntary and altruistic donation of organs does not necessarily imply the free transplantation of that organ. In other words, under current systems of healthcare in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> are organ donations managed by private {{organizations such as the}} United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), but organ transplantation is provided only to those who can afford it and in rare cases to those who desperately need it.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{believe that}} T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) drew from Whitman's elegy in {{fashioning}} his poem The Waste Land (1922). In the poem, Eliot prominently mentions lilacs and April in its opening lines, and later passages about [...] "dry grass singing" [...] and [...] "where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees." [...] Eliot told author Ford Madox Ford that Whitman {{and his own}} lines adorned by lilacs and the hermit thrush were the poems' only [...] "good lines" [...] Cleo McNelly Kearns writes that [...] "Whitman's poem gives <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> motifs and images of The Waste Land...but its very tone and pace, the steady andante which makes of both poems a walking meditation." ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{ascribed}} to the hymn, [...] "1 Chronicles 17:16–17", refers to David's reaction to the prophet Nathan telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever. Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people. Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God {{is involved in the}} daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await. Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly, and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were [...] "blinded by the god of this world" [...] until [...] "mercy came to <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> undeserved but undesired... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace." ...|$|E
