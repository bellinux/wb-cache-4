Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive. Merchandising of the character include plush toys, t-shirts, wooden toys, glasses, and coloring books, along with appearances in literature and a 2009 video game for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy begins {{running the}} car lot when Charlie leaves Walford. His {{friendship}} with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) grows {{and they have}} a one-night stand, but, feeling it is making their friendship weird, he rejects her afterwards despite her thinking she might have deeper feelings for him. Things between them are awkward, and when Donna's foster brother Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) finds out, he confronts Fatboy and locks him a cupboard. He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact his mother used to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. Vincent convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her. Over the coming weeks, Fatboy gets tangled in Vincent's vendetta against the Mitchell family and trying to kill Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Fatboy repeatedly tries to convince Vincent to stop, and interrupts Vincent when as he is about to throttle Phil. Fed up with his interference, Vincent threatens Fatboy with violence against Dot if he does not leave Walford forever. Fatboy tells Dot {{that he is going to}} see his father for Christmas, and shares a final dinner with her before saying goodbye. He confronts Vincent one last time, demanding that he stay away from Dot, and leaves Walford.|$|E

25|$|Around dawn, Tarleton {{reached the}} {{plantations}} of Castle Hill, Doctor Thomas Walker's home, and a splinter group of British arrived at Belvoir, {{the home of}} his son, Continental Congress member John Walker. Tarleton captured or paroled various important figures at the two plantations. Various legends have sprung <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stop at Castle Hill. Supposedly, Dr. Walker prepared an elaborate breakfast (including alcohol), for Tarleton in order to allow more time for Jefferson and the legislature to get warning of the cavalry. Tarleton's account says he did pause at Castle Hill for a half-hour rest, but the story of Walker's ploy is probably apocryphal.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} Tarnopol Ghetto was set up, {{and only two}} days after the arrival of the Wehrmacht, up to 2,000 Jews were killed in the provincial capital of Tarnopol, one-third of them by the Ukrainian People's Militia. Some of the victims have been decapitated. The SS shot the {{remaining}} two-thirds, in the same week. In Stanisławów – another provincial capital in the Kresy macroregion – the single largest massacre of Polish Jews prior to Aktion Reinhardt was perpetrated hand in glove by Orpo, SiPo and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police (brought in from Lwów) on 12 October 1941; tables with sandwiches and bottles of vodka had been set <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cemetery for shooters who needed to rest from the deafening noise of gunfire; 12,000 Jews were murdered before nightfall. A total of 31 deadly pogroms were carried out throughout the region in conjunction with the Belarusian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian Schuma. Further east, during the massacre in Jedwabne, over 300 Jews died (Institute of National Remembrance's Final Findings), burned alive in a barn set on fire by a group of Polish men in the presence of German Ordnungspolizei. The circumstances surrounding the events in Jedwabne are still debated, and include the ominous presence of the Einsatzgruppe Zichenau-Schroettersburg under SS-Obersturmführer Hermann Schaper deployed in Bezirk Bialystok, as well as German Nazi pressure, anti-Semitism, but also resentment over Jewish cooperation with the Soviet invaders during the Polish-Soviet War of 1920 as well as the alleged Jewish participation in anti-Polish terror following Soviet 1939 invasion of Kresy in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Pact.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the legends}} {{that have grown}} <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (at least not for any reason {{connected}} with independence), as no public announcement {{was made of the}} Declaration of Independence. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang. However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the National Park Service, [...] "We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence." ...|$|E
500|$|Fifty-seven guinea pigs, 109 mice, 146 pigs, 176 goats, and 3,030 white rats {{had been}} placed on 22 target ships in {{stations}} normally occupied by people. 35% of these animals died or were sacrificed {{in the three months}} following the explosion: 10% were killed by the air blast, 15% were killed by radiation, and 10% were killed by the researchers as part of later study. The most famous survivor was Pig #311, which was (reportedly) found swimming in the lagoon after the blast and was brought back to the National Zoo in Washington, DC. The mysterious survival of Pig #311 caused some consternation at the time and has continued to be reported in error. However, an investigation pointed to the conclusion that it had neither swum in the ocean nor escaped the blast; it had likely been safely aboard an observation vessel during the test, thus [...] "absent without leave" [...] from its post on Sakawa and showing <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same time other surviving pigs were captured.|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, Nasri {{was one of}} a {{group of}} young players who were accused of being insolent during the team's {{campaign}} at Euro 2008. The accusation came from domestic teammate William Gallas, who made the charge in his autobiography. Though not explicitly named in the book, Nasri was widely identified as the player in question. As an example of Nasri's disrespectful attitude, Gallas cited an incident in which the young player sat in Thierry Henry's seat on the team bus and refused to move, which, according to Gallas, undermined the striker's seniority. The incident ultimately led to a verbal exchange between Nasri and Gallas during a training session. In response, Nasri played down the incident, stating Gallas was overreacting to a problem that did not exist. In 2010, after failing to make the 2010 World Cup squad, Nasri opened <b>up</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation, stating that during Gallas' final year at Arsenal, Nasri was one of [...] "four or five" [...] Arsenal players who did not speak to the defender. The feud culminated on 20 November 2010 when Nasri lived up to a pledge he would not shake the hand of Gallas, who was then playing for Tottenham Hotspur, during the pre-match build-up.|$|E

2500|$|The watt (W) is {{the unit}} of power, and is usually quoted for the {{electrical}} power input, not the light power output.
