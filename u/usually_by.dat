5|$|An {{irreversible}} inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> {{forming a}} covalent bond to the protein. Penicillin and aspirin are common drugs that act in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Cormorants are {{medium to}} large aquatic birds with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked for catching fish and aquatic invertebrates. They nest in colonies, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> the sea. There are about 39 species worldwide, with two recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
50|$|Eggs are <b>usually</b> {{specified}} <b>by</b> count. Vegetables are <b>usually</b> specified <b>by</b> {{weight or}} occasionally by count, despite the inherent imprecision of counts given {{the variability in}} the size of vegetables.|$|R
5000|$|In {{abstract}} algebra, a Robbins algebra is an algebra {{containing a}} single binary operation, <b>usually</b> denoted <b>by</b> , {{and a single}} unary operation <b>usually</b> denoted <b>by</b> [...] These operations satisfy the following axioms: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{smallest}} constant C in the inequality {{above is}} called the weak [...] norm and is <b>usually</b> denoted <b>by</b> ||f||1,w or ||f||1,∞. Similarly the space is <b>usually</b> denoted <b>by</b> L1,w or L1,∞.|$|R
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{can also}} irreversibly {{inactivate}} enzymes, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> covalently modifying active site residues. These reactions, {{which may be}} called suicide substrates, follow exponential decay functions and are usually saturable. Below saturation, they follow first order kinetics with respect to inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomic {{analysis}} pipelines use {{two approaches}} in the annotation of coding {{regions in the}} assembled contigs. The first approach is to identify genes based upon homology with genes that are already publicly available in sequence databases, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> simple BLAST searches. This type of approach is implemented in the program MEGAN4.|$|E
5|$|More recent models {{attempt to}} model bubble dynamics, also <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> {{simplified}} models, {{to facilitate the}} computation of tables, and later to allow real time predictions during a dive. Models that approximate bubble dynamics are varied. They range from {{those that are not}} much more complex than the dissolved phase models, to those that require considerably greater computational power.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{relative}} minor is D minor, <b>usually</b> replaced <b>by</b> C minor (see reason below) and its parallel minor is F minor, <b>usually</b> replaced <b>by</b> E minor, since F minor's four double-flats make {{it generally}} impractical to use.|$|R
50|$|Off-peak Thameslink {{services}} are <b>usually</b> operated <b>by</b> 4 carriage Class 319 units while peak time Thameslink {{services are}} <b>usually</b> operated <b>by</b> 8 carriage Class 319 units. Southern services are mainly all operated by 8 carriage Class 455 units.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{featured}} many fictional guests, <b>usually</b> interviewed <b>by</b> Casper Christensen in an [...] "absurd talkshow" [...] style. They were <b>usually</b> played <b>by</b> the Mandril crew. While many characters appeared only once, {{some would}} re-appear in many episodes.|$|R
5|$|The borders {{between the}} four {{subspecies}} are not sharp, because the subspecies interbreed. Many {{studies have been}} performed in the border regions to assess the intermediate turtles, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> comparing the anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical subspecies. Despite the imprecision, the subspecies are assigned nominal ranges.|$|E
5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E
5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> poison.|$|E
50|$|Rape {{is a type}} {{of sexual}} assault, usually {{involving}} sexual intercourse. Rape is <b>usually</b> perpetrated <b>by</b> men against boys, women, and girls; women are usually assaulted more often than boys and girls and <b>usually</b> all <b>by</b> someone they know.|$|R

5|$|Both House of Representatives seats {{have mostly}} been held by Labor, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> {{comfortable}} margins. The Labor Party has polled {{at least seven}} percentage points more than the Liberal Party at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points. The ALP and the Liberal Party have always held one Senate seat each.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
50|$|In {{peaceful}} circumstances, {{they are}} <b>usually</b> installed <b>by</b> {{the police or}} road transport authorities; they are also commonly employed during wars and are <b>usually</b> staffed <b>by</b> heavily armed soldiers in that case.

5|$|Dostoyevsky showed {{interest}} in literature since his childhood. His mother's subscription to the Library of Reading enabled the family {{entry into the}} leading contemporary Russian and non-Russian literature. Gothic tales, such as by Ann Radcliffe, was the first genre Dostoyevsky was introduced to. Other formative influences were the works by the poets Alexander Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky, heroic epics <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> Homer and chivalric novels by Cervantes and Walter Scott.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|From 10 July 1925, {{until his}} death in 1969, Meher Baba was silent. He communicated first by using an {{alphabet}} board and later by unique hand gestures which were interpreted and spoken out by one of his mandali, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> his disciple Eruch Jessawala. Meher Baba said that his silence was not undertaken as a spiritual exercise but solely in connection with his universal work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} use of on, in turn, is <b>usually</b> replaced <b>by</b> different uses of pronouns or paraphrases, like in {{the rest}} of the Francophonie.

5|$|In Mobile, locals {{often use}} the term Mardi Gras as a {{shorthand}} {{to refer to the}} entire Carnival season. During the Carnival season; the mystic societies build colorful floats and parade throughout downtown. Masked society members toss small gifts, known as 'throws,' to parade spectators. The mystic societies, which in essence are exclusive private clubs, also hold formal masquerade balls, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> invitation only, and oriented to adults.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|Lang's {{region of}} Stepney within the Diocese of London {{extended}} {{over the whole}} area generally known as London's East End, with two million people in more than 200parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was troubled by the squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, <b>usually</b> <b>by</b> bus and tram.|$|E
