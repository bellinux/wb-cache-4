50|$|The codex {{contains}} the complete {{text of the}} four Gospels. Written carefully in small minuscule letters. There is mixture of minuscule and <b>uncial</b> <b>characters.</b> <b>Uncials</b> usually {{in the beginning of}} words, and almost never in the medial position. Titles were written in red colour. It {{contains the}} Ammonian Sections and the Eusebian Canons.|$|R
6000|$|Also on the {{right-hand}} side of this surface of the sherd, painted obliquely in red on the space not covered by the <b>uncial</b> <b>characters,</b> and signed in blue paint, was the following quaint inscription:-- ...|$|R
40|$|On cover: Codex rescriptus dublinensis, etc. "Appendix. Fragmentum Codicis palatini. (Matt. XIII. 13 - 23.)," {{facsimile}} of {{a fragment}} of a purple codex in the University of Dublin library, identified as a missing part of the Codex palatinus in the National library at Vienna. Lithographic reproduction, in <b>uncial</b> <b>characters,</b> of {{the text of the}} original manuscripts. Mode of access: Internet...|$|R
50|$|The Psalter {{is bound}} with 12 leaves of a {{different}} Gospel book written in <b>uncial</b> <b>characters</b> with a text similar to the Codex Amiatinus. These leaves date from around 700 and show characteristics typical of an Anglo-Saxon scribe (Lowe, 273), {{and is the only}} other text identified as by the same scribe as the St Cuthbert Gospel, working at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey (T. Julian Brown, Stonyhurst Gospel, 7-10). The psalter was at one time also bound with the Reculver charter (Birch, 77), but this was later removed (Benson, 14). Robert Cotton may have bound them together due to their similar folio size.|$|R
50|$|Papyrus 112 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), {{designated}} by 112, is a fragment from {{a portion of}} the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript from the Acts of the Apostles. The surviving portions are parts of Acts 26:31-32 and, {{on the other side of}} the sheet, Acts 27:6-7. It is written in <b>uncial</b> <b>characters</b> of uniform size, without any diacritical marks or spacing between words. ὁ ἄνθρωπος ('the man') is written in the Nomen Sacrum form ὁ ἄνος, with a single overline. Based on palaeography, the manuscript has been assigned to the 5th century by the INTF.|$|R
5000|$|The Godescalc Evangelistary {{outlines}} prayer {{services and}} contains {{selections from the}} Gospels designed to be read at Mass through the liturgical year. The content of the Godescalc Evangelistary {{is a reminder of}} Charlemagne’s intention to renew culture of the past rather than to create a new one. There was a movement to correct Psalters, Gospel books, and other works to provide easier understanding of texts that had become unclear over time. [...] The Godescalc Evangelistary is written in gold and silver ink on purple vellum in <b>uncial</b> <b>characters</b> except the dedication, which is written in Caroline minuscule. [...] The codex is decorated by six miniature figures. The first four are Evangelist portraits, {{of the authors of the}} Gospels. The fifth is a Christ in Majesty. The sixth image is of the Fountain of Life, or fons vitae.|$|R
50|$|The Codex Amiatinus {{qualifies as}} an {{illuminated}} manuscript {{as it has}} some decoration including two full-page miniatures, but these show little sign of the usual insular style of Northumbrian art and are clearly copied from Late Antique originals. It contains 1040 leaves of strong, smooth vellum, fresh-looking today despite their great antiquity, arranged in quires of four sheets, or quaternions. It is written in <b>uncial</b> <b>characters,</b> large, clear, regular, and beautiful, two columns to a page, and 43 or 44 lines to a column. A little space is often left between words, but the writing is in general continuous. The text is divided into sections, which in the Gospels correspond closely to the Ammonian Sections. There are no marks of punctuation, but the skilled reader was guided into the sense by stichometric, or verse-like, arrangement into cola and commata, which correspond roughly to the principal and dependent clauses of a sentence. From this manner of writing the script {{is believed to have}} been modeled upon the Codex Grandior of Cassiodorus, but it may go back, perhaps, even to St. Jerome.|$|R
5000|$|These {{fragments}} contain Psalms 26:9-14; 44:4-8; 47:13-15; 48:6-21; 49:2-16; 63:6-64:5 according numbering of the Septuaginta. “This {{is probably}} the earliest extant copy of the Septuagint Psalms.” The text was written by an inexperienced writer in <b>uncial</b> script <b>characters.</b> Fragments thereof six columns of the manuscript are preserved. This {{is one of the}} known fragments of the Septuagint found in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript contains the tetragrammaton to represent the Divine Name written in archaic Hebrew characters (Palaeo-Hebrew script [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|Kipling's major {{work was}} Codex Theodori Bezæ Cantabrigiensis, Evangelia et Apostolorum Acta complectens, quadratis literis, Græco-Latinus. Academia auspicante venerandæ has vetustatis reliquias, summa qua potuit fide, adumbravit, expressit, edidit, Codicis historiam præfixit, notasque adjecit T. Kipling, Greek and Latin, 2 pts., Cambridge, 1793, printed at the {{university}} press. The impression was limited to 250 copies. This edition of the Codex Bezæ used types resembling the <b>uncial</b> <b>characters</b> of the original manuscript. It was criticised in the Monthly Review, new ser. xii. 241-6, and by Richard Porson in two notices in the British Critic, vol. iii. (1794); and the preface was attacked in a pamphlet entitled Remarks on Dr. Kipling's Preface to Beza. Part the first (London, 1793), by Thomas Edwards the vicar of Histon (no second part appeared). Errors in this edition and the bad latinity of the preface were mercilessly censured, {{so that in the}} slang of the university a [...] "Kiplingism" [...] came to be synonymous with a grammatical blunder. George Horne remarked that Kipling's work, although imperfect, was unfairly underrated. Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, in the preface to his own edition of the Bezæ Codex Cantabrigiensis (Cambridge, 1864) defended Kipling's textual work, but not his adopted forms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{letters are}} a little unusual, in form small, and their <b>character</b> is between <b>uncial</b> and minuscule, and in the 19th century the codex was {{classified}} as a minuscule manuscript (catalogue number 53). Tregelles argued {{that they are more}} <b>uncial</b> by <b>character,</b> they are almost entirely separate, and sometimes joined in the same word. [...] "They are certainly by no means cursive, in the common acceptation of the term". According to Scrivener they [...] "can hardly be called semicursive". According to Günther Zuntz it is an uncial manuscript, its letters are that kind of uncial script, which scribes of the 10th and later centuries used.|$|R
6000|$|Between {{these two}} ancient writings, {{the second of}} which was inscribed upside down and was so faint and worn that, {{had it not been}} for the {{transcript}} of it executed by Vincey, I should scarcely have been able to read it, since, owing to its having been written on that portion of the tile which had, in the course of ages, undergone the most handling, it was nearly rubbed out--was the bold, modern-looking signature of one Lionel Vincey, [...] "Ætate sua 17," [...] which was written thereon, I think, by Leo's grandfather. To the right of this were the initials [...] "J. B. V.," [...] and below came a variety of Greek signatures, in <b>uncial</b> and cursive <b>character,</b> and what appeared to be some carelessly executed repetitions of the sentence τῷ παιδί (to my son), showing that the relic was religiously passed on from generation to generation.|$|R
50|$|Tombstone of Thomas, {{brought to}} Ortona from Chios {{along with the}} relics of the Apostle, is {{currently}} preserved in the crypt of St Thomas Basilica, behind the altar. The urn containing the bones instead is placed under the altar. It is {{the cover of a}} fake coffin, fairly widespread burial form in the early Christian world, as the top of a tomb of less expensive material. The plaque has an inscription and a bas-relief that refer, in many respects, to the Syro-Mesopotamian. Tombstone Thomas the Apostle on inclusion can be read, in Greek <b>characters</b> <b>uncial,</b> the expression 'osios thomas, that Saint Thomas. It can be dated {{from the point of view}} palaeographic and lexical to III-V century, a time when the term osios is still used as a synonym of aghios in that holy is he that is in the grace of God and is inserted in the Church: the two vocabulary, therefore, indicate the Christians. In the particular case of Saint Thomas' plaque, then, the word osios can easily be the translation of the word Syriac mar (Lord), attributed in the ancient world, but also to the present day, is a saint to be a bishop.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next thing}} that I found was a {{parchment}} carefully rolled up. I unrolled it, and seeing {{that it was}} also in Vincey's handwriting, and headed, [...] "Translation of the Uncial Greek Writing on the Potsherd," [...] put it down by the letter. Then followed another ancient roll of parchment, that had become yellow and crinkled {{with the passage of}} years. This I also unrolled. It was likewise a translation of the same Greek original, but into black-letter Latin, which at the first glance from the style and character appeared to me to date from somewhere about the beginning of the sixteenth century. Immediately beneath this roll was something hard and heavy, wrapped up in yellow linen, and reposing upon another layer of the fibrous material. Slowly and carefully we unrolled the linen, exposing to view a very large but undoubtedly ancient potsherd of a dirty yellow colour! This potsherd had in my judgment, once been a part of an ordinary amphora of medium size. For the rest, it measured ten and a half inches in length by seven in width, was about a quarter of an inch thick, and densely covered on the convex side that lay towards the bottom of the box with writing in the later <b>uncial</b> Greek <b>character,</b> faded here and there, {{but for the most part}} perfectly legible, the inscription having evidently been executed with the greatest care, and by means of a reed pen, such as the ancients often used. I must not forget to mention that in some remote age this wonderful fragment had been broken in two, and rejoined by means of cement and eight long rivets. Also there were numerous inscriptions on the inner side, but these were of the most erratic character, and had clearly been made by different hands and in many different ages, and of them, together with the writings on the parchments, I shall have to speak presently.|$|R
