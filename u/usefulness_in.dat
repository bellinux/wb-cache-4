Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients {{have been}} proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented {{a detailed description of the}} oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E

5|$|Through 1944 'A' Force {{was slowly}} winding down. Clarke was {{involved}} in planning Operation Bodyguard, a major cover plan for the Allied landing in Normandy, and he was tasked with executing the (largely political) deceptions in the Middle Eastern region. However, {{by the end of}} the summer 'A' Force's <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to Caserta. Clarke, along with a skeleton staff, remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the Great Central Hotel where the department was disbanded.|$|E

Because of their <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> ROMP these catalysts are {{sometimes referred to as}} the 3rd generation Grubbs' catalysts. The high ratio of the rate of initiation to the rate of propagation makes these catalysts useful in living polymerization, yielding polymers with low polydispersity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the term}} first {{appeared}} in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch, it gained popularity in the 1995 book by that title, written by the author, and science journalist Daniel Goleman.

25|$|Spironolactone is {{a potent}} and direct {{antagonist}} of the AR, blocking androgens like testosterone from binding to and activating the receptor. The AR antagonism of spironolactone mostly underlies its antiandrogen activity and is responsible for its therapeutic benefits {{in the treatment of}} androgen-dependent conditions like acne, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and its <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> hormone therapy for transgender women. In addition, the AR antagonism of spironolactone is involved in its feminizing side effects like gynecomastia in men.|$|E

In the same year the American Philosophical Society and the City Trusts of Philadelphia awarded the John Scott Medal to Hartness for the flat turret lathe, citing its <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> making artillery.|$|E
25|$|While it {{has been}} {{established}} that Equity Theory provides insight into scenarios of under-compensation, the theory has generally failed to demonstrate its <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> understanding scenarios of overcompensation. In this way, {{it could be said}} Equity Theory is more useful in describing factors that contribute to a lack of motivation rather than increasing motivation in the workplace. Concepts of organizational justice later expanded upon the fundamentals of Equity Theory and pointed to the importance of fairness perceptions in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Above the supercharger's {{critical}} altitude of about 12,000ft (3,658m), an early P-39's performance dropped off rapidly. This limited its <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> traditional fighter missions in Europe {{as well as}} in the Pacific, where it was not uncommon for Japanese bombers to attack at altitudes above the P-39's operational ceiling (which in the tropical hot air was lower than in moderate climates).

25|$|The {{syndrome}} {{was first}} recognized in Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia in an affected family by Denborough et al. in 1962. Denborough did {{much of his}} subsequent work on the condition at the Royal Canberra Hospital. Similar reactions were found in pigs. The efficacy of dantrolene as a treatment was discovered by South African anesthesiologist Gaisford Harrison and reported in a 1975 article published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. After further animal studies corroborated the possible benefit from dantrolene, a 1982 study confirmed its <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> humans.|$|E
25|$|Genealogical DNA {{tests have}} become {{popular due to}} the ease of testing at home and their <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> supplementing genealogical research.

DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied.

25|$|Like {{with other}} {{intelligence}} agencies, failing {{to pass the}} DIA polygraph is a virtual guarantee that an applicant will be judged unsuitable for agency employment.

The same report recommended that DIA seek permanent authority to conduct more intrusive Expanded Scope Screenings due to their supposed <b>usefulness</b> <b>in</b> eliciting admissions from applicants.|$|E
