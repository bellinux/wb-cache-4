5|$|All other {{praseodymium}} isotopes have half-lives <b>under</b> <b>a</b> day (and most <b>under</b> <b>a</b> minute), {{with the}} single exception of 143Pr with a half-life of 13.6days. Both 143Pr and 141Pr occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 141Pr is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of cerium, while that of heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|As Tam was developing, {{residents}} {{attempted to}} evacuate the island by plane, with the primary target of Fiji. Only a few flights took off before officials closed the airport, stranding numerous passengers. Late on January 11, RSMC Nadi placed Tonga and Futuna <b>under</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone alert and also placed Tonga and Wallis <b>under</b> <b>a</b> strong wind warning. Early the next day RSMC Nadi placed northern Tonga <b>under</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone gale warning. Later that morning they canceled the tropical cyclone alert for Wallis and Futuna as Tam was not expected to directly affect Futuna anymore. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi placed Niue <b>under</b> <b>a</b> Tropical cyclone alert, as they predicted that Niue {{would be affected by}} Tam within 24 hours. Early on January 13 RSMC Nadi cancelled the tropical cyclone warnings and alerts for Tonga, whilst at the same time placing Niue <b>under</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone gale warning, however this gale warning was canceled later that day as Tam moved into the southern ocean.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA linear elastic full-space {{composed}} of an upper half-space, a lower half-space and {{a layer of}} three different transversely isotropic materials <b>under</b> <b>an</b> internal load is considered. The axes of symmetry of the different regions {{are assumed to be}} normal to the planar interfaces of the regions and are thus parallel. An arbitrary load in the frequency domain is allowed on a finite patch located at the interface of the upper half-space and the adjacent layer. By means of the complete displacement potentials, the displacements and stresses in the three regions are determined in Fourier–Hankel space in the form of line integrals. The solution can be degenerated to the solution for (i) <b>a</b> full-space <b>under</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary buried load, (ii) a half-space contain a layer bonded to the top of it <b>under</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary surface force, (iii) <b>a</b> half-space <b>under</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary surface load, (iv) a two layer half-space <b>under</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary force applied at the interface of two regions, (v) <b>a</b> half-space <b>under</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary buried force, (vi) a layer of finite thickness fixed at the bottom and <b>under</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary surface load, and (vii) <b>a</b> bi-material full-space <b>under</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary load at the interface of two materials. Examples of the displacements and stresses are obtained numerically and compared to existing solutions...|$|R
