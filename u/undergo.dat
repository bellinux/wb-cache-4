The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional.

40|$|Objective. To assess anxiety among {{pediatric}} {{patients and}} their parents related to initial gastrointestinal endoscopy. Methods. Patients aged < 19 years <b>undergoing</b> initial gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and their parents were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire related to endoscopy in 13 institutions in Japan. Results. The subjects were 128 children, aged 1 month to 17 years. Forty-eight patients (37. 5 %) <b>underwent</b> esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), 32 (25 %) <b>underwent</b> colonoscopy (CS), 39 (30. 5 %) <b>underwent</b> both EGD and CS, 3 (2. 3 %) <b>underwent</b> balloon enteroscopy (BE), 3 (2. 3 %) <b>underwent</b> capsule endoscopy (CE), and 3 (2. 3 %) <b>underwent</b> CE and other endoscopic procedures. In the preendoscopy questionnaire, the most common concerns of the patients and parents before <b>undergoing</b> the procedure were “Pain” (45 % of the patients <b>underwent</b> EGD or BE via the oral approach, and 52 % of the patients <b>underwent</b> CS or BE via the anal approach) and “Procedural accidents related to the endoscopy” (63 % of parents). In the postendoscopy questionnaire, the most common difficulty that patients and parents actually experienced before and after <b>undergoing</b> the procedure was “Hunger. ” Conclusion. A preparatory intervention including an explanation regarding specific concerns before initial GI endoscopy, which this study revealed, could reduce anxiety experienced by both pediatric patients and parents...|$|R
40|$|Language {{varieties}} {{are common in}} any places which consist of heterogeneous people in each region. Tuban {{is one example of}} town which consists of many regions with heterogeneous people and has language varieties of each region. In this paper, the author focused only on two regions: Kingking and Karangsari. This study was aimed at analyzing dialect varieties spoken in Kingking and Karangsari by using the 200 basic vocabularies proposed by Morish Swadesh. The author used phonology, morphology, and semantic analysis. The study found 103 lexicons from Kingking and Karangsari that are different from other Tuban dialects. First, there are phonological differences: nine lexicons <b>undergoing</b> vowel change, six lexicons <b>undergoing</b> consonant change, and seven lexicons <b>undergoing</b> sound omission. On morphological differences, there are 36 lexicons <b>undergoing</b> coinage process, eight lexicons <b>undergoing</b> borrowing process, two lexicons <b>undergoing</b> blending process, three lexicons <b>undergoing</b> clipping process, three lexicons <b>undergoing</b> conversion, 16 lexicons <b>undergoing</b> derivation process, two lexicons <b>undergoing</b> reduplication process, and 12 lexicons <b>undergoing</b> multiple processes. Third is semantic difference, that is change in meaning, which involved 19 lexicons. After differentiating lexicons through three analyses, the author obtained 51. 5 % as the percentage of lexicon criteria. And according to the criteria of isolect or lexicon, the number 51. 5 % must be assumed as dialect differences...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Infrarenal {{abdominal}} {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA) repair warrants lifelong surveillance. Secondary aortic intervention (SAI) outcomes {{may be affected}} by the therapeutic approach. We compared short- and long-term mortality in patients who <b>underwent</b> SAIs after initial aortic repair, either endovascular (EVAR) or open. Methods. Patients who <b>underwent</b> AAA repair between 1986 and 2010 were retrospectively identified in a vascular surgery database {{as well as those who}} <b>underwent</b> SAIs. All-cause mortality and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated. Results. We identified 149 patients who <b>underwent</b> either open AAA repair or EVAR followed by open or endovascular SAI. Seventy-seven patients (51. 7 %) <b>underwent</b> initial EVAR while 72 patients (48. 3 %) <b>underwent</b> open repair. Sixty (78 %) initial EVAR patients <b>underwent</b> secondary EVAR while 17 (22 %) patients had an open SAI. Initial open repair patients were evenly distributed between EVAR and open SAIs. Compared to EVAR, patients who <b>underwent</b> initial open repair had longer intervals between primary aortic interventions (PAIs) and SAIs. Multivariable-adjusted all-cause mortality was significantly higher for patients who <b>underwent</b> initial open AAA repair followed by EVAR when compared to patients who <b>underwent</b> endovascular PAI and SAI. Conclusion. Long-term mortality in patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms who require SAI may be improved by an EVAR-first algorithm...|$|R
