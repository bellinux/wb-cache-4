The objective {{of this paper is}} to study the effect applying ceramic sol coating, which is silica sol via sol gel technique onto SiCp. The various concentrations applied are 2 wt%, 4 wt% and 10 wt % of silica sol. Aluminium metal matrix composite (Al-MMC) reinforced with 10 % and 20 % volume fraction of SiCp produced by powder metallurgy technique with sintering temperature of 550 °C was studied. The surface morphology of Al-MMC is observed using SEM to examine the particle distribution, porosity and flow pattern. While the degradation of SiCp due to interfacial reaction between the particulate and Al matrix is examined by x-ray diffraction (XRD). SiCp degradation is evaluated by the ratio of the SiC to the silicon (Si) XRD peak. From microstructure analysis, the specimens coated with 2 wt % and 4 wt % silica sol coating showed the best result which has <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution,</b> lower porosity and better flow pattern.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{properties}} of a metal matrix composites depend upon the properties of the reinforcement phase, of the matrix and of the interface. A strong interface bonding without any degradation of the reinforcing phase is one of the prime objectives {{in the development of the}} metal matrix composites. Therefore, the objective of this work is to characterize the interface structure of WE 43 /SiC particles composite. Magnesium alloys containing yttrium and neodymium are known to have high specific strength, good creep and corrosion resistance up to 250 °C. The addition of SiC ceramic particles strengthens the metal matrix composite resulting in better wear and creep resistance while maintaining good machinability. In the present study, WE 43 magnesium matrix composite reinforced with SiC particulates was fabricated by stir casting. The SiC particles with 15 μm, 45 μm and 250 μm diameter were added to the WE 43 alloy. The microstructure of the composite was investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and XRD analysis. YSi and Y 2 Si reaction products are observed at the interfaces between SiC particles and WE 43 matrix in the composite stirred at 780 °C. Microstructure characterization of WE 43 MMC with the 45 μm, stirred at 720 °C showed relative <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution.</b> Moreover, the Zr-rich particles at particle/matrix interface were visible instead of Y-Si phases.

40|$|Austenitic 316 L {{stainless}} steel alloy {{is an attractive}} industrial material combining outstanding corrosion resistance, ductility, and biocompatibility, with promising structural applications and biomedical uses. However, 316 L has low strength and wear resistance, limiting its high-performance applicability. Adding secondary hard nanoscale reinforcements to steel matrices, thereby forming steel-matrix nanocomposites (SMCs), can overcome these problems, improving the performance and thereby the applicability of 316 L. However, SMC parts with complex-geometry cannot be easily achieved limiting its application. This can be avoided through additive manufacturing (AM) by generating layer-by-layer deposition using computer-aided design data. Expanding the range of AM-applicable materials is necessary to fulfill industrial demand. This dissertation presents the characteristics of new AM-processed high-performance 316 L-matrix nanocomposites with nanoscale TiC or TiB 2 reinforcements, addressing specific aspects of material design, process control and optimization, and physical metallurgy theory. The nanocomposites were prepared by high-energy ball-milling and consolidated by AM selective laser melting (SLM). Continuous and refined ring-like network structures were obtained with homogenously distributed reinforcements. Additional grain refinement occurred with reinforcement addition, attributed to nanoparticles acting as nuclei for heterogeneous nucleation. The influence of reinforcement content was first investigated; mechanical and tribological behaviors improved with increased reinforcement contents. The compressive yield strengths of composites with TiB 2 or TiC reinforcements were approximately five or two times those of 316 L respectively. Hot isostatic pressing post-treatment effectively eliminated major cracks and pores in SLM-fabricated components. The effects of the SLM processing parameters on the microstructure and mechanical performance were also investigated. Laser re-melting through double-scanning created higher-density SLM-processed parts with improved mechanical properties but longer production times. Certain scanning patterns minimized texture, creating near-isotropic structures. The energy density η crucially improved densification {{at the expense of}} increased grain size, causing mechanical behavior tradeoffs. It also influenced the size and dispersion state of TiC. In-situ SMCs were fabricated by SLM, an encouraging low-cost processing approach for high-performance parts. Interestingly, in-situ SMCs exhibited higher microhardness values in comparison to the ex-situ composites under fixed SLM processing conditions because of fine, <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution.</b> The developed nanocomposites show promise as high-performance materials.

However, no code provision exists for the {{analysis of}} deep beams with web opening. The code implemented strut and tie models are debatable and no unique solution using these models is available. In this study, the finite element method is utilized to study the behavior of reinforced concrete deep beams with and without web openings. Furthermore, the effect of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution</b> on the beam overall capacity has been studied and compared to the Egyptian code guidelines. The damaged plasticity model has been used for the analysis. Models of simply supported deep beams under 3 and 4 -point bending and continuous deep beams with and without web openings have been analyzed. Model verification has shown good agreement to literature experimental work. Results of the parametric analysis have shown that web openings crossing the expected compression struts should be avoided, and the depth of the opening should not exceed 20 % of the beam overall depth.

40|$|Core {{shearing}} and core/face debonding are {{two common}} failure states of sandwich beams which are mainly {{the result of}} excessive shear stresses in the core. Generally, the core made of homogeneous Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) shows better shear resistance in comparison with that made of pure polymer. Usually, this enhancement is however somewhat limited. This paper proposes a methodology to decrease interfacial stresses by presenting the optimal distribution of reinforcing ingredients in the polymeric matrix. For this purpose, a Non-Uniform Rational Bspline (NURBS) based <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution</b> optimizer is developed. This technique aims at the local stress minimization within any arbitrary zone of the design domain. In our methodology, optimization and model analysis (calculation of the objective function and the design constraints) have common data sets. The quadratic NURBS basis functions smoothly define the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution</b> function as a NURBS surface. The core and face sheets are modeled as multi-patches and compatibility in the displacement field is enforced by the penalty method. An adjoint sensitivity method is devised to minimize the objective function within areas of interest defined over arbitrary regions in the design domain. It is also used for efficient updating of design variables through optimization iterations. The method is verified by several examples...|$|R

In Phase 1, 3 birds {{were exposed to}} 20 combinations of five variable-interval values, with each variable-interval value consistently associated with a different color on the side keys. Another 3 pigeons {{were exposed to the}} same 20 conditions, but with a more standard procedure that used a nondifferential discriminative stimulus on the two side keys throughout all conditions. In Phase 2, the differential and nondifferential stimulus conditions were reversed for each pigeon. Each condition lasted for one 5 -hr session and one subsequent 1 -hr session. In the last 14 conditions of each phase, the presence of differential discriminative stimuli decreased the time necessary for differential responding to develop and increased the sensitivity of behavior to <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution</b> in the 1 st hr of training; during the last hours of training in each condition, however, the effects of the differential discriminative stimuli could not be distinguished from the effects of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution</b> per se.

40|$|Although {{concurrent}} schedules may arrange reinforcers irregularly, {{relatively large}} numbers of reinforcers are obtained when an animal changes from one schedule to the other. This paper proposes a quantitative relation that predicts the proportion of reinforcers obtained when an animal {{is working on a}} schedule and the proportion when the animal changes over to a schedule. Basically the relation states that the number of reinforcers obtained while an animal works on a schedule varies directly with the relative amount of time spent working on that schedule; and the number of reinforcers obtained when an animal changes to a schedule varies directly with the relative amount of time spent on the alternate schedule. An important aspect of this relation is that when relative reinforcement rates are less than. 50, more reinforcers are obtained just after an animal changes to a schedule than at all other times when this schedule is engaged. Data obtained both from a stat-bird and a live pigeon were in close agreement with the quantitative predictions. The relation between changing over and reinforcement held across several procedural changes that included changes in relative reinforcement rate, changes from independent to interdependent scheduling procedures, and changes in the variable-interval <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distributions.</b> The results are discussed in terms {{of the effects of the}} local <b>distribution</b> of <b>reinforcement</b> on responding.

Response rates were highest during the variable-interval and lowest during the variable-time schedule. Intermediate response rates occurred during the tandem schedule. The results of a yoked control condition showed that the effects of the tandem schedule were not due simply to changes in <b>reinforcement</b> <b>distribution</b> or frequency.

By comparing simulated and experimental temperature curves of the mould in the different cases, different HTC made the best fit. By increasing the vibrations’ intensity, the HTC increases in the temperature range of solidification of the composite...|$|R
