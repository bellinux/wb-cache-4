50|$|Pere was {{supported}} in his trial by Maata Te Owai, one of Te Kooti's wives. Te Owai testified that Pere had not joined Te Kooti's forces willingly. Other evidence indicated that Pere had been present when several murders of colonists took place, although no <b>uncorroborated</b> <b>evidence</b> was presented that Pere had actually committed or condoned the crime. (Oddly, this evidence better fits the charge of murder than the charge of treason, {{but it was the}} charge of murder that was abandoned.) In the end, Pere was found guilty of treason. The judge deferred Pere's sentencing for a time, but eventually ordered the same punishment as for the others.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{institutional}} barriers {{contribute to}} lack of report and conviction rates. The [...] "cautionary rule" [...] is a law that requires that a judge must show awareness to special dangers on relying on <b>uncorroborated</b> <b>evidence</b> of a complainant, lowering this rate and making victims of sexual violence feel as if the court will deem them untrustworthy. According to a survey that questioned rape victims who did not report the crime to the police, 33.3% of victims cited they feared reprisals, 9.6% cited that they felt the police {{would not be able}} to solve the crime, and 9.2% cited embarrassment as their reasons for not reporting the crime.|$|E

The Guardian, a London-based newspaper, has claimed that Banana had travelled to South Africa, where he eventually died, to receive appropriate treatment for his cancer; however, this assertion relies upon <b>uncorroborated</b> testimonial <b>evidence.</b> He was buried in Zimbabwe in late November 2003. President Robert Mugabe called him [...] "a rare gift to the nation" [...] in a radio address. Banana was buried without the full honours that are traditionally reserved for former heads of state.

40|$|For years, {{judges and}} legislatures in common-law jurisdictions have {{struggled}} to develop effective and equitable rules regarding the admissibility of hearsay statements. Particularly in criminal cases, in which a defendant’s very liberty is often at stake, governments have endeavored to strike the balance between the prosecution’s need for probative evidence against the accused and the defendant’s right to cross-examine those who have made statements against him. Parliament attempted to achieve such parity when it passed the Criminal Justice Act 2003, a watershed {{piece of legislation that}} significantly liberalized the admissibility of hearsay statements in English and Welsh criminal trials. Because the Act allows the jury to convict the defendant based on <b>uncorroborated</b> hearsay <b>evidence</b> alone, however, it contravenes the defendant’s right to a fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights...|$|R
25|$|Eyewitness {{sightings}} {{have been}} claimed {{as early as}} 1995 in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported {{as far north as}} Maine, and as far south as Chile, and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like Russia and the Philippines, but many of the reports have been disregarded as <b>uncorroborated</b> or lacking <b>evidence.</b> Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as canids afflicted by mange.

50|$|Criminal {{defense lawyers}} often propose {{detailed}} jury instructions {{as a mechanism}} to offset undue reliance on eyewitness testimony, when factors shown to undermine its reliability are present in a given case. Many state courts prohibit instructions detailing specific eyewitness reliability factors but will allow a generic instruction, while others find detailed instructions on specific factors to be critical to a fair trial. California allows instructions when police procedures are in conflict with established best practices, for example, and New Jersey mandates an instruction on the cross-race effect when the identification {{is central to the}} case and <b>uncorroborated</b> by other <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
40|$|The federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program {{provides}} critical {{housing subsidy}} assistance to over two million low-income {{families in the}} United States. Each year some of these families have their Section 8 voucher assistance terminated based solely on <b>uncorroborated</b> hearsay <b>evidence</b> relied on by local public housing authorities to prove various program violations. State and federal courts have reached differing conclusions as to whether these terminations violate families’ procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal regulations governing the program. This Note argues that terminations based solely on hearsay evidence violate procedural due process and the federal regulations. Applying the balancing test laid out by the U. S. Supreme Court in Mathews v. Eldridge in 1976, this Note concludes that Section 8 voucher terminations may not be based solely on hearsay evidence without affording families the right to confront and cross-examine those adverse witnesses who provide the evidence relied on by the housing authority. Further, this Note urges that the federal regulations be amended to make this requirement explicit...|$|R

40|$|Many state innocence {{protection}} statutes give courts {{the power}} to impose appropriate sanctions when biological evidence needed for postconviction DNA testing is wrongly destroyed by the government. Constitutional claims based on wrongful evidence destruction are governed by the virtually insurmountable “bad faith” standard articulated in Arizona v. Youngblood. The wrongful destruction of DNA evidence in contravention of state innocence protection laws, however, should be governed by the standards used to adjudicate other “access to evidence” violations in criminal cases, including disclosures mandated {{by the rules of}} criminal procedure, the Jencks Act, and Brady v. Maryland. Under the “access to evidence” sanctions analysis, courts must balance the degree of government culpability in the destruction, the degree of prejudice to the defense, and the strength of the government’s case. In applying this analysis to the wrongful destruction of evidence needed for postconviction DNA testing, courts should give due weight to the exclusive power of DNA evidence to discredit other forms of evidence and prove identity to a scientific certainty. Further, in evaluating the strength of the government’s evidence at trial, courts must carefully scrutinize guilt determinations based largely or exclusively on evidence that has been the predominate cause of wrongful convictions, including stranger eyewitness identifications, non-DNA forensic <b>evidence,</b> <b>uncorroborated</b> confessions, and jailhouse informant testimony. Applying these critical lessons learned from over 200 exonerations to the sanctions determination, appropriate sanctions for the wrongful destruction of DNA evidence include a sentence reduction, a new trial, or dismissal...|$|R

Auberon Waugh on Thorpe's election victory, February 1974The most disappointing result has been Jeremy Thorpe's success in North Devon. Thorpe was already conceited enough, and now threatens {{to become one of the}} great embarrassments of politics. Soon I may have to reveal some of the things in my file on this revolting man. Private Eye, March 1974. [...] In 1972 and 1973 Thorpe's political fortunes, and those of the Liberals, revived. Thorpe's personal standing was enhanced when, on 14 March 1973, he married Marion, Countess of Harewood, whose former husband was a first cousin to the Queen. After a series of by-election victories and local government gains, an electoral breakthrough for the party looked plausible when Heath called a general election in February 1974. In that election, with more than six million votes (19.3% of those cast), the Liberals achieved by far their best election result since the Second World War, but under the first-past-the-post voting system this large vote translated into only 14 seats. However, as neither major party won an overall majority, these seats gave Thorpe (whose personal majority in North Devon increased to 11,072) significant leverage. He was briefly in coalition discussions with Heath, who was prepared to give cabinet posts to Thorpe and other senior Liberals. Thorpe later denied that there was any serious prospect of agreement, and in March 1974 Harold Wilson formed a minority Labour government. In the second 1974 general election, in October, Wilson achieved a narrow majority; the Liberals lost ground, with 5.3 million votes and 13 MPs.|$|R
