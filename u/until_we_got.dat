500|$|Weaver began {{recording}} Saturday Night! – The Album in 1986. He {{was being}} {{barred from the}} studio where he originally recorded his single for [...] "P.S.K. What Does It Mean?" [...] and went to INS Studios in New York. To compose the music, Weaver first started working on the drums, stating that [...] "by 1985 I had mastered the 909." [...] After completing the drums, Weaver worked on lyrics and vocals when he [...] "smoked and drank <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> silly enough. At that point, {{the first thing that}} hit my mind-that was the song". Some songs were performed with live musicians such as [...] "B-Boy Rhyme and Riddle" [...] which had a live drummer brought in by engineer Joe Nicolo. The music on [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was the result of DJ Codemoney forgetting a plug for the 909. Weaver used the drum machine at the studio to record the song without the 909 on hand and accidentally pushed a button that sent the kick and snare to go to the timbales sound. This new sound was used for the song [...] "Saturday Night".|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine relationship, {{sometimes}} referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Klaine" [...] by Glee fans and the media, developed slowly. As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really want it to happen. It's funny how many people want to see these boys hook up. We'll see." [...] Based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy decided to have Blaine become Kurt's love interest. Criss noted: [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." ...|$|E

500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there".|$|E
500|$|The show's eighth season {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. The A.V. Club {{noted that the}} first eight seasons of The X-Files were [...] "good-to-great", and that the eighth season of the show was [...] "revitalized by the new 'search for Mulder' story-arc." [...] John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions gave the season a favorable review, calling it [...] "great" [...] and describing its episodes as [...] "pretty strong". Collin Polonowonski of DVD Times said that the season included [...] "more hits than misses overall" [...] but was throughout negative about the mythology episodes claiming them to be the [...] "weakest" [...] episodes in the season. Many critics eventually accepted Doggett's character. Anita Gates of The New York Times said that most fans had [...] "accepted" [...] {{the introduction of the}} character and further stated that he actually looked [...] "Like a Secret Service Agent." [...] Carter commented on the character, saying [...] "Everybody likes Robert Patrick and the character", but further stating that the fans [...] "miss" [...] Duchovny's character, Mulder. Dave Golder of SFX called Patrick [...] "superb" [...] and noted that his entrance in the series [...] "inject a sense of pragmatism and good old-fashioned plain-speaking in to the show which we didn't realise was missing <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker said that Patrick's portrayal of Doggett was [...] "hardboiled alertness", giving mostly positive reviews about his inclusion. Cynthia Littleton of The Hollywood Reporter described the season as the show's [...] "swan song".|$|E
500|$|The cast of FOX musical series Glee {{performed}} {{this song}} on the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", with Heather Morris' character, Brittany Pierce, taking the lead. The episode revolved around teen drinking and its dangers. The members of Glee Club are asked to perform at the school's alcohol awareness assembly, in which [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{is one of the}} songs performed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that the song's inclusion in the episode was superfluous, stating that it was just an excuse to get a Kesha song on Glee. VanDerWerff however, wrote that he [...] "REALLY liked Heather Morris'" [...] rendition of the song. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised Brittany's choreography and overall performance in [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "The huge star of this number was clearly Brittany, who more and more every week proves that she needs to be moved to the forefront of this show's big performances and storylines." [...] Gonzalez gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a B, calling it [...] "pure, fun entertainment up <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the part straight out of the mind of Gordie LaChance. So even though the purple vomit was a bit too much for this weak viewer, the performance made me add a Ke$ha song to my iTunes, which I never thought would happen." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "Love Brittany as we do, we wish Rachel or Mercedes stepped up to the mic. The performance is less risqué than their Pep Rally [...] "Push It" [...] but winds up causing more controversy when Brittany pukes on Rachel and Santana also vomits up grey slush. It's a fitting end to the song, and the episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{production}} {{on the second}} season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron. Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, {{a member of the}} rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into sort of the middle of the season." [...] Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song [...] "Blackbird" [...] in [...] "Original Song", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." [...] When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other Glee relationships by making their pairing [...] "as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's." [...] This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: [...] "They're solid. They have problems—you have two stars dating each other, there's going to be some competition there." [...] In the second-season finale, they each tell the other, [...] "I love you", and early in the third season they decide to have sex for the first time. The Kurt–Blaine relationship has been well received by critics, and they were named [...] "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium" [...] late in the second season by Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post.|$|E

In the end I was with Briek Schotte and Enkel Thiétard. They were happy just to follow me. We made an agreement. I said that they could stay with me <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to Kwatrecht. I wouldn't drop them provided they'd do their best to work with me. They were happy with that. They didn't have a choice. Under the bridge at Kwatrecht I just got rid of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was Ferrari's eighth one-two {{finish of}} the season. Barrichello said [...] "To win, it was very, very, very good... I {{got to the}} last corner, I didn't {{know what to do}} and nothing has been said. Michael was just very kind to, you know, let us finish equally. I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?" [...] Schumacher said [...] "The end of the race was not planned... We tried to cross the line {{together}} but failed by a tiny bit and in fact we did not know who had won <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out of the cars.

2500|$|During {{the period}} of filming, Murray {{was in the midst}} of marital {{problems}} and several crew reported his attitude as erratic. Murray had wanted to make the film less of a comedy as to make it more contemplative, against Ramis' own direction to keep it as a comedy. Rather than to handle Murray's constant phone calls, Ramis had Murray work with Rubin in New York City directly to adjust the script to satisfy Murray's requests. Actor Stephen Tobolowsky described the script changes: [...] "When I got the part, it was still kind of a mediocre Bill Murray movie," [...] he said. [...] "You know, Bill Murray, with no consequences, in comic situations ... It wasn’t <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into the shooting that everything turned on its head. And it became not only a good movie, not only a great movie, but a classic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large {{controversy}} {{in the media and}} in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man [...] "sparked a playground craze" [...] where [...] "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'" [...] As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.|$|E
2500|$|Barton started {{mixing the}} album in mid-April 2013, after the {{recording}} {{had just been}} finalized, and mixing was finished {{by the end of}} the month. It was then, that the album's short length, just 35 minutes and 3 seconds, surprised even the band: [...] "It wasn't <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the masters sessions that we realized, 'Wow, this is like an old Van Halen record'..." [...] Wilton says that it wasn't possible for them to deliver more within the time frame they had, adding: [...] "To tell you the truth, we were at one point considering just doing 5 songs and doing an EP. But, basically, Century Media said it would be better if we could do an album." [...] Its length would later become a point of criticism, but Wilton has explained that the band prefers to choose quality over quantity: [...] "we don't want to have an album with filler songs. We want every song to be quality. I'd rather have a 35 minute badass album, than a 50 minute long with a bunch of epic songs that really shouldn't have been on the CD." [...] La Torre has added: [...] "We tend to focus on good content, we didn't want to have ten more minutes or fifteen more minutes of music, just to say that we could." ...|$|E

6000|$|July 15.--This day I did {{not attempt}} to work, but spent my time in the morning in making the {{necessary}} catalogue and distribution of two or three chests of books which I have got home from the binder, Niece Anne acting as my Amanuensis. In the evening we drove to Huntly Burn, and took tea there. Returning home we escaped a considerable danger. The iron screw bolts of the driving-seat suddenly giving way, the servants were very nearly precipitated upon the backs of the horses. Had it been down hill instead of being on the level, the horses must have taken fright, and the consequences might have been fatal. Indeed, they had almost taken fright as it was, had not Peter Matheson,[301] who, in Mr. Fag's phrase, I take to be, [...] "the discreetest of whips,"[302] kept his presence of mind, when losing his equilibrium, so that he managed to keep the horses in hand <b>until</b> <b>we</b> all <b>got</b> out.

"When {{you left}} us in London, Wallingford, I {{supposed}} {{we were on}} the point of sailing for the West Indies, but a better appointment soon after offering in the East, my destination was changed to Bombay.

Nothing occurred <b>until</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> within three or four days' sail of our port, when we fell in with la Pauline, and were captured. At first, I think Captain Le Compte would have been willing to let me go on parole, but no opportunity offered, and we went with the ship to Manilla. While there, the melancholy loss happened, which, no doubt, you have comprehended from our mourning; and I was strongly in hopes of making some arrangements that would still enable me to save my situation. But, by this time, Monsieur Le Compte had become an open admirer of Emily, and I suppose it is hopeless to expect any liberation, so long as he can invent excuses to frustrate it." ...|$|R

It was a confusion of white water rushing past and over me. Then for a moment I stopped, and at once made a clutch at the ground that I had been rolling over. There was a big strain, and I was hauled backwards as if a team of wild horses were pulling at me.
