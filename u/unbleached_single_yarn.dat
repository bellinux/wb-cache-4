40|$|This paper investigates a {{multispectral}} imaging {{approach to}} colour measurement and colour matching of <b>single</b> <b>yarns.</b> The {{small size of}} a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> {{makes it impossible for}} spectrophotometers directly to acquire its spectral reflectance. Multispectral imaging systems, on the other hand, have the potential to measure the reflectance of <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> as they can record both the spectral and the spatial information of a sample. A multispectral imaging system, namely imaging colour measurement, has been developed to conduct colour measurement of <b>single</b> <b>yarns.</b> A <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is first detected from backgrounds by a modified K-means clustering method. The reflectance of the <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is then specified by an averaging method. Comparative experiments based on 100 pairs of <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> and corresponding yarn windings show that the reflectance magnitude of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> acquired by imaging colour measurement is smaller than that of corresponding yarn winding measured by a Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer. Experiments on 16 <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> show that the repeatability and spatial reproducibility of the imaging colour measurement system in measuring a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> colour are 0. 1185 and 0. 2827 CMC(2 : 1) units. A colour matching comparison experiment (pass or fail), using 24 pairs of <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> and corresponding pairs of solid-colour yarn dyed fabrics, shows that <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> measured by imaging colour measurement can achieve similar colour matching results to solid-colour yarn dyed fabrics measured by the Datacolor 650 spectrophotometer, with degrees of similarity of 87. 5 and 83. 3 % when the CMC(2 : 1) and CIE 2000 (2 : 1 : 1) colour difference formulas are employed.

First, in the manufacturing process of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn,</b> a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a tape yarn, and after that the <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> was produced by adding a proper twist to the tape yarn through a twisting machine.

Then, the Hanji paper yarns, count of 16 and 11  Ne, were produced after twisting 600 and 520  tpm (Z-twist), respectively, using a twisting machine (Murata® 363). The combination yarn was manufactured by combining paper yarn and core spun yarn.

H 577 P ITC 2015 Luoxxv, 211 leaves :color illustrations; 30 cmCommercial spectrophotometers {{and current}} {{state-of-the-art}} digital camera imaging systems {{are unable to}} measure the spectral reflectance of yarn dyed fabrics, the former can only measure the average reflectance of an area and the latter can only measure the tristimulus values derived from the camera's RGB responses. Multispectral imaging systems, on the other hand, {{have the potential to}} measure the reflectance of a multi-colour object, such as yarn dyed fabrics, since they can record both of the spectral and spatial information of a sample. In this thesis, colour measurement of yarn dyed fabrics based on the multispectral imaging technique is studied. The major factor restraining multispectral imaging systems from application in textile is the difficulty of correlation the measurement results of a yarn dyed fabric to the true colours of the yarns. The spectral response of multispectral imaging systems to yarn dyed fabrics is dramatically affected by irregular 3 D shapes of yarns, inter-reflection between neighbouring yarns, and interstices between weft and warp yarns. In this thesis, a novel reflection model is first proposed to estimate the interaction between light and a yarn dyed fabric surface. Surface texture, illumination occlusion and inter-reflection are taken into account. The reflection model is then verified by reducing the influence of texture on spectrophotometric colour. Derived from the proposed reflection model, reflectance and tristimulus values of yarn dyed fabrics with different texture structures are linear. The linear relationship in the reflectance space can be used to estimate a theoretical reflectance which discounts the influence of texture. Experimental results show that the impact of texture on colour for yarn dyed fabric samples in four colour centres and twenty-one texture structures can be reduced by 79 %, 55 %, 71 % and 57 %, respectively. Based on the proposed reflection model, multispectral imaging colour measurement of yarn dyed fabrics are achieved through a series of image processing techniques, namely, colour region segmentation, solid-colour and multi-colour region detection, and weft and warp yarn segmentation. Firstly, a yarn dyed fabric image is partitioned into dominant colour regions by a Gaussian model. The Gaussian model is used to reconstruct the CIELAB colour histograms of dominant colour regions from those of yarns. A hierarchical segmentation structure is then devised to obtain dominant colour regions by combining histogram segmentation results in three colour channels. Experimental results shows the proposed approach has excellent performance for dominant colour region segmentation with high computational efficiency. Secondly, a dominant colour region is detected as solid-colour or multi-colour by CIExyY histogram distributions. Derived from the proposed reflection model, the CIExyY histogram of a multi-colour yarn dyed fabric accords with a combination of two Gaussian distributions, whereas for that of a solid-colour yarn dyed fabric, it correlated to one Gaussian distribution. Experiments on real yarn dyed fabric samples demonstrate that solid-colour and multi-colour yarn dyed fabric regions can be distinguished in terms of CIExyY histogram distribution. Finally, a multi-colour yarn dyed fabric is segmented to weft and warp yarns by a modified K-means clustering method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can segment weft and warp yarns in yarn dyed fabric images, with both high segmentation accuracy and fast processing speed. In addition, the proposed reflection model can be utilized to accomplish multispectral imaging colour measurement of <b>single</b> <b>yarns.</b> <b>Single</b> <b>yarns</b> are the elemental weaving components of yarn dyed fabrics and have much simpler structures. The multispectral imaging colour of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is not affected by surface texture and inter-reflection. The colour measurement of <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> is achieved by two steps. Firstly, a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> is segmented from backgrounds by an image difference method. Secondly, the reflectance of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> can be specified by different weighting methods. Experimental results show that multispectral imaging colour measurement of <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> can achieve a repeatability of 0. 1185 CMC(2 : 1) units and a spatial reproducibility of 0. 2827 CMC(2 : 1) units. Experimental results also show that <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> measured by multispectral imaging systems can accomplish the similar colour matching results as solid-colour yarn dyed fabrics measured by spectrophotometers. Finally, an optical-based approach is proposed to explore the relation between the multispectral imaging colour of a <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> and the spectrophotometric colour of the corresponding yarn card. A colour mapping equation between the <b>single</b> <b>yarn</b> and corresponding yarn card can be then found by the simplex optimal method. Experimental results show that colour difference between <b>single</b> <b>yarns</b> and corresponding yarn cards reduces from 2. 97 to 1. 20 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of training samples and from 3. 09 to 1. 37 CMC(2 : 1) units for 50 pairs of testing samples.

The technology is a versatile and cost effective alternative to two-folding, Sirospun or sizing. It offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity. Solospun is a simple, inexpensive, clip-on attachment for the spinning of long staple, weavable <b>singles</b> <b>yarns.</b> The technology {{is the result of}} a joint development between CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, The Woolmark Company and WRONZ and was commercially released in 1998.

Each roller is positioned immediately below, and parallel to, each top front draft roller where it interacts with the emerging drafted fibre strand before twist insertion. The roller-fibre interaction subtly changes the structure of the yarn, which dramatically increases its abrasion resistance. This allows Solospun yarns to be woven without two-folding or sizing, providing significant cost savings. Depending on fabric structure, weaving performance is equivalent to that of conventional two-fold yarns. Fabrics woven from Solospun yarns are of good quality and appearance. Some aspects, including preferred hand and FAST results, are equal or superior to two-fold yarn fabrics. As with compact and condensed spinning, Solospun offers significant reductions in yarn hairiness.
