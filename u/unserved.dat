25|$|Once {{the idea}} of the public library as an agency worthy of {{taxation}} was broadly established during the 19th and early 20th centuries, librarians through actions of the American Library Association and its division devoted to public libraries, the Public Library Association, sought ways to identify standards and guidelines to ensure quality service. Legislation such as the Library Services Act and the Library Services and Construction Act ensured that <b>unserved</b> areas and <b>unserved</b> groups would have access to library services.|$|E

25|$|Public-Private Partnerships convened through {{executive}} order or statute to broadband availability, identify <b>unserved</b> and underserved areas, assess supply and demand-side barriers, create local technology teams to implement programs to increase computer ownership, digital literacy, aggregate demand, and accelerate broadband build-out.|$|E
25|$|The term of {{supervised}} {{release that}} {{is subject to}} revocation is the term originally imposed by the court, not the existing <b>unserved</b> term of supervised release. The courts are divided on whether, when imposing a new sentence after revocation, the court can consider {{the seriousness of the}} offense, since this is a factor that Congress deliberately omitted from the list applicable to revocation sentencing. More than one revocation of supervised release is permitted. The statute provides for aggregated, rather than per violation, statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for violations of supervised release.|$|E
25|$|Despite all the effort, there {{remained}} a significant {{disparity between the}} high coverage levels in the cities and the coverage available in the underdeveloped rural regions. Progress on providing some minimum access had been good. Of a total of 3,914 village development committees across the country, 306 were <b>unserved</b> by December 2009. In order to meet future demand, {{it was estimated that}} Nepal needed to invest around US$135 million annually in its telecom sector. In 2009, the telecommunication sector alone contributed to 1% of the nation's GDP. As of 30 September 2012, Nepal has 1,828,700 Facebook users.|$|E
25|$|Biographer Karen Holliday Tanner {{found that}} Holliday {{had been arrested}} 17 times before his 1881 shootout in Tombstone. Only one arrest was for murder, which {{occurred}} in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, {{for which he was}} acquitted. In the preliminary hearing following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday's actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell's murder went <b>unserved</b> when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges.|$|E
25|$|Local buses used {{to serve}} the tunnel in the past. Route 82 ran between Stepney East Station (now Limehouse) and St. Marychurch Street in Rotherhithe, before being {{withdrawn}} in 1968. The tunnel remained <b>unserved</b> until route P14 commenced in 1988 from Surrey Quays and the Isle of Dogs. This route was withdrawn and partially replaced by a new 395 route in 1999 running from Limehouse (Burdett Road) instead of the Isle of Dogs. The 395 route was withdrawn without replacement on 28 April 2006, due to high running costs and low passenger usage. By {{this time it was}} the only Transport for London bus route that still used mini-buses, which were necessary due to the tunnel's width restriction.|$|E
25|$|Tompkins County became {{involved}} in supporting suburban routes and in developing rural transit service. The County formed TOMTRAN to extend fixed-route bus service to Dryden, Caroline and Newark Valley in 1982, Groton (1983), Newfield and Ulysses (1985), and Lansing and Danby (1991). In 1999, TCAT initiated bus service to Enfield, the last <b>unserved</b> town in the County. In 1992, the City, Cornell and County built a $5 million transit facility to base transit operations and fleet maintenance including GADABOUT. In 1996, the New York State Legislature adopted a state law that authorized TCAT to be created as a joint partnership, governmental entity, and on April 1, 1998, the City of Ithaca, Cornell University and Tompkins County established TCAT as a joint venture (public entity) to operate public transit service in Tompkins County, service began in 1999, establishing a unified route and fare system. TCAT re-organized itself as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, TCAT. Inc. in 2005 with representatives of City of Ithaca, Cornell University, and Tompkins County serving on its Board of Directors.|$|E
500|$|A {{long stretch}} of the Northway through the Adirondack Park had been an <b>unserved</b> zone for {{cellular}} telephone service. In 2007, a driver who crashed off the road was unable to summon help, prompting messages from local governments to telephone companies to add new wireless towers {{to address the problem}} and warning signs to inform travelers of the so-called [...] "dark zone". Throughout this area, roadside emergency call boxes are located approximately every two miles {{on both sides of the}} roadway. These boxes use a two-way UHF radio network to connect directly to New York State Police dispatchers. The first of 13 new cellular phone towers along I-87 was installed in October 2008. A second cellular phone tower was completed just one month later.|$|E

2500|$|Credit {{unions are}} not-for-profit {{financial}} cooperatives. [...] In {{the early stages}} of development of a nation's financial system, <b>unserved</b> and underserved populations must rely on risky and expensive informal financial services from sources like money lenders, ROSCAs and saving at home. [...] Credit unions proved they could meet demand for financial services that banks could not: [...] from professional, middle class and poorer people. [...] Those that served poorer urban and rural communities became an important source of microfinance.|$|E
2500|$|The reform {{resulted}} in new generation facilities, which were built and {{financed by the}} private sector, and investment in distribution by the privatized companies. Thanks to the new investments, {{between the end of}} 2000 and mid-2003, effective capacity experienced a 43% increase, with the distribution network also showing improvement. This led to temporary reduction in blackouts and distribution losses and increasing operating efficiency, the combination of which translated in improvements in the quality of service. <b>Unserved</b> energy decreased to 11% of the potential demand in 2002, down from 40% in 1991. In the same period, capacity deficits to meet unsuppressed demand were estimated to have fallen from 30% to 16%. However, rising oil prices, the introduction of generalized subsidies and political interference negatively affected the sector's financial health. In 2003, these unfavorable conditions and strong political pressure led the government to repurchase Union Fenosa's shares in the privatized distribution companies EdeNorte and EdeSur. These companies have experienced a deteriorating operating efficiency since their renationalization., ...|$|E
2500|$|Prosecutors in Mexico have {{asserted}} that prosecution under Article IV of the Mexican Penal Code is sufficient {{compliance with the}} Extradition Treaty and allows Mexico to try fugitives for crimes committed in a foreign territory by a Mexican citizen. The trial is conducted in accordance with Mexican Federal Law when the accused has not been tried {{in the country where}} he committed the offense. [...] Although efforts are underway to address the widespread corruption which has historically plagued Mexican judicial and law enforcement communities, {{little is known about the}} results of Article IV prosecutions. [...] Often warrants remain in their system, <b>unserved,</b> for years. [...] Prosecutions are commenced and then dismissed or have their sentences substantially reduced in appellate courts. [...] No verifiable system exists to track sentences served. [...] Demands for such information have been mostly ignored by the Mexican government. [...] Informal surveys of law enforcement regarding the results of such prosecution reveal an abysmal record. [...] Approximately 85% of the cases appear to have never been prosecuted. [...] The remaining cases appear to result in acquittals or vastly reduced sentences in comparison to what would have been the sentence in the United States. [...] The Extradition Treaty bars future extradition once a “trial” has been conducted in either country and, regardless of the result, double jeopardy provisions generally bar subsequent prosecution in many US States if the suspect returns to the United States, regardless of the outcome in Mexico.|$|E

6000|$|Then, of course, Nyankupon {{would receive}} the best sacrifices of all, {{as the most}} {{powerful}} deity? Far from that, Nyankupon received no sacrifice, and had no priests. No priest would have a traditional way of serving him. As the unlucky man in Voltaire says to his guardian angel, 'It is well worth while to have a presiding genius,' so the Tshis and Bantu might ironically remark, 'A useful thing, a new Supreme Being!' A quarter of a continent or so adopts a new foreign god, and leaves him planté là; <b>unserved,</b> unhonoured, and unsung. He therefore came to be thought too remote, or too indifferent, 'to interfere directly in the affairs of the world.' 'This idea was probably caused {{by the fact that the}} natives had not experienced any material improvement in their condition ... although they also had become followers of the god of the whites.'[33] ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Huxley now enforces {{his theory}} by a {{parallel}} between the religion of Tonga and the religion of Israel under the Judges. He quotes Mariner,[18] whose statement avers {{that there is a}} supreme Tongan being: 'of his origin they had no idea, rather supposing him to be eternal. His name is Tá-li-y-Tooboo = [...] "Wait-there-Tooboo."' 'He is a great chief {{from the top of the}} sky down to the bottom of the earth.' He, and other 'original gods' of his making, are carefully and absolutely discriminated from the atua, which are 'the human soul after its separation from the body.' All Tongan gods are atua (Elohim), but all atua are not 'original gods,' <b>unserved</b> by priests, and unpropitiated by food or libation, like the highest God, Tá-li-y-Tooboo, the Eternal of Tonga. 'He occasionally inspires the How' (elective King), but often a How is not inspired at all by Tá-li-y-Tooboo, any more than Saul, at last, was inspired by Jehovah.|$|E
60|$|The mysterious {{struggle}} {{was going on}} with confused thuds of bare feet, in a mute wrestling match, no human sound, hiss, groan, murmur, or exclamation coming through the curtain. A chair fell over, not with a crash but lightly, as if just grazed, and a faint metallic ring of the tin bath succeeded. Finally the tense silence, as of two adversaries locked in a deadly grip, was ended by the heavy, dull thump of a soft body flung against the inner partition of planks. It seemed to shake the whole bungalow. By that time, walking backward, his eyes, his very throat, strained with fearful excitement, his extended arm still pointing at the curtain, Wang had disappeared through the back door. Once out in the compound, he bolted round the end of the house. Emerging innocently between the two bungalows he lingered and lounged in the open, where anybody issuing from any of the dwellings was bound to see him--a self-possessed Chinaman idling there, with nothing but perhaps an <b>unserved</b> breakfast on his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wealth has {{accumulated}} itself into masses; and poverty, also in accumulation enough, lies impassably separated from it; opposed, uncommunicating, like forces in {{positive and negative}} poles. The gods of this lower world sit aloft on glittering thrones, less happy than Epicurus's gods, but as indolent, as impotent; while the boundless living chaos of ignorance and hunger welters, terrific in its dark fury, under their feet. How much among us might be likened to a whited sepulcher: outwardly all pomp and strength, but inwardly full of horror and despair and dead men's bones! Iron highways, with their wains fire-winged, are uniting all {{the ends of the}} land; quays and moles, with their innumerable stately fleets, tame the ocean into one pliant bearer of burdens; labor's thousand arms, of sinew and of metal, all-conquering everywhere, from the tops of the mount down to the depths of the mine and the caverns of the sea, ply unweariedly for the service of man; yet man remains <b>unserved.</b> He has subdued this planet, his habitation and inheritance, yet reaps no profit from the victory. Sad to look upon: in the highest stage of civilization nine-tenths of mankind have to struggle in the lowest battle of savage or even animal man--the battle against famine. Countries are rich, prosperous in all manner of increase, beyond example; but the men of these countries are poor, needier than ever of all sustenance, outward and inward; of belief, of knowledge, of money, of food." ...|$|E
6000|$|The tradesman's {{pleasure}} {{should be}} in his business, his companions should be his books; and {{if he has a}} family, he makes his excursions up stairs, and no farther; when he is there, a bell or a call brings him down; and while he is in his parlour, his shop or his warehouse never misses him; his customers never go away <b>unserved,</b> his letters never come in and are unanswered. None of my cautions aim at restraining a tradesman from diverting himself, as we call it, with his fireside, or keeping company with his wife and children: there are so few tradesmen ruin themselves that way, and so few ill consequences happen upon an uxorious temper, that I will not so much as rank it with the rest; nor can it be justly called one of the occasions of a tradesman's disasters; on the contrary, it is too often that the want of a due complacency there, the want of taking delight there, estranges the man from not his parlour only, but his warehouse and shop, and every part of business that ought to engross both his mind and his time. That tradesman who does not delight in his family, will never long delight in his business; for, as one great end of an honest tradesman's diligence is the support of his family, and the providing for the comfortable subsistence of his wife and children, so the very sight of, and above all, his tender and affectionate care for his wife and children, is the spur of his diligence; that is, it puts an edge upon his mind, and makes him hunt the world for business, as hounds hunt the woods for their game. When he is dispirited, or discouraged by crosses and disappointments, and ready to lie down and despair, the very sight of his family rouses him again, and he flies to his business with a new vigour; 'I must follow my business,' says he, 'or we must all starve, my poor children must perish;' in a word, he that is not animated to diligence by the very sight and thought of his wife and children being brought to misery and distress, {{is a kind of a}} deaf adder that no music will charm, or a Turkish mute that no pity can move: in a word, he is a creature not to be called human, a wretch hardened against all the passions and affections that nature has furnished to other animals; and as there is no rhetoric of use to such a kind of man as that, so I am not talking to such a one, he must go among the incurables; for, where nature cannot work, what can argument assist? ...|$|E
6000|$|I can now at last {{tell you}} the sad story of the book for Emily Morgan--which I am having put {{up to go to}} you with this; as well as explain a little my long silence.

[...] "But," [...] you will say, [...] "why didn't you send the promised volume for E. M. from London then? What matter to us where it came from so long as it came?" [...] To which I reply: [...] "Well, I had in this house a small row of books available for the purpose and among which I could choose--also which I came away, in my precipitation, too soon to catch up in flight. In London I should have to go and buy the thing, my own production--while I have two or three bran-new volumes, which will be an economy to a man utterly depleted by the inordinate number of copies of The Outcry that he has given away and all but six of which he has had to pay for--his sanguinary (admire my restraint!) publisher allowing him but six." [...] "Why then couldn't you write home and have one of the books in question sent you?--or have it sent to Hastings directly from your house?" [...] "Because I am the happy possessor of a priceless parlourmaid who loves doing up books, and other parcels, and does them up beautifully, and if the volume comes to me here, to be inscribed, I shall then have to do it up myself, an act for which I have absolutely no skill and which I dread and loathe, and tumble it forth clumsily and insecurely! Besides I was vague as to which of my works I did have on the accessible shelf--I only knew I had some--and would have to look and consider and decide: which I have now punctually done. And the thing will be beautifully wrapped!" [...] "That's all very well; but why then didn't you write and explain why it was that you were keeping us <b>unserved</b> and uninformed?" [...] "Oh, because from the moment I go up to town I plunge--plunge into the great whirlpool of postal matter, social matter, and above all, this time, grey matter of cerebration--having got back to horrible arrears of work and being at best so postally submerged during these last weeks that every claim of that sort that could be temporarily dodged was a claim that found me shameless and heartless." [...] But you see the penalty of all is that I have to write all this now.|$|E
