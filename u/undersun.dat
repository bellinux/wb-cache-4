Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of 34 monocarbonyl curcumin analogs as novel anti-inflammatory agents. Among the analogs, the symmetrical heterocyclic type displayed the strongest inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Analogs S 1 –S 5 and AS 29 reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) production in a dose-dependent manner and also displayed excellent stability and low cytotoxicity in vitro. In addition, analog S 1 dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, analogs S 1 and S 4 displayed a significant protective effect on LPS-induced septic death in mouse models, with 40 % and 50 % survival rates, respectively. These data demonstrate that the heterocyclic monocarbonyl curcumin analogs have potential therapeutic effects in acute inflammatory diseases.

Novel anti-inflammatory alternatives are still in urgent need. In this study, we designed and synthesized 30 indole- 2 -one and 7 -aza- 2 -oxindole derivatives based on the skeleton of tenidap, and their anti-inflammatory activity was determined by evaluating the inhibitory potency against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interleukin (IL) - 6 release in RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Quantitative SAR (structure–activity relationship) analysis revealed that a high molecular polarizability and low lipid/water partition coefficient (ALogP) in indole- 2 -one are beneficial for anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, compounds 7 i and 8 e inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL- 6, COX- 2, PGES, and iNOS in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and 7 i exhibited a significant protection from LPS-induced septic death in mouse models. These data present a series of new indole- 2 -one compounds with potential therapeutic effects in acute inflammatory diseases. Keywords: anti-inflammation, macrophages, sepsi...|$|E
