40|$|Graduation date: 2000 An {{analysis}} and modeling method of the diagnostic {{characteristics of a}} mechanical or electromechanical system is presented. Diagnosability analysis is especially relevant given the complexities and functional interdependencies of modern-day systems, since improvements in diagnosability {{can lead to a}} reduction of a system's life-cycle costs. The diagnosis process of a mechanical system, involving an observation phase and a testing phase, is described, as well as how failure types (the way particular system failure modes occur) impact the diagnostic process. Failure and diagnostic analysis leads to system diagnosability modeling with the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and component-indication relationship analysis. Finally, methods are developed for translating the diagnosability model into mathematical methods for computing metrics such as distinguishabilty, testability, and Mean Time Between <b>Unscheduled</b> <b>Removals</b> (MTBUR). These methods involve the use of matrices to represent the failure and replacement characteristics of the system. Diagnosability metrics are extracted by matrix multiplication. These metrics are useful when comparing the diagnosability of proposed designs or predicting the life-cycle costs of fault isolation...|$|E
40|$|Costs {{associated}} with unscheduled and preventive maintenance can {{contribute significantly to}} an airline's expenditure. Reliability analysis can help to identify and plan for maintenance events. Reliability analysis in industry is often limited to statistically based approaches that incorporate failure times as the primary stochastic variable, with additional strict assumptions regarding independence of events and underlying distributions of failure phenomena. This foregoes the complex nature of aircraft operations, where {{a whole range of}} operational factors may influence the probability of occurrence of a maintenance event. The aim of this research is to identify operational factors affecting component reliability and to assess whether these can be used {{to reduce the number of}} unscheduled occurrences (i. e. failures). To do so, a data-driven approach is adopted where historical operational and maintenance data is gathered and analysed to identify operational factors with a measurable influence on maintenance event occurrence. Both time-independent and time-dependent Proportional Hazard Models (PHMs), models which incorporate operational factors as covariates, are employed to generate reliability estimates. Results obtained from analysing historical data of a set of ten components with respect to <b>unscheduled</b> <b>removals</b> indicates that adopting new maintenance schedules, derived from the proposed reliability models, could reduce the number of unscheduled occurrences by approximately 37 %. The potential benefits of adopting the proposed strategy are extensive. Nonetheless, numerous assumptions have been introduced to overcome challenges imposed by the complex nature of the data. To overcome these challenges, recommendations are made for future development of the proposed approach Aerospace Transport & Operation...|$|E
40|$|The use of prognostics {{and health}} {{management}} (PHM) systems can improve operational reliability by reducing delays and cancellations caused by unscheduled maintenance events and no-fault-founds (NFFs). While PHM systems have no influence on components’ failure distributions, they {{can improve the}} operational reliability of an aircraft. This is achieved by performing maintenance tasks prior a component failure based on the remaining useful life (RUL) predicted by the PHM system and by reducing NFFs based on health monitoring information of the PHM system. This study presents {{an analysis of the}} monetary potential of an improved operational reliability and reduced maintenance costs realized by the use of a PHM system. Therefore an aircraft lifecycle cost-benefit approach is chosen to conduct an economic assessment from an airline perspective. By modeling the aircraft operation based on a weekly flight plan and the maintenance simulated as discrete events within the aircraft life-cycle it is possible to analyze the influence of changes in operational reliability on aircraft utilization and the net benefit for the operator. To show the potential benefits of PHM systems within different aircraft systems (ATA-Chapters) a parameter variation of a notional aircraft system has been performed on a 150 -seat short-range aircraft. Effects based on PHM have been modeled by a variation of mean times to repair (MTTR), mean times between <b>unscheduled</b> <b>removals</b> (MTBUR) and the aircraft price. The results show the monetary potential for an airline, depending on the increase of investment cost, and reduction of NFFs and repair time of the chosen system...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of MTBF, such as {{mean time between}} system aborts (MTBSA), mean time between critical failures (MTBCF) or mean time between <b>unscheduled</b> <b>removal</b> (MTBUR). Such nomenclature is used when it is desirable to differentiate among types of failures, such as critical and non-critical failures. For example, in an automobile, {{the failure of the}} FM radio does not prevent the primary operation of the vehicle. Mean time to failure (MTTF) is sometimes used instead of MTBF in cases where a system is replaced after a failure, since MTBF denotes time between failures in a system which is repaired. MTTFd is an extension of MTTF, where MTTFd is only concerned about failures which would result in a dangerous condition.|$|R
40|$|Mean {{time between}} <b>unscheduled</b> <b>removal</b> (MTBUR) {{measurement}} is a baseline technique for condition monitoring (CM) in aircraft reliability programmes. Many airlines, component suppliers and airframe manufacturers apply MTBUR analysis {{because of its}} simplicity and industry-wide acceptance for contractual, performance and technical evaluation purposes. Owing to its aggregated nature, MTBUR alone has little to offer for showing the significant changes within a repairable component population. This paper introduces the Carroll-Hung (CH) method, an innovative approach for bridging the industrial practice of CM alerts {{and the process of}} identifying candidates for reliability improvement. Through systematic mapping of modulated time-to-failure patterns onto finger-print charts, trained engineers are able to scrutinize life characteristics and then detect inherent issues by making reference to a CH pattern guidebook. Applications at two airlines have proved the method to be simple and effective because the CH algorithm and its unique failure pattern examination technique involve aircraft system knowledge and logistics factors in developing component improvement plans. Possible refinement of the CH methodology using a non-parametric approach and pattern recognition is planned for future research. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
500|$|The initial {{powerplant}} {{selected for}} the single-engined F-16 was the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 afterburning turbofan, {{a modified version of}} the F-15's F100-PW-100, rated at 23,830lbf (106.0kN) thrust. During testing, the engine was found to be prone to compressor stalls and [...] "rollbacks", wherein the engine's thrust would spontaneously reduce to idle. Until resolved, the Air Force ordered F-16s to be operated within [...] "dead-stick landing" [...] distance of its bases. It was the standard F-16 engine through the Block 25, except for new-build Block 15s with the Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU). The OCU introduced the 23,770lbf (105.7kN) F100-PW-220, later installed on Block 32 and 42 aircraft: the main advance being a Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) unit, which improved reliability and reduced stall occurrence. Beginning production in 1988, the [...] "-220" [...] also supplanted the F-15's [...] "-100", for commonality. Many of the [...] "-220" [...] engines on Block 25 and later aircraft were upgraded from 1997 onwards to the [...] "-220E" [...] standard, which enhanced reliability and maintainability; <b>unscheduled</b> engine <b>removals</b> were reduced by 35%.|$|R
40|$|Costs {{associated}} to unscheduled and excessively prudent maintenance can {{contribute significantly to}} an airline's expenditure. Due to the complex nature of aviation related operations, reliability practices have been limited. In an attempt to improve component reliability, i. e. reduce maintenance-related costs, a new strategy was proposed which pursuits new avenues w. r. t. reliability modelling. The strategy focusses on identifying operational factors affecting component reliability and assessing whether these {{can be used to}} reduce the number of unscheduled occurrences (i. e. failures). Currently, reliability models are limited to exponential distributions, which assume hazard rates remain constant throughout the component's operational life. Studies have shown that time-independent Proportional Hazard Models (PHMs) could improve overall reliability, however, due to poor data, this was not verified. In this solution, the benefits of both time-independent and -dependent PHMs are assessed. Furthermore, underlying hazard functions were supplemented by introducing: normal, log-normal, logistic, exponential, Weibull, and gamma distributions. To address repairables, restoration events were simulated using Kijima type II General Repair Processes (GRPs). This project would not have been possible without the cooperation of QantasLink that supplied the data required. Results obtained from analysing historical data of the top ten components w. r. t. <b>unscheduled</b> <b>removals</b> indicated that adopting new maintenance schedules, derived from the proposed reliability models, could reduce the number of unscheduled occurrences by approximately 37 % while limiting the increase in Mean Time Till (next) Repair (MTTRep). The variables identified by the solution were validated using literature, however, due to variable reduction and data limitations, the exact nature of component failures is yet to be established. Undeniably the potential benefits of adopting the proposed strategy are extensive. Nonetheless, numerous assumptions were introduced to overcome challenges imposed by the complex nature of the data. To overcome these challenges, recommendations and suggestions were proposed for the future development of airline reliability practices.

40|$|The United States Air Force {{utilizes}} {{a significant}} amount of its budget to maintain its aerospace systems in operational condition. In order to reduce these costs, the Air Force has communicated to aerospace manufactures a desire to reduce the overall costs of its aerospace system maintenance. This thesis investigates how the Air Force and Corporation Alpha, a leading manufacturer of aerospace engines, have adapted their design and development practices to make the EG 10 fighter engine family more reliable, durable, and maintainable. I used the metric <b>Unscheduled</b> Engine <b>Removals</b> (UER) per 1000 Effective Flight Hours (UER/ 1000 EFH) to compare the sustainability of different models of EG 10 while investigating how the sustainment lessons of the EG 10 have been incorporated into Corporation Alpha's latest product, the EG 1 5 - 1. The analysis presented in this thesis will focus on the policies, technology, processes and tools, and final results of efforts to improve the sustainability of these engine systems. The final results show that the sustainability, as measured by the UER metric, have not increased beyond 106 EFH with each succeeding generation of EG 10 engine. This illustrates that improving aerospace system sustainability involves factors beyond the design phase of the system. by Spencer L. Lewis. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The US Air Force (USAF) {{has evolved}} a {{policy for the}} {{acquisition}} of fighter jet engines (FJE). In the 1970 s and 1980 s that policy placed a premium on FJE performance primarily measured by the metric: thrust/engine weight. In the 1990 s, the USAF policy changed from an emphasis on performance to reduced life-cycle cost with a premium on sustainment. This paper reports {{the results of a}} study of how the USAF and Corporation Alpha (Alpha) have adapted their processes, practices, and policies to design, develop, manufacture, test, and sustain a family of FJEs. Each member of the family of FJEs is sequentially linked relative to insertion of technology designed to reduce sustainment costs. In addition to the technology linkages, the development of the family of FJEs selected for this case study is also tracked relative to US Department of Defense and USAF policy and industry design, build, and maintain processes, methods, and tools. This paper discerns the complex, highly integrated manner that characterizes the interaction between (1) technology, (2) policy, and (3) manufacturing and sustainment tools to produce a family of FJEs with improving sustainment qualities and non-degrading performance. The metric <b>Unscheduled</b> Engine <b>Removals</b> (UER) per 1000 Effective Flight Hours (UER/ 1000 EFH) is used to compare the sustainability of each member of the selected family of FJEs. Our results are based on data obtained through a series of field interviews of USAF and civilian government personnel and Alpha personnel. The US government extensive database containing UER information is the primary source of MRO trends for the FJEs of this study. Our analysis shows that the family of FJEs sustainability, as measured by the UER metric, has not improved beyond 6 10 EFH for each succeeding generation in the selected FJE family. We conjecture that upstream policy, technology insertion, and manufacturing and sustainment tools are not the primary determinants of sustainability; {{the manner in which the}} FJE is used has the greatest influence on sustainability of FJEs.

40|$|O Transplante de Células-Tronco Hematopoéticas (TCTH) é uma terapi{{a complex}}a que expõe o paciente a inúmeras vulnerabilidades, das quais se destaca a infecção relacionada ao Cateter Venoso Central (CVC). Entre as coberturas oclusivas, o Curativo Impregnado com Gel de Clorexidina (CIGCHX) é uma tecnologia promissora que tem demonstrado eficácia {{superior}} na prevenção dessas infecções. Uma característica inovadora é a presença da almofada gel de clorexidina, que mantém ação antimicrobiana, a despeito da presença de matéria orgânica, permitindo permanência de sete dias por propiciar controle do crescimento da microbiota local. Diante disto, propôs-se descrever o uso do CIGCHX como cobertura do CVC inserido em adultos e crianças submetidos ao TCTH e a ocorrência de infecção relacionada ao cateter na vigência deste curativo. Foi conduzido um estudo quantitativo, observacional, descritivo com corte transversal. A casuística compôs-se de 25 pacientes que se submeteram a observações diárias de aspectos relacionados ao CIGCHX até 45 dias após a inserção do primeiro CVC, ou antes, caso este curativo tenha sido suspenso ou o cateter removido, entre setembro de 2013 a fevereiro de 2014. As variáveis foram analisadas por meio de estatística descritiva. O CIGCHX teve permanência média de 4, 62 dias, variando entre 0, 5 e sete dias. A remoção programada do mesmo ocorreu em 43 dos 104 curativos acompanhados. A presença de sangue foi o principal motivo para remoção não programada do CIGCHX. A presença de bolha de ar sob a almofada gel de clorexidina foi a observação mais frequente sobre o aspecto diário do curativo, presente em 56, 7 % das avaliações realizadas. O CVC teve permanência média de 14, 73 dias, variando entre cinco e 33 dias, com DP 6, 78 dias. A infecção relacionada ao cateter foi o principal motivo para sua remoção. Nas culturas de sangue e ponta de cateter, os microrganismos isolados foram todos bactérias gram negativas. Os sinais e sintomas de irritação cutânea na região do CIGCHX ocorreram em cinco pacientes. Os achados relacionados à irritação cutânea podem apontar que o uso do CIGCHX exige cautela na população estudada. A presença de sangue como principal motivo para remoção não programada do curativo revela a especificidade dos pacientes e indica que os fatores relacionados devem ser considerados para o uso do CIGCHX nesta população. O desenvolvimento de estudos experimentais que investiguem as causas e implicações da presença da bolha de ar, bem como dos outros aspectos observados no curativo, é essencial para certificar a eficácia do uso do CIGCHX sob essas condições e propor medidas para manejo, se necessário, para que seja implementado em sua maior potencialidade. Ademais, tais resultados contribuirão para centros de transplante gerenciar o uso do CIGCHX e desenvolver protocolos para sua utilização, com atenção às diversas nuances que seu uso implica. Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplantation (HSCT) {{is a complex}} treatment that exposes patients to uncountable vulnerabilities, particularly central venous catheter (CVC) infections. Among the many occlusive dressings, the chlorhexidine-gel-impregnated dressing (CHXGID) is a promising technology that has proven superior effectiveness in preventing CVC infections. One innovative feature of CHXGID {{is the presence of}} a chlorhexidine-gel pad that maintains an antimicrobial action despite of the presence of organic material. The dressing can remain on the patient for seven days, thus controlling local microbiota growth. Therefore, it was proposed to describe the use of CHXGID as a dressing of the CVC of adult and child patients undergoing HSTC and the occurrence of catheter-related infections while using that dressing. A quantitative, observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted. The study sample consisted of 25 patients who agreed to daily observations of aspects related to the CHXGID for 45 days after first CVC insertion, or less in case the dressing or catheter were removed, from September of 2013 to February of 2014. The variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The mean CHXGID permanence was 4. 62 days, ranging between 0. 5 and seven days. Scheduled removal occurred in 39 of the 104 studied dressings. The presence of blood was the main reason for <b>unscheduled</b> CIGCHX <b>removal.</b> The presence of air bubbles under the chlorhexidine-gel pad was the most frequent observation regarding the daily aspect of the dressing, observed in 56. 7 % of the assessments. The mean CVC permanence was 14. 73 days, ranging between five and 33 days, with a SD of 6. 78 days. Catheter-related infection was the main reason for its removal. The microorganisms isolated in the blood and catheter tip cultures were all gram negative bacteria. Five patients showed signs and symptoms of skin irritations in the CHXGID area. The findings related to skin irritations suggest that special care is required when using CHXGID in the studied population. The presence of blood as the main reason for unscheduled removing the dressing reveals the specificity of the patients and indicates that the associated factors must be considered for using CHXGID in this specific population. Further experimental studies that investigate the causes and implications of air bubbles, as well as other aspects observed on the dressings, are essential to verify the effectiveness of CHGID under these conditions and to propose any necessary handling measures, so the highest effectiveness of CHGID use can be achieved. Furthermore, such results will help transplant centers manage the utilization of CHXGID and develop specific utilization protocols, with particular care to the diverse levels of implications involved...|$|R
