5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> physical principle {{that could be}} {{described in terms of}} the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} Perl can be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} to three broad {{trends in the}} computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly and easily.|$|E

5|$|The Temple {{teaches that}} the true self, or essence, is immortal, and Xeper {{is the ability to}} align {{consciousness}} with this essence. Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual's subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping with its emphasis on the individual, the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.|$|E
5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field can be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gauge field, i.e., {{as a field}} that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E

5|$|During {{the debate}} on the bill, New York's Francis B. Cutting demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a {{statement}} he had made, which Breckinridge <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> challenge to duel. Under the code duello, the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in Silver Spring, Maryland, on his friend, Francis Preston Blair's estate. Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelists from holding office.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sociology}} {{refers to}} an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology {{is also part of}} the broader field of science communication or science journalism. In a distinct but similar vein, applied sociology, also known as clinical sociology, policy sociology or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E

5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is {{in the words of the}} institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are <b>understood</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E
