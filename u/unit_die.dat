5000|$|Any six-sided dice or ten-sided dice (see Monsters, below) {{that belongs}} to a race is a unit. The color(s) of the dice {{identify}} each race and represent the elements that comprise each. The dice come in four sizes, each corresponding to a particular amount of [...] "health" [...] from 1 to 4 points. One side on each <b>unit</b> <b>die</b> has an ID icon, which identifies the unit and generates results equal {{to the health of}} the die towards whatever action is being rolled for. The remaining sides have either normal action icons (representing magic, maneuvers, melee, missiles, or saves) or special action icons (SAI) that generate special effects or results. Generally, the more health a unit has, the more icons it will have. Units are also divided by class as well as size, reflecting their specialty. Most races have five classes of unit, plus monsters (or champions for the Eldarim), but while most races share a number of classes (Cavalry, Magic, Melee), some are unique to certain races (Light Magic, Light Melee, Light Missile).|$|E

40|$|As modern metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs) {{scale to}} smaller dimension, the power density of {{microprocessors}} rises up quickly. The supply voltage has scaled with device dimension. To maintain an acceptable ON/OFF ratio, the subthreshold swing (S. S.) of transistors {{need to be}} reduced. ^ The 60 mV/dec limit of MOSFET comes from the the e-kT variation in f(E) above the Fermi level. This limit can be overcome by changing the transmission probability T(E) so that it decades sharply above the source Fermi level. Such examples have been demonstrated. Tunneling FET (TFET) can have a steep S. S., but its on-current (Ion) is limited by tunneling probability from conduction band to valence band. ^ Utilizing the high transmission of miniband and low transmission in the minigap, nanowire superlattice MOSFETs have been demonstrated to have been both steep S. S. and high Ion. Adding a superlattice between the N+ source and the channel suppresses the injection of high-thermal-energy electrons, reduces S. S., in simulations to 13 mV/dec. However, high Ion per <b>unit</b> <b>die</b> area demands small nanowire pitch and such devices might be hard to fabricate. ^ In this work, a double-gate MOSFETs having InGaAs/InAlAs superlattices between the N+ source and a planar InGaAs channel is proposed. As with nanowire superlattice transistors, the 2 -D superlattice bandgap reduces injection into the channel of electrons having energy above the source Fermi energy. Simulated ballistic transport characteristics of FETs using a three-well superlattice show 29 - 37. 5 mV/dec. minimum subthreshold swing and 390 A/m on-current given 0. 1 A/m off-current and a 0. 2 V power supply. ^ Utilizing the high conduction band offsets, InAs/InAlAs superlattice MOSFETs have higher ON/OFF ratios than InGaAs/InAlAs superlattice MOSFETs. Furthermore within the same length we can fit in more superlattice periods, so a steeper S. S. and even higher ON/OFF ratio can be achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of fluid}} flow in industrial processes {{is essential for}} numerous applications {{and there have been}} vast amount of work on the hydrodynamic pressure generated due to the flow of viscous fluid. One major manifestation of hydrodynamic pressure application is the wire coating/drawing process, where the wire is pulled through a unit either conical or cylindrical bore filled with a polymer melt that gives rise to the hydrodynamic pressure inside the unit. The hydrodynamic pressure distribution may change during the process due to various factors such as the pulling speed, process temperature, fluid viscosity, and geometrical shape of the <b>unit</b> (<b>die).</b> This work presents the process of designing a new plasto-hydrodynamic pressure die based on a tapered-stepped-parallel bore shape; the device consists of a fixed hollow outer cylinder and an inner rotating shaft, where the hollow cylinder represents a pressure chamber and the rotating shaft represents the moving surface of the wire. The geometrical shape of the bore is provided by different shaped inserts to set various gap ratios, ancl the complex geometry of the gap between the shaft and the pressure chamber is filled with viscous fluid materials. The device allows the possibility of determining changes in the hydrodynamic pressure as the shaft speed is altered while different fluid viscosity during the process is considered. A number of experimental procedures and methods have been carried out {{to determine the effects of}} various shaft speeds by using Glycerine at 1 to 18 °C and two different types of silicone oil fluids at 1 to 25 °C on the hydrodynamic pressure and shear rate. Viscosities of the viscous fluids were obtained at atmospheric pressure by using a Cone-plate Brookfield viscometer at low shear rate ranges. Moreover, Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to develop and analyze computational simulation models that demonstrate the pressure units, which studies the drawing process involving viscous fluids in a rotating system. A finite volume technique was used to observe the change in fluid viscosity during the process based on non-Newtonian characteristics at high shear rate ranges. The maximum shaft speed used in these models was 1. 5 m. sec' 1. Results from experimental and Computational models were presented graphically and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-functional}} requirements (NFRs) of enterprise application systems (EASs) {{have a significant}} impact on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of companies. Among NFRs like accessibility, security, and reusability is performance considered as one of the top most important. Performance quantifies the degree to which an application meets the requirements, with respect to response times and resource utilization. To enable early performance problem detection, so-called Application Performance Management (APM) tools are integrated in an EAS life cycle. Due to the high initial and ongoing configuration effort of APM tools, they have hardly been accepted in the industry. This results in time-consuming and error-prone manual performance problem diagnosis. These vulnerabilities of APM tools are addressed by the diagnoseIT research project. The main objective of the project is to enrich existing APM processes with automated configuration of instrumentations as well as automated performance problem detection and diagnosis. Since there is already a wide variety of APM tools, diagnoseIT does not implement a new tool to measure performance metrics. Instead, already existing APM tools provide their monitoring data to diagnoseIT. As part of this research project arose this work and contributed three components to the diagnoseIT framework. As a basis for performance problem diagnosis, diagnoseIT needs to know a variety of information (e. g., system architecture, execution environment, and dynamic runtime data) about the monitored EAS. Therefore, an Enterprise Performance Model (EPM) was designed and implemented in the first part of this thesis. The second part of the work was to provide a maintenance service for the EPM and an associated integration interface for third-party APM tools. The implemented components were assembled to a prototypical implementation of the diagnoseIT framework. The final evaluation of the implemented solution has shown that we are able to maintain the EPM by connecting the Kieker application performance monitoring tool to diagnoseIT. The evaluation results of extensive load tests showed, however, that the processable amount of data is limited by the current implementation of the persistence <b>unit.</b> <b>Die</b> nicht-funktionalen Qualitätseigenschaften (NFRs) von Enterprise-Anwendungen (EASs) haben eine signifikante Auswirkung auf die Leistungskennzahlen von Firmen. Unter den NFRs wie Zugänglichkeit, Sicherheit und Wiederverwendbarkeit gilt die Performance als eine der allerwichtigsten. Die Performance entscheidet darüber, in welchem Ausmaß eine Anwendung in punkto Antwortzeit und Nutzung der Ressourcen den Anforderungen entspricht. Um das frühe Erkennen von Performance-Problemen zu ermöglichen, werden sogenannte Application Performance Management (APM) -Tools in den EAS-Lebenszyklus integriert. Wegen des hohen anfänglichen, aber auch anhaltenden Pflegeaufwands von APM-Tools werden sie in der Industrie kaum eingesetzt. Das alles läuft auf eine zeitraubende und fehlerbehaftete manuelle Problemdiagnose der Performance heraus. Diese Unzulänglichkeit der APM-Tools wird durch das diagnoseIT -Forschungsprojekt angegangen. Das Hauptziel des Projektes ist es, schon bestehende APM-Prozesse sowohl mit automatisierter Konfiguration von Instrumentierungen anzureichern als auch mit automatisierter Entdeckung und Diagnose von Performance-Problemen. Da es bereits eine große Auswahl von APM-Tools gibt, führt diagnoseIT kein neues Tool ein, um die Performance-Metrik zu messen. Stattdessen stellen bereits bestehende APM-Tools ihrer Daten für diagnoseIT zur Verfügung. Aus diesem Forschungsprojekt heraus entstand die vorliegende Arbeit. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, drei Komponenten für diagnoseIT bereitzustellen. Ein sogenanntes Enterprise Performance Model (EPM) wurde definiert und implementiert, um einlaufende monitoring data zu speichern und zu verarbeiten. Um das EPM zugänglich zu machen, wurde ein System Model Maintenance Interface (SMMI) implementiert. Die Tool-Integration für bereits existierende APM-Lösungen wurde als Adapter realisiert. Alle Komponenten sind zusammengefügt als prototypische Implementierung des diagnoseIT-Frameworks. Die abschließende Evaluation der implementierten Lösung hat gezeigt, dass wir das EPM befüllen und auswerten können, indem wir das Kieker APM-tool mit diagnoseIT verbinden. Die Resultate der Evaluation von ausführlichen Belastungstests zeigten jedoch, dass die verarbeitbare Datenmenge durch die aktuelle Implementierung der Persistenzschicht beschränkt ist...|$|E
