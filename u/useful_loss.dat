30|$|In this paper, the two {{variants}} of B-IFDMA, the joint-DFT B-IFDMA and the added-signal B-IFDMA, {{have been investigated}} in terms of carrier frequency offset (CFO) sensitivity. CFO gives rise to <b>useful</b> power <b>loss</b> together with interference, leading to performance degradation. To evaluate this performance degradation, we have determined the theoretical expressions of the SINR degradation caused by CFO at the input of the decision device. The results of the analysis have shown a different behavior for both {{variants of}} B-IFDMA in terms of CFO sensitivity. Hence, when considering the added-signal B-IFDMA, the multiuser interference contributions are the dominant ones. For the joint-DFT B-IFDMA, the degradation {{is found to be}} dominated by self-user interference. As a consequence, it appears that, in terms of sensitivity to CFO, joint-DFT B-IFDMA is better suited than added-signal B-IFDMA for the uplink. Indeed, the effect of multiuser interference is far more complex to be corrected with the uplink case than downlink. Then, the numerical results have shown that the added-signal B-IFDMA is more robust to CFO for the downlink.|$|R

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. A thermodynamic limitation of single-component working fluids in organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) is the large exergy destruction (and, consequently, <b>useful</b> power <b>loss)</b> associated with evaporation and condensation. Due to their non-isothermal phase-change behaviour, non-azeotropic working-fluid mixtures have shown reduced exergy losses, leading to improved cycle efficiencies and power outputs. These benefits are exclusively observed from a thermodynamic perspective. The present paper considers the effects of selecting such working-fluid mixtures on heat transfer performance, component sizing and system costs {{compared with those of}} pure fluids; a mixture of n-pentane and n-hexane is selected. While the fluid-mixture cycles do indeed allow higher efficiencies and the generation of higher power outputs, they require larger evaporators, condensers and expanders; thus, the resulting ORC systems are more expensive than those based on the pure fluids. While a working-fluid mixture (60 % n-pentane + 40 % n-hexane) leads to the thermodynamically optimal cycle, a pure n-pentane ORC system has reduced costs of 37 % per unit power output over the thermodynamic optimum. am 201...|$|R

It is proposed in [7] that mathematical simulation should be used to estimate the metrological performance instability of measuring devices, while [2] recommends that instability should be estimated based on the sensitivity function of measuring devices. Such approaches however do not make it possible to assess to which extent the effects of each influencing factor on the MC error are individual. It is therefore appears to be reasonable to apply Taguchi methodology based on estimating the losses using the “useful signal/noise” ratio. Factors influencing the MC error instability have been considered. The area has been defined for the preventive control of the neutron power MC error instability.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a family of}} product-form loss models, including loss networks (or circuit-switched communication networks) and a class of resource-sharing models. There can be multiple classes of requests for multiple resources. Requests arrive according to independent Poisson processes. The requests can be for multiple units in each resource (the multi-rate case, e. g., several circuits on a trunk). There can be upper-limit and guaranteed-minimum sharing policies {{as well as the}} standard complete-sharing policy. If all the requirements of a request cannot be met upon arrival, then the request is blocked and lost. We develop an algorithm for computing the (exact) steady-state blocking probability of each class and other steady state descriptions in these loss models. The algorithm is based on numerically inverting generating functions of the normalization constants. In a previous paper we introduced this approach to product-form models and developed a full algorithm for a class of closed queueing networks.
