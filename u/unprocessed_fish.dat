On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
25|$|Aggravating factors {{surround}} {{the demand for}} seafood from East Asian markets, which encourage commercial fishermen to exhaust stocks in Russia’s EEZ. Russian illegal exporters have well oiled links to importers in Japan, China and South Korea. Criminal groups and corruption magnifies the effect, as the short distances needed to transport seafood from south Kurils and south Sakhalin to Japan. Huge fish processing developments in China built on cheap labour encourage the export of further <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If {{performed}} {{without consideration}} for potential local environmental impacts, aquaculture in inland waters {{can result in}} more environmental damaging than wild fisheries, though with less waste produced on a per kg on a global scale. Local concerns with aquaculture in inland waters may include waste handling, side-effects of antibiotics, competition between farmed and wild animals, and the potential introduction of invasive plant and animal species, or foreign pathogens, particularly if <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> are used to feed more marketable carnivorous fish. If non-local live feeds are used, aquaculture may introduce plant of animal.

40|$|Two plants {{processing}} salmon fillets {{and cold}} smoked salmon were investigated for occurrence of Listeria in products and the environment. Analyses were conducted {{for a period}} of 31 weeks. At plant A, 252 samples were examined of which 97 were from <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> and 155 from cold-smoked fish. At plant B, 189 samples of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> were investigated. The first examination of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> at plant A showed a presence of L. monocytogenes and L. spp. in 81 % and 19 % of the samples respectively. For cold-smoked fish the figures were 43 % and 23 %. At plant B, L. monocytogenes was isolated in 63 % of the samples. During the test period, management at the processing plant initiated various hygiene precautions to improve the sanitary situation. The last batch of analyses of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> at plant A showed a presence of L. monocytogenes and L. spp. in 42 % and. 33 % of the samples respectively. For cold-smoked fish, the figures were 6 % and 11 %. The isolation figures at plant B for L. monocytogenes and L. spp. were 50 % and 17 % respectively. The hygienic precautions did not {{have a significant effect on}} the presence of L. monocytogenes and L. spp. We suggest that Listeria bacteria are a part of the resident flora and are not eliminated by current cleaning and sanitation programmes. Cold-smoking, however, gave a significant reduction in the isolation of L. monocytogenes (P= 0. 0082), while the isolation of L. spp. did not decrease after this process...|$|E

40|$|Fish and fishery {{products}} are highly traded commodities and nearly 40 per {{cent of the}} global fish production goes for international trade. There was a tremendous increase in the international trade of fish and fish products consequent to structural changes in the fishery sector contributed by technological innovations in harvest and post-harvest sectors, trade liberalization policies and increase in consumption. The advanced technologies for processing, packaging, storage, transportation coupled with substantial reductions in freight charges has promoted the international trade of new product forms and entry of new producers and traders to the global market. In 2009, trade in fish and {{fishery products}} represented about 12 percent of total agricultural exports (FAO, 2010). Apart from providing foreign exchange earnings, fish and fish products trade is a significant contributor to the economy of developing countries through generation of employment in the secondary and tertiary sectors. In 2010, 75 percent {{of the value of}} fishery exports from developing countries was destined towards developed countries. A growing share of these exports consisted of processed fishery products prepared from imports of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> to use as raw material for further processing. The developed countries thus gain comparative advantage in trade by way of utilizing the cheap raw materials and labour available in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Background: The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the degree of sensitization to Anisakis spp. antigens in healthy coastal population of Dalmatia given the high thermally <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> intake rate present in this area, suggested as a significant risk factor for anisakiasis. We performed a monocenter, cross-sectional pilot study stratified by geographic area of residence, conducted at the County secondary healthcare provider Medicine-biochemical Laboratory in Split (Croatia), from November 2010 till December 2011, on 500 unpaid volunteer subjects undergoing routine blood analysis and belonging to the south coast of the Adriatic Sea. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied the IgE seroprevalence to Anisakis spp. Ani s l and Ani s 7 allergens by indirect ELISA in healthy subjects, which were selected at random in the region of Dalmatia (Southern Croatia), among islands, coastal urban and inland rural populations. In order to detect possible cross-reactivity to other human helminthes, serum samples were tested also for the presence of IgG antibodies to Ascaris lumbricoides and Toxocara canis. The overall and coastal Anisakis seroprevalences for the sampled population were 2 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. The logistic univariate regression analysis confirmed that regarding anti-Anisakis IgE seroprevalence, raw fish intake, daily fish intake, homemade origin of fish dish and occupational contact (professional, artisanal or hobby contact with fishery or fish industry) were risk factors associated to Anisakis spp. sensitization, but neither of the variables was exclusive for...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} granting a fishermen's sales organization exclusive rights to sell <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish.</b> On {{the assumption that the}} fishermen's monopoly is able to discriminate between plants and end use alternatives in its pricing policy, the conditions for profit maximization are derived and compared with the conditions for social efficiency. It is found that the monopoly would be efficient if (I) its costs for obtaining the fish are identical to the social costs, (2) the marginal processing cost is constant, and (3) either the price of the finished product is constant or the product is exported so that consumer's surplus is {{not a part of the}} social benefit. A fishermen's monopoly may thus achieve the objectives of an export cartel. When the marginal processing cost is rising the monopoly will overconserve the fish resource, provided that its cost of providing the fish is not sufficiently below the social cost. Finally, the analysis is extended to the special case in which processors have established a price discriminating monopoly in the market for finished products but distribute the resulting profit through higher accounting prices while leaving individual processors to decide how much fish to buy for processing. This system passes the benefits from price discrimination in the markets for finished products on to the fishermen's monopoly.

Also, a significant difference was observed between seropositive and seronegative subjects that had stated allergy or symptoms associated with allergy (atopic dermatitis, asthma or rhinitis) in their previous history.

40|$|After {{the last}} war, the USSR set it self to {{increase}} the development of its ocean fisheries from its two North-East Atlantic seaboards on the Barents Sea and the Baltic. With a modernized fleet and almost complete freedom on the seas, its catch increased six fold between 1950 and 1976, going from 0, 4 to 2, 5 million tons per year, and Soviet fishermen could be found roaming on all the seas bordering Europe. However, as from 1977, this expansion was fiercely curtailed when coastal nations, including the USSR, established the 200 -mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or mere exclusive fishing zone (EFZ), each being alloted almost all of its living resource s. More fishing grounds were lost by the USSR than gained, {{to the point where}} production suddenly fell in 1977 and it had to turn to fish of lesser quality, often used for industrial purposes, such as the Capelin (Mallotus villosus) and the blue Whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) which today make up to 60 % of all its catch off Northern Europe. The Soviet authorities reacted with flexibility and diversity, namely by increased fishing in the national exclusive zone, particularly in the Barents Sea, through negotiations leading to access rights to foreign waters, particularly those of Norway and the Faeroe Islands, and through a policy whereby it could purchase <b>unprocessed</b> <b>fish</b> from some members of the EEC. Thus Russian factory ships came to the British coasts to process mackerel delivered to them at sea by English and Scottish fishermen. It is through such a strategy of diversification, various examples of which may be found around the world, that the Soviets have succeeded in regaining grounds lost in 1977 and in reaching an average production of 1, 7 million tons from 1977 to 1983 in the North-East Atlantic, this being 3 to 4 % less than that of 1970 - 76, notwithstanding the few purchases of fish made directly at sea...|$|E
