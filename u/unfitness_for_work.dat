25|$|In {{terms of}} working conditions, {{a number of}} reforms were {{introduced}} aimed at strengthening the rights of workers {{both at home and}} in the workplace. The Sickness Act of 1970 provided equal treatment of workers and employees in the event of incapacity for work, while maternity leave was increased. Legislation was introduced in 1970 which ensured continued payment of wages for workers disabled by illness. In 1970 all employees unit for work (with the exception of women in receipt of maternity benefits and temporarily and inconsiderably employed persons) were provided with an unconditional legal claim against their employer to continued payment of their gross wage for a period of 6 weeks, as also in the case of spa treatment approved by an Insurance Fund, the Fund bearing the full cost thereof. Previously, payment of employer's supplement and sick pay were only made from the day on which the doctor certified <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> In 1972, an Act on Agency Work was passed which sought to prevent works agencies from providing job placement services and aimed to provide job minimum protection for employees in agency work. A law on the hiring out of manpower, passed in October 1972, contained provisions to stipulate prior authorization for the hiring out of manpower, to draw a distinction between the system governing workers hired out and the placing of workers, to regulate and improve the rights of hired out workers pertaining to working conditions and social insurance, and provide for more severe penalties and fines to be imposed on offenders.|$|E

Since influenza waves are difficult to predict because of their cyclic but not regular behaviour, statistical methods based on the computation of mean values are not helpful. Instead, we have developed a prognostic model that makes use of similar former courses. Our method combines Case-based Reasoning with Temporal Abstraction to decide whether early warning is appropriate. In this paper, we present this method. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{health status}} of {{unemployed}} people is much worse than that of people with jobs. More detailed information {{on the health of}} unemployed people at Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit (BA), the German federal employment service, comes primarily from three data sources: First, placement counsellors enter health problems in computer-assisted position wanted listings. They are based on information provided by the unemployed person, the degree of disability recognised by the pension offices, and the results of the medical report procedure. Approx. one million unemployed people are registered as having health problems. The second source of information comes from the conclusions of medical reports by the employment office medical service, whose diagnoses of diseases and function are published in aggregate form. Over 300, 000 medical reports were prepared for the unemployed in 2001 alone. Analyses show that the most frequent diagnoses in the medical report procedure of BA's medical service were 'diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue' followed by 'mental and behavioural disorders'. Certain occupational groups are affected disproportionately. The third source - {{as a result of the}} legal provisions governing the payment of benefits and the way the statistics are designed - is information on the occurrence of cases of <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> among the unemployed. The outflow statistics record over 1. 2 million cases of <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in 2002. That is an annual average of over 84, 000 unemployed people who received unemployment benefits or assistance. However, unemployment statistics systematically underestimate the percentage of unemployed people with health problems due to the recording of the outflow of people who are unfit for work due to ill health. As shown by a representative IAB survey, unemployed people with health problems have poorer chances of reintegration into the labour market. Health problems are a major barrier to seeking a new job. It is urgent to develop approaches to prevention and health promotion that will support integration into the labour market.

40|$|AbstractSocial {{service support}} for {{beneficiaries}} of the French RSA (minimum income scheme) is based on reducing their problems {{to a series of}} situations blocking their “plans to return to employment”. These situations are defined in practice by the specific “programs” toward which professional may orient beneficiaries. This notion is quite close to that of “situation of disability”, as it is used in social conceptions of disability. It is the support for a specific handicapology, rooted in a representation of social service work in rupture with the traditional notion of support for disabled persons, those unfit for work. It is characterized particularly by a refusal to sort beneficiaries into overarching categories, and a change in the meaning given to people's material and cultural destitution, which is not treated as a consequence of unemployment or as a disability, but as a disabling situation responsible for their withdrawal from the employment market. These professional norms are manifest in a strong resistance when beneficiaries express the desire to seek AAH (disabled adult allowance). This reticence is explained by the simultaneous transformations of both the administrative division of social support work and the social trajectories of the social workers charged with this work. AAH requests place professionals in a paradoxical situation: their general role to support people in their administrative procedures comes into contradiction with their mission to “support toward employment”, which they find radically incompatible with the posture of assistance implied by the recognition of even a partial <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to {{determine}} the burden of illness imposed by severe sepsis in Switzerland by evaluating the direct and indirect patient-related costs for critically ill patients with severe sepsis. METHODS: In order to estimate the direct costs a retrospective analysis was undertaken using records from 61 adult patients treated in three intensive care units (ICUs) in three different University hospitals in Switzerland, in 2001. Resource use was determined by a bottom up approach and valued using centre-specific unit costs for medication, nutrition, blood products, disposables and official tariffs for laboratory and microbiology analysis, diagnostic services, and clinical procedures. By adding centre-specific personnel and basic bed (hotel) costs total direct costs in the ICU were calculated. Indirect costs resulting from <b>unfitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> early retirement, and premature death were calculated using official Swiss statistics for the years 1998 - 2000. RESULTS: The mean total direct costs for a severely septic patient are CHF 41, 790 (+/- 33, 222 CHF) or CHF 3244 (+/- 757 CHF) per day. Nonsurvivors cause significantly higher costs than survivors (CHF 45, 956 vs. CHF 37, 759, p < 0. 001). The total intensive care costs in Switzerland due to severe sepsis amount to CHF 146 - 355 million. Indirect costs were estimated to range from CHF 347 to 844 million (predominantly due to premature death). Consequently the burden of illness of severe sepsis can be estimated to range from CHF 493 to 1199 million per year in Switzerland (1 CHF = 0. 662 Euro in 2001). CONCLUSION: Patients suffering from severe sepsis in Switzerland have a high mortality rate and spend a prolonged time in the ICU, leading to high direct and indirect costs. Particularly productivity losses due to premature death represent a considerable burden to the Swiss society...|$|E
