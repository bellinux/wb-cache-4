40|$|Abstract. Most {{digital systems}} {{operate on a}} {{positional}} representation of data, such as binary radix. An alternative is to operate on random bit streams where the signal value is encoded by the probability of obtaining a one versus a zero. This representation is much less compact than binary radix. However, complex opera-tions can be performed with very simple logic. Furthermore, since the represen-tation is uniform, with all bits weighted equally, it is highly tolerant of soft errors (i. e., bit flips). Both combinational and sequential constructs have been proposed for operating on stochastic bit streams. Prior work has shown that combinational logic can implement multiplication and scaled addition effectively; linear finite-state machines (FSMs) can implement complex functions such as exponentiation and tanh effectively. Building on these prior results, this paper presents case stud-ies of <b>useful</b> <b>circuit</b> constructs implement with the paradigm of logical computa-tion on stochastic bit streams. Specifically, it describes finite state machine im-plementations of functions such as edge detection and median filter-based noise reduction. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Cascaded H-bridge {{multilevel}} inverters shows a <b>useful</b> <b>circuit</b> configuration {{to increase}} the number of output voltage levels to obtain high quality output voltage. By applying the concept of the power of three to dc voltage sources, it can increase the number of output voltage levels effectively. To realize this concept, two approaches may be considered. One is to use independent dc voltage sources pre-scaled in the power of three, and the other is to use instantaneous dc voltage sources generated from a cascaded transformer, which has the secondary turn-ratios scaled in the power of three in sequence. A common feature in both approaches is to use the concept of the power of three for dc voltage sources, and a point of difference is whether it adopts a low frequency transformer or not, and where the transformer is located. According to the difference, application areas are limited and show different characteristics on THD of output voltages. We compare and analyze both approaches for their circuit configurations, voltage level generating method, THD characteristics of output voltage, efficiency, application areas, limitations, and other characteristics by experiments using 500 [W] prototypes when they generate a 27 -level output voltage...|$|E
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) systems support rotating shafts without any physical contact, using electromagnetic forces. Each radial AMB uses {{two pairs of}} electromagnets at {{opposite sides of the}} rotor. This allows the rotor to float in the air gap, and the machine to operate without frictional losses. In active magnetic suspension, displacement sensors are necessary to detect the radial and axial movement of the suspended object. In a high-speed rotating machine equipped with an AMB, the rotor bending modes may be limited to the operating range. The natural frequencies of the rotor can cause instability. Thus, notch filters are a <b>useful</b> <b>circuit</b> for stabilizing the system. In addition, commercial displacement sensors are sometimes not suitable for AMB design, and cannot filter the noise caused by the natural frequencies of rotor. Hence, implementing displacement sensors based on the AMB structure is necessary to eliminate noises caused by natural frequency disturbances. The displacement sensor must be highly sensitive in the desired working range, and also exhibit a low interference noise, high stability, and low cost. In this study, we used the differential inductive sensor head and lock-in amplifier for synchronous demodulation. In addition, an active low-pass filter and a notch filter were used to eliminate disturbances, which caused by natural frequencies. As a consequence, the inductive displacement sensor achieved satisfactory linearity, high sensitivity, and disturbance elimination. This sensor can be easily produced for AMB applications. A prototype of these displacement sensors was built and tested...|$|E
40|$|Bioreporters {{are living}} cells that {{generate}} an easily measurable signal {{in the presence}} of a chemical compound. They acquire their functionality from synthetic gene circuits, the configuration of which defines the response signal and signal-to-noise ratio. Bioreporters based on the Escherichia coli ArsR system have raised significant interest for quantifying arsenic pollution, but they need to be carefully optimized to accurately work in the required low concentration range (1 - 10 μg arsenite L(- 1)). To better understand the general functioning of ArsR-based genetic circuits, we developed a comprehensive mechanistic model that was empirically tested and validated in E. coli carrying different circuit configurations. The model accounts for the different elements in the circuits (proteins, DNA, chemical species), and their detailed affinities and interactions, and predicts the (fluorescent) output from the bioreporter cell as a function of arsenite concentration. The model was parametrized using existing ArsR biochemical data, and then complemented by parameter estimations from the accompanying experimental data using a scatter search algorithm. Model predictions and experimental data were largely coherent for feedback and uncoupled circuit configurations, different ArsR alleles, promoter strengths, and presence or absence of arsenic efflux in the bioreporters. Interestingly, the model predicted a particular <b>useful</b> <b>circuit</b> variant having steeper response at low arsenite concentrations, which was experimentally confirmed and may be useful as arsenic bioreporter in the field. From the extensive validation we expect the mechanistic model to further be a useful framework for detailed modeling of other synthetic circuits...|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} the metallization of folded DNA, known as DNA origami, as an enabling {{step toward the}} use of such DNA as templates for nanoelectronic circuits. DNA origami, a simple and robust method for creating a wide variety of shapes and patterns, makes possible the increased complexity and flexibility needed for both the design and assembly of <b>useful</b> <b>circuit</b> templates. In addition, selective metallization of the DNA template is essential for circuit fabrication. Metallization of DNA origami presents several challenges over and above those associated with the metallization of other DNA templates such as λ-DNA. These challenges include (1) the stability of the origami in the processes used for metallization, (2) the enhanced selectivity required to metallize small origami structures, (3) the increased difficulty of adhering small structures to the surface so {{that they will not be}} removed when subject to multiple metallization steps, and (4) the influence of excess staple strands present with the origami. This paper describes our efforts to understand and address these challenges. Specifically, the influence of experimental conditions on template stability and on the selectivity of metal deposition was investigated for small DNA origami templates. These templates were seeded with Ag and then plated with Au via an electroless deposition process. Both staple strand concentration and the concentration of ions in solution were found to have a significant impact. Selective continuous metal deposition was achieved, with an average metallized height as small as 32 nm. The shape of branched origami was also retained after metallization. These results represent important progress toward the realization of DNA-templated nanocircuits...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the I-V characteristic of the negative differential resistance (NDR) devices on the power level and frequency of the rf input signal has been theoretically analyzed with a modified large- and small-signal nonlinear circuit analysis program. The NDR devices we used in this work include both the tunnel diode (without the antisymmetry in the I-V characteristic) and resonant-tunneling devices (with the antisymmetry in the I-V characteristic). Absolute negative conductance can be found from a zero-biased resonant tunneling device when the applied pump power is within a small range. This study verifies the work of Sollner et al. Variable negative conductances at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies can also be obtained from both the unbiased and biased tunnel diodes. The magnitude of the negative conductances can be adjusted by varying the pump amplitude [...] a very <b>useful</b> <b>circuit</b> property. However, the voltage range over which the negative conductance occurs moves towards the more positive side of the voltage axis with increasing frequency. Furthermore, {{the range of the}} pumping amplitude to obtain negative conductance varies with the parasitics (resistance and capacitance) of the device. The theoretical observation of the {{dependence of}} the I-V characteristic of the NDR devices on the power and frequency of the applied pump signal is supported by the experimental results. In addition, novel functions of a NDR device such as self-oscillating frequency multiplier and mixer with gain have been experimentally demonstrated. The unbiased oscillator have also been successfully realized with a NDR device with an antisymmetrical I-V characteristic. Finally, the applications of these device functions will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Emerging wide bandgap (WBG) power {{transistors}} {{are capable of}} improving the efficiency of mains voltage power electronic circuits. Several commercial WBG transistors are now available, but all exhibit undesirable gate drive characteristics. The cascode circuit has been suggested {{as a solution to}} this problem: WBG cascodes improve the switching speed, gate characteristics and noise immunity of devices, at the expense of greater on-state resistance. WBG cascodes have not, however, been widely accepted in commercial applications. Previous research has typically been too application-specific, with little practical information available for design engineers wishing to use them. This thesis addresses these shortcomings through a comprehensive investigation of practical design considerations for switch-mode cascode circuits. A SPICE simulation and simplified mathematical model are developed as design tools to give a detailed insight into cascode hard-switching behaviour and to aid cascode optimisation and device selection. The effects of the cascode configuration on static (DC) device performance are quantified for a silicon super-junction (SJ) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), silicon carbide (SiC) junction field-effect transistor JFET and SiC MOSFET. The on-state resistance penalty of the cascode configuration is shown to be modest and potentially mitigated by careful selection of HV transistor gate bias. There are few advantages to using silicon SJ MOSFETs in a cascode configuration, but both SiC MOSFET and JFET cascodes benefit from improved gate drive, reverse conduction and switching characteristics. SiC MOSFETs are shown to be better suited to efficient high temperature operation, while SiC JFETs are more appropriate for high current applications. Cascode switching losses are shown to be reduced compared to standalone devices, although reverse recovery losses can counteract this. Methods of controlling switching transients using gate resistors or feedback capacitors are investigated and shown to be effective. The effects of stray inductance on cascode switching are quantified experimentally for the first time. This corroborates other work and informs the layout of cascode circuits. The resilience of cascodes to severe dV/dt is also demonstrated.

40|$|This {{research}} presents three works {{all related}} {{by the subject}} of third-order distortion reduction in nonlinear circuits. Each one is a novel extension to previous work in that branch of electronics literature. All three follow the procedure of presenting a novel algebraic proof and following up with simulations and/or measurements to confirm the theoretical result. The works are generally themed around nonlinear low-frequency bipolar transistor circuits. Firstly, an investigation is conducted into a well documented effect in bipolar-junction transistors (BJTs) called inherent third-order distortion nulling. This effect is {{shown to be a}} fundamental result of the transistor’s transfer junction acting upon an input signal. The proof of a single BJT emitter-follower amplifier’s inherent null is examined which is well documented in the literature. This forms the basis for a novel extension in Darlington transistors where theory suggests the third-order null occurs at double the collector current of a single BJT. Discrete measurements of a CA 3083 transistor array are undertaken and compared with theory and simulation data. These measurements confirm theory with reasonable accuracy. A temperature and process variation independent bias circuit is developed to solve one issue with using third-order distortion nulling. This work is interesting in that it branches into series resistance compensation for translinear circuits and stands as a <b>useful</b> <b>circuit</b> in its own right. Using stacks of matched forward-biased semiconductor junctions which conform to translinear conditions, a bias current can be generated which theoretically removes temperature and series resistance dependence on the particular BJT used. This proves useful for the previous work in distortion nulling, but also allows direct and accurate measurement of series resistance. Again, simulation and measurement data is obtained from discrete measurements of the proposed circuit, and the results conform with theory to a reasonable degree. Lastly, this work presents the analysis of a cascoded-compensation (Cascomp) amplifier. It presents the first fully nonlinear derivation of the Cascomp’s transfer function and its associated harmonic and intermodulation distortion components. The derivation reveals an interesting characteristic in which the third-order intermodulation distortion has multiple local minima. This characteristic has not yet been presented in the literature, and allows better optimisation of Cascomp amplifiers in any application. Again, this characteristic and its potential benefits are confirmed with simulation and discrete measurements. Observations of the presented works are discussed and built upon in the last chapter. This leads to suggestions on future research topics branching on from these works...|$|E
