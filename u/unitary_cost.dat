50|$|New {{materials}} for energy generation and storage constitute {{a topic of}} the greatest significance due to its great economic potential and social impact. Fuel cells, and specially the so-called SOFC´s (solid oxide fuel cells), {{are one of the}} most promising alternatives for the production of environmentally friendly energy. Chemical energy storage devices (batteries) and electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are among the leading technologies today, critically needed to enable the effective use of alternative energy sources such as solar and wind, and to allow the expansion of electrical or hybrid electrical vehicles. A fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical processes that take place in the electrodes, the electrolytes and specially their interfaces is need to design the next generation of high performance ECs. New separators and electrolytes with increased capacity and conductivity are needed to improve efficiency and the possibility of operating at high currents, but also new materials have to be design to increase service life and to reduce the size and the associated <b>unitary</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E

The influence of these two categories of expenses is felt on the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost.</b> Cost variation is determined only by changes in activity, because the same fixed costs will be distributed to a greater or smaller number of products. Therefore, if the activity level increases, the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> tends to fall and vice versa, if the activity level decreases, the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> tends to increase. To avoid the inconvenience of the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> variation when the activity level changes, a cost above the normal activity was decided to be set.

40|$|The Solvency II {{directive}} {{requires that}} insurance liabilities are valued using a best estimate plus a risk margin. The risk margin should be estimated using {{the cost of}} capital approach, that {{is the cost of}} the solvency capital requirement—which is computed through a value at risk measure—needed to support the insurance obligation until settlement. The <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> of capital applied to the future capital requirement should be fixed. This paper deals with conceptual issues relating to the risk margin estimate through the cost of capital approach. It shows that the Solvency II specification of the methodology is consistent with financial economics.

As the economic <b>unitary</b> <b>costs</b> of the insulation materials are not so closely dependent on their performance, there is not a clear trend in the case of the economic optimization point of view.|$|R

30|$|A {{simplified}} method {{has been used}} for quantifying the impact of the insulation material characteristics of the manufacture process on the economic, energetic and environmental optimum insulation thicknesses. The large influence of the parameters associated with the manufacturing phase of the insulation materials on the determination of the optimum thickness has been clearly shown. For all the optimization points of views studied, the insulation thickness depends in a large way on the <b>unitary</b> <b>costs</b> associated to the fabrication of the materials. The biggest differences in thickness between two different isolation materials correspond to the highest difference in the <b>unitary</b> <b>costs.</b> As a consequence, the differences for energetic or environmental optimization assessments are larger than for the economic one. The study also demonstrates that increasing values of the characteristic parameters of the manufacturing phase, which depend {{on the nature of the}} insulation materials, imply a decrease of the impact of the calculation settings, associated with the use phase of the building.|$|R

The main focus of the following experiments will be on how interference and conflict occurs during these processes, either at the perceptual or action selection stages when switching task. It should be possible to demonstrate with increases to the number of attributes, the experience of tasks associated with non-target attributes, and in varying the number of trials before switching tasks, that task selection consists of several stages or processes, and that these processes do not necessarily interact.

In fact, trends obtained for the three views are closer. The difference between the trend line and the real values comes from the thermal properties of the insulation materials.|$|R

Given {{a set of}} demands and a capacitated network, the problem consists of allocating each demand {{to a set of}} primary paths that carry the flows realizing the demand volume in the normal operation mode. To ensure survivability, bandwidth is allocated over a disjoint set of backup links protecting the primary path. With the varied survivability concept, only a varied portion of the primary flow is guaranteed to be recovered in failure situations. The recovery ratio is predefined for a given demand and denotes the guaranteed quality of protection. We associate a <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> for using the installed bandwidth in core links. Thus, the problem provides a minimum cost solution for allocating the demands and ensuring their survivability.

40|$|This paper aims to seek {{evidence}} of environmentalism {{among the poor}} by asking two questions: i) is environmental perception, knowledge and behavior positively influenced by thesocioeconomic status and objective environmental conditions of individuals?; ii) Does the nature of behavior (collective versus private) influence pro-environmental actions among the poor? Using novel household-level data representative of two metropolitan regions in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, we measure and describe perceptions and behavior about several environmental issues using the Grade of Membership (GoM) technique and fixed-effect logistic regression. Based on our findings, we argue that past evidence on low levels of pro-environmental behavior in low-income settings may reflect the inability of differentiating private (individual) from public (collective) environmental behavior. We address these limitations by including questions about actual and intended environmental behavior that explicitly differentiates individual from collective actions. This difference is key to understanding how low-income individuals overcome budget constraints, reducing the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> of action...|$|E

Microalgae has huge potential {{for the production of}} biodiesel suitable for application as transportation fuel thereby mitigating emission of harmful and greenhouse gases. The present work provides conceptual process design and economic feasibility analysis for microalgae cultivation and extraction of oil and conversion of microalgal oil into biodiesel using Aspen plus. In the present work, the nannochloropsis salina was considered as microalgae species with chemical formula of C 50 H 50 O 30 N 7. The microalgae were cultivated in a tubular photo bioreactor [...] In the present work, microalgal oil was considered as a mixture of triglycerides containing three same fatty acid groups in the structure. The physicochemical properties of these triglycerides and microalgae were included in Aspen Plus to regress the property methods. The regressed property method was then used for techno-economic analysis for various plant capacities. The <b>unitary</b> production <b>cost</b> of biodiesel decreased slightly with increasing plant capacity. 0. 125 MMT microalgal oil/annum was considered as the optimum plant capacity. The chemicals alone contribute about 40 % of <b>unitary</b> production <b>cost</b> of microalgal oil. On the other hand, the microalgal oil was the largest cost contributing factor in the production of biodiesel with share of up to 65 % of <b>unitary</b> production <b>cost</b> of biodiesel.

We argue that non-consolidated (recently-appointed) managers are more worried about short-term results than consolidated managers are. This feature leads the former to bias the labor contracting favoring short-term contracts. This has two main consequences. First, a higher variation in the number of workers hired in each period. And second, a lower increase in <b>unitary</b> labor <b>costs.</b> To contrast these results, we use a database of 1. 054 Spanish companies during the period (1994 - 98), and analyze their managerial turnover as well as their corresponding variation in the number of workers and in <b>unitary</b> labor <b>costs.</b> The theoretical results are confirmed, especially for highly-productive (R&D-intensive) firms...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an evolutionary}} two-country model to characterize long run location {{patterns of the}} manufacturing activities of competing multinational enterprises. Firms located in country 1 can decide to offshore their manufacturing activities to country 2. The profitability of production in a country depends on several factors: <b>unitary</b> <b>costs</b> of production, the number of firms that are located in each country, within-country spillovers, and cross-border spillovers. Furthermore, profits in country 2 are influenced by congestion costs. Country 1 {{is assumed to be}} technologically advanced and has an advantage in terms of internal spillovers. In contrast, country 2 offers lower production unit cost which, however, may be offset by congestion costs. The firms’ (re) location choices are based on a simple comparison of current production costs obtained in the two countries and the dynamics of switching is modeled by a simple replicator dynamics. The global analysis of the resulting one-dimensional dynamical system reveals that a large advantage in terms of <b>unitary</b> production <b>costs</b> encourages the firms to off-shore manufacturing activities to country 2. This off-shoring process stops when congestion costs offset this advantage of country 2, even though congestion costs do not cause all manufacturing activities to be re-shored to country 1. The re-shoring process can be accelerated by an increase of within-country spillovers in country 1, while cross-border spillovers tend to favor a geographic dispersion of manufacturing activities and make location patterns that lead to suboptimal long run outcomes less likely...|$|R

Farms that wish to engage in the final product market necessarily need, at least to some extent, to perform more tasks and reorganize the whole process and set of functions. The challenges involved in the process are frequently neglected or undervalued. First, dealing with the final consumer is complex, takes time, and requires appropriate facilities and specific competences. Producers are usually not trained to this end and tend to underestimate competences and investments that may be necessary.

40|$|The {{proposed}} paper aims {{first to}} evaluate the full <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> of the grape production in different condition of soil position and targeting different quality objectives. In addition, the paper evaluate analytically {{the composition of the}} production cost and the opportunities to optimise the single cost items in the different conditions. As the grape production cost is becoming and increasing competitive factors in the wine business, the general purpose of the paper is to make available for the scientific and professional community a set of production cost analytically demonstrated and clearly related to specific contexts. This information about cost can be useful to orient research and extension efforts and to develop consistent budget in the firms. Data are obtained in restricted areas but the results of the analysis can be generalised to other areas with similar climatic conditions. Four cases are discussed. One case in very sloped conditions: production of grape for superpremium wine in Ischia Island; three cases with a ordinary soil position: production of grape for top basic (or popular premium), premium and ultrapremium wines in the Taburno area. In the selected areas has been collected information about the standard cultural practices (trellis systems and canopy management, soil management, pest control, nutrition, harvest) and yields concerning the different qualitative objectives and on the base of this information, has been defined the set of representative production processes. The cost investigation has been applied to these processes. Data analysis allowed to compute the threshold price able to completely remunerate the initial and current cost of the cultivation in the different studied cases and shown that the canopy management represent always a very critical cost item, varying from 35 to 60 % in the different cases. Data therefore indicates {{that it is necessary to}} optimise canopy management in order to reduce as much as possible his aggregate cost and to maximise his efficiency, targeting to obtain the planned yield. The comparison between the computed full unitary costs and the current paid grape prices reveals that grape producers obtain a price able to cover all costs only producing standard grape; the production of value and high value grape in non completely remunerated and only the annual cost are covered. The technical analysis of the studied processes shown that is possible to define in the different cases specific path to optimise the cropping practices (canopy management and other cultural practices), maximising the crop efficiency, moving in some cases from manual to mechanized operations or optimising the manual operations; the economic analysis allowed to quantify the cost reduction that can be obtained following the defined improvement path and to develop a set of optimised <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> for the different studied cases. With regard to the introduction of mechanical operations, the proposed paper considers the constraints in terms of farm dimension or area served by a single machine and, in addition, analyses in detail the consequences in terms of vineyard operations organisation and risk management of the different improvement path. Finally, the analysis demonstrate that also in an optimised situation in terms of cropping practices the production cost for grapes destined to premium and superpremium wines remain very high and emerge the urgency to understand completely the trade-off between grape quality and yield in order to explore the possibility to increase the target yield determining a relevant positive effect on the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|E

Economic burden to society to support the activity divided by avoided CO 2 equivalent emissions indicates the bio-ethanol cost effectiveness. Agricultural feedstock supply that comprises of sugarbeets, grains and industrial processing sub-models are articulated in a regional sector model. The maximization of total welfare determines optimal crop mix for farmers and the best configurations for industry.
