40|$|The {{properties}} of commercial {{directly and indirectly}} heated <b>UHT</b> <b>milks,</b> both after heating and during storage {{at room temperature for}} 24 weeks, were studied. Thermally induced changes were examined by changes in lactulose, furosine and acid-soluble whey proteins. The results confirmed previous reports that directly heated <b>UHT</b> <b>milks</b> suffer less heat damage than indirectly heated milk. During storage, furosine increased and bovine serum albumin in directly heat-treated milks decreased significantly. The changes in lactulose, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin were not statistically significant. The data suggest that heat treatment indicators should be measured as soon as possible after processing to avoid any misinterpretations of the intensity of the heat treatment...|$|R
25|$|Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT), {{is a type}} of milk {{processing}} where all bacteria are destroyed with high heat to extend its shelf life for up to 6 months, as long as the package is not opened. Milk is firstly homogenized and then is heated to 138 degrees Celsius for 1–3 seconds. The milk is immediately cooled down and packed into a sterile container. As a result of this treatment, all the pathogenic bacteria within the milk are destroyed, unlike when the milk is just pasteurised. The milk will now keep for up for 6 months if unopened. <b>UHT</b> <b>milk</b> {{does not need to be}} refrigerated until the package is opened, which makes it easier to ship and store. But in this process there is a loss of vitamin B1 and vitamin C and there is also a slight change in the taste of the milk.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} steps in {{preparing}} {{a cup of}} tea is a much-debated topic, and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of <b>UHT</b> <b>milk,</b> resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist it is better to add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed. Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer so the earlier you add milk the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the European Heart Journal found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.|$|E

Compared to L. monocytogenes grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth for 24 h at 4 °C, 26 genes were upregulated (more-than-twofold increase) in <b>UHT</b> skim <b>milk,</b> whereas 14 genes were downregulated (less-than-twofold decrease). The upregulated genes included genes encoding transport and binding proteins, transcriptional regulators, proteins in amino acid biosynthesis and energy metabolism, protein synthesis, cell division, and hypothetical proteins. The downregulated genes included genes that encode transport and binding proteins, protein synthesis, cellular processes, cell envelope, energy metabolism, a transcriptional regulator, and an unknown protein. The gene expression changes determined by microarray assays were confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR analyses.

The physicochemical parameters including fat, protein, temperature, Titrable Acidity (TA), Solid Not Fat (SNF) and Specific Gravity (SG) were determined. Additionally, the microbiological evaluations were based on the total bacterial count, total coliform count and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The results (mean values of 81 measurements) for raw milk samples showed fat content 2. 6, protein 3. 5, T 18 Â°C, TA 0. 17, SNF 7. 71 and SG 1. 030 and total bacterial count 13 x 10 6 cfu mL - 1, total coliform count 1300 cfu mL - 1 and E. coli positive.

40|$|Foaming is an {{important}} process {{in the production of}} many food products. It usually involves mechanical agitation or gas injection. Foaming of milk for making cappuccino coffee, a common practice in many countries, involves the injection of steam into cold milk until the temperature reaches ∼ 65 °C. However, it is also possible to foam milk at this temperature using mechanical agitation or air bubbling. The objective of this research was to compare mechanical agitation, steam injection and air bubbling for foaming different types of milk. Five types of milk were chosen, namely reconstituted skim milk, pasteurized skim milk, pasteurized homogenized full-cream <b>milk,</b> <b>UHT</b> skim <b>milk</b> and <b>UHT</b> full-cream <b>milk.</b> Foaming characteristics were assessed in terms of foam stability and foam strength. There was little difference in the stability of the foams produced by the three methods of foaming but steam injection produced significantly stronger foams compared to air bubbling while the effect of mechanical agitation relative to steam and air bubbling varied considerably between milk types. Overall, foams with greater stability and strength were produced from the skim milks than from full-cream milks with the difference being most pronounced when mechanical agitation was used.
