40|$|The Long-tailed goral (Naemorhedus caudatus) {{is a rare}} {{mountain}} <b>ungulate</b> <b>animal</b> {{species with}} a mosaic range. In the Sikhote-Alin Reserve, the goral {{is located at the}} northern limit of its distribution. The main part of its population is concentrated in the coastal area, in the Abrek natural landmark. In the early XX century, the goral occupied another small area along the coast – 20 km south of the Abrek natural landmark. Currently, the total area of species' habitats is only 7. 1 km 2. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the population size, population density and some demographic parameters of the goral population. Also, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the photo-trap method which is a new approach to the study and monitoring of this rare species. Accounting studies in the Abrek natural landmark were carried out in October 2014 – January 2015 (1401 trap-days); also, at the same time we worked in the second area during three seasons (2014 – 2017, 1326 trap-days). Estimation of the abundance and annual survival of the goral has been carried out using stochastic «capture – recapture» models presented in the software MARK. In the Abrek natural landmark for an effective area of 4 km 2 (63 % of this habitat's area), the average density of the goral population was 15. 4 animals per km 2 (CI 95 % = 14. 6 – 18. 2 individuals per km 2), in the second area (0. 7 km 2) completely accounted – 21. 0 individuals per km 2 (CI 95 % = 20. 1 – 28. 6 individuals per km 2). The total abundance of goral individuals in the Reserve remains, apparently, at the level of the late 1980 s. And currently it is about 110 – 140 individuals. According to our preliminary data, the total annual survival in the first year was 0. 73 (CI 95 % = 0. 41 – 0. 91), and by the end of the second year it was 0. 72 (CI 95 % = 0. 31 – 0. 93). Female animals have prevailed in the population structure, and the sex ratio for adult animals was 1 : 1. 5. The fertility rate was 0. 61. In comparison with the data obtained in the late 1970 s, currently the age and sex structure of the goral population has changed somewhat, and the rate of reproduction has decreased. The use of photo-traps significantly improves the quality of the goral population monitoring. However, photo-trap monitoring is a fairly expensive and time-consuming process. So it is advisable to apply this method in habitats which are most important for conservation of this rare species...|$|E

Total 81 isolates of hydatid cyst collected from <b>ungulate</b> <b>animals</b> from different geographical areas of North India {{were identified by}} sequencing of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (coxi) gene. Three genotypes belonging to E. granulosus sensu stricto complex were identified (G 1, G 2 and G 3 genotypes).

Molecular diversity indices represent overall high mitochondrial DNA diversity for these populations, but low nucleotide diversity between haplotypes. The neutrality tests were used to analyze signatures of historical demographic events. The Tajima’s D test and Fu’s FS test showed negative value, indicating deviations from neutrality and both suggested recent population expansion for the populations. Pairwise fixation index was significant for pairwise comparison of different populations (except between South America and East Asia, Middle East and Europe, South America and Europe, Africa and Australia), indicating genetic differentiation among populations.

60|$|Mr. Mivart then asks (and this is {{his second}} objection), if natural {{selection}} be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage, why has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty stature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel, guanaco and macrauchenia? Or, again, why has not {{any member of the}} group acquired a long proboscis? With respect to South Africa, which was formerly inhabited by numerous herds of the giraffe, the answer is not difficult, and can best be given by an illustration. In every meadow in England, in which trees grow, we see the lower branches trimmed or planed to an exact level by the browsing of the horses or cattle; and what advantage would it be, for instance, to sheep, if kept there, to acquire slightly longer necks? In every district some one kind of animal will almost certainly be able to browse higher than the others; and it is almost equally certain that this one kind alone could have its neck elongated for this purpose, through natural selection and the effects of increased use. In South Africa the competition for browsing on the higher branches of the acacias and other trees must be between giraffe and giraffe, and not with the other <b>ungulate</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R

It has been influenced negatively by the human disturbance such as overgrazing, farming, wood harvesting, digging herbs and illegal hunting {{as well as by}} the rapid industrial development for mineral and energy resources such as oil and coal. A plan for biodiversity conservation is so urgent for the basin that the contradiction between biodiversity protection and economic development can be solved. Here, we propose a conception for a national desert park in the basin. Firstly, the boundary of the Dzungaria Basin was determined through topographic mapping, field investigation, and historical data. Secondly, the current biological diversity in terms of the desert vegetation types, ephemeral plant species, and the wildlife was then analyzed in details.

Thirdly, the feasibility of biodiversity conservation was also analyzed based on the distribution of key areas for further development of energy and mineral resources, the current status of nature reserves and the international experience of national preserves.

6000|$|The {{remarkable}} progressive {{change of}} a four or five-toed ancestor into the one-toed horse, and the equally remarkable {{division of the}} whole group of <b>ungulate</b> <b>animals</b> into the odd-toed and even-toed divisions, Mr. Cope attempts to explain by the effects of impact and use among animals which frequented hard or swampy ground respectively. On hard ground, it is urged, the long middle toe would be most used and subjected to the greatest strains, and would therefore acquire both strength and development. It would then be still more exclusively used, and the extra nourishment required by it would {{be drawn from the}} adjacent less-used toes, which would accordingly diminish in size, till, after a long series of changes, the records of which are so well preserved in the American tertiary rocks, the true one-toed horse was developed. In soft or swampy ground, on the other hand, the tendency would be to spread out the foot so that there were two toes on each side. The two middle toes would thus be most used and most subject to strains, and would, therefore, increase {{at the expense of the}} lateral toes. There would be, no doubt, an advantage in these two functional toes being of equal size, so as to prevent twisting of the foot while walking; and variations tending to bring this about would be advantageous, and would therefore be preserved. Thus, by a parallel series of changes in another direction, adapted to a distinct set of conditions, we should arrive at the symmetrical divided hoofs of our deer and cattle. The fact that sheep and goats are specially mountain and rock-loving animals may be explained by their being a later modification, since the divided hoof once formed is evidently well adapted to secure a firm footing on rugged and precipitous ground, although it could hardly have been first developed in such localities. Mr. Cope thus concludes: [...] "Certain it is that the length of the bones in the feet of the ungulate orders has a direct relation to the dryness of the ground they inhabit, and the possibility of speed which their habit permits them or necessarily imposes on them."[205] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{domestication}} {{of plants}} and animals was extremely important anthropologically. Previous studies have revealed a general tendency for populations of livestock species to include deeply divergent maternal lineages, indicating that they were domesticated in multiple, independent events from genetically discrete wild populations. However, in water buffalo, there are suggestions that a similar deep maternal bifurcation may have originated from a single population. These hypotheses have rarely been rigorously tested {{because of a lack of}} sufficient wild samples. To investigate the origin of the domestic yak (Poephagus grunnies), we analyzed 637 bp of maternal inherited mtDNA from 13 wild yaks (including eight wild yaks from a small population in west Qinghai) and 250 domesticated yaks from major herding regions. Results The domestic yak populations had two deeply divergent phylogenetic groups with a divergence time of > 100, 000 yrs BP. We here show that haplotypes clustering with two deeply divergent maternal lineages in domesticated yaks occur in a single, small, wild population. This finding suggests that all domestic yaks are derived from a single wild gene pool. However, there is no clear correlation of the mtDNA phylogenetic clades and the 10 morphological types of sampled yaks indicating that the latter diversified recently. Relatively high diversity was found in Qinghai and Tibet around the current wild distribution, in accordance with previous suggestions that the earliest domestications occurred in this region. Conventional molecular clock estimation led to an unrealistic early dating of the start of the domestication. However, Bayesian estimation of the coalescence time allowing a relaxation of the mutation rate are better in agreement with a domestication during the Holocene as supported by archeological records. Conclusion The information gathered here and the previous studies of other animals show that the demographic histories of domestication of livestock species were highly diverse despite the common general feature of deeply divergent maternal lineages. The results further suggest that domestication of local wild prey <b>ungulate</b> <b>animals</b> was a common occurrence during the development of human civilization following the postglacial colonization in different locations of the world, including the high, arid Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. </p...|$|R

Recreational hunters were surveyed each month for a year about these matters, and participated in a choice experiment to identify characteristics of preferred hunts for Sika deer. The choice experiment used travel distance as the numeraire of value to overcome resistance to the commodification of recreational hunting, using an adaptive pivot design to address the wide variance in distances travelled. The study identified significant non-market benefits of recreational hunting.

Spatial and temporal separation of different types of hunters, as well as management of harvest and activity levels provide opportunities for significantly enhancing the value of recreational hunting...|$|R

50|$|The aquatic {{lifestyle}} of cetaceans first {{began in the}} Indian subcontinent from even-toed ungulates 50 million years ago, {{over a period of}} at least 15 million years, however a jawbone discovered in Antarctica may reduce this to 5 million years. Archaeoceti is an extinct parvorder of Cetacea containing ancient whales. The traditional theory of cetacean evolution, first proposed by Van Valen in 1966, was that whales were related to the mesonychids, an extinct order of carnivorous <b>ungulates</b> (hoofed <b>animals)</b> that resembled wolves with hooves and were a sister group of the artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates). This theory arose due to similarities between the unusual triangular teeth of the mesonychids and those of early whales. However, molecular phylogeny data indicates that whales are very closely related to the artiodactyls, with hippopotamuses as their closest living relative. Because of this, cetaceans and hippopotamuses are placed in the same suborder, Whippomorpha. Cetartiodactyla (formed from the words Cetacea and Artiodactyla) is a proposed name for an order containing both cetaceans and artiodactyls. However, the earliest anthracotheres, the ancestors of hippos, do not appear in the fossil record until the Middle Eocene, millions of years after Pakicetus, the first known whale ancestor, appeared during the Early Eocene, implying the two groups diverged well before the Eocene. Since molecular analysis identifies artiodactyls as being very closely related to cetaceans, mesonychids are probably an offshoot from Artiodactyla, and cetaceans did not derive directly from them, but possibly sharing a common ancestor.|$|R
40|$|Most {{ungulates}} are {{gregarious species}} and are typically observed in {{groups that are}} flexible in size and composition. Individuals can join or leave conspecifics, resulting in fission (splitting) or fusion (amalgamation) of groups (Wilson, 1975; Gerard and Loisel, 1995; Conradt and Roper, 2000; Krause et al., 2000). The tendency to join or to leave groups depends on the attraction between individuals (Hamilton, 1971). In order to maintain group consistency, animals must synchronise their activity and motion and they must remain within an appropriate distance of neighbours (Deneubourg and Goss, 1989). However the mechanisms implicated in group dynamics of vertebrates, and in particular spacing of individuals, are poorly understood (Couzin et al., 2002; Krause and Ruxton, 2002). In vertebrates, individuals of different age and sex classes do not mix randomly, but are assorted by phenotypes (Krause et al., 2000; Ward and Krause, 2001; Croft et al., 2003). In <b>ungulates,</b> individual <b>animals</b> tend to associate and/or interact primarily with conspecifics belonging to the same (social) category, e. g. sex and age (Bon and Campan, 1996; see also Conradt, 1998). Social segregation between the sexes is a characteristic of the socio-spatial organization at a population level in social and dimorphic ungulates, and may result from several mechanisms, before and/or after fusion (Bon et al., 2005). For example, group fusion could be dependent upon the capacity of individuals to discriminate the activity or the phenotype of conspecifics at a distance. Weckerly et al. (2001) observed that Roosevelt elk Cervus elaphus roosevelti females avoid male groups exceeding six individuals. Bon and Campan (1996) proposed that social segregation between adults could result from social ontogeny – juvenile males being more motivated to interact than females using pseudo-sexual and agonistic-like interactions. As a result females may avoid or be indifferent to males. This {{would result in a}} social auto-segregation, i. e. males and females would prefer to associate with same-sex peers, which can have long-lasting effects during adulthood (Bon et al., 2001).

This paper updates a review of frugivory and seed dispersal by vertebrates in the Oriental Region (tropical and subtropical Asia) published in 1998. The major conclusions remain the same. Small fruits are consumed by a wide range of potential seed dispersal agents, including species that thrive in small forest fragments and degraded landscapes. Larger and larger-seeded fruits are consumed by progressively fewer dispersers, and the largest depend on a few species of mammals and birds which are highly vulnerable to hunting, fragmentation, and habitat loss. Controlling hunting in both forest areas and the agricultural matrix must be a top priority for conservation. A lot more natural history information has been added to the literature since 1998. This reinforces previous evidence for the importance of hornbills, bulbuls, elephants, gibbons, civets, and fruit bats in seed dispersal, and suggests that the roles of green pigeons, macaques, rodents, bears, and deer were previously underestimated. The taxa for which additional natural history observations would be most valuable include fish, pheasants, pigeons, babblers, rodents, and even-toed <b>ungulates.</b> For other <b>animal</b> taxa, future frugivory and seed dispersal studies need to focus more on the fitness consequences for both the plants and the animals...|$|R

It is a great challenge to manage their depredation on livestock at global level. In this study, I examined spatiotemporal patterns of leopard diet composition in Bardia National Park, Nepal, the buffer zones surrounding the park and a recently established habitat corridor that extends towards a protected area in India. Based on analyses of leopard scat contents, I investigated how the proportions of three main prey categories, i. e. wild <b>ungulates,</b> domestic <b>animals</b> and smaller wild prey, differed between the park, buffer zones and the corridor. I also investigated how diet composition had changed over time by comparing my data (from 2013) with scat content data that were collected during 2000, prior {{to the establishment of}} the corridor. Spatially, scats were distributed mainly along the border of the national park (28), the buffer zones (24), and in the corridor (21). Only two scats were found further than 500 m inside the park. Out of 63 scats with recognizable content (10 scats contained only grass, soil or bone fragments and were omitted from the analyses), 29 (46 %) were from wild ungulates (26 chital (Axis axis) and 3 nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus)) and 12 (19 %) contained smaller wild mammals and birds. Among these, 3 were rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and 3 were langur (Semnopithecus hector). Twenty-two scats (35 %) contained domestic animals, i. e. 14 goat, 5 pig and 3 sheep. Statistical analysis (G-test) showed no significant differences in diet composition between scats collected during 2013 within the national park and outside in the buffer zones and corridor. This was evident both when grouping the prey items into three categories (i. e. ungulates, domestic and other; G= 0. 201, DF= 2, P= 0. 905), and when grouping the prey into two categories (i. e. wild prey and domestic prey; G= 0. 191, DF= 1, P= 0. 662). However, {{there was a significant difference}} in composition of scats collected in 2000 and 2013 when using two prey categories (Wild and domestic; G= 3. 976, DF= 1, P= 0. 0462). Scat samples from 2013 contained 64 % goat, 23 % pig, 14 % sheep and no calves, and these proportions were almost identical as reported losses among 161 interviewed households (i. e. 65 % goat, 22 % pig, 10 % sheep and 3 % calves. The similarity of the results indicate that the scat analyses were reliable, and also identify goats as the most commonly killed domestic prey. I suggest two explanations to the lack of difference in composition of scats collected inside and outside the national park. Firstly, the two parts of the study area were relatively small, and leopards may have moved between them. Secondly, scats found within the park were located near the park border, thereby suggesting that these leopards may have moved frequently outside to feed on domestic animals. The difference between scats collected in 2000 and 2013 was mainly due to an increase in consumption of domestic animals. This may indicate that leopards are more in contact with humans following the establishment of the habitat corridor. This study and other studies have shown that leopards are highly opportunistic animals that commonly consume domestic prey when they are available. Hence, conservation efforts aimed at connecting protected areas should take into account that an increased distribution of wild carnivores is likely followed by elevated conflicts with humans...|$|R

I also investigated how diet composition had changed over time by comparing my data (from 2013) with scat content data that were collected during 2000, prior {{to the establishment of}} the corridor. Spatially, scats were distributed mainly along the border of the national park (28), the buffer zones (24), and in the corridor (21). Only two scats were found further than 500 m inside the park. Out of 63 scats with recognizable content (10 scats contained only grass, soil or bone fragments and were omitted from the analyses), 29 (46 %) were from wild ungulates (26 chital (Axis axis) and 3 nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus)) and 12 (19 %) contained smaller wild mammals and birds. Among these, 3 were rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and 3 were langur (Semnopithecus hector). Twenty-two scats (35 %) contained domestic animals, i. e. 14 goat, 5 pig and 3 sheep. Statistical analysis (G-test) showed no significant differences in diet composition between scats collected during 2013 within the national park and outside in the buffer zones and corridor. This was evident both when grouping the prey items into three categories (i. e. ungulates, domestic and other; G= 0. 201, DF= 2, P= 0. 905), and when grouping the prey into two categories (i. e. wild prey and domestic prey; G= 0. 191, DF= 1, P= 0. 662). However, {{there was a significant difference}} in composition of scats collected in 2000 and 2013 when using two prey categories (Wild and domestic; G= 3. 976, DF= 1, P= 0. 0462). Scat samples from 2013 contained 64 % goat, 23 % pig, 14 % sheep and no calves, and these proportions were almost identical as reported losses among 161 interviewed households (i. e. 65 % goat, 22 % pig, 10 % sheep and 3 % calves. The similarity of the results indicate that the scat analyses were reliable, and also identify goats as the most commonly killed domestic prey. I suggest two explanations to the lack of difference in composition of scats collected inside and outside the national park. Firstly, the two parts of the study area were relatively small, and leopards may have moved between them. Secondly, scats found within the park were located near the park border, thereby suggesting that these leopards may have moved frequently outside to feed on domestic animals. The difference between scats collected in 2000 and 2013 was mainly due to an increase in consumption of domestic animals. This may indicate that leopards are more in contact with humans following the establishment of the habitat corridor. This study and other studies have shown that leopards are highly opportunistic animals that commonly consume domestic prey when they are available. Hence, conservation efforts aimed at connecting protected areas should take into account that an increased distribution of wild carnivores is likely followed by elevated conflicts with humans...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} informing people of tick-borne encephalitis and vaccination against this disease. Our diploma thesis has four objectives in total. The first objective was to ascertain {{how many of the}} respondents were vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis. The second and the third objectives were to demonstrate the reasons of vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents. The fourth objective was to analyze the attitudes of the respondents to publicization of the tick-borne encephalitis issue. As an infection with the natural focus, the disease is caused by a tick-borne encephalitis virus belonging among flaviviruses. The carrier is a sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus). Ticks live as parasites on reservoir animals, such as small rodents, <b>ungulates</b> and domestic <b>animals.</b> The clinical picture of the disease has mostly two stages and the symptomatologic form affects in particular adults and seniors. South Bohemia is a significant focus of tick-borne encephalitis with the sickness rate considerably exceeding the average of the Czech Republic. The most efficient prevention of the disease is vaccination. Two vaccines have been registered in the Czech Republic at present, namely FSME-Immun of Baxter and Encepur of Novartis. Both the vaccines are intended for children from 1 year of age. The basic vaccination scheme consists of 3 doses and the vaccinated person needs to be revaccinated every 3 - 5 years. It follows from the questionnaire research that 49 % {{of the total number of}} 136 respondents are vaccinated. As expected, the most frequent reason for vaccination (65 %) is the fear of becoming infected with tick-borne encephalitis. Other reasons are the interventions of the surrounding persons persuading the person to become vaccinated (19 %) and the financial contribution of the health insurance company or the employer (16 %). 35 % of the unvaccinated respondents do not plan to become vaccinated in the future. Approximately 40 % of the unvaccinated respondents feel that they do not need the vaccination or do not trust vaccination as such. 42 % of the unvaccinated persons would agree to vaccination if they received a financial contribution of the health insurance company or the employer, but nothing at all would convince 35 % of the unvaccinated respondents. It follows from the research that most respondents are satisfied with the quantity and the content of the information about tick-borne encephalitis. They do not think that anything should be changed in the system of informing of the disease. This thesis contributes to monitoring the trends in thinking of the public, and will eventuate in the finding which way the education of people about tick-borne encephalitis should be directed...|$|R
