5|$|The Big Four, {{along with}} Rod Laver, Tony Roche and Ivan Lendl, {{are the only}} men in Open Era history to reach the semifinals at all four Majors in a single {{calendar}} year. Federer has achieved this a record five times in his career so far and Djokovic four times. However, this feat was accomplished many more times in the pre-Open Era. Similarly, the Big Four make <b>up</b> <b>four</b> of the ten players to have made the semi-finals twice or more {{at each of the}} four Grand Slam events. Additionally, the Big Four make <b>up</b> <b>four</b> of the ten players to have reached the final at each of the four Grand Slam events. Finally, prior to 2003, no man had ever made 20 grand slam singles finals, with Ivan Lendl leading the way with 19 grand slam singles finals. However, since then, Federer (29), Nadal (23) and Djokovic (21) have each surpassed this mark.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority.

The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine <b>up,</b> <b>four</b> down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} {{under the}} command of Major F.P. Chuvakin from the 2nd Brigade composed of 45 tanks, 37 of which were from the brigade and the remaining eight from the KMG, and a machine gun and rifle battalion, was attached to the KMG to mop up remaining Polish resistance in the Augustów Forest and to prevent them from fleeing to Lithuania. On 22 September, in the area of Sapotskin, the detachment engaged units of the Polish 101st and 102nd Uhlan Regiments, as well as the 110th Reserve Uhlan Regiment, and other units retreating from Grodno. Most of the Polish troops escaped into the forest because of the slow advance of the detachment. Around three companies of Polish troops were dispersed and several officers were killed, among them the Grodno defense commander, Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński. The retreating Polish forces left mines behind them, which blew <b>up</b> <b>four</b> BT-7 tanks. Chuvakin's troops also lost 11 killed and 14 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de France his squadron broke <b>up.</b> <b>Four</b> ships were {{sent back to}} France in 1797 and 1798 as Île de France could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île de France and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to the Directory then ruling France. With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering Forte to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798. Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E

Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later.

5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of the shoot, Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the shoot only wrapping <b>up</b> <b>four</b> months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E
5|$|Everton picked <b>up</b> <b>four</b> {{points from}} their opening 12 league {{games of the}} 1994–95 season, and Southall {{received}} death threats after being confronted by an Everton fan during a match at Goodison Park. Walker was sacked and replaced by Joe Royle, who led the club to a 2–0 win over Liverpool in his first match in charge – this game also marked a record 35th Merseyside derby appearance for Southall. It was also the second match of seven consecutive games Everton went without conceding a goal – another club record. Southall then conceded just one goal (a penalty) in five games {{en route to the}} 1995 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. Everton won the game 1–0, with Southall making a double save from Paul Scholes; the victory left Southall as the most decorated Everton player in the club's history.|$|E
