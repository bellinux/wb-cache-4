5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1880, by Gustav Hartlaub in the Journal für Ornithologie, as Sorella Emini Bey. Hartlaub {{gave it the}} specific name Emini Bey in honour of the explorer Emin Pasha, who collected the type specimen in modern South Sudan or Uganda near Lado, and it is occasionally given the eponymous common name Emin Bey's sparrow. Hartlaub's <b>unusual</b> <b>spelling</b> of its specific epithet as two words led some to spell the name emini or emini-bey. No subspecies are recognised, but one was described by British ornithologist George L. G. Van Someren in 1922 from Archers Post in central Kenya, as Sorella eminibey guasso.|$|E

Knauf had plotted the story's broad strokes {{as well as several}} plot details from early on and knew the story destination until the final scene. However, the resulting 180-page long script was twice the length of a typical feature film script, and Knauf still felt that it was too short to do his story justice. He therefore shelved the screenplay as a learning experience. In the meantime, Hollywood studios rejected all but one of Knauf's other scripts, often for being [...] "too weird." ...|$|E
500|$|William Speirs Bruce {{was born}} at 43 Kensington Gardens Square [...] in London, the fourth child of Samuel Noble Bruce, a Scottish physician, and his Welsh wife Mary, née Lloyd. His middle name came from another branch of the family; its <b>unusual</b> <b>spelling,</b> as {{distinct}} from the more common [...] "Spiers", tended to cause problems for reporters, reviewers and biographers. William passed his early childhood in the family's London home at 18 Royal Crescent, Holland Park, {{under the tutelage of}} his grandfather, the Revd William Bruce. There were regular visits to nearby Kensington Gardens, and sometimes to the Natural History Museum; according to Samuel Bruce these outings first ignited young William's interest in life and nature.|$|E

Fiona and Mandor are present: it is unclear whether they are in charge, or merely blameless observers as they claim to be. Both are seriously wounded (their weapons forcing them into confrontation against their wills) but both survive. It is revealed that Castle Amber itself appears to be sufficiently sentient to be attempting to influence affairs.|$|R
500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's <b>unusual</b> <b>spelling</b> was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has {{described}} his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E

A causal association was supported by finding a source of carbon monoxide in a patient's home, workplace or vehicle; results of screening tests that ruled out other illnesses; an abnormally high carboxyhemoglobin level in 11 of 14 patients tested, and abatement or resolution of symptoms when the source of carbon monoxide was removed. Exposed household pets provided an important clue to the diagnosis in some cases.

In the film, [...] "happiness" [...] is misspelled (as [...] "happyness") outside the daycare facility Gardner's son attends.|$|E
2500|$|Chern's surname is {{a common}} Chinese surname which is now usually spelt Chen. The <b>unusual</b> <b>spelling</b> [...] "Chern" [...] is a {{transliteration}} in the old Gwoyeu Romatzyh (GR) romanization for Mandarin Chinese used {{in the early twentieth}} century China. It uses special spelling rules to indicate different tones of Mandarin, which is a tonal language with four tones. [...] The silent r in [...] "Chern" [...] indicates a second-tone syllable, written [...] "Chén" [...] in pinyin but in practice often written by non-Chinese without the tonal mark. [...] In GR the spelling of his given name [...] "Shiing-Shen" [...] indicates a third tone for Shiing and a first tone for Shen, which are equivalent to the syllables [...] "Xǐngshēn" [...] in pinyin.|$|E

Given his background in industry, and given President Eisenhower's predominance in defense matters, McElroy's appointment was not <b>unusual.</b> He <b>spelled</b> out his mandate the day he assumed office: [...] "I conceive the role of the Secretary of Defense to be that of captain of President Eisenhower's defense team." ...|$|R

40|$|Fluctuations {{in spring}} climate {{in the western}} United States over the last 4 – 5 decades are {{described}} by examining changes in the blooming of plants and the timing of snowmelt–runoff pulses. The two measures of spring’s onset that are employed are the timing of first bloom of lilac and honeysuckle bushes from a long-term cooperative phenological network, and {{the timing of the}} first major pulse of snowmelt recorded from high-elevation streams. Both measures contain year-to-year fluctuations, with typical year-to-year fluctuations at a given site of one to three weeks. These fluctuations are spatially coherent, forming regional patterns that cover most of the west. Fluctuations in lilac first bloom dates are highly correlated to those of honeysuckle, and both are significantly correlated with those of the spring snowmelt pulse. Each of these measures, then, probably respond to a common mechanism. Various analyses indicate that anomalous temperature exerts the greatest influence upon both interannual and secular changes in the onset of spring in these networks. Earlier spring onsets since the late 1970 s are a remarkable feature of the records, and reflect the <b>unusual</b> <b>spell</b> of warmer-than-normal springs in western North America during this period. The warm episodes are clearly related to larger-scale atmospheric conditions across North America and the North Pacific, but whether this is predominantly a...|$|R

40|$|Data {{collected}} {{around the}} Santa Catalina Mountains in Arizona {{as part of}} the Cumulus Photogrammetric, In Situ and Doppler Observations (CuPIDO) experiment during the 2006 summer monsoon season are used to investigate the effect of soil moisture on the surface energy balance, boundary layer (BL) characteristics, thermally forced orographic circulations, and orographic cumulus convection. An <b>unusual</b> wet <b>spell</b> allows separation of the two-month campaign in a wet and a dry soil period. Days in the wet soil period tend to have a higher surface latent heat flux, lower soil and air temperatures, a more stable and shallower BL, and weaker solenoidal forcing resulting in weaker anabatic flow, in comparison with days in the dry soil period. The wet soil period is also characterized by higher humidity and moist static energy in the BL, implying a lower cu-mulus cloud base and higher convective available potential energy. Therefore, this period witnesses rather early growth of orographic cumulus convection, growing rapidly to the cumulonimbus stage, often before noon, and producing precipitation rather efficiently, with relatively little lightning.

6000|$|Much more of {{the same}} kind was told me, but in so {{confused}} and rambling a manner that I could make nothing out of it, till I inquired how long ago it was that all this happened, when they told me that after their people were taken away the Bugis came in their praus to trade in Aru, and to buy tripang and birds' nests. It is not impossible that something similar to what they related to me really happened when the early Portuguese discoverers first came to Aru, and has formed the foundation for a continually increasing accumulation of legend and fable. I have no doubt that to the next generation, or even before, I myself shall be transformed into a magician or a demigod, a worker of miracles, and a being of supernatural knowledge. They already believe that all the animals I preserve will come to life again; and to their children it will be related that they actually did so. An <b>unusual</b> <b>spell</b> of fine weather setting in just at my arrival has made them believe I can control the seasons; and the simple circumstance of my always walking alone in the forest is a wonder and a mystery to them, as well as my asking them about birds and animals I have not yet seen, and showing an acquaintance with their form, colours, and habits. These facts are brought against me when I disclaim knowledge of what they wish me to tell them. [...] "You must know," [...] say they; [...] "you know everything: you make the fine weather for your men to shoot, and you know all about our birds and our animals as well as we do; and you go alone into the forest and are not afraid." [...] Therefore every confession of ignorance on my part is thought to be a blind, a mere excuse to avoid telling them too much. My very writing materials and books are to them weird things; and were I to choose to mystify them by a few simple experiments with lens and magnet, miracles without end would in a few years cluster about me; and future travellers, penetrating to Wanumbai, world h hardly believe that a poor English naturalist, who had resided a few months among them, could have been the original of the supernatural being to whom so many marvels were attributed.|$|R

The <b>unusual</b> pronunciation versus <b>spelling</b> of who is because the vowel was formerly /aː/, and thus it did not undergo the sound change in Old English, but in Middle English (following spelling change) the vowel changed to /uː/ and it followed the same sound change as how before it, but with the Middle English spelling unchanged.|$|R
