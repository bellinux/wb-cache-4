5|$|Although {{the battle}} was a British victory, there was {{criticism}} of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships {{did not return to}} Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline {{for the remainder of the}} year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.|$|E
5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by {{a visit to the}} 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa, where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} no sitting justices at the {{beginning}} of Washington's term, he had the <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> fill the entire body of United States federal judges with his selections. Despite this, Washington appointed only 28 judges to the United States district courts, due to the smaller size of the judiciary at the time; there were far fewer states, most states had a single district court, and each district had a single judge assigned to it. Because intermediate federal appellate courts had not yet been established, this, combined with the Supreme Court appointments, constituted the total number of federal judicial appointments made by Washington. The number is roughly 10% of the record 376 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan from 1980 to 1988, when the judiciary was much larger, and less than 5% of the number of active federal judges serving as of July 2010. Richard Peters, Jr. served for over 36 years, the longest of Washington's appointments.|$|E

25|$|The bridges in Fulton County exhibit {{two types}} of steel truss bridge construction, Pratt bridge and Parker, which were the most common early types of steel truss bridges.

At the heart of the exhibition is Twombly’s work exploring the cycles associated with seasons, nature and the passing of time. Several key groups are brought together for the first time, such as Tate’s Four Seasons (1993–94) with those from the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The exhibition also explores how Twombly is influenced by antiquity, myth and the Mediterranean, for example the violent red swirls in the Bacchus 2005 paintings which bring to mind the drunken god of wine.

25|$|Most of {{the circles}} are of fairly modest {{dimensions}} and Burl has theorised {{that they could}} have been constructed by a single family. Transporting the massive recumbents was a different matter, however; the fifty-ton recumbent at Old Keig was transported from six miles away and may have needed up to 200 people to drag it to its final resting place. The circle at Strichen provided a <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> test how the recumbents might have been transported. It was incorrectly restored in the 19th century by Lord Lovat, so between 1979–83 it was fully excavated and correctly restored by a team led by Burl, Ian Hampsher-Monk and Philip Abramson. The restoration required the team to move some of the stones, and {{it was found that the}} most efficient non-mechanical means of doing so was to use drag the stones along a slippery path of wet straw using logs as a kind of sledge.|$|E
25|$|The {{geomorphology}} of the Mount Meager massif {{resembles that}} of Glacier Peak, another Cascade Arc volcano located in the U.S. state of Washington. It consists of at least four overlapping stratovolcanoes that are younger from south to north. With a total volume of , Mount Meager is older than most volcanoes in the Cascade Arc, tracing its history back to 2,200,000years ago. In the Cascade Range, the oldest volcanoes are generally {{no more than a}} million years old. This includes Mount Rainier (500,000yearsold), Lassen Peak (25,000years old), Mount Jefferson (290,000years old) and Mount St. Helens (50,000years old). However, portions of Mount Meager formed in the last million years. The volcano is made of volcanic rocks ranging from rhyodacite to basalt. Rhyodacite forms a series of eroded volcanic plugs which represent the highest peaks of Meager. Their flanks are covered with their eruptive products and serve as the surface expressions of intrusions. As a result, they provide a <b>unique</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> study the relationships between magma chambers and their lavas. The mafic, intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks of Meager were erupted from at least eight volcanic vents.|$|E
