5|$|In 1950, Perseus {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} steam catapult. The catapult {{was placed on}} top of the carrier's existing flight deck and the deckhouse to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches were made by the catapult, beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, and moving on to with <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by manned aircraft of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the catapult to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of manned aircraft were made by the British and the Americans. Perseus arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the catapult removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.|$|E
5|$|Intrepid steamed from Ulithi {{back to the}} Philippines {{with orders}} to strike Nichols and Nielsen airfields, destroy {{shipping}} in Manila Bay and to attack concentrations of enemy aircraft encountered between Manila and Batangas. This effort began on November 19. The first strike of the day ran into token resistance {{from a handful of}} Zeros, but the enemies did not press home attacks on the bomber squadrons. Instead, VF-18 fighters initiated combat, chasing down and destroying two enemy aircraft. A solitary Zero flying at higher altitude was spotted by Harris, who led his division in pursuit. Harris put holes in the enemy fighter's starboard wing root firing from long range. The Japanese pilot bailed out, but his plane continued flying for four or five minutes with curious Hellcats following in its wake. They eventually shot down the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Intrepid went to general quarters a number of times throughout the day's strikes and into the evening as enemy planes tested the perimeter of the task group.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, subsonic military aviation focused on eliminating the pilot in favor of remotely operated or completely autonomous vehicles. Several unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs have been developed. In April 2001 the <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft</b> Global Hawk flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003 the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. Major disruptions to air travel in the 21st Century included the closing of U.S. airspace following the September 11 attacks, and the closing of northern European airspace after the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull.|$|E

40|$|At present, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of photographic measurement units {{are in a state of}} "measuring " instead of "photographing". In order to combine "photographing " with "measuring " more closely, an engineering test of low-altitude aerial photography has been carried out on unmanned helicopter, <b>unmanned</b> fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> and <b>unmanned</b> airship. The paper focuses on their flight safety, photographic quality as well as working performance. Seen from the analysis of flight quality, all three aircrafts meet the requirements of photogrammetry. Taking the security performance into account, unmanned helium airship is the best one to adapt to flight in urban areas. As far as efficiency is concerned, <b>unmanned</b> fixed-wing <b>aircraft</b> has the highest working performance. Finally, suggestions are made on how to improve the techniques of <b>unmanned</b> low-altitude civil <b>aircraft</b> photography...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} {{the methods of}} {{increase}} {{the efficiency of the}} compensation of indignations of theonboard integrated control systems of <b>Unmanned</b> <b>Aircrafts</b> are considered. On the basis of generalizationthe disadvantages of inertial and satellite navigation systems it was revealed, {{that as a result of}} theinsufficient compensation of indignations these systems lose a stable condition. They are exposed to barriersand there is unlimited growth of mistakes in time. For the solution of this actual problem of the onboardintegrated control systems a method of increase the efficiency of the compensation of indignations of nonstationarylinear systems in the conditions of uncertainty with the observer and with the correction bymistake of recovery was suggested. For this purpose the conditions of uncertainty were mathematicallystated, the equations of the onboard integrated control systems were completed, as non-stationary object ofmanagement, the observer with correction by mistake of recovery and a matrix of factor of strengthening ofthe observer are made. As a result the system is asymptotically stable to low-frequency indignations and theaccumulation of an error in time at high-frequency indignations is eliminated. Keywords: a condition of uncertainty, a matrix of factor of strengthening of the observer, iasymptoticalstability, low-frequency and high-frequency indignations, nertial and satellite navigation systems, nonstationarylinear systems, onboard integrated control systems, the observer with a correction by mistake ofrecovery, <b>unmanned</b> <b>aircrafts...</b>|$|R
