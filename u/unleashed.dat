5|$|Public {{anticipation}} for {{the game}} was high, owing to the video's demonstration of some two-dimensional gameplay, seen as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. However, critical reception for Sonic <b>Unleashed</b> was mixed, with reviewers praising certain elements, such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio {{that make up the}} environments, and criticizing others, such as the new Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and design concepts. Many reviewers felt that <b>Unleashed</b> was ultimately not the title that would be able to reinvigorate the series. Sonic <b>Unleashed</b> was de-listed in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all Sonic titles with average or lower Metacritic scores from sale in stores. Despite this, the game was released on the PlayStation Network in April 2014.|$|E
5|$|Sonic <b>Unleashed</b> began {{development}} in 2006 after {{the creation of}} its game engine, the Hedgehog Engine. The game was initially conceived as the sequel to Sonic Adventure 2, but the development team began to introduce enough new innovations that separated it from previous games, and it was renamed <b>Unleashed.</b> The Werehog gameplay was conceived to help introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series. The game's existence was first brought to light when Sega trademarked the <b>Unleashed</b> name, and shortly after, images and a gameplay video were leaked {{to the public in}} March 2008. Three versions of the game were developed: one by Sonic Team for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, one by Dimps for the Wii and PlayStation 2, and one by Gameloft for mobile phones.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{anticipation}} {{when the}} first media for <b>Unleashed</b> was revealed was high, as the demonstration videos hinted at a possible return of Sonic to his traditional platforming roots, especially because of the series' declining quality in recent years, {{and a number of}} poorly received titles in the franchise that preceded it, such as the 2006 game, Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it {{was stated}} that <b>Unleashed</b> {{was to be}} {{intended}} solely as a single-player experience, and would not offer any multiplayer or online modes. This was cast into doubt when references to online modes were alluded to around E3 2008, but later interviews re-iterated that <b>Unleashed</b> would have no online modes at all. However, downloadable content, including additional levels, would remain a possibility after the game's release. A demo version was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on December 8, 2008 and on the US and EU PlayStation Stores on December 18 and 24, 2008, respectively. The demo does not contain any of the Werehog stages. On March 12, 2009 Sega released Sonic Unleasheds first downloadable content for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, consisting of four Chun-nan daytime stages and two night stages in addition to two new missions. Since then, more downloadable levels have been added: Spagonia, Holoska, Mazuri, Apotos, Shamar, Empire city and Adabat.|$|E
