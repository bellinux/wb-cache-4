5|$|Carlotta Joaquina, {{sometimes}} {{described as}} sinister, {{is said to}} have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly <b>ugly,</b> <b>and</b> she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.|$|E

This would permit the demolition of the Third Avenue Elevated south of 149th Street, which was seen as uneconomical to operate, <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> a hindrance of the avenue below it.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E

5|$|Out of sympathy, Gian Gastone befriended his unhappy sister-in-law, Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria. Her husband, Grand Prince Ferdinando, {{thought her}} too <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> too dull for him. At the same time, Gian Gastone sank {{into a state}} of melancholy. In an attempt to rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi. However, these soirées had no effect and Gian Gastone {{continued}} to weep unceasingly in his private rooms.|$|E
5|$|Rondo Hatton's {{likeness}} from The Brute Man {{inspired the}} appearance {{of one of the}} villain characters in Dave Stevens' Rocketeer comic book as well as the 1991 film adaptation, The Rocketeer. In the film, the seven-foot-tall Tiny Ron Taylor portrays Lothar, an <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> murderous henchman for the story's antagonist. Rick Baker, the special make-up effects artist that worked on the film, designed the character's facial make-up to resemble Hatton's Creeper character, and Lothar dresses in a dark coat and hat similar to his clothing from The Brute Man.|$|E
5|$|Violante Beatrice of Bavaria (Violante Beatrix; 23 January 167330 May 1731) was Grand Princess of Tuscany as {{the wife}} of Grand Prince Ferdinando of Tuscany and Governor of Siena from 1717 until her death. Born a Duchess of Bavaria, the {{youngest}} child of Elector Ferdinand Maria, she married {{the heir to the}} Tuscan throne, Ferdinando de' Medici, in 1689. Violante Beatrice loved him but Ferdinando did not return her affection, declaring her too <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> too dull. Her brother-in-law, Prince Gian Gastone, befriended her out of sympathy, a friendship that lasted until Violante Beatrice's demise.|$|E

5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic goddess Nirriti is {{associated}} with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize offerings to keep her away. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati {{is associated}} with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> {{is associated with}} the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and has a bad temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka-Tantra, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and antithesis of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, luck and beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and poverty.|$|E

50|$|Weekend Pussy Hunt was a {{film noir}} cartoon. We {{serialized}} {{it so that}} every week there'd be a cliffhanger. Its style was a 1940s live-action film noir movie. and we based one of the characters, Dirty Dog, {{on one of my}} favorite movie actors, Robert Ryan. Weekend Pussy Hunt was basically a chase movie, a really dark hardboiled thriller. We started off fooling the audience. We wanted them to think it was like a 1940s Warner Brothers chase cartoon between a dog and a cat, but as we moved on, they got <b>uglier</b> <b>and</b> <b>uglier</b> <b>and</b> <b>uglier.</b> You found out more about who this dog was; he was the king of the underworld animals in the neighborhood. So it becomes this ugly dark film noir kind of a movie.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Bull Pain {{attacked}} hero 2 Tuff Tony at East Side Wars. For {{the next}} several years, Pain continued to beat opponents mercilessly using a metal baseball bat he called Brother Pain. The tag team The Bumpin' Uglies followed Pain’s path and began fighting with multiple heroes of the company throughout early 2011. 2 Tuff Tony, The Weedman, and Jailbird Man all individually wrestled Pain, The Bumpin' <b>Uglies,</b> <b>and</b> Baby Bitch Boy at Juggalo Championship Wrestling’s bi-weekly events. Following Rhino’s return to the company at Monster’s Island, an eight man tag team match was booked for Hatchet Attacks with The Weedman, 2 Tuff Tony, Jailbird Man, and Rhino facing Baby Bitch Boy, The Bumpin' <b>Uglies,</b> <b>and</b> Bull Pain.|$|R
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a long}} history of {{interaction}} with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.|$|E
5|$|With {{unprecedented}} {{growth in}} the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Student's Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the Clifton area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The new Union provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100; the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge. Whilst spacious, the Union building is thought {{by many to be}} <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> out of character compared to the architecture {{of the rest of the}} Clifton area, having been mentioned in a BBC poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain. The university has proposed relocating the Union to a more central location as part of its development 'masterplan'. More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise <b>ugly</b> <b>and</b> the model hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined {{together for the}} complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

25|$|To {{make up for}} {{the lack}} of an album, Sheer Terror re-recorded many of the songs from <b>Ugly</b> <b>And</b> Proud, {{releasing}} the result on Blackout as Thanks Fer Nuthin, a jab at the owner of Maze Records. According to Bearer, he originally wanted to call the record Canadian Scumbag. However, upon hearing of the band's new album, Maze Records quickly, and finally, released <b>Ugly</b> <b>And</b> Proud, leading to the band having two records on the market with mostly identical songs.|$|E
