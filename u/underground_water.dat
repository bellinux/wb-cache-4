5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} hydrological cycle, hydrological balance and hydrology of <b>underground</b> <b>waters.</b> <b>Underground</b> <b>waters</b> holding {{in a river}} stream {{is one of the}} most important characteristics of hydrological mode of a river. <b>Underground</b> <b>waters</b> proportion is detected from a line of flow rate in the course of many years via so called separation of underground river stream. There are several methods of separation and problematics of these methods is described in detail in this thesis. What is mentioned further are the factors influencing occurance and size of an elemental outflow rate, these factors being in particular climate, geology,relief of land, vegetation and last but not least human aktivity. Outflow rate which comes through the cycle of <b>underground</b> <b>waters</b> can be considered as an elemental outflow rate. Outflow rate is a subject matter of a further chapter. Water flowing out in a form of an elemental outflow rate creates both surface and <b>underground</b> <b>waters,</b> which are constituents of a cycle of water in the nature, which is described in this thesis in a detail together with surface, <b>underground</b> and subsurface <b>water...</b>|$|R

5|$|There are no large rivers, but {{abundant}} small water streams exist. Some {{of these}} streams are permanent, {{such as the}} Este River, which feeds into the Ave. The source of the Esteiro Stream {{is located at the}} base of Cividade Hill and empties at the beach of Aver-o-Mar, while the Alto River's source is at the base of São Félix and reaches the Atlantic at Rio Alto Beach. The land is well-irrigated, springs and wells are very common, since <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> is often close to the surface.|$|E

The contamination of the karst <b>underground</b> <b>waters</b> is due to the large number of waste disposal sites leached by rainwater, {{as well as to the}} accidental overflow of various liquids. The reflection of such pollution in the karst <b>underground</b> <b>waters</b> depends on the type and quantity of pollutants, and on the rock structure through which the waters penetrate.

5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E

Gordon goes through <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> channels as aliens pick off the remaining marines. He arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists developed the teleportation technology that allowed travel to Xen. The remaining staff tell Gordon that the satellite failed to reverse {{the effects of the}} resonance cascade as an immensely powerful being {{on the other side of}} the rift is keeping it open. The scientists activate the teleporter to send Gordon to Xen and stop the being. In Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers before him and defeats Gonarch, the huge egg-laying headcrab. At a factory creating alien soldiers, he defeats levitating creatures and enters a giant portal. In a vast cave, Gordon confronts the Nihilanth, the entity maintaining the rift, and destroys it.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E

5|$|Marrakesh {{is one of}} {{the great}} citadels of the Muslim world. The city was {{fortified}} by Tashfin's son, Ali ibn Yusuf, who in 1122–1123 built the ramparts which remain to this day, completed further mosques and palaces, and developed an <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> system in the city known as the rhettara to irrigate his new garden. In 1125, the preacher Ibn Tumert settled in Tin Mal in the mountains to the south of Marrakesh. He preached against the Almoravids and influenced a revolt which succeeded in bringing about the fall of nearby Aghmat, but stopped short of bringing down Marrakesh following an unsuccessful siege in 1130. The Almohads, Masmouda tribesmen from the High Atlas mountains who practiced orthodox Islam, took the city in 1147 under leader Abd al-Mu'min. After a long siege and the killing of some 7,000 people, the last of the Almoravids were exterminated apart from those who sought exile in the Balearic Islands. As a result, almost all the city's monuments were destroyed. The Almohads constructed a range of palaces and religious buildings, including the famous Koutoubia Mosque (1184–1199), and built upon the ruins of an Almoravid palace. It was a twin of the Giralda in Seville and the unfinished Hassan Tower in Rabat, all built by the same designer. The Kasbah housed the residence of the caliph, a title borne by the Almohad rulers from the reign of Abd al-Mu'min, rivaling the far eastern Abbasid Caliphate. The Kasbah was named after the caliph Yaqub al-Mansur. The irrigation system was perfected to provide water for new palm groves and parks, including the Menara Garden. As a result of its cultural reputation, Marrakesh attracted many writers and artists, especially from Andalusia, including the famous philosopher Averroes of Cordoba.|$|E

40|$|New data {{obtained}} during the expedition to Middle Asia (1973) essentially enlarge {{our knowledge of}} foraminifera living in <b>underground</b> <b>waters.</b> Seven new species were discovered in the wells of the Kara-Kum and Ust-Urt deserts.

25|$|Quicksand forms {{when water}} {{saturates}} {{an area of}} loose sand and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer support weight. Quicksand can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing <b>underground</b> <b>water,</b> {{the force of the}} water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.|$|E
