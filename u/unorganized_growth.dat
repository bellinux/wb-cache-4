40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Crown gall {{disease is}} an {{agricultural}} problem {{caused by the}} soil-borne bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. A. tumefaciens oncogenes cause transformed plant cells to overproduce the hormones, auxin and cytokinin. High hormone levels cause <b>unorganized</b> plant cell <b>growth</b> resulting in a gall. Control of crown gall disease is difficult because after plant cell transformation has occurred, the bacterium is no longer required for the disease to progress. Apple trees engineered to express double-stranded RNA of two A. tumefaciens oncogenes, ipt and iaaM, silenced {{the expression of the}} wild-type oncogenes and prevented crown gall disease. Only the iaaM oncogene was targeted for posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) as measured by biological assays and by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RTPCR) on transgenic tissue. However, if the translation initiation sequence of the iaaM construction was eliminated, gall formation was not prevented, indicating that translatable RNA initiates silencing whereas untranslatable RNA does not. Other data indicate that the Arabidopsis thaliana micro-RNA pathway gene is involved in A. tumefaciens-mediated tumorigenesis. A. thaliana plants with a mutation in HEN 1, a gene required for micro-RNA maturation, demonstrated a tenfold reduction in tumorigenesis upon A. tumefaciens infection compared to wild-type.

In vitro propagation techniques have been used on many plant species with varying degrees of success. Several species of birch, a diverse group of ornamental and forest trees, have been propagated using these techniques. Birch plantlets have been produced from axillary shoots, organogeneic callus, and somatic embryos. Organogenic callus and somatic embryogenesis involve cultural conditions that promote rapid <b>unorganized</b> cell <b>growth.</b> The auxin, 2, 4 -D is frequently used in these cultural systems. This study examined the effect of 2, 4 -D exposure on the ability to regenerate birch shoots from callus using thidiazuron (TDZ) and compared the subsequent rate of somaclonal variation in the plants produced via organogenesis and axillary shoot proliferation. Callus tissue was cultured on medium supplemented with 10 uM 2, 4 -D and 1. 0 uM BA for up to 24 weeks and then was transferred to media with varying concentrations of TDZ. A minimum concentration of 0. 01 uM TDZ was required for shoot organogenesis to occur, but a higher frequency of regeneration was obtained with either 0. 1 or 1. 0 uM TDZ. The number of explants differentiating shoots increased with increasing time of exposure to TDZ. Exposure to 2, 4 -D delayed and decreased the number of calli producing shoots, and calli exposed to 2, 4 -D for 18 weeks or more rarely produced shoots regardless of the TDZ concentration or exposure. The formation of albino and chimeral shoots was highest on explants exposed to TDZ without prior exposure to 2, 4 -D. Rooting, acclimation, and field establishment was not influenced by either 2, 4 -D or TDZ exposure. More plants survived the stressful conditions in the field from treatments with prior exposure to 2, 4 -D than from either axillary shoot cultures or plants that had been exposed to TDZ only. Further work needs to be undertaken to determine whether the surviving plants are truly more stress tolerant and to determine if and how 2, 4 -D might be influencing this stress tolerance...|$|R

40|$|The <b>unorganized</b> <b>growth</b> {{in urban}} {{planning}} in Spain {{in the last}} decade of the 20 century and the beginning of the 21 st century has provoked diverse negative consequences for the public interest and specially for the large number of foreigners that have been affected by the serious problem of having declared void and null, building licenses for their properties which were bought in good faith, only to discover that they are obliged to demolish such properties. Our planning laws contemplate a possible compensation for the cancelation of a building license, except in the case of fraud, error or negligence on behalf of the injured party. But along with this demand for the replacement of the integral property of the injured party, it raises the constitutional demand to carry out the decisions of the Courts in its full terms, which corresponds exclusively to the judicial power, as well as to proceed to its execution. To reconcile all the parties involved, we will show the various legal initiatives which have been taken by the different autonomous regions, which have been declared void and null by the Constitutional Court, basically due to the fact that regional parliaments have not got legal powers to regulate process law and additionally, because such initiatives would limit the exclusive faculties of the judges to execute their own decisions. The State also has adopted legal measures which are relevant in criminal and public process laws, so as to try and give a response to this problem.

40|$|Duncan, Randall L. Funanage, Vicky L. Metatropic {{dysplasia}} (MD) is {{a severe}} skeletal dysplasia {{that results in}} {{a significant impact on}} quality of life in patients diagnosed with disease. MD is characterized by striking skeletal changes which include general shortening of long bones, widened metaphysis, and halberd shaped pelvis. Over time, patients display wedging of vertebral bodies (platyspondyly), and progressive kyphoscoliosis. These spinal changes result in reduced spinal integrity with cervical vertebrae instability, spinal stenosis and a reduced respiratory capacity. Mutations in non-selective cation channel, Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 4 (TRPV 4) have been found to cause MD. TRPV 4 associated channelopathies also include peripheral neuropathies and other skeletal dysplasias that range in clinical severity and symptomatic phenotype. As a result, causation, classification and development of TRPV 4 channelopathies are very complex. TRPV 4 channel activity is integral in the Ca 2 + mediated response to a large variety of sensory stimulation from the extracellular environment. TRPV 4 activity can also be regulated by changes in temperature, nociception and natural and synthetic ligands, such as arachidonic acid metabolites and phorbol esters. It is most classically studied as a regulator of Ca 2 + response to changes in osmotic and mechanical forces. The spatial, temporal and intensive properties of [Ca 2 +]i as well as spontaneous Ca 2 + oscillations can {{have a profound effect on}} cell behavior. In the musculoskeletal system, TRPV 4 Ca 2 + signaling regulates the chondrogenic response to osmotic signals and anabolic chondrogenic response under mechanical loads. TRPV 4 also plays a chondroprotective role in normal articular cartilage and is imperative to maintaining joint health. Loss of TRPV 4 often results in osteoarthritis. Whereas most information pertains to normal TRPV 4 physiology and signaling, the effect of TRPV 4 mutation in terms on skeletal development has only recently been studied. Histological analysis of growth plates from lethal variants of MD revealed a highly <b>unorganized</b> <b>growth</b> plate with reduced hypertrophic regions and delayed endochondral ossification, suggesting that mutational TRPV 4 activity disrupts ordered chondrogenesis. Expression of TRPV 4 mutations in numerous cell types alludes to gain-of function activity that results in increased basal and stimulated intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) activity, as well as constitutively open channel gating. However, most studies have been performed in non-endogenous cell types that are either transfected or transformed. To better understand channel properties directly affected by disease, we studied the effect of two TRPV 4 mutations, p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp on Ca 2 + channel activity and chondrocyte function in cells directly isolated from patients with metatropic dysplasia. P. Pro 799 Leu is considered a mutational hotspot and there is a high prevalence of this specific mutation in disease, whereas p. Gly 800 Asp is a novel severe mutation identified by our group. We hypothesize that MD mutations will exhibit increased basal and stimulated [Ca 2 +]i activity that results in improper terminal differentiation of chondrocytes. We further hypothesize that this increase in channel activity is from a direct result of alteration with C-terminal regulatory domains that occur within and immediately prior to mutational occurrence. We observed temperature-dependent [Ca 2 +]i oscillations in both intact and MD chondrocytes; however, MD mutations exhibited increased peak magnitudes of [Ca 2 +]i during oscillations. We have also found increased baseline [Ca 2 +]i in MD primary cells, as well as increased [Ca 2 +]i response to either hypotonic swelling or the TRVP 4 -specific chemical agonist, GSK 1016790 A. Oscillations and stimulation responses could be blocked with TRPV 4 -specific antagonist, GSK 205. Analysis of [Ca 2 +] i response kinetics reveals that MD chondrocytes have significantly increased frequency of temperature-sensitive oscillations, as well as increased magnitude and duration of [Ca 2 +]i responses to given stimuli. Additionally, duration of the response of the novel p. Gly 800 Asp mutation to stimulation was significantly greater than the p. Pro 799 Leu mutation. The altered [Ca 2 +]i activity caused by these TRPV 4 mutations indicates that this region of the channel is essential for proper [Ca 2 +]i regulation and that these mutations result in a gain of Ca 2 + channel activity. TRPV 4 activity has been shown to mimic the expression pattern of chondrogenic markers, Col 2 a 1 and aggrecan, and modulate Sox 9 promotor activity. These data suggest that TRPV 4 is an essential regulator of chondrogenesis. We postulate that MD mutations would result in increased proliferation and reduced terminal differentiation compared to intact chondrocytes. Basally, the proliferative capacity of MD chondrocytes was unaltered compared to WT, yet both p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes display altered chondrogenic differentiation compared to intact chondrocytes. Proteoglycan production was dysregulated in both p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes with both an increase and decrease in proteoglycan production observed, respectively. Expression of chondrogenic markers after bead culture mirrored the effect observed in micromass proteoglycan production. Differential gene expression was observed in that p. Pro 799 Leu chondrocytes upregulated proliferative chondrocyte makers, COL 2 A 1, AGGRECAN and SOX 9 whereas p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes were downregulated in all chondrogenic markers. While the mutational effect appeared to result in opposing dysregulation, both MD chondrocytes p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp mutations exhibited decreased markers of terminal hypertrophy, COL 10 A 1 and RUNX. Therefore, while the mechanism behind regulation of TRPV 4 in chondrogenesis appears differential between, p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp, both mutations result in a disruption of normal chondrogenesis. Mutations of p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp occur directly in or prior to important regulatory domains within the C-terminal end of TRPV 4. In this region, TRPV 4 has been shown to interact with cytoskeletal proteins, MAP 7, actin and tubulin as well as proteins involved in Ca 2 + sensing, including calmodulin (CaM). We have found that similar to what was observed during chondrogenesis, dysregulation of interaction with C-terminal binding partners occurs differentially between the two mutations compared to intact chondrocytes. Actin regulation and binding was lost in p. Pro 799 Leu chondrocytes; however, microtubule binding was increased in p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes. Depolymerization of actin with Cytochalasin D results in a reduction in basal and stimulated Ca 2 + activity that was not observed in p. Pro 799 Leu chondrocytes. Additionally, we observed increased CaM binding in p. Pro 799 Leu that was not observed in p. Gly 800 Asp or intact chondrocytes. Abolishment of microtubules with Vincristine results in a loss of response to HTS; however, it had no effect on basal TRPV 4 activity. These data suggest a role for both actin and tubulin in the regulation of TRPV 4 activity that seems to be stimulation and mutation-dependent. In this study, we present differential modes of regulation for two metatropic dysplasia-causing mutations in the C-terminal end of the protein, p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp. Overall, our findings indicate the complex regulation of TRPV 4 activity in terms of Ca 2 + signal and downstream chondrogenic effects. We also present several possible modes of TRPV 4 channel regulation through interaction with both cytoskeletal proteins and calmodulin. Understanding the mechanisms of TRPV 4 regulation presents multiple avenues of interest for not only skeletal dysplasia causing mutations, but for future study into the maintenance of articular cartilage. In the case of osteoarthritis, the variety of signaling mechanisms we've studied provides several different approaches that could be used to target TRPV 4 as a possible therapeutic for the promotion of overall joint health.
