In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} <b>universal</b> <b>support</b> where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E

Implicitly, this means that full species status will help grant genetically distinct populations added environmental protection.|$|E

2500|$|ERT made {{an early}} {{announcement}} confirming that Rouvas would again be Greece's {{entry in the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2009. He performed his three songs ("Out of Control", [...] "Right on Time" [...] and [...] "This Is Our Night", all composed by Dimitris Kontopoulos) at the Greek finals in February; the latter was the runaway winner with the jury and the viewers, winning 61 {{percent of the vote}} (the largest margin ever, and the most votes received by ERT in a national final). The song debuted at number one on the Greek Digital Singles chart, while Rouvas embarked on a promotional tour of Europe. He said publicly that he hoped to return the contest to Greece the following year. A win was widely anticipated by the Greek public, with the country being one of the three favorites among the Eurovision fans. However, Rouvas finished seventh in the final. The singer and the Greek public were disappointed with the result, and he issued a public apology for his loss. Rouvas received <b>universal</b> <b>support</b> from the public and the media, a first for a Greek Eurovision entrant regardless of result.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} possible {{occurrence of}} Yahweh is as a place-name, [...] "land of Shasu of YHW", in an Egyptian inscription {{from the time}} of Amenhotep III (1402–1363 BCE), the Shasu being nomads from Midian and Edom in northern Arabia. In this case a plausible etymology for the name could be from the root HWY, which would yield the meaning [...] "he blows", appropriate to a weather divinity. There is considerable but not <b>universal</b> <b>support</b> for this view, [...] but it raises the question of how {{he made his way to}} the north. The widely accepted Kenite hypothesis holds that traders brought Yahweh to Israel along the caravan routes between Egypt and Canaan. The strength of the Kenite hypothesis is that it ties together various points of data, such as the absence of Yahweh from Canaan, his links with Edom and Midian in the biblical stories, and the Kenite or Midianite ties of Moses. However, while it is entirely plausible that the Kenites, and others may have introduced Yahweh to Israel, it is unlikely that they did so outside the borders of Israel or under the aegis of Moses, as the Exodus story has it.|$|E

Our results demonstrate that the <b>universal</b> <b>supports</b> fall into two categories differentiated by the mechanism of elimination of the 3 ’-phosphate linkage to produce the desired 3 ’-hydroxyl group. In the first group, the oligomer is quickly cleaved from the support followed by slow dephosphorylation under aggressively basic conditions to generate the 3 ’-hydroxyl group. In the second group, the dephosphorylation step first leads to the cleavage of the oligomer from the support, followed by further deprotection of the oligomer under standard conditions. The first group is exemplified by McLean's 1 classic support (1) and four of the seven supports tested fall into this category. The second group is more nove...|$|R

2500|$|When the new {{parliamentary}} session began on 6 October Fitzwilliam moved an amendment (drafted by Burke) {{to the address}} criticising Lord Malmesbury peace mission to France, {{the only person to}} do so. This near <b>universal</b> <b>support</b> was due [...] "not from Opposition concurring in the measures of Government but from Government abandoning their own measures of to adopt those of Opposition—the regular order of things seems subverted". It was futile to desire peace with [...] "a species of power, with whose very existence all fair and equitable accommodation is incompatible". Furthermore, such a peace would be dishonourable because the government had previously stated it would only seek peace [...] "through the ancient and legitimate government long established in France" [...] and that he solemnly recorded his discharging [...] "of the duty I owe to my king and country". The Annual Register said Fitzwilliam's protest [...] "breathes the genuine spirit first roused, and perhaps, still actuated {{to a greater extent than}} was acknowledged by the British government". Laurence wrote to Fitzwilliam on 26 October that Henry Addington, Speaker of the House of Commons, viewed him as [...] "man of high integrity; no person could say that his lordship had abandoned his principles". Burke wrote to Fitzwilliam on 30 October of his appreciation of [...] "the solo you played in the grand orchestra" [...] and that his arguments were [...] "relished by the public" [...] and were given greater power due to [...] "your personal weight and character". Burke further stated that his Two Letters on a Regicide Peace were a [...] "poor attempt to second what you have done". Fitzwilliam wrote to Burke on 10 November that his pamphlets had [...] "roused a spirit in the country, which does not act, only because those, who ought to make use of it, choose to keep it under". He also claimed that [...] "It is the dread of an [...] expedition slipping over to Ireland, and erecting there the standard of revolt, which makes him [...] drive England headlong into peace". Fitzwilliam wrote to Laurence on 10 November that [...] "Every other political consideration, continental connexions, balance of power in Europe—the existence of civil society itself—is to be sacrificed, rather than give up their system in Ireland. ... Had it been permitted to me to have gratified them [...] in the little they looked for, Ireland would not have been what it now is, a millstone upon the neck of England".|$|E

It was a sad-faced, miserable little man who emerged from the narrow passage into the bustle of the broad thoroughfare. He walked with the nerveless gait of a tramp going on, still going on, indifferent to rain or sun in a sinister detachment from the aspects of sky and earth. Chief Inspector Heat, on the other hand, after watching him for a while, stepped out with the purposeful briskness of a man disregarding indeed the inclemencies of the weather, but conscious of having an authorised mission on this earth and the moral support of his kind. All the inhabitants of the immense town, the population of the whole country, and even the teeming millions struggling upon the planet, were with him—down to the very thieves and mendicants.
