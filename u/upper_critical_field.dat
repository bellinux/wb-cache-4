By employing the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation for the two-band superconductors BaFe 2 (As 1 -xPx) 2, NdO 1 -xFxFeAs, and LiFeAs, we obtained expressions for the <b>upper</b> <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>field,</b> HC 2; GL coherence length, ξGL; and GL penetration depth, λGL, {{as a function of}} temperature and the angular dependency of <b>upper</b> <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>field.</b> By using the experimental values in the obtained expressions, phase diagrams of the <b>upper</b> <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>field</b> parallel, HC 2 ∥c, and perpendicular, HC 2 ⊥c, to the symmetry axis (c-direction) versus temperature are plotted.

40|$|We have derived the {{so-called}} gap equation, which determines the <b>upper</b> <b>critical</b> magnetic <b>field,</b> perpendicular to conducting chains of a quasi-one-dimensional superconductor.

The resistivity of quenched sample exhibits an Arrhenius TAFF behavior for both field directions.
