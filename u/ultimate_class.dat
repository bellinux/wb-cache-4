50|$|This {{receptor}} {{is directly}} associated {{with one of}} its <b>ultimate</b> effectors, the <b>class</b> C L-type calcium channel CaV1.2. This receptor-channel complex is coupled to the Gs G protein, which activates adenylyl cyclase, catalysing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which then activates protein kinase A, and counterbalancing phosphatase PP2A. Protein kinase A {{then goes on to}} phosphorylate (and thus inactivate) myosin light chain kinase, which causes smooth muscle relaxation, accounting for the vasodilatory effects of beta 2 stimulation. The assembly of the signaling complex provides a mechanism that ensures specific and rapid signaling. A two-state biophysical and molecular model has been proposed to account for the pH and REDOX sensitivity of this and other GPCRs.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} {{of a large number}} of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) raises the question of how a particular receptor selectively regulates speciÞc targets.

The b 2 adrenergic receptor was found to be directly asso-ciated with one of its <b>ultimate</b> effectors, the <b>class</b> C L-type calcium channel Cav 1. 2. This complex also contained a G protein, an adenylyl cyclase, cyclic adenosine monophosphateÐ dependent protein kinase, and the counterbal-ancing phosphatase PP 2 A. Our electrophysiological recordings from hip-pocampal neurons demonstrate highly localized signal transduction from the receptor to the channel. The assembly of this signaling complex provides a mechanism that ensures speciÞc and rapid signaling by a G proteinÐ coupled receptor.

40|$|During biosynthesis, class II major {{histocompatibility}} complex molecules are intimately associated with invariant chain (Ii). The Ii-class II association {{has been shown to}} block peptide-class II binding and to affect the <b>ultimate</b> conformation of <b>class</b> II expressed on the cell surface. To assess the biochemical basis for the effects of Ii on class II, we have analyzed the biosynthesis of class II in EL 4 cells transfected with I-Ad with and without Ii. In these studies, we found that Ii {{had a profound effect on}} the biosynthesis of I-Ad. In the absence of Ii, class II could form dimers efficiently, but these dimers appeared to be misfolded and this altered conformation resulted in the loss of some monoclonal antibody epitopes and inefficient transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. In addition, class II that was transported through the Golgi accumulated an abnormally increased molecular mass associated with N-linked glycosylation. Subsequent transfection of Ii into these cells resulted in recovery of normal class II conformation, causing a restoration of monoclonal antibody epitopes, efficient intracellular transport, and normal glycosylation. Together, these data indicate that Ii can have a profound effect on the folding, transport, and modification of class II molecules and suggest that one function of Ii may be to act as a class II-specific chaperone...|$|R

40|$|The rough {{equivalence}} of {{certification and}} <b>ultimate</b> outcome is <b>class</b> action dogma. If certification is granted, then the plaintiff “wins” by settlement because {{the risk of}} incurring class-wide liability by going to trial is too great. If certification is denied, the defendant “wins” because the case may not be worth litigating {{without the possibility of}} a class-wide recovery. This Note is about where the dogma is wrong. There are now cases where a denial of certification, just like a grant, presents to the defendant the risk of incurring class-wide liability at trial. This is because those cases are capable of what I call jury certification. Thanks to recent case law, there are now cases where the jury will decide an issue when it passes on the merits that is the same issue that the judge first decided during certification. The merits and class certification overlap on that issue. That overlap gives the jury’s verdict the power to, in effect, overrule the judge’s decision to deny certification. Thus, a defendant facing a certified class and a defendant facing an uncertified class capable of jury certification are in the same bargaining position—going to trial means risking class-wide liability. Here, I will explain how jury certification could work in federal securities class actions, where the conditions for jury certification are often found...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of classes of indoor free flight models. Some are scale reproductions but others are {{designed}} purely to fly for as long as possible. These models are timed with a stopwatch.The FAI is the international organising body for all air sports worldwide, including aeromodelling. The FAI sanctions World and European Championships for the <b>ultimate</b> indoor duration <b>class</b> designated F1D. F1D models must have a minimum weight of 1.4 grams and a maximum wing span of 55 cm. These models are constructed from very light balsawood sheet and strip, boron filament, carbon fibre, and a transparent covering of plastic film less than 0.5 micrometres thick. The models are powered by 0.4 grams of rubber in a single loop about 9.0 inches long that can be wound to take around 1500 turns. The average propeller RPM during a flight is less than 50 and these models fly at less than walking pace. F1D models require a large space, such as a sports hall, aircraft or dirigible hangar, with the famous atrium of the West Baden Springs Hotel having been previously used for indoor free flight competitions in the United States, and there is even a salt mine in Romania 400 ft underground that has hosted the FAI world F1D championships several times. Single flight times approach forty minutes.|$|R
40|$|The undergradtuate {{research}} project was the completion, manipulation {{and assessment of}} a population model. The stage based population model assessed the late larval and juveniles stages of the hard shell clam Mercenaria mercenaria. There were seven class sizes input into the model starting with pediveligers and ending with juveniles at specific developmental sizes: 0. 2 mm(Pediveliger), 0. 2 mm+ (Dissoconch I) and 1. 0 mm+ (Dissoconch II). Parameters or vital rates input into the model included growth, survival and saturation state. The aim of the model was to investigate by what degree the saturation state of CaCO 3 (Ωaragonite) influences the population dynamics of Mercenaria mercenaria. My project involved adding the seventh class size to the model, and changing the constant value of saturation state to a variable parameter on a diurnal cycle. Additionally, {{the assessment of the}} model output would be the focus of the research. The model was constructed in matlab, so the learning this software was necessary for the manipulation and completion of this model. The vital rates of survival and growth were probabilities defined from lab and field experiments published in the literature. Saturation state was incorporated into these probabilities as a way to change the values according to environmental conditions. The task of parameterizing saturation state as a cyclical function meant the reworking of how model probabilities were populated. Writing the function and integrating the varying saturation states to each time step was the dominate focus of the project before analysis. Background literature was necessary in order to establish a range of saturation state (Ω) values to input into the model. With accurate values of saturation state obtained, three different simulation trials were run to represent the diurnal variation. The simulations ranged from high (0. 20 – 2. 20), medium (0. 54 – 1. 86) and low (0. 87 - 1. 53). The values represent amplitudes of 0. 33, 0. 66 and 1. 0 within a diurnal cycle. By assessing the different simulation runs all with the same mean value of 1. 2, the characterization of dramatic shifts could be compared amongst the three simulation runs. Assessing the degree of change this variation had on the population was the main objective for the model output. Once the model was completed the objectives included: assessing what stage class had the highest sensitivity to changes in vital rates, evaluation of hourly mortality rates given varying diurnal cycles in saturation state, identifying specific time in days that the population reaches stable age distribution and survivors converge to <b>ultimate</b> size <b>class,</b> and compare population growth rate of large diurnal shifts or small shifts at constant undersaturation. The output of the model provided the necessary data to assess the population dynamics and answer the above objectives. Analysis of the data was completed in matlab and Microsoft excel. Future work for this model will be to create a separate carbonate chemistry which will run in parallel with the population model. The objective of this carbonate chemistry model will be to parameterize saturation state more completely by the components that constitute what saturation state is...|$|R
40|$|In the bag {{of words}} framework, {{documents}} are often converted into vectors according to predefined features together with weighting mechanisms. Since each feature presentation has its character, {{it is difficult to}} determine which one should be chosen for a specific domain, especially for the users who are not familiar with the domain. This paper explores the integration of various feature presentations to improve the classification accuracy. A general two phases framework is proposed. In the first phase, we train multiple base classifiers with various vector spaces and use these classifiers to predict the class of testing samples respectively.

40|$|Extreme {{nanowires}} (ENs) {{represent the}} <b>ultimate</b> <b>class</b> of crystals: They are the smallest possible periodic materials. With atom-wide motifs repeated in one dimension (1 D), {{they offer a}} privileged perspective into the Physics and Chemistry of low-dimensional systems. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide ideal environments {{for the creation of}} such materials. Here we present a comprehensive study of Te ENs encapsulated inside ultra- narrow SWCNTs with diameters between 0. 7 nm and 1. 1 nm. We combine state-of-the-art imaging techniques and 1 D-adapted ab initio structure prediction to treat both confinement and periodicity effects. The studied Te ENs adopt a variety of structures, exhibiting a true 1 D realisation of a Peierls structural distortion and transition from metallic to insulating behaviour as a function of encapsulating diameter. We analyse the mechanical stability of the encapsulated ENs and show that nanoconfinement is not only a useful means to produce ENs, but may actually be necessary, in some cases, to prevent them from disintegrating. The ability to control functional properties of these ENs with confinement has numerous applications in future device technologies, and we anticipate that our study will set the basic paradigm to be adopted in the characterisation and understanding of such systems...|$|E
