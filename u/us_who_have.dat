Some media networks simply stopped reporting on drug crimes, while others have been infiltrated and corrupted by drug cartels.

25|$|This {{collection}} of essays started with Nancy Mitford's article The English Aristocracy, published in 1955 in the magazine Encounter. The expressions 'U' (upper class) and 'non-U' (non-upper class) came to prominence in this article, which sold out the edition of the magazine immediately after publication. The article caused {{a great deal of}} light-hearted controversy. The book was published one year later. There is sharp disagreement among the <b>Us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> contributed to this book.|$|E

It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks {{to make sure they are}} not engaging in money laundering. Banks must identify all the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens. There is also an expectation that they must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any senior political figure where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption.|$|E
25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> known them, to all of us here who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{multiple}} sources of income, {{the community was}} in constant debt almost immediately after it began. The community, including Ripley, had difficulty with the farming aspects of the community, in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor. The major crop was hay, though it was sold at low grade prices; vegetables, milk, and fruit were not produced in high enough numbers to be profitable. The property was mortgaged four times between 1841 and 1845. Brook Farm got {{into the habit of}} spending money before they had raised it. As one Brook Farmer wrote, [...] "I think here lies the difficulty,—we have not had business men to conduct our affairs... those among <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> some business talents, see this error".|$|E

"Padre Pio {{looked at}} Lefebvre very sternly and said: [...] "Never cause discord among your {{brothers}} and always practise {{the rule of}} obedience; above all when it seems {{to you that the}} errors of those in authority are all the more serious.

It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father." [...] Padre Pio looked at him intensely and, seeing what would soon happen, said: [...] "No! You will forget it! You will tear apart the community of faithful, oppose the will of your superiors and even go against the orders of the pope himself and this will happen quite soon..." ...|$|E

[...] John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that [...] "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing."

There are several other lawyers all over the <b>U.S.</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> filed Krayoxx tort suits. The blossoming class action lawsuit against Varrick Labs is coordinated by Jerry Alisandros of Florida, who has become rich out of {{previous}} lawsuits against Varrick. Wally flies to Las Vegas to meet the other mass tort interests. Alisandros offers Wally [...] "a ride" [...] back to Chicago in his luxurious private jet and makes clear that all Wally needs to do is locate some more Krayoxx cases in Chicago and then he would become part of a mass settlement, with Alisandros taking care of all the rest, such as finding experts to testify on the harmful effects of Krayoxx.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. TV Squad's Jane Boursaw called the episode's case [...] "an interesting premise" [...] and {{was pleased that}} [...] "things are really, REALLY starting to {{come together in a}} big way, which is good, considering that the finale is fast approaching". Annalee Newitz of io9 declared it to be [...] "one of the most rewarding episodes ever for people who love the show's mythology," [...] and found Olivia's universe-hopping ability to be [...] "truly cool". Newitz concluded that [...] "this was a truly awesome episode with a lot of payoff for those of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been glued to the set every Tuesday night, looking for answers." [...] The website later listed [...] "The Road Not Taken" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.

500|$|On 13 September 1644 Vane {{acted with}} St John and Cromwell in the Commons {{to set up}} a [...] "Grand Committee for the Accommodation", {{designed}} to find a compromise on religious issues dividing the Westminster Assembly. [...] He sought in its debate to identify loopholes for religious tolerance on behalf of the Independents. [...] This exposed Vane's opposition to Presbyterianism, and created a rift between the pro-war Independents, led by Vane and Cromwell, and the pro-peace Scots and other supporters of Presbyterianism. [...] The latter included the Earl of Essex, whose failures in the west of England reduced popular support for his cause, even as the military success of Cromwell at Marston Moor raised his profile. [...] Robert Baillie, on the realization that the Parliamentary Independents, despite previous claims of support by Vane, were not {{on the side of the}} Scots, wrote [...] "Sir Henry Vane and The Solicitor ... without any regard for <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> saved their nation and brought their two persons to the height of power now they enjoy and use to our prejudice".|$|E

500|$|Kolbe {{was sent}} to Rome in 1912, where he {{attended}} the Pontifical Gregorian University. He earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1919 or 1922 (sources vary). He {{was active in the}} consecration and entrustment to Mary. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against Popes St. Pius X and Benedict XV in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the Freemasons. According to Kolbe, They placed the black standard of the [...] "Giordano Brunisti" [...] under the windows of the Vatican. On this standard the archangel, St. Michael, was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully. Soon afterward, Kolbe organized the Militia Immaculatae (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary. So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> recourse to thee. And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee.|$|E
