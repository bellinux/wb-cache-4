5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> the solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, {{but they can be}} completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E

5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints.

5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling. Its kinship {{with other members}} of the genus is unclear. The bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to the blue nuthatch (S. azurea), or other blue-tinted nuthatch species such as the velvet-fronted nuthatch (S. frontalis), yellow-billed nuthatch (S. solangiae) and the sulphur-billed nuthatch (S. oenochlamys), but its distribution being focused in the eastern Himalayas, and the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> its plumage, argues against the assumption.
