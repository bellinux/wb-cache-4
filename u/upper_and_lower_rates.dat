30|$|In some sense, this {{behavior}} is {{an artifact of}} the model usedâ€”perfect integration is only possible if the feedback perfectly counters the decay of the firing rate over a range of different rates, which is possible in this model because rate increases linearly with feedback and feedback increases linearly with rate. However, such a balance is also achievable with nonlinear rate/feedback relationships if they are locally linear over the relevant range of firing rates. In particular, if the firing rate is a sigmoidal function of input and the eigenvalue of firing rate dynamics near a fixed point is near zero, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> limits act to control runaway firing rates while the system acts as an integrator {{in the neighborhood of}} the fixed point.

A yacht with a rating of 40 ft was generally about 47 to 52 ft in length overall.

40|$|We {{address the}} {{optimization}} of the sum rate performance in multicell interference-limited singlehop networks where access points {{are allowed to}} cooperate in terms of joint resource allocation. The resource allocation policies considered here combine power control and user scheduling. Although very promising from a conceptual point of view, the optimization of the sum of per-link rates hinges, in principle, on tough issues such as computational complexity and the requirement for heavy receiver-to-transmitter channel information feedback across all network cells. In this paper, we show that, in fact, distributed algorithms are actually obtainable in the asymptotic regime where the numbers of users per cell is allowed to grow large. Additionally, using extreme value theory, we provide scaling laws for <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> bounds for the network capacity (sum of single user rates over all cells), corresponding to zero-interference and worst-case interference scenarios. We show that the scaling is either dominated by path loss statistics or by small-scale fading, depending on the regime and user location scenario. We show that <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> bounds behave in fact identically, asymptotically. This remarkable result suggests not only that distributed resource allocation is practically possible but also {{that the impact of}} multicell interference on the capacity (in terms of scaling) actually vanishes asymptotically.

40|$|We {{focus our}} {{attention}} on the most common scenario in networked control systems where the measured output from the observer is transmitted via a communication channel to the controller. Using information theoretic results, we studied the tradeoff between the performance and the accuracy of observations due to communication constraints for such a scenario. We focused on three important cases in the communication channel, the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), limited data rate and systems with multiplicative uncertainty in the system parameters. Using known theoretical results for a rate limited communication channel, we showed the effect of entropy of the output of quantizer on the control performance. The same was done for the case of multiplicative uncertainty in the system. For an AWGN channel, we showed the effect of channel SNR on the performance. For the analog joint source channel coding approach (which works only for Gaussian disturbances in the system), we showed that the known lower bound is tight even for non Gaussian system disturbances. We also compared the simulated performance of a system with known <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> distortion bounds for all the three cases. The lower bound on the rate is closely approached by a simple uniform quantization scheme, hence demonstrating its tightness.

Additionally, in C-burning conditions a high 12 C+ 12 C rate may lead to lower central C-burning temperatures and to 13 C(alpha,n) 16 O emerging as a more dominant neutron source than 22 Ne(alpha,n) 25 Mg, increasing significantly the s-process production. This {{is due to the}} rapid decrease of the 13 N(gamma,p) 12 C with decreasing temperature, causing the 13 C production via 13 N(beta+) 13 C. Presented here is the impact of the 12 C+ 12 C reaction uncertainties on the s-process and on explosive p-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars, including also fast rotating massive stars at low metallicity. Using various 12 C+ 12 C rates, in particular an <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>rate</b> limit of ~ 50000 higher <b>and</b> ~ 20 <b>lower</b> than the standard rate at 5 * 10 ^ 8 K, five 25 Msun stellar models are calculated.

Consequently, we show that the p-process abundances have an average production factor increased up to about a factor of 8 compared to the standard case, efficiently producing the elusive Mo and Ru proton-rich isotopes. We also show that an s-process being driven by 13 C(alpha,n) 16 O is a secondary process, even though the abundance of 13 C does not depend on the initial metal content.

It is shown that both <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> entropy <b>rate,</b> hence entropy rate itself if it exists, are Lipschitzian relative to this topology, which, by well known facts, is close to differentiability. An application of this theorem leads to a simple and elementary proof of the existence of entropy rate of random sources with finite evolution dimension.

40|$|Directed {{covers of}} finite graphs are {{also known as}} {{periodic}} trees or trees with finitely many cone types. We expand the existing theory of directed covers of finite graphs to those of infinite graphs. While the <b>lower</b> growth <b>rate</b> still equals the branching number, <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> growth <b>rates</b> do not longer coincide in general. Furthermore, the behaviour of random walks on directed covers of infinite graphs is more subtle. We provide a classification in terms of recurrence and transience and {{point out that the}} critical random walk may be recurrent or transient. Our proof is based on the observation that recurrence of the random walk is equivalent to the almost sure extinction of an appropriate branching process. Two examples in random environment are provided: homesick random walk on infinite percolation clusters and random walk in random environment on directed covers. Furthermore, we calculate, under reasonable assumptions, the rate of escape with respect to suitable length functions and prove the existence of the asymptotic entropy providing an explicit formula which is also a new result for directed covers of finite graphs. In particular, the asymptotic entropy of random walks on directed covers of finite graphs is positive if and only if the random walk is transient. Comment: 32 pages, final versio...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{dispersion}} of ions in one dimension {{is a well}} established means of analysing ion mass and focal plane detectors (FPDs) allow ions {{of a wide range}} of masses to be recorded simultaneously. This paper is concerned with the principles governing the performance of FPDs and the types of FPD available. It is focused on magnetic sector mass spectrometry but is relevant to all applications in which spatially dispersed particles can be detected using a microchannel plate electron multiplier, e. g. ions, photons of wavelength Ã† 200 nm, electrons and energetic neutrals. Although it has proved possible to produce mass spectra with a high resolution, this has not been matched by an ability to detect them efficiently. Given that highly resolved spectra are available at the detector but are inaccessi-ble efficiently, it is in the development of high-performance FPDs where there are enormous gains in efficiency to be achieved. Limitations of FPD performance of two fundamental types are discussed: the position of impact of an ion on the FPD cannot be measured exactly, <b>and</b> the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> count <b>rates</b> of the FPD are both restricted.

An experimental analysis of the unsteady pressure distribution on a two dimensional pitching Eppler- 361 airfoil was conducted by using transducers at low speed wind tunnel. Dynamic pitching motion was produced by oscillating the model over a range of reduced frequencies, k= 0. 02355 - 0. 1413. In addition, Static data were recorded as base line for analysis and comparison. Both static and oscillatory tests were conducted at Reynolds numbers of 5 Re 5.

Modern acquisition systems such as those based on LicelTM transient recorders combine a dual acquisition mode in which the return signal is recorded simultaneously in both analog (analog-to-digital (AD) conversion) and photon-counting (PC) modes. Although both data records can be analyzed separately, their combination obtained through gluing gives {{the advantage of the}} high linearity of the AD conversion for high light-level signals (especially in the near range) and the high sensitivity of the PC mode for low light-level signals (in the far range). Recently, eruptions of volcanoes such as Eyjafjalla (Iceland) in 2010, GrÃ­msvÃ¶tn (Iceland Puyehue (Argentina) Nabro (Eritrea) and Mount Lokon (Indonesia) in 2011 have yielded emergency situations with a strong economical cost due to human evacuation and/or air traffic interruption. Volcanic aerosols are first injected in the troposphere and often reach the stratosphere where they can reside for several years. The mixed analog/photo-counting acquisition approach is particularly suitable for the detection of volcanic aerosols in both the troposphere (near/mid range) and the stratosphere (far range). In this line, a case study showing volcanic aerosols from the Nabro volcano (Eritrea, 2011) in the stratosphere and simultaneously Saharan dust in the troposphere over the multi-spectral Barcelona lidar station during the period 27 June â€“ 1 July 2011 is presented.

The model can be simplified for lobing and chatter analysis. A Bidiagrammatical method is proposed to investigate the lobing stability. It was found that the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> lobing growth <b>rate</b> can be estimated through the Bidiagrammatical method, and the lobing growth exhibits periodicity over the lobing frequency. A relative stability diagram is thus developed to provide guidance such that a proper setup angle Î² can be selected to suppress lobing. ^ During grinding, two types of workpiece surface waves can be generated: (1) standing wave; and (2) precessing wave. It was found that the standing waves are less stable, therefore, often cause significant workpiece out-of-roundness problem. A work-speed regulation method is proposed such that only precessing waves are generated during grinding, therefore, reduce the workpiece out-of-roundness. ^ Chatter stability is investigated by using a similar Bidiagrammatical method. It was found that chatter stability can be approximately assessed through lobing stability. Therefore, approaches to lobing suppression can be equally applied to suppress chatter. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:Review of limb {{arterial}} injuries {{associated with}} limb fractures. Design:Retrospective study. Setting:University Hospital. Materials and Methods:The clinical presentation, assessment {{and management of}} 25 patients with <b>upper</b> (seven) <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> (18) limb arterial injuries associated with limb bone fractures has been retrospectively reviewed. Main Results:Five patients presented with life threatening injuries and classic signs of acute limb ischaemia, 15 patients had an obvious limb arterial injury, and 5 presented with a suspected limb arterial injury. The site of arterial damage was: superficial femoral (4); popliteal (11); tibioperoneal trunk (3); anterior tibial (4); posterior tibial (3); peroneal (2); axillary (1); brachial (5); radial (4); and ulnar artery (4). The types of arterial repair were: autogenous vein interposition or bypass grafting (17); P. T. F. E. (2); end-to-end anastomosis (14); and ligation (8). The popliteal vein was injured in six cases, repaired in four and ligated in two; the superficial femoral vein was injured in four cases, repaired in three and ligated in one; and the axillary vein was injured in one case and was ligated. Primary nerve repair was employed in six out of seven injured nerves. Skeletal fixation preceded vascular repair in 21 patients and in four a Javid shunt was used. Intraoperative fasciotomy was performed in 12 out of 18 patients with lower limb ischaemia. Completion arteriography revealed residual thrombi in the distal foot of four patients, in whom intraarterial thrombolysis was effective. During the follow-up period of 1. 5 to 2 years, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> limb preservation <b>rate</b> was 100 and 89 %, respectively. The upper limb function was judged excellent in five patients, good in one and fair in one. In the lower limbs it was excellent in 11 patients, good in three, fair in one and poor in one. Conclusions:To ensure life and functional limb salvage of patients with devastating vascular injuries, a well organised multidisciplinary approach is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} safety, {{effectiveness}} and acceptability of oral midazolam sedation for orthodontic extraction of permanent teeth in children. Design A prospective, randomised, controlled, crossover trial. Methods A total of 26 children aged 10 - 16 (ASA I), referred for orthodontic extraction of premolar or canine teeth under sedation, {{were included in}} the study. Each child required two treatment sessions for the extraction of equivalent teeth {{on opposite sides of the}} mouth. Each subject was sedated with either oral midazolam (0. 5 mg/kg) or nitrous oxide and oxygen (30 %/ 70 %) at the first visit and the alternative form at the second visit. At each visit two teeth were extracted, one <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> one <b>lower.</b> Heart <b>rate,</b> arterial oxygen saturation, respiration rate, sedation and behavioural scores were recorded every five minutes. Overall behaviour, patient acceptance and patient satisfaction were recorded at the end of treatment. Results Of the 26 children included in the study there were 12 males and 14 females. The mean age was 12. 5 years. The mean heart rate and respiratory rate for both groups were similar and within acceptable clinical limits. The lowest mean arterial oxygen saturation levels for nitrous oxide and midazolam sedation were 97. 7 % and 95. 0 % respectively. Although midazolam caused greater oxygen desaturation, the range (91 % - 100 %) was within safe limits for conscious sedation. The mean level of sedation was greater in the midazolam group compared with the nitrous oxide group and all but one case completed treatment. A total of 23 patients (88 %) said they would be prepared to have oral midazolam sedation again and 17 (65 %) actually preferred oral midazolam to nitrous oxide sedation. Conclusion Oral midazolam (0. 5 mg/kg) appears to be a safe and acceptable form of sedation for 10 - 16 year old paediatric dental patients...|$|R
