5|$|As {{with the}} Aronde, Simca marketed {{different}} trim {{levels of the}} Vedette <b>under</b> <b>different</b> model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca Vedette Versailles and, {{at the top of}} the range, the Simca Vedette Régence. An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956. As the new model caught on, Simca was able to increase production from the 150daily achieved during Ford's ownership of the factory to 250cars a day.|$|E
5|$|Internet {{censorship}} in Hong Kong operates <b>under</b> <b>different</b> {{principles and}} regulations {{from those of}} mainland China. In November 2015, the newly established Innovation and Technology Bureau pushed for the legislation of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2014, more popularly known as the Internet Article 23, which would severely limit the legality of derivative works and other activities previously permitted on the Internet. Supporters of the bill {{point to the fact}} that Hong Kong is lagging behind in the protection of intellectual property rights, but detractors state that creative work on the Internet should be exempt from legislation, and the ordinance would severely violate human rights.|$|E

5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible <b>under</b> <b>different</b> constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E

5|$|Termite populations can be {{substantially}} impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention. A Brazilian {{study investigated the}} termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga <b>under</b> <b>different</b> levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, {{a sort of}} theocratic state, that {{developed}} in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had a taboo symbolic code with six types. These included human (such as twins), animal, object, temporal, behavioral, speech and place taboos. The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri's subjects. This meant that, while certain Igbo may have lived <b>under</b> <b>different</b> formal administration, all followers of the Igbo religion had {{to abide by the}} rules of the faith and obey its representative on earth, the eze Nri.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something {{that would not have been}} feasible <b>under</b> <b>different</b> economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{some other}} states, {{there are no}} formal rules prohibiting the usage of the same route number <b>under</b> <b>different</b> systems. Motorists using Michigan's {{highways}} may encounter I-75 and M-75, as well as both US8 and M-8. Many of the state's US Highways were assigned numbers duplicating those of state trunklines when the US Highway System was created in 1926. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s further complicated the situation, as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated M-n trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state.|$|E
