Her distant ancestry includes Irish and other European roots. In addition, a paternal first cousin once-removed is the African-American Jewish Rabbi Capers Funnye, son of her grandfather's sister.|$|E
5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another.

5|$|Massachusetts {{has avoided}} {{many forms of}} racial strife seen {{elsewhere}} in the <b>US,</b> <b>but</b> examples such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist (mainly anti-Catholic) Know Nothings in the 1850s, the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s, and Boston's opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s show that the ethnic history of Massachusetts was not completely harmonious.|$|E

5|$|Another colony lost by Spain in 1898 was Cuba, but {{as freedom}} for Cuba {{had been a}} major purpose of the war, it was not annexed by the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>but</b> was, {{after a period of}} occupation, given {{independence}} in 1902. Election fraud and corruption followed, as did factional conflict. In September 1906, President Tomás Estrada Palma asked for U.S. intervention. Taft traveled to Cuba with a small American force, and on September 29, 1906, {{under the terms of the}} Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1903, declared himself Provisional Governor of Cuba, a post he held for two weeks before being succeeded by Charles Edward Magoon. In his time in Cuba, Taft worked to persuade Cubans that the U.S. intended stability, not occupation.|$|E

5|$|Election Special was {{released}} by Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records on August 16, 2012, one week before the 2012 Republican National Convention. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its topical protest songs and Cooder's musicianship. The album peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the <b>US,</b> <b>but</b> charted significantly higher in other countries. Cooder did not tour in promotion of the album, citing a lost interest in both playing large concert venues and the commercial aspect of releasing records.|$|E
5|$|Grandon Productions {{produced}} Donen's next film: The Grass Is Greener, released through Universal Pictures in 1960. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr {{play the}} earl and countess {{of a large}} estate in England who are forced to permit guided tours of their mansion {{in order to help}} their financial problems. Robert Mitchum plays an American oil tycoon who falls in love with Kerr and Jean Simmons plays an eccentric American heiress who is Grant's former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the <b>US,</b> <b>but</b> successful in England where the original stage version had been a West End hit.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 NTNF started {{planning}} {{to use the}} station for downloading from NASA's Landsat program. Sufficient funding from the government was secured in mid 1976, after a successful lobby operation which emphasized the possibility of environmental observation in Norway's territorial waters. 7.5 million Norwegian krone (NOK) was granted for upgrades in 1977. Norway entered negotiations with the <b>US,</b> <b>but</b> soon ESA and NASA started discussions regarding two European telemetry stations for Landsat to serve all ESA members. ESA and Sweden pushed for Kiruna, Sweden, to be the location of ESA's northern telemetry station and Tromsø was discarded because of Norway's decision to not join ESA.|$|E

5|$|In early 1968, media {{coverage}} {{in the aftermath of}} the Tet Offensive spurred increased protests in opposition to the Vietnam War, especially among university students. The protests were most prevalent in the <b>US,</b> <b>but</b> on 17 March, several thousand demonstrators marched to the American embassy in London's Grosvenor Square and violently clashed with police. Major protests concerning other political issues made international news, such as the March 1968 protests in Poland against their communist government, and the campus uprisings of May 1968 in France.|$|E
5|$|In the United States during July 2007, Aman Kapoor, {{founder of}} the Immigration Voice forum, {{initiated}} a Gandhigiri protest inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai.

5|$|Quadrophenia was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception in both the UK and the <b>US,</b> <b>but</b> the resulting tour was marred with problems with backing tapes replacing the additional instruments on the album, and the stage piece was retired in early 1974. It was revived in 1996 with a larger ensemble, and a further tour occurred in 2012. The album made {{a positive impact on}} the mod revival movement of the late 1970s, and the resulting film adaptation, released in 1979, was successful. The album has been reissued on compact disc several times, and seen a number of remixes that corrected some perceived flaws in the original.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Britain and the United States {{escalated}} {{again during}} the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to impress men into the Royal Navy. The US declared war, the War of 1812, and invaded Canadian territory. In response Britain invaded the <b>US,</b> <b>but</b> the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, ensuring Canada's future would be separate {{from that of the}} United States.|$|E
