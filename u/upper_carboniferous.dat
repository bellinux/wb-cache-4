40|$|ABSTRACT: The K/Ar {{characteristics}} of 53 clay assemblages (Triassic–Cretaceous), representing the detrital, volcanogenic and arid-facies clay mineral associations, are interpreted {{in relation to}} their mineralogy, chronostratic age and geological origins. The K-bearing mineral components of the 12 mm, 0. 21 mm and < 0. 2 mm fractions of each clay assemblage together display one of two characteristic patterns of K 2 O and 40 Ar values (the K/Ar signature of the assemblage) on a 40 Ar/K 2 O correlation diagram. Interpretation of the K/Ar signatures indicates that: (1) all of these clay assemblages are apparently unaffected by burial diagenetic illitization; (2) the Jurassic and Cretaceous detrital clay assemblages are derived from the reworking of weathered Caledonian metasediments (420500 Ma) and weathered kaolin-bearing sediments of <b>Upper</b> Devonian/ <b>Carboniferous</b> age; and (3) the role played by palaeoclimate in developing the pattern of clay minerals in the Mesozoic sediments of England is much less significant than previously believed...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{regional}} {{assessment of the}} distribution of saline outbreaks is demonstrated for a large area (68 000 km(2)) in north Queensland, Australia. Soil samples were used in conjunction with a digital elevation model and a map of potentially saline discharge zones to examine the landscape distribution of soluble salts in the region. The hypothesis of atmospheric accession of salt was tested for the topographically defined catchment regions feeding into each potentially saline discharge area. Most catchments showed a salt distribution consistent with this hypothesis, i. e. %TSS was large near the discharge areas and decreased rapidly with distance uphill from the discharge areas. In some catchments, however, local saline outbreaks were apparent at significant distances uphill from discharge areas. The possibility of geological sources of this salt was examined by comparing random point distributions with the location of saline points with distance downhill from geological units (excluding points near discharge zones). The distribution of some saline outbreaks was consistent with the occurrence of Cambro-Ordovician metasediments, Devonian limestone, <b>Upper</b> Devonian-Lower <b>Carboniferous</b> volcanics, and Triassic sediments.
