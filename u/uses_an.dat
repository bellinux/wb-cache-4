5|$|A {{solar power}} tower <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> array of {{tracking}} reflectors (heliostats) to concentrate {{light on a}} central receiver atop a tower. Power towers are more cost effective, offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among CSP technologies. The PS10 Solar Power Plant and PS20 solar power plant are examples of this technology.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the gold-standard {{method of}} {{cellular}} localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. The sample {{is prepared for}} normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details {{as well as the}} protein of interest.|$|E

5|$|Shilts {{focuses on}} several {{organizations}} and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS—and {{were given the}} task of finding {{the cause of the}} disease—or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying.

5|$|The International Telecommunication Union <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> internationally agreed {{system for}} {{classifying}} radio frequency signals. Each Type of radio emission is classified {{according to its}} bandwidth, method of modulation, nature of the modulating signal, and Type of information transmitted on the carrier signal. It is based on characteristics of the signal, not on the transmitter used.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
5|$|The city <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> {{algorithm}} {{created by}} the Walsh administration, called CityScore, to measure the effectiveness of various city services.

With the Range, Hornsby <b>used</b> <b>an</b> Oberheim OB-X synthesizer.|$|R
50|$|Yokes are {{not used}} on all aircraft. Helicopters <b>use</b> <b>a</b> cyclic and the {{majority}} of military fighter aircraft <b>use</b> <b>a</b> centre or side-stick. Some light aircraft <b>use</b> <b>a</b> stick because some sport pilots prefer that control system. The latest Airbus family of passenger jets <b>use</b> <b>a</b> side-stick, not unlike a computer game controller, to actuate control surfaces.|$|R
25|$|Kata one {{to seven}} are {{performed}} with both partners <b>using</b> <b>a</b> normal length wooden sword. Kata {{eight to ten}} are performed with uchidachi <b>using</b> <b>a</b> normal length weapon and shidachi <b>using</b> <b>a</b> shorter one (kodachi).|$|R

5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E
5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC third rail, {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines. The North South and East West lines <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> automatic train operation system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E
30|$|Intubation was {{performed}} <b>using</b> <b>an</b> endotracheal tube with 7.0  mm of internal diameters (Mallinckrodt, Dublin, Ireland).

5|$|Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by BioWare {{and published by}} Black Isle Studios. It is the sequel to Baldur's Gate (1998) and was released for Microsoft Windows in September 2000. Like Baldur's Gate, the game {{is set in the}} Forgotten Realms campaign setting and is based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition rule set. The game, which is powered by BioWare's Infinity Engine, <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> isometric perspective and pausable real-time gameplay. The player controls a party of up to six characters, one of whom is the player-created protagonist; and the others, certain characters from the game world.|$|E
5|$|Barthel {{referred}} {{to each of}} 24 texts he accepted as genuine with a letter of the alphabet; two texts {{have been added to}} the corpus since then. The two faces of the tablets are distinguished by suffixing r (recto) or v (verso) when the reading sequence can be ascertained, to which the line being discussed is appended. Thus Pr2 is item P (the Great Saint Petersburg Tablet), recto, second line. When the reading sequence cannot be ascertained, a and b are used for the faces. Thus Ab1 is item A (Tahua), side b, first line. The six sides of the Snuff Box are lettered as sides a to f. Nearly all publications follow the Barthel convention, though a popular book by Fischer <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> idiosyncratic numbering system.|$|E
5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the extinction of the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings had been made as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that the extinction of the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN <b>uses</b> <b>an</b> extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E
