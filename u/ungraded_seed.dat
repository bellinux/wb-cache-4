40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to study the effect of seed size on yield and yield components of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) when planted at different seeding rates under rainfed and irrigated conditions. The experiment was conducted at the Hyslop Crop Science Field Laboratory at Corvallis in 1976. Certified seed lots of Fielder soft white spring and Profit 75 hard red spring wheat were separated into large, small and <b>ungraded</b> <b>seed</b> sizes and planted to evaluate their yield responses. Seeds were planted at three seeding rates based on equal numbers of seeds per 2 unit area (228, 293, and 421 seeds/m) and one seeding rate based on equal weights of seeds per area (approximately 11 grams/m 2). This study was conducted under rainfed conditions (70. 9 mm = 2. 79 in) and with supplemental irrigation (290. 1 mm = 11. 42 in of total wate...|$|E
40|$|Seeds {{uniformity}} and seedling establishment {{are major}} problem in pepper production in developing countries and have great impact on production quality and performance. Seed enhancement technology like hydropriming {{can be done to}} address this gap. A study was initiated to determine the physiological quality of three Capsicum species (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens and Capsicum chinense) in relation to seed density and hydropriming treatment durations. In the first experiment, fresh <b>ungraded</b> <b>seeds</b> were subjected to different hours of hydropriming durations with second experiment light and heavy density seed lots were subjected to the same hydropriming durations. Seedling emergence, energy of emergence, seedling vigour index and emergence rate were evaluated in the experiments. The result revealed that among the ungraded, light and heavy density seed lots, Capsicum chinense had superior seedling emergence, energy of emergence, seedling vigour index and emergence index. Hydropriming for 0 to 12 h resulted in lower days to emergence. Hydropriming of light density seeds gave high seedling emergence in the three Capsicum species compared to hydropriming of heavy density seeds. An increase in hydropriming durations of the light density seeds resulted in an increase in the seedling emergence, energy of emergence, seedling vigour and emergence index. Positive and significant relationships were obtained between seedling emergence or energy of emergence and seedling vigour index {{in each of the three}} Capsicum species over the hydropriming durations. Therefore, the study suggests the use of hydropriming as a simple and cost-effective strategy in pepper production especially in developing countries...|$|R
