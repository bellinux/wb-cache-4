5|$|In {{computer}} science research, Plan 9 {{has been used}} as a grid computing platform and as a vehicle for research into <b>ubiquitous</b> computing without middleware.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that LARP may one day evolve into a major {{industry}} {{in the form of}} location-based games using <b>ubiquitous</b> computing.|$|E
5|$|Mallard {{have often}} been <b>ubiquitous</b> in their regions among the ponds, rivers, and streams of human parks, farms, and other {{man-made}} waterwayseven {{to the point of}} visiting water features in human courtyards.|$|E
5|$|Olive oil was a <b>ubiquitous</b> {{ingredient}} in Mediterranean cultures, but remained an expensive import {{in the north}} where oils of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert were the most affordable alternatives. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce, were used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond, {{which was in the}} <b>ubiquitous</b> and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later.|$|E
5|$|Since {{fields are}} <b>ubiquitous</b> in {{mathematics}} and beyond, there are several refinements of the concept which are adapted {{to the needs of}} a particular mathematical area.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in Sony films, Sony product {{placements}} abounded, replacing the <b>ubiquitous</b> Apple Computer products often used by other studios. The film's mobile phones, tablets, monitors and laptops all came from other Sony divisions. Other placements included Microsoft's Bing search engine.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} <b>ubiquitous</b> in neutral and weakly basic soils, but not acidic soils. They {{are also found}} in the Arctic and Antarctic soils, despite the cold climate, short growing season, and {{relatively}} low pH values of these soils. In dry soils, Azotobacter can survive in the form of cysts for up to 24 years.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{dishes such as}} apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and {{hot dogs}} derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed. Americans drink {{three times as much}} coffee as tea. Marketing by U.S. {{industries}} is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk <b>ubiquitous</b> breakfast beverages.|$|E
5|$|Despite such unpromisingly reactionary trappings the Schimmelpenninck regime {{actually}} accomplished more in its short existence {{than the}} previous regimes had accomplished in the ten years since 1795. This was, of course, mainly due to the diligent preparatory work that Agents like the <b>ubiquitous</b> Gogel; Johannes Goldberg, for National Economy; and Johannes van der Palm, for National Education; had done.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{are present}} in nearly all aspects of modern life. Iron {{may be the most}} common as it {{accounts}} for 90% of all refined metals. Platinum may be the most <b>ubiquitous</b> given it is said to be found in, or used to produce, 20% of all consumer goods.|$|E
5|$|In modern society, merit-making {{has been}} criticized as materialist, but merit-making is still <b>ubiquitous</b> in many societies. Examples {{of the impact of}} beliefs about merit-making {{can be seen in the}} Phu Mi Bun rebellions which took place in the last centuries, as well as in the revival of certain forms of merit-making, such as the much {{discussed}} merit release.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Vera Rubin {{uncovered}} a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that {{predicted by the}} visible mass of stars and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem {{is thought to be}} explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter. A concept known as the universal rotation curve of spirals, moreover, shows that the problem is <b>ubiquitous</b> in these objects.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, Silkies {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular and <b>ubiquitous</b> {{ornamental}} breeds of chicken. They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers, and are also commonly used to incubate and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like ducks and geese and game birds such as quail and pheasants.|$|E
5|$|Jim Raynor is {{the primary}} Terran protagonist and player {{character}} in the StarCraft franchise. Raynor is the <b>ubiquitous</b> character of the series, having participated in all critical plot points and military conflicts in the sector, except one. He is also the only character to have established inter-species alliance.|$|E
5|$|Lice were <b>ubiquitous</b> {{in human}} society {{until at least}} the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House, and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They {{commonly}} feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A louse {{was one of the}} early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, Micrographia.|$|E
5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, though there is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not <b>ubiquitous</b> in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{fiberglass}}es contain boron, but on {{a global}} scale, most of the fiberglass used does contain it. Because the <b>ubiquitous</b> use of fiberglass in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron, and are the single largest commercial boron market.|$|E
5|$|Other chains {{were created}} to serve the {{increasingly}} mobile patron. Carl Karcher opened his first Carl's Jr. in 1956, and rapidly expanded, locating his restaurants near California's new freeway off-ramps. These restaurant models initially relied on the new and <b>ubiquitous</b> ownership of automobiles, and the willingness of patrons to dine in their automobiles. , drive-through service account for 65percent of their profits.|$|E
5|$|Salt is {{essential}} for life in general, and saltiness {{is one of the}} basic human tastes. Animals tissue contain larger quantities of salt than plant tissues do. Salt {{is one of the oldest}} and most <b>ubiquitous</b> food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s {{specifically}} gay publications have also included comic strips, in which LGBT themes are <b>ubiquitous.</b> Local LGBT newspapers sometimes carry their own strips, like Ron Williams's Quarter Scenes in the New Orleans paper Impact. Strips including Wendel by Howard Cruse, and Leonard and Larry by Tim Barela, have been syndicated in national gay magazines like the Advocate.|$|E
5|$|Some even sub-specialize in {{military}} radio collecting and undertake to restore and operate surplus communications equipment, {{much of it}} dating back to World War II, from the <b>ubiquitous</b> AN/ARC-5 command sets and US Signal Corps SCR-300 and SCR-536 walkie talkies to exotic gear like the British Paraset, a small espionage transceiver supplied to Resistance forces in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The agung {{is a set}} of two wide-rimmed, {{vertically}} suspended gongs used by the Maguindanao, Maranao, Sama-Bajau and Tausug {{people of}} the Philippines as a supportive instrument in kulintang ensembles. The agung is also <b>ubiquitous</b> among other groups found in Palawan, Panay, Mindoro, Mindanao, Sabah, Sulawesi, Sarawak and Kalimantan {{as an integral part of}} the agung orchestra.|$|E
5|$|The {{concrete}} bunkers of Albania are a <b>ubiquitous</b> {{sight in}} the country, {{with an average of}} 5.7 bunkers for every square kilometre. The bunkers (Albanian: bunkerët) were built during the communist government of Enver Hoxha from the 1960s to the 1980s; by 1983 a total of 173,371 concrete bunkers had been constructed around the country.|$|E
5|$|The lighter Lewis gun {{was adopted}} for land and {{aircraft}} use in October 1915. The Lewis gun {{had the advantage}} of being about 80% faster to build than the Vickers, and far more portable. By the end of World War I, over 50,000 Lewis Guns had been produced; they were nearly <b>ubiquitous</b> on the Western Front, outnumbering the Vickers gun by a ratio of about 3:1.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a profusion}} of wild flowers, {{including}} mountain everlasting, spring squill and eyebright {{as well as the}} <b>ubiquitous</b> heather. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred.|$|E
5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the <b>ubiquitous</b> service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|Bread is a {{significant}} part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen). German cheeses account for about a third of all cheese produced in Europe. In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their <b>ubiquitous</b> sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts, Weisswursts, and Currywursts. In 2012, organic foods accounted for 3.9% of total food sales.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are <b>ubiquitous</b> and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates <b>ubiquitous</b> {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from <b>ubiquitous</b> formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are <b>ubiquitous</b> in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is <b>ubiquitous</b> across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, breaking up the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the eighth}} or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) {{in the human}} body, so that a 60kg adult {{contains}} {{a total of about}} 120g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant (with the exception of the <b>ubiquitous</b> CHON elements). Potassium ions are present {{in a wide variety of}} proteins and enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Escondido {{proved to}} be a rich {{collecting}} ground, and after nine days in the Gulf, they had to scale back their collecting ambitions owing to lack of space for the specimens. It had already become clear that there were certain species that were <b>ubiquitous</b> in the region: some species of crabs, sea anemones, limpets, barnacles and sea cucumbers were found at every stop, and the sun star, Heliaster kubiniji, the sea urchin, Arbacia incisa, and bristleworms of the Eurythoe genus were common.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Vaughan Williams, {{who wrote}} in 1928 an {{arrangement}} of the traditional tune associated with the psalm, Old 100th ("All people that on earth do dwell"), arranged it for congregation, organ and orchestra for the coronation of Elizabeth II, becoming <b>ubiquitous</b> at festive occasions in the Anglophone world. Reger's setting, however, was not intended for church use, but first for a secular occasion, then for the concert hall.|$|E
5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental lead is <b>ubiquitous,</b> and everyone has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E
