40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with stochastic differential games (SDGs) defined through fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which are governed by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. For SDGs, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lower</b> value functions are defined by the controlled fully coupled FBSDEs with jumps. Using a new transformation introduced in [6], we prove that the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lower</b> value functions are deterministic. Then, after establishing the dynamic programming principle for the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lower</b> value functions of this SDGs, we prove that the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lower</b> value functions are the viscosity solutions to the associated <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lower</b> Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equations, respectively. Furthermore, for a special case (when σ, h do not depend on y, z, k), under the Isaacs' condition, we get {{the existence of the}} value of the game. Comment: 33 page...|$|R

5|$|Ice sledge {{hockey is}} open only to male {{competitors}} with a physical disability {{in the lower}} part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> limbs.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> masseteric ridges {{come close}} together below the first molars, {{but do not}} fuse. The {{back end of the}} lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination <b>and</b> to study the effect of speed on the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination in individuals with stroke and control groups. Thirty individuals with stroke who were able to walk independently without using any assistive devices and 30 control individuals were recruited for the study. <b>Upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination was analyzed using the shoulder and contralateral hip displacements in the sagittal plane. All data were analyzed by three-dimensional gait analysis. Results demonstrated high degrees of coordination in the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limbs of the controls and in the unaffected <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> affected <b>lower</b> limbs of individuals with stroke. Gait speed was found {{to be associated with the}} <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination in individuals with stroke but not in the controls. The findings implied that the affected upper limb plays an important role for improving gait coordination and is necessary for gait performance in individuals with stroke. Thus, health professionals should exercise the affected arm to increase efficiency of walking in individuals with stroke...|$|R

5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each nostril is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. The <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> symphyses (jaw midpoints). The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides by very large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
