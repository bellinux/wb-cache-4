We examine {{data from}} a topside {{ionosphere}} and two magnetospheric missions (CHAMP, Cluster and Geotail) for signatures of ultra low frequency (ULF) waves during the exceptional 2003 Halloween geospace magnetic storm, when Dst reached ∼− 380 nT.

Consequently designs and arrangement <b>of</b> <b>top-side</b> process units are still evolving and their safety {{has yet to be}} fully and objectively evaluated. This paper explores the probability of occurrence of accidents leading to vapour cloud explosion at one of the topside liquefaction modules of an FLNG. The worst possible scenario with the maximum tolerable probability is identified and the impact of the corresponding vapour cloud explosion is estimated. The strength of the structures supporting the neighbouring modules was examined using finite element analysis to determine if the accident has a potential of escalating to neighbouring modules. It is found that the current levels of safety gaps between the liquefaction modules may be insufficient for the structural arrangement in place. It is thought that a new structural design using circular pipes as the structural elements instead of the I-beams may enhance the integrity <b>of</b> the <b>top-side</b> supporting structures against the impact of potential vapour cloud explosion. The effectiveness of the new structure is demonstrated by comparing it to the conventional supporting structure using I-beam members. This also implies that, by using pipe elements, the safety gaps can be reduced, thus making it possible to optimise the topside arrangement more easily...|$|R

One possibility is that water retracted into the ground, but this loss mechanism {{is yet to be}} demonstrated. It is therefore of interest to understand how water (i.e. O and H) in the atmosphere can be lost to the solar wind.

Therefore the transport of both ions and neutrals from the <b>top-side</b> <b>of</b> the ionosphere to the solar wind is an important regulator of the outflow rate.

40|$|Abstract — To prevent slug-flow on {{offshore}} oil production units, controlling a subsea pressure is the recommended so-lution. However, the subsea pressure {{is not often}} available as a measurement. The top-side pressure is usually measured {{but it is difficult}} to use for stabilizing control, because of its Right Half-Plane zero dynamics combined with nonlinearity. We have used the top-side pressure as measurement for different observers to estimate state variables of the system, and then used the estimated states for control. This scheme was tested in experiments <b>using</b> three types <b>of</b> observers. A simple Luenberger observer with a large gain was found to be more robust than the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). We modified the UKF to a Fast UKF for time-scale separation of the closed-loop system. The resulting observer was robust, also less sensitive to measurement noise compared to the simple Luenberger observer when measuring the top-side pressure. Surprisingly, the nonlinear observers were not able to work in closed-loop when the subsea pressure was used as the measurement. On the other hand, a linear observer worked very well for this case with a larger operating range compared to that <b>of</b> the <b>top-side</b> pressure. I...|$|R
40|$|In managed {{pressure}} drilling (MPD) operations, {{the well}} is sealed and mud pressure {{is controlled by}} opening/closing the valve that releases the mud {{at the top of}} the well. This technology has proven successful when drilling from stationary platforms. Managed Pressure Drilling from floaters brings about several challenges. In normal drilling, heave motion of the floater (due to waves) is compensated by the draw-works and the drill string is not affected by heave. During drill string connection, however, the drill string is disconnected from the draw-works and gets rigidly attached to the floater. Thus the drill string follows the heave motion of the floater thus moving back and forth in the well and acting like a piston. This generates large pressure fluctuations, which can damage the well. These pressure fluctuations must therefore be fully or at least partly compensated by active control <b>of</b> the <b>top-side</b> choke. Previous attempts to achieve such compensation, although successful in simulations, failed in full scale tests.

40|$|An {{explosion}} on {{a typical}} offshore installation is a critical, however rare accidental event which may result in damage and loss of property, and in the worse case loss <b>of</b> lives. <b>Top-side</b> sections on an offshore installation which are exposed to an explosion blast should be designed to withstand such an event {{in a way that}} further escalation of the damage on personnel or property is avoided. There is however limited information on the modeling and analysis procedures for dealing with such events, and most classification rules on this subject give limited information and guidelines on the practical implementation of such effects for general analysis purposes. This thesis has been an investigation on these matters. The basis of this Master thesis has been on a pipe rack structure from one <b>of</b> Aker Solutions' <b>top-side</b> projects. It has been assumed that this structure is exposed to an accidental hydrocarbon explosion, and the resulting structural response has been investigated. A parameter study has been performed by varying blast load levels and durations. The effects due to the weight of the piping on the structure have also been studied. The main task of this thesis has been to compare simplified, static analysis models against dynamic analysis models as to calculate dynamic amplification factors (DAF), the purpose of this is to better understand the dynamic behavior of the structure due to the blast loading. The intention is that the dynamic amplification factors are to be used further by the engineers at Aker Solutions for dimensioning and designing of similar structures. Results showed that the blast loads as used in the analyses did not cause any structural responses within the material's plastic range. Further on, {{it was found that the}} magnitude of dynamic amplification is depending on both the blast duration emph{and} the weight of the pipes on the pipe rack.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the high temperature degradation of high brightness light emitting diodes (HBLEDs) on gallium nitride. Two different families of devices, from two leading manufacturers, have been submitted to thermal stress: during treatment, the optical and electrical characteristics of the devices have been analyzed. Degradation modes detected after stress have been (i) operating voltage increase, (ii) output power decrease, (iii) modifications of the spectral properties. The degradation of the electrical and optical characteristics of the devices were found to have different kinetics: this fact indicates that optical power (OP) loss is not strongly related to the degradation of the electrical parameters of the LEDs. On the other hand, spectral analysis indicated that OP loss is strongly related to the decrease of the phosphors-related yellow emission band. Microscopic analysis showed that this effect can be ascribed to the carbonization of the package and phosphorous material. A degradation of the transparency <b>of</b> the <b>top-side</b> ohmic contact has been also detected after stress: these mechanisms are thought to be responsible for the detected OP decrease.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there is a strong {{correlation}} between the formation of a descending sporadic E layer (E) and the occurrence of large upper atmospheric zonal wind shears, most likely driven by solar thermal tides and/or gravity waves. We present new results of E perturbation events captured between 13 and 17 July 2011 (UT days 194 - 198) as part of a coordinated campaign using a wind/temperature Na lidar at Utah State University [41. 7 °N, 111. 8 °W], and a Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI; Scientific Instrumentation Ltd., Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) and SkiYMet meteor wind radar, both located at nearby Bear Lake Observatory [41. 9 °N, 111. 4 °W]. During this period, the CADI detected strong descending E on 2 days (195 and 197) when large modulations <b>of</b> the <b>top-side</b> mesospheric Na layer occurred in synchronism with strong oscillations in the ionosonde E region echoes. A weakening in the descending E layer echoes was observed on the other 2 days (196 and 198) coincident with a large reduction in the zonal diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes above 95 km. Both tidal components were found to have comparable contributions to the total zonal wind shear that was critical for E formation and its downward propagation. Further investigation indicates that the weakening tidal amplitudes and the occurrence of the E events were also influenced by a strong quasi-two-day period modulation, suggesting significant quasi-two-day wave (QTDW) interactions with the tides. Indeed, a nonlinear, wave-wave interaction-induced 16 -hour period child wave was also detected, with amplitude comparable to that of the prevailing tides. These interaction processes and their associated effects are consistent with earlier Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model studies of nonlinear interactions between the migrating tidal waves and the QTDW and were probably responsible for the observed damping of the tidal amplitudes resulting in the disruption of the E.
