500|$|Deirdre Barrett, a dream {{researcher}} at Harvard University, said that Nolan {{did not get}} every detail accurate regarding dreams, but their illogical, rambling, disjointed plots would not make for a great thriller anyway. However, [...] "he did get many aspects right," [...] she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into {{the windows of the}} building, waking him up. [...] "That's very much how real stimuli get incorporated, and you very often wake <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> that intrusion".|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1982, Girlschool did a European tour and, at the last Danish date in Copenhagen with supporting act Mercyful Fate, McAuliffe received a potentially-fatal electric shock from her microphone. She recovered fast enough to complete a Japanese tour, to do other European shows supporting Rainbow on their Difficult to Cure tour and to start working on new material for the next album.

2500|$|Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{compared}} Peter Pan to King Joffrey from Game of Thrones, saying [...] "It's a shame Storybrooke doesn't get HBO. If Henry {{paid attention}} to Theon's story in the season 3 episode [...] "And Now His Watch Is Ended" [...] (or read George R. R.

[...] Not all reviews were as positive, however; Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating, signaling mixed reviews. She said [...] "On the way to Neverland, unfortunately, OUAT's season-three premiere gets immediately bogged down in family issues, an area where these Storybrookers have loads of problems." ...|$|E

6000|$|The train {{pulled into}} Baltimore. As is the custom {{in the great}} Eastern cities, the {{railroad}} ran beneath {{the level of the}} streets on the bottom of a big [...] "cut." [...] As the train pulled into the lighted depot, I made myself as small as possible on the blind. But a railroad bull saw me, and gave chase. Two more joined him. I was past the depot, and I ran straight on down the track. I was in a sort of trap. On each side of me rose the steep walls of the cut, and if I ever essayed them and failed, I knew that I'd slide back into the clutches of the bulls. I ran on and on, studying the walls of the cut for a favorable place to climb up. At last I saw such a place. It came just after I had passed under a bridge that carried a level street across the cut. Up the steep slope I went, clawing hand and foot. The three railroad bulls were clawing <b>up</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> me.|$|E
