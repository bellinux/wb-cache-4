5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} inhibits excretion of {{the waste}} product <b>urate</b> and causes a predisposition for gout, in which <b>urate</b> builds up. This condition is known as saturnine gout.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing <b>urate</b> absorption and unopposed <b>urate</b> secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Over last 15 {{years there}} has been {{increasing}} interest in the non-invasive assessment of airway inflammation in addition to traditional parameters of asthma control and severity. [...] - AIMS: 1) to compare different inflammatory biomarkers (BMs) in children with controlled and uncontrolled asthma, 2) to investigate their relationship {{with each other and with}} other clinical indices of asthma control (symptoms, lung function, prn salbutamol use, exacerbations, asthma control test [ACT], quality of life [AQLQ]). [...] - MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational, parallel-cohort study comprised 103 consecutive patients (age 6 - 18 years) with controlled ([CA], n= 50) and uncontrolled ([UA], n= 53) asthma. Measured lung function and BMs included: spirometry, eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), blood counts with differentials, exhaled NO (FENO), pH and <b>urates</b> in EBC, and exhaled breath temperature (EBT). [...] - RESULTS: EBC <b>urates,</b> EBC pH and EBT showed statistically significant differences between groups (UA vs. CA: EBC <b>urates,</b> median [IQR], μmol/L; 0 [3] vs 37, 9 [26], p≤ 0, 0001; EBC pH, mean [SD], 7, 2 [0, 17] vs. 7, 33 [0, 16], p= 0, 002; EBT mean [SD], °C; 34, 26 [0, 83], vs 33, 90 [0, 60], p= 0, 014).

50|$|Visceral gout is {{a disease}} of birds in which kidney failure causes a {{build-up}} of <b>urates</b> in the internal organs, leaving a chalky white coating on them. Symptoms include anorexia and emaciation.|$|R
5|$|Dutch {{scientist}} Antonie van Leeuwenhoek {{first described}} the microscopic appearance of <b>urate</b> crystals in 1679. In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod identified excess uric acid {{in the blood}} {{as the cause of}} gout.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is a form}} of {{inflammatory}} arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or <b>urate</b> nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent <b>urate</b> nephropathy.|$|E
50|$|Though {{crystallized}} urinary solutes, such as oxalates, <b>urates,</b> or sulfonamides, {{may become}} enmeshed within a ketanaline cast during its formation, the clinical {{significance of this}} occurrence is not felt to be great.|$|R
50|$|Through viremia, some nephrotropic strains (most of high virulence) could infect {{the kidney}} {{epithelium}} in tubules and nephron, causing kidney failure. At gross examination, kidneys may appear swollen and pale {{in color and}} with <b>urates</b> in ureters.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic {{model for the}} {{behavior}} of an AC undervoltage protection relay during voltage dips. The behavior is expressed by means of standardized voltage tolerance curves and highly depends on the point on-wave (phase angle) of the dip initiation. Using the model, it can be explained that AC undervoltage relays are much more sensitive to voltage dips of e. g. 50 % <b>Urated</b> than to short interruptions (0 % <b>Urated),</b> caused by the magnetic behavior. The model {{takes into account the}} electrical, magnetic and mechanical system equations. An experimental set-up with a programmable power source as dipgenerator is build to validate the model. Finally, a complete weaving machine is represented to analyze the influence towards voltage dip immunity by adding an undervoltage protection relay...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or <b>urate</b> nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and <b>urate,</b> {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower <b>urate</b> affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E

40|$|Keakei, a 4 {{year old}} male (DNA sexed) Congo African Grey Parrot, {{presented}} to the Triage Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals due to decreased activity, inappetence, yellow-stained <b>urates</b> and "quiet behavior". Six days prior to presentation at Cornell, Keakei {{was admitted to the}} referring veterinarian (rDVM) for evaluation of similar signs and regurgitation. Oral Nystatin and Trimethoprim-Sulfonamide were prescribed to treat for presumed gastrointestinal bacterial or fungal infection. There was a slight increase in activity and appetite noted the next day, but three days later the bird became inappetant and "quiet" again. Yellow-colored <b>urates</b> and dark stool continued to be noted over the next two days and Keakei was then brought to Cornell. Keakei's environment had recently been going through changes as its owner {{was in the process of}} moving. Throughout most of its life, the bird lived in a non-painted metal cage and had been exposed to finches who were housed in the same room, but in a separate cage. Keakei's regular diet consisted of Pretty Boy Parrot pellets, an unknown seed mixture (majority of diet), fruits and random feedings of the owner's food. No previous medical problems or exposure to inhaled or ingested toxins were reported. The finches had not been exhibiting any clinical signs of illness recently...|$|R
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma <b>urate</b> level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of <b>urate,</b> the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout {{at some point in their}} lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E

The electrochemically induced N-functionalization of benzoxazol- 2 (3 H) -ones works very well in all tested ionic liquids, avoiding the use of volatile organic solvents. The N-acyl and N-alkyl derivatives of benzoxazol- 2 (3 H) -ones were isolated in good to excellent yields; moreover, the ionic liquid has been reused fivefold maintaining the high yield of the products...|$|R

50|$|TLS {{should be}} {{suspected}} {{in patients with}} large tumor burden who develop acute kidney failure along with hyperuricemia (> 15 mg/dL) or hyperphosphatemia (> 8 mg/dL). (Most other acute kidney failure occurs with uric acid < 12 mg/dL and phosphate < 6 mg/dL). Acute uric acid nephropathy is associated {{with little or no}} urine output. The urinalysis may show uric acid crystals or amorphous <b>urates.</b> The hypersecretion of uric acid can be detected with a high urine uric acid - creatinine ratio > 1.0, compared to a value of 0.6-0.7 for most other causes of acute kidney failure.|$|R
25|$|The <b>urate</b> to {{creatinine}} (breakdown {{product of}} creatine phosphate in muscle) concentration ratio in urine is elevated. This {{is a good}} indicator of acid overproduction. For children under ten years of age with LNS, a <b>urate</b> to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour <b>urate</b> excretion of more than 20mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of >8mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are particularly helpful for subsequent 'carrier testing' in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side.|$|E

40|$|Atrophy, partial and complete, of {{the kidney}} of dove or pigeon can be {{obtained}} by section of one ureter. Pressure develops in the occluded duct and kidney, and insoluble <b>urates</b> later disappear from the contents of the duct. The uninjured kidney readily undergoes functional hypertrophy. These observations have a bearing on the problem of the agenesis of organs. They indicate that in some cases the absence of a glandular organ which, like the kidney, is functional in the embryo may have been formed (not agenesis) and-through malformation or malfunction of its duct-later undergone complete atrophy. In contrast, section of the genital ducts of these birds was not followed by atrophy of testis or ovary; this evidence therefore indicates that the absence of gonads in birds has a different origin and significance...|$|R
25|$|Losartan is a uricosuric. As a {{specific}} inhibitor of the <b>urate</b> transporter 1 (SLC22A12, URAT1), losartan blocks the uptake of uric acid into cells, thus leaving more {{available in the}} bloodstream to be filtered and excreted by the kidneys. Because losartan can cause hyperkalemia, individuals should not use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without appropriate monitoring by a physician.|$|E
25|$|Primarily herbivorous, Ricord's iguanas are {{presented}} with a special problem for osmoregulation: plant matter contains more potassium and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs. As Ricord's iguanas are not capable of creating liquid urine more concentrated than their bodily fluids, like birds they excrete nitrogenous wastes as <b>urate</b> salts through a salt gland. As a result, Ricord's iguanas have developed this lateral nasal gland to supplement renal salt secretion by expelling excess potassium and sodium chloride.|$|E
25|$|Seabird guano {{consists}} of nitrogen-rich ammonium oxalate and <b>urate,</b> phosphates, {{as well as}} some earth salts and impurities. Unleached guano from favored locales, such as the Chincha Islands off the coast of Peru, typically contains 8 to 16 percent nitrogen (the majority of which is uric acid), 8 to 12 percent equivalent phosphoric acid, and 2 to 3 percent equivalent potash. The fresh excrement of insect-eating bats can have nitrogen levels approximating that of seabird guano and high phosphate levels, but bat guano typically has less fertilizing value than seabird guano from arid areas because its nitrogen content is more easily leached within cave environments.|$|E

40|$|Ultrasound is an {{investigation}} imaging technique routinely performed in mammal medicine. In the avian patient the aerodynamic {{anatomy of the}} body {{with the presence of}} the air sacs makes this diagnostic tool a challenging investigations technique to perform. However, several organs can be visualized and checked in the abdomen of the bird, like the liver, the spleen, the proventriculus, the gizzard, the intestinal tracts, the cloaca and sometimes the kidneys and the gonads. In this work ultrasound investigation of the abdominal organs was performed on 6 healthy specimens of Eurasian Buzzard (Buteo buteo). The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain standard imagines of the abdominal organs in these specie of raptors and to gain knowledge regarding the normal appearance of coelomic ultrasound imagines in the avian patient.. The main acoustic window used was the liver and with this trans-abdominal approach it was not necessary to remove any feather. Abdominal organs of the raptors were observed and checked regarding their shape, their content and their echogenic appearance. The liver is, at the present knowledge, the easiest organ to be investigated: it appears well divided in lobes and its echogenic imagine pattern is similar to the one of mammals. The proventriculus and the gizzard can be visualizes both empty or filled with water previously given by forced feeding (20 ml/bird half an hour before the investigation). The gut was seen with occurring peristalsis. The cloaca was very interesting to observe: it appears usually filled with echogenic feaces and not echogenic <b>urates.</b> Sometimes it is possible to see the <b>urates</b> and feaces passing from urinary and intestinal tract to the cloaca. The kidneys are still challenging organs to check, although parts of can be seen both with trans-hepatic or lateral approach.

50|$|Much of the tortoise’s {{water intake}} comes from {{moisture}} in the grasses and wildflowers they consume in the spring. A large urinary bladder can store over 40% of the tortoise's body weight in water, urea, uric acid, and nitrogenous wastes. During very dry times, they may give off waste as a white paste rather than a watery urine. During periods of adequate rainfall, they drink copiously from any pools they find, and eliminate solid <b>urates.</b> The tortoises can increase their body weight by up to 40% after copious drinking. Adult tortoises can survive {{a year or more}} without access to water. During the summer and dry seasons, they rely on the water contained within cactus fruits and mesquite grass. To maintain sufficient water, they reabsorb water in their bladders, and move to humid underground burrows in the morning to prevent water loss by evaporation.|$|R
