40|$|AbstractThe {{diffuser}} plate {{is the key}} component of the direct type LED backlight module. The optimization and design of the micro-structures {{on the surface of}} the {{diffuser plate}} are the critical factors in manufacturing diffuser plate of good optical properties. A mathematical model of direct type LED backlight is built. The size and arrangement of microsemispheres are simulated using Lighttools 7. 0 software based on a Monte Carlo ray tracing. The influence of the magnitude and arrangement of micro-semispheres on the optical properties of the diffuser plate is analyzed by this method. And when the sphere's radius is fixed, the center distance is optimized for the best one. Simulation results show that: the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> increases with the increase of the radius value, while the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> decreases with the increase of the center distance value...|$|E
40|$|Summary The aim of {{this study}} was to check the {{calculation}} model of the visibility levels using hemispherical targets, developed by Lecocq (see this issue(1)). We have compared the results of this new model with the appraisal ratings given by observers. The experiment confirms the reliability of calculations of the visibility levels thus obtained. The correlation between visibility level and observers’ rating is high. We have compared these results with those found using flat targets. The study shows that it is possible to use both calculation models of visibility levels, which are thus both valid. However, they do not give the same result in terms of visibility for the same lighting geometry.

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diode (OLED) is light emissive device. The advantages of OLED are low power consumption, self electroluminescence and simple optical system. Furthermore, active matrix pixels and display drivers can be integrated together by standard CMOS technology for driving OLED. As a result, a novel microdisplay can be implemented by integrating OLED on a silicon backplane. Liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) microdisplay is well developed for head mount display (HMD) applications, there are limitations of high power consumption of backlight and complicated optical system. OLED microdisplay solves these problems by self electroluminescence and high efficiency. Moreover, the size can be as compact as LCoS and good for HMD application. The silicon backplane for OLED is developed. There are two topics on design. One is the pixel driving circuit, which has to ensure the current continuously flow through OLED. The major problem is process variation that affects the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>luminance.</b> The process independent pixel driving schemes are proposed. The other is that, the display drivers have to be integrated in the silicon backplane {{in order to simplify}} the I/O interface. The display drivers consist of column driver, row driver and digital-to-analog converter. All these circuits are efficiently integrated with the pixels. Finally, a OLED controller board is developed to convert conventional video for the silicon backplane. The controller board can support many video formats; including TV, PC graphic and DVI. Moreover, there are many other functions in the board to optimize the silicon backplane performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sharpening filters {{increase}} {{the depth of}} digital images by adding a fraction of their gradient. This portion is tuned by a coefficient which is usually selected according to rules of thumb or subjective evaluation. This paper proposes statistical measures for designing such parameter in a nearly automatic way, avoiding subjective evaluations. The proposed measures {{are based on the}} distance between sharpened and equalized images, which serve as an early reference, and test statistics <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>luminance</b> histogram. More complex measures, based on the trade-off between skewness and kurtosis, and variance and autocovariance of the sharpened image, are also studied. Numerical applications to various kinds of digital images show that the proposed measures provide similar and acceptable solutions...|$|R
5000|$|Developed {{with a look}} at cost-efficiency, Samsung's Blue Phase mode {{does not}} require liquid crystal {{alignment}} layers, unlike today's most widely used TFT LCD modes such as Twisted Nematic (TN), In-Plane Switching (IPS) or Vertical Alignment (VA). The Blue Phase mode can make its own alignment layers, eliminating the need for any mechanical alignment and rubbing processes. This reduces the number of required manufacturing steps, resulting in savings on production costs. Additionally it has been claimed that Blue Phase panels would reduce the sensitivity of the liquid crystal layer to mechanical pressure which could impair the lateral <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> display (e.g. <b>luminance,</b> chromaticity).|$|R
40|$|Traditional Low Dynamic Range (LDR) color spaces encode a small {{fraction}} of the visible color gamut, which does not encompass the range of colors produced on upcoming High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. Future imaging systems will require encoding much wider color gamut and luminance range. Such wide color gamut can be represented using floating point HDR pixel values but those are inefficient to encode. They also lack perceptual <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>luminance</b> and color distribution, which is provided (in approximation) by most LDR color spaces. Therefore, there is a need to devise an efficient, perceptually uniform and integer valued representation for high dynamic range pixel values. In this paper we evaluate several methods for encoding colour HDR pixel values, in particular for use in image and video compression. Unlike other studies we test both luminance and color difference encoding in a rigorous 4 AFC threshold experiments to determine the minimum bit-depth required. Results show that the Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) encoding provides the best perceptual uniformity in the considered luminance range, however the gain in bit-depth is rather modest. More significant difference can be observed between color difference encoding schemes, from which YDuDv encoding seems to be the most efficient...|$|R

40|$|We present two {{perimeter}} daylighting {{systems that}} passively redirect beam sunlight {{further from the}} window wall using special optical films, an optimized geometry, and a small glazing aperture. The objectives of these systems are (1) to increase daylight illuminance levels at 4. 6 - 9. 1 m (15 - 30 ft) from the window aperture with minimum solar heat gains and (2) to improve the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the daylighting <b>luminance</b> gradient across the room under variable solar conditions throughout the year. The designs were developed {{through a series of}} computer-assisted ray-tracing studies, laser visualization techniques, and photometric measurements and observations using physical scale models. Bi-directional illuminance measurements in combination with analytical routines were then used to simulate daylight performance for any solar position, and were incorporated into the DOE- 2. 1 E building energy analysis computer program to evaluate energy savings. Results show increased daylight levels and an improved luminance gradient throughout the year compared to conventional daylighting systems...|$|R

In all these respects sodium lamp lighting provides more favourable results than those obtained with colour corrected mercury lamps under otherwise identical conditions.

40|$|Accurate image {{segmentation}} {{is important for}} many image, video and computer vision applications. Over the last few decades, many {{image segmentation}} methods have been proposed. However, {{the results of these}} segmentation methods are usually evaluated only visually, qualitatively, or indirectly by the effectiveness of the segmentation on the subsequent processing steps. Such methods are either subjective or tied to particular applications. They do not judge the performance of a segmentation method objectively, and cannot be used as a means to compare the performance of different segmentation techniques. A few quantitative evaluation methods have been proposed, but these early methods have been based entirely on empirical analysis and have no theoretical grounding. In this paper, we propose a novel objective segmentation evaluation method based on information theory. The new method uses entropy as the basis for measuring the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> pixel characteristics (<b>luminance</b> is used in this paper) within a segmentation region. The evaluation method provides a relative quality score {{that can be used to}} compare different segmentations of the same image. This method can be used to compare both various parameterizations of one particular segmentation method as well as fundamentally different segmentation techniques. The results from this preliminary study indicate that the proposed evaluation method is superior to the prior quantitative segmentation evaluation techniques, and identify areas for future research in objective segmentation evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Every year {{hundreds}} of night time road collisions result in fatalities and injuries in Canada. Roadway lighting is considered {{as the main}} countermeasure to prevent nighttime crashes. Provision of lighting follows two industry standards in North America: one for the warrants {{and the other for}} minimum recommended levels. The warrant system assigns scores to highway segments based on geometrical, operational and functional characteristics as well as the collision history through a night-to-day crash-ratio. Transportation agencies in North America had manifested their interest in simplifying the warrant system; eliminating elements and/or modifying lighting values, however, {{there is a need for}} a method to support lighting decisions over its effectiveness as a countermeasure. This thesis presents a novel method to calibrate lighting warrants and to identify effective levels of lighting in order to reduce the severity and frequency of night-time collisions. This new method uses an evidence-based mechanism to connect lighting warrants with statistical analysis of collisions in order to adjust the scores of the warrant. It also connects the estimation of lighting levels with evidence-based statistical analysis of crash-history in order to identify recommended levels <b>of</b> <b>luminance,</b> illuminance and <b>uniformity</b> variations. The method expands the industry standards by providing the decision maker with two alternate non-exclusive approaches supported over collisions’ frequency and severity criteria. A large-scale case study for highways in Quebec was used to calibrate the warrants and identified recommended levels <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> <b>of</b> at least 1. 5 cd/m 2, maximum <b>uniformities</b> <b>of</b> illuminance of 1. 5 and <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> <b>of</b> 8 times to prevent severe and frequent collisions. A case study of Arthabaska region in Quebec found that levels <b>of</b> <b>luminance</b> should be increased for every functional classification of roads that values <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> must be reduced, and that levels of illuminance increased to reduce severe collisions. The novel methods developed in this research will provide province/state transportation agencies and municipalities with the capability of not only allocating lighting when is needed and justified, but also of selecting the optimal levels that result in effective reductions in nighttime road collision frequency and severity, signifying safer roads for the society at large...|$|R

We use this standard test target to measure the range <b>of</b> <b>luminances</b> that can be captured on a camera’s image plane.
