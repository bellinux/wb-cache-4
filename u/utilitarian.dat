5|$|<b>Utilitarian</b> philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on <b>utilitarian</b> principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong.|$|E
5|$|With {{increasing}} {{trade in}} economic and medicinal plants {{the need for}} a more comprehensive classification system increased. Up to about 1650 CE plants had been grouped either alphabetically or according to <b>utilitarian</b> folk taxonomy – by their medicinal uses or whether they were trees, shrubs or herbs. Between 1650 and 1700 CE there was a move from the <b>utilitarian</b> back to a scientific natural classification based on the characters of the plants themselves.|$|E
5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a <b>utilitarian</b> function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for <b>utilitarian</b> memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} final pier structure, built along the newly {{reclaimed}} waterfront, was designed {{in a modern}} <b>utilitarian</b> style and was opened by Maurine Grantham, wife of Governor Alexander Grantham, in June 1954.|$|E
5|$|Two-level utilitarianism (sometimes Government House utilitarianism) is a <b>utilitarian</b> {{theory of}} ethics {{developed}} by R. M. Hare. According to the theory, a person's moral decisions {{should be based}} on a set of 'intuitive' moral rules, except in certain rare situations where it is more appropriate to engage in a 'critical' level of moral reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca's salient {{architecture}} is primarily Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic. The modern era has also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the mid-century style. The mostly <b>utilitarian</b> Communist-era {{architecture is}} also present, although {{only to a}} certain extent, as Cluj-Napoca never faced a large systematisation programme. Of late, the city has seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings, mainly constructed after 2000.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; <b>utilitarian</b> approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most <b>utilitarian</b> to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as {{lashings}} and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E
5|$|Varner's In Nature's Interests? {{offers a}} {{resolution}} of the debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based biocentric individualism according to which all living beings—including plants—have morally significant interests that ground prima facie (though overridable) duties. The approach follows {{in the tradition of the}} work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear <b>utilitarian</b> commitments.|$|E
5|$|As a {{military}} man, al-Mu'tasim's outlook was <b>utilitarian,</b> and his intellectual pursuits {{could not be}} {{compared with those of}} al-Ma'mun or his successor al-Wathiq, but he continued his brother's policy of promoting writers and scholars. Baghdad remained a major centre of learning throughout his reign. Among the notable scholars active during his reign were the astronomers Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi and Ahmad al-Farghani, the polymath al-Jahiz, and the distinguished Arab mathematician and philosopher al-Kindi, who dedicated his work On First Philosophy to his patron al-Mu'tasim.|$|E
5|$|As part of post-war reclamation, the old pier was demolished. Work {{commenced}} in February 1954 {{on a new}} pier on the new waterfront {{designed in}} a modern <b>utilitarian</b> style. The structure {{was described as a}} U-shaped plan, with an open-sided superstructure. It consisted of tiled reinforced concrete base and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and disembark, three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west.|$|E
5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a <b>utilitarian</b> post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the ancient world, at least, plants have been {{classified}} in two ways. On the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function. Then there is the practical, <b>utilitarian</b> or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use. Cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code. This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special <b>utilitarian</b> needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce. Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, hedges served as fences {{on the perimeter}} to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less <b>utilitarian</b> plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others.|$|E
5|$|Japanese lacquerware {{has a long}} history, {{back as far as}} the Jōmon period, {{because of}} {{decorative}} value and the quality as protective finish. Initially lacquer was used to enhance properties of <b>utilitarian</b> objects such as watertight drinking vessels, cooking and household goods. The oldest extant decorated item dates to the 6th century; in the medieval and early modern period lacquer was used in the manufacture of many products such as toiletry boxes, inkstone cases, eating utensils, plates, bowls, containers, furniture, saddles, stirrups or armour.|$|E
5|$|Justin Ferrell explores three moral {{sensibilities}} {{that motivated}} activists {{in dealing with}} Yellowstone. First came the <b>utilitarian</b> vision of maximum exploitation of natural resources, characteristic of developers in the late 19th century. Second was the spiritual vision of nature inspired by the Romanticism and the transcendentalists the mid-19th century. The twentieth century saw the biocentric moral vision {{that focuses on the}} health of the ecosystem as theorized by Aldo Leopold, which led to the expansion of federally protected areas and to the surrounding ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the {{cultivated}} plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both scientific and <b>utilitarian</b> ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E
5|$|Navajo {{textiles}} {{were originally}} <b>utilitarian</b> blankets {{for use as}} cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar purposes. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences. In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level <b>utilitarian</b> knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these domes are bright in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly <b>utilitarian,</b> as they prevented snow from piling on the roof.|$|E
5|$|The Bacon Academy, nicknamed Old Bacon Academy, was the {{original}} Bacon Academy until 1993. The Old Bacon Academy was built in 1803 and is located at 84Main Street, Colchester, Connecticut. The main structure is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. Noted for its plain, <b>utilitarian</b> floor plan consisting of two rooms off a central hall and stairway, the inside has seen some renovations throughout its history. The Day Hall, a contributing property purchased by the Bacon Academy trustees in 1929, is a church hall that {{was used for the}} high school until 1962.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{engaged in}} long {{distance}} trade across the Maya region, and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond. Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast. In the Early Classic, Chichen Itza {{was at the}} hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from Colombia and Panama, and turquoise from Los Cerrillos, New Mexico. Long distance trade of both luxury and <b>utilitarian</b> goods was probably controlled by the royal family. Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies. An Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of the {{contributing}} properties of the Michigan–Wacker Historic District, which was listed as on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1978. It was also designated as a Chicago Landmark on October 2, 1991. In 2009 the sidewalks and railings on the bridge were replaced, and the bridge was repainted; the design of the new ornamental railings was based on the original 1920 design for the bridge's railings, replacing more <b>utilitarian</b> ones that had been substituted at a later date.|$|E
5|$|The older {{route through}} {{downtown}} is a one-way pair on Sixth (southbound) and Seventh (northbound) Streets, entirely overlapping OR 99 to I-5 exit 58, where OR 99 continues with I-5 to the north. The Caveman Bridge, a concrete through arch bridge built in 1927, carries Sixth Street over the Rogue River, while the parallel Seventh Street Bridge is a <b>utilitarian</b> bridge from 1960. The Grants Pass Parkway (Redwood Spur) also crosses the river on a four-lane bridge built in 1990; before that bypass was completed, the spur began downtown on E (southbound) and F (northbound) Streets. Soon after {{the old and}} new routes join, the spur ends at a trumpet interchange with I-5 (exit 55).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{plans for the}} station called for a clean <b>utilitarian</b> structure typical of metro stations of that period. Due {{to the efforts of}} the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one that resembles an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine {{was a part of the}} secular Soviet Union at the time of the station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists and architects of the station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991.|$|E
5|$|These <b>utilitarian</b> fortifications {{were armed}} with artillery, {{intended}} to be used against enemy ships before they could land forces or attack ships lying in harbour. The first wave of work between 1539 and 1543 was characterised {{by the use of}} circular bastions and multi-tiered defences, combined with many traditional medieval features. These designs contained serious military flaws, however, and the second period of construction until 1547 saw the introduction of angular bastions and other innovations probably inspired by contemporary thinking in mainland Europe. The castles were commanded by captains appointed by the Crown, overseeing small garrisons of professional gunners and soldiers, who would be supplemented by the local militia in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|They were {{supported}} by architects Anatoliy Krushynskyi, Tamara Tselikovska, and Fedir Zaremba, who were responsible for designing the underground vestibule. While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original <b>utilitarian</b> design continued. The new design {{was based on the}} form of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white ceiling was divided with diametrical mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a <b>utilitarian</b> approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between <b>utilitarian</b> and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E
5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as <b>utilitarian</b> footwear worn for warmth and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The <b>utilitarian</b> loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} <b>utilitarian,</b> {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the IMA has begun to focus on {{developing}} its contemporary art collection, which includes works such as Two White Dots in the Air by Alexander Calder and Light and Space III, a permanent installation by Robert Irwin located in the Pulliam Great Hall. Since 2007 the museum has featured site-specific contemporary installations in the Efroymson Pavilion, rotating the temporary works every six months. The Efroymson Pavilion has featured works by artists such as William Lamson, Ball-Nogues Studio, Orly Genger, and Heather Rowe to name a few. Contemporary art is also featured in 100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, which is unique in its inclusion of commissioned works by emerging mid-career artists. Since 2007, the IMA has committed to building a modern design collection that illustrates the artistic merits of <b>utilitarian</b> objects. The focus on international contemporary design, combined {{with the opening of}} the Miller House in 2011, is expected to reposition the museum as an authority on design.|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily <b>utilitarian,</b> instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{porcupine}} ray consists {{mainly of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes, which it digs {{up from the}} sea floor. It is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The porcupine ray has long been valued for its rough and durable skin, which {{was made into a}} shagreen leather once used for various <b>utilitarian</b> and ornamental purposes, such as to cover sword hilts and shields. It is caught incidentally by coastal fisheries. Because it must be handled carefully due to its thorns, its commercial significance is limited. Unregulated fishing has led to this species declining in many parts of its range, and thus has been listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's <b>utilitarian</b> ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|The {{recently}} built Battersea Power Station then dominated most {{views of}} the area, so {{it was decided that}} the bridge's appearance was unimportant. Consequently, in contrast to the heavily ornamented 1858 bridge, the new bridge has a starkly <b>utilitarian</b> design and the only ornamentation consists of two ornamental lamp posts at each entrance. Each features a gilded galleon on top of a coat of arms. The outward facing sides of all four posts show the LCC coat of arms of the Lion of England, St George's Cross and the barry wavy lines representing the Thames; the inward faces on the south side show the dove of peace of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, that on the northwest corner shows the winged bull, lion, boars' heads and stag of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea, and that on the northeast corner the portcullis and Tudor roses of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E
