25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} hobble corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E
500|$|Linda Laubenstein {{was born}} on May 21, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Priscilla and George Laubenstein. She grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island. [...] Her mother worked as a special-education {{preschool}} teacher, while her father worked as a purchasing agent for Providence Gas Company. As a child, she had severe asthma and contracted polio {{at the age of}} five. She was placed in an iron lung for three months to prevent respiratory failure and was left paraplegic; she would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of her}} life. Because she was unable to physically attend elementary school, an intercom was set up from her classroom to her home. Her high school did not have an elevator, so when she needed to attend classes on the second floor, members of the school's football team would carry her wheelchair <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> She chose to attend Barnard College because the campus was accessible for wheelchair users. Aspiring to become a doctor, she took mostly science classes. She went on to study at the New York University School of Medicine, receiving her M.D. in 1973 and completing her internship, residency and fellowship by 1978.|$|E
2500|$|The first video {{interlude}} featured dancers waving {{large white}} cloths {{in front of}} fans during [...] "Messiah", as footage from the [...] "Ghosttown" [...] video played on the screens. The next segment started with [...] "Body Shop", where Madonna sang the song alongside dancers dressed as mechanics {{in front of a}} 1965 Ford Falcon. She then played the ukulele for an acoustic version of [...] "True Blue" [...] before flowing into a disco version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper", which was sung at end of the catwalk. A spiral staircase descended from the ceiling for a mashup of [...] "HeartBreakCity" [...] and [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", where a male dancer followed Madonna <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> before she pushed him off from the top. She closed the section with a remix of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] performing it energetically around the stage. The second video interlude began with a mashup of [...] "S.E.X." [...] and [...] "Justify My Love", with eight dancers mimicking sex positions on four beds while an edited version of the [...] "Erotica" [...] music video played on the screens.|$|E

And through it all the ceaseless hammering of pick and axe, attacking these stately walls which had withstood the wars and sieges of centuries.|$|E

Jonathan's footsteps then died from the door, and his cart creaked away.|$|E

60|$|It {{was wide}} open, {{the hall was}} lighted extravagantly, and people were going <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> His courage failed him; to enter footsore, laden, and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved, if not to court repulse from her husband. Accordingly he went round into {{the street at the}} back that he knew so well, entered the garden, and came quietly into the house through the kitchen, {{temporarily}} depositing the bird and cage under a bush outside, to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival.|$|E
60|$|Order was not {{restored}} to the house, nor, indeed, any decent progress made, until this great man came: but {{where there was a}} revolt before, and a general disposition to strike work and to yell out defiance against Mrs. Gashleigh, who was sitting bewildered and furious in the drawing-room--where there was before commotion, at the appearance of the master-spirit, all was peace and unanimity: the cook went back to her pans, the housemaid busied herself with the china and glass, cleaning some articles and breaking others, Buttons sprang <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> obedient to the orders of his chief, and all things went well and in their season.|$|E
60|$|You {{are afraid}} to poke your nose into any {{room in the house}} now; so, after walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> for a while, you go and sit in your own bedroom. This becomes uninteresting, however, after a time, and so you put on your hat and stroll out into the garden. You walk down the path, and as you pass the summer-house you glance in, and there are those two young idiots, huddled up into one corner of it; and they see you, and are evidently under the idea that, for some wicked purpose of your own, you are {{following}} them about.|$|E

No, do not pout, I have no wish to pry into the secrets of ladies, but still in my position here it is my business to know a thing or two. Well, what did you see?" ...|$|E
60|$|Frank's {{name was}} never now {{mentioned}} in the house. Its utterance had not been forbidden, {{but it had been}} dropped as a matter concerning which a hopeless disagreement existed. Alice had changed almost as much as her uncle. Her spirits were gone; her voice was no longer heard singing about the house; she no longer ran <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> with quick springing footsteps, and indeed seemed all at once to have changed from a young girl into a young woman. Sometimes, as she sat, the tears filled her eyes and rolled fast down her cheeks; at other times she would walk about with her eyebrows knitted, and hands clenched, and lips pursed together, a little volcano of suppressed anger.|$|E
60|$|I never undressed that night, {{but just}} {{lay down on}} my bed, thinking. The house was very still at times, but at others I could hear the tramp of the police agents <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and also outside my window. The latter gave on a small, {{dilapidated}} back garden which had a wooden fence {{at the end of}} it. Beyond it were some market gardens belonging to a M. Lorraine. It did not take me very long to realize that that way lay my fortune of twenty thousand francs. But for the moment I remained very still. My plan was already made. At about midnight I went to the window and opened it cautiously. I had heard no noise from that direction for some time, and I bent my ear to listen.|$|E

60|$|The restlessness {{that had}} driven her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and {{backward}} and {{forward in the}} hall, left her as suddenly as it had come. She waited through the second interval, leaning on the window-sill, and staring, without conscious thought of any kind, into the black night. The howling of a belated dog was borne toward her on the wind, at intervals, from some distant part of the suburb. She found herself following the faint sound as it died away into silence with a dull attention, and listening for its coming again with an expectation that was duller still. Her arms lay like lead on the window-sill; her forehead rested against the glass without feeling the cold. It was not till the moon struggled out again that she was startled into sudden self-remembrance. She turned quickly, {{and looked at the}} clock; seven minutes had passed since the second Pouring.|$|E
60|$|The {{necessary}} {{alterations in}} his house were being fast completed, and {{he walked through the}} rooms, and went <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and rambled through the garden, but he could not wake himself to much interest about them. He stood still at every window to look out and think upon Mr. Slope. At almost every window he had before stood and chatted with Eleanor. She and Mrs. Grantly had been there continually; and while Mrs. Grantly had been giving orders, and seeing that orders had been complied with, he and Eleanor had conversed on all things appertaining to a clergyman's profession. He thought how often he had laid down the law to her and how sweetly she had borne with his somewhat dictatorial decrees. He remembered her listening intelligence, her gentle but quick replies, her interest in all that concerned the church, in all that concerned him; and then he struck his riding-whip against the window-sill and declared to himself that it was impossible that Eleanor Bold should marry Mr. Slope.|$|E
60|$|Do {{write to}} me soon. I hear that {{everybody}} should read Dr. Arnold's 'Life.' Do you know also 'E[=o]then,' a work of genius? You have read, perhaps, Hewitt's 'Visits to Remarkable Places' in the first series and second; and Mrs. Jameson's 'Visits and Sketches' and 'Life in Mexico.' Do you know the 'Santa Fé Expedition,' and Custine's 'Russia,' and 'Forest Life' by Mrs. Clavers? You will think that my associative process is in a most disorderly state, by all this running <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{of all sorts of}} subjects, in the naming of books. I would write a list, more as a list should be written, if I could see my way better, and this will do for a beginning in any case. You do not like romances, I believe, as I do, and then nearly every romance now-a-days sets about pulling the joints of one's heart and soul out, as a process of course. 'Ellen Middleton' (which I have not read yet) is said to be very painful. Do you know Leigh Hunt's exquisite essays called 'The Indicator and Companion' &c., published by Moxon? I hold them at once in delight and reverence. May God bless you both.|$|E
