However, when Hirschfeld wanted out of the partnership in 1992, Stahl accused the latter of <b>unfair</b> <b>profit</b> distribution. In retaliation, Stahl was accused of racial discrimination against tenants. In 1998, Hirschfeld was indicted of hiring a hitman to murder Stahl in 1996.|$|E

50|$|On December 21, 2009, {{five months}} after the three TVXQ members filed their lawsuit and while the dispute was ongoing, Han Geng, the only Chinese member of Super Junior, also filed a lawsuit against S.M. for similar reasons of <b>unfair</b> <b>profit</b> {{distributions}} and having signed an unfair thirteen-year contract that contained provisions in S.M.'s favour and that he was not allowed to revise or end. Han Geng's friend and current manager Sun Le also submitted a statement to Korean courts citing S.M. Entertainment's violation of Han Geng's rights, which was later leaked via the internet. The statement argued that S.M. had discriminated against Han Geng financially as well as in terms of management.|$|E

Along with this, it was disclosed that because of SM Entertainment's refusal to give him a day off in over two years, he had developed gastritis and kidney disease.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a field experiment with real-life tenants in Ethiopia {{to test the}} incentive effects of fixed-wage, sharecropping, fixed-rent, and ownership contracts. The experimental task resembles a common process in agricultural production. The sharecropping contract is essentially a piece-rate scheme framed as a profit sharing agreement. The sharecropping output was about 11 percent smaller than the fixed-rent output. Surprisingly, it is statistically indistinguishable from the fixed-wage output, despite substantial piece rates. This effect is driven by real-life sharecroppers. Their sharecropping output was significantly smaller than that of non-sharecroppers, and in one region, it was even 10 percent lower than sharecroppers fixed-wage output. Based on qualitative interviews and historical accounts, we argue that our subjects dislike sharecropping contracts because of the <b>unfair</b> <b>profit</b> sharing and the controversial allocation of the land. The contractual performance may therefore depend on the perceived fairness of the incentive scheme...|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} {{governance}} mechanisms for industrial symbiosis (IS). The study takes an organizational approach on material and energy exchanges between different organizations (or different {{parts in the}} same organization) leading to increased regional resource efficiency. This project explores different strategies for governance mechanisms and analyzes how these affect trust. Significant factors for initiating and keeping a collaboration successful are also analyzed. Representatives from 24 Swedish cases of symbiotic arrangements are interviewed and ten themes affecting IS collaborations are identified. The themes are governance structure, shared vision, previous collaboration, local conditions, initiating a collaboration, activities to build trust, conflicts, transaction-based or goal-oriented approach, indicators and distribution of costs and benefits. Among the governance structures used are hierarchy (collaboration between {{different parts of the}} same organization), joint venture, strategic alliance and different types of agreements. Common is a 10 - 15 years agreement, sometimes combined with a strategic discussion about the development of the collaboration. Three factors particularly affecting collaborations are identified: strategic meetings, indicators related to the collaboration and fair profit distribution. The factor strategic meetings is about combining long term agreements with innovation. Long term agreements might be necessary when a project requires investments. Meanwhile, this can suppress innovation by supporting outdated solutions. The paradox of needing both long term agreements and continued innovation may be solved by the practice of having strategic meetings and contract surveillance. Another significant factor for successful collaborations is the use of jointly evaluated indicators. To jointly evaluate a project according to predetermined indicators gives all parties the opportunity to know when a collaboration is successful. The third significant factor is fair profit distribution. <b>Unfair</b> <b>profit</b> distribution may delay or stop a project. It may also decrease trust in an ongoing project. A fair profit distribution is a key factor for enabling long term relationships.  Den här rapporten studerar samarbetsformer för industriell symbios (IS). Fokus för den här studien är material- och energiutbyten mellan organisationer eller mellan olika delar i samma organisation som leder till regional resurseffektivisering. Val och implementering av samarbetsform analyseras i relation till förtroende mellan organisationer och lyckade samarbeten. Viktiga faktorer för att lyckas starta och bibehålla ett symbiossamarbete analyseras också. Representanter från 24 svenska fall av symbiotiska samarbeten intervjuas och deras svar analyseras utifrån tio teman: samarbetsform, gemensam vision, tidigare samarbete, lokala förutsättningar, att starta ett samarbete, aktiviteter för att bygga förtroende, konflikter, transaktionsbaserat eller målinriktat förhållningssätt, indikatorer och vinstfördelning. Bland de samarbetsformer som används återfinns hierarki (samarbete mellan olika delar i samma organisation), joint venture, strategisk allians och olika typer av avtal. Vanligt är avtal på 10 - 15 år, ibland kombinerat med en strategisk diskussion om samarbetets utveckling. Tre faktorer identifieras som extra viktiga vid symbiotiska samarbeten: strategiska möten, indikatorer relaterade till samarbetet och rättvis vinstfördelning. Strategiska möten handlar om att kombinera långsiktiga avtal med innovation. Långsiktiga avtal behövs ofta i symbiossamarbeten för att kunna göra investeringar. Samtidigt kan detta låsa fast utdaterade lösningar och försvåra innovation och utveckling. Att ha avtalsbevakning och en strategisk diskussion kring utveckling av samarbetet har identifierats som ett sätt att lösa detta på. En annan betydande faktor för lyckade samarbeten är gemensamma indikatorer relaterade till samarbetet. Att gemensamt utvärdera samarbetet enligt uppsatta indikatorer ger alla parter möjlighet att veta när ett samarbete lyckats. Den tredje identifierade faktorn är rättvis vinstfördelning. Orättvis vinstfördelning kan stoppa eller försena ett samarbete. Det kan också urholka parternas förtroende till varandra. En rättvis vinstfördelning kan däremot skapa förtroende och är en nyckelfaktor till ett långsiktigt samarbete. ...|$|E
30|$|We {{proposed}} a multimodal framework for detecting game bots {{in order to}} reduce damage to online game service providers and legitimate users. We observed the behavioral characteristics of game bots and found several unique and discriminative characteristics. We found that game bots execute repetitive tasks associated with earning <b>unfair</b> <b>profits,</b> they do not enjoy socializing with other players, are connected among themselves and exchange cyber assets with each other. Interestingly, some game bots use the mail function to collect cyber assets. We utilized those observations to build discriminative features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed framework based on highly accurate ground truth—resulting from the banning of bots by the game company. The results showed that the framework can achieve detection accuracy of 0.961. Nonetheless, we should consider that the banned list does not include every game bot.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} e.g. Sweden there is legislation {{to prevent the}} pawn broker from making <b>unfair</b> <b>profits</b> (usury due to financial distress or ignorance of the customer) {{at the expense of}} the customer by low evaluation on their collaterals. It is stated that the pawn broker may not keep the collateral but must sell them at public auction. Any excess after paying the loan, the interest and auction costs must be paid to the customer. If the item does not fetch a price that will cover these expenses the pawn broker may keep the item and sell it through other channels. Despite this protection. the cost for the customer to borrow money this way will be high, and if he cannot redeem the collateral it would in many cases be better to sell the goods directly.|$|R
40|$|This study {{concentrated}} on local private companies' evaluation to solve crises. It explains {{the factors that}} {{have an effect on}} these companies’ success by developing strategies, establishing general budget supporting up their conditions, fair dealing with tax and clear corporate responsibility duties. The companies that get government support may reach their aims of solving the crises or may develop trickeries to get <b>unfair</b> <b>profits</b> besides government support which increases depression. The researcher suggests the use of three tables which will be presented in this study, as models to evaluate the fair general budget policies, the ability of local private companies to get support, and also to evaluate the sharing between companies and government. These tables are important and need to be monitored and can provide direction for companies to a condition which is to cover citizens’ need locally, at appropriate prices, at a suitable time and place. On another hand, a figure displayed in this research can be used to watch a company’s reaction in crises...|$|R

40|$|This {{short article}} {{deals with a}} {{specific}} problem of interpretation of Romanian law on the enforcement of IP rights, namely the possibility of having the court set damages to the right holder by taking into account both the right holder’s loss and the infringer’s <b>unfair</b> <b>profits.</b> The two criteria {{for the assessment of}} damages are specifically provided for by law and are also expressly provided for by the EU IP Rights Enforcement Directive which was implemented in Romania. While the possibility of referring to either of the two remains uncontested, the possibility of cumulating the two has been denied in some decisions of the Romanian High Court. In order to do so the High Court has interpreted Romanian law so as to comply with the provisions of the EU Directive read by taking into account one of the recitals to the directive which seems to only allow for the criteria to be used alternatively and not cumulatively. The article examines this interpretation and concludes that the curt ought not to have referred to the text of the EU Directive and that, even if it would do so, could not base its interpretation on the recital, as it did and should {{have come to the conclusion}} that the cumulation of the two criteria is possible. In order to do so the article examines the implementation of the Directive in Romanian law, the limitations that the CJEU has imposed on the interpretation of EU acts, the history of the enacting of the EU provisions at issue and the context of the provisions within the directive...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{challenges}} facing the networking industry today {{is to increase the}} profitability of Internet services. This calls for economic mechanisms that can enable providers to charge more for better services and collect a fair share of the increased revenues. In this paper, we present a generic model for pricing Internet services that are jointly offered by a group of providers. We show that non-cooperative pricing strategies between providers may lead to <b>unfair</b> distribution of <b>profit</b> and may even discourage future upgrades to the network. As an alternative, we propose a fair revenue-sharing policy based on the weighted proportional fairness criterion. We show that this fair allocation policy encourages collaboration among providers and hence can produce higher profits for all providers. Based on the analysis, we suggest a scalable algorithm for providers to implement this policy in a distributed way and study its convergence property...|$|R
40|$|Assignment {{problems}} {{where both}} sets of agents {{that have to be}} matched are countably infinite, the so-called infinite assignment problems, are studied as well as the related cooperative assignment games. Further, several solution concepts for these assignment games are studied. The first one is the utopia payoff for games with an infinite value. In this solution each player receives the maximal amount he can think of with respect to the underlying assignment problem. This solution is contained in the core of the game. Second, we study two solutions for assignment games with a finite value. Our main result is the existence of core-elements of these games, although they are hard to calculate. Therefore another solution, the f-strong ε-core is studied. This particular solution takes into account that due to organisational limitations it seems reasonable that only finite groups of agents will eventually protest against <b>unfair</b> proposals of <b>profit</b> distributions. The f-strong ε-core is shown to be nonempty...|$|R
40|$|Population-based biobank {{research}} {{is a phenomenon}} which has evolved {{over the past two}} decades. This development has received extensive ethical scrutiny because it requires large numbers of research participants, involves genetic analysis, and its activities do not fit the mould of traditional medical research ethics. Thus the aim {{of this study was to}} analyse, explore and further develop ethical arguments on the following three issues pertaining to population-based biobank research: consent, commercial use and return of research results. The work included in this thesis was carried out as part of the project: “In Genes We Trust? Biobanks, commercialization and everyday life”. It was funded by the Research Council of Norway by the framework addressing ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) within functional genomics research – the FUGE program (The Research Council of Norway 2009). This effort has resulted in 11 papers published in national and international peer-reviewed journals or reviewed academic anthologies, where five of these works are included in this thesis. Four of the papers presented are grounded in theoretical normative analysis; they are partly descriptive and partly argumentative, and are based on bioethical inquiry of the topic addressed. In addition, one paper presents an empirical study using focus group interviews. This strategy was used to explore lay peoples’ intuitions on commercial involvement in biobank research; subsequently they were drawn on in the normative analysis of this topic. The two papers pertaining to consent first of all contribute to understanding the legitimacy of broad consent. Here previous arguments and notions are articulated and explained and broad consent is argued as a valid consent. In addition, the proposal of dynamic consent, suggested as a unique and morally superior form of consent to use in biobank research, is critically examined and compared to the broad form of consent. The two works included about commercial actors’ involvement in publicly funded population-based biobank research, support an understanding that some forms of commercial use can be acceptable. Governance frameworks, including ethical reviews,public contribution fees and separating the donation setting from the realms of the marketplace, were strategies that could help render commercial use sound. However, unjust handling of the resources and <b>unfair</b> distributions of <b>profits</b> can hamper such opportunities. The last paper addresses the increased call for a return of research results to individuals. Its appeal is based on respect for individuals’ autonomy, potential beneficence and reciprocity for specific individuals as well as a potential strategy to commit lay persons to and involve them in biobank research. This issue is currently receiving substantial scholarly attention, based both on theoretical debates of justification, and on evaluations of practical implementations. Although arguments for such strategies are strong, there are also substantial arguments against a general duty to return research results to individual research participants. On a whole, this thesis contributes to build a platform to understand why ethical inquiries into issues in biobank research are embarked upon. It also shows how complex and interrelated all the ethical issues in biobank research are. Although working separately with these issues, the complexity of their political and social meaning in addition to their role in biomedical research are underlying reasons why these discussions are still on-going. Further bioethical work in this field is needed as none of the practical ethical challenges are fully met. As the nature of biobank {{research is}} longitudinal, it will continuously meet developments in society and technologies which provide novel opportunities. Therefore ethical issues in biobank research will and should re-emerge and be readdressed on a regular basis. PhD i klinisk medisinPhD in Clinical Medicin...|$|R
