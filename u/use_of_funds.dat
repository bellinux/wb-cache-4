5|$|This section {{establishes}} the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. Federal regulations prohibit the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized {{by a federal}} agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award that starts on January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must {{be returned to the}} federal agency unless otherwise authorized.|$|E

Parker and his advisors opted for a front porch campaign, in which delegations would be brought to Rosemount to see Parker speak {{on the model of}} McKinley's successful 1896 campaign. However, due to Esopus' remote location and the campaign's inefficient <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to bring in delegates, Parker received few visitors. Rather than introducing issues that would differentiate the two parties, the Democrats preferred to emphasize Roosevelt's character, portraying him as dangerously unstable. Parker's campaign also failed to reach out to traditional Democratic voting blocs such as Irish Catholic immigrants. In contrast, Roosevelt's campaign, headed by George Cortelyou, organized committees to appeal specifically to demographics including Jewish, black, and German-American voters. John Hay, Roosevelt's Secretary of State, wrote of Parker's poor showing to Henry Adams, calling it [...] "the most absurd political campaign of our time".|$|E
