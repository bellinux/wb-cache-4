5|$|The closing {{was criticized}} by two engineers, who {{stated that the}} company {{actually}} made a profit, but ended <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> 24% of their revenue in ticket commission to SJ and NSB. In 2003, the company had a revenue of SEK426.8 million, of which SEK411 million was from ticket sales. The company had a deficit of SEK33.8 million, of which NSB covered SEK8.1 million and SJ SEK25.6 million. However, NSB took a commission of SEK10.8 million and SJ SEK58.5 million. This gave a profit, before provisions, of SEK35.5 million. In comparison, Narvesen took a commission of 2.7% for tickets sold by NSB.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he ended <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian {{had been given the}} title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, or at least the senate, was {{aware of the fact that}} it had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Matilda's {{eldest son}} Henry {{slowly began to}} assume {{a leading role in}} the conflict. He had {{remained}} in France when the Empress first left for England. He crossed over to England in 1142, before returning to Anjou in 1144. Geoffrey of Anjou expected Henry to become the King of England and began to involve him in the government of the family lands. In 1147, Henry intervened in England with a small mercenary army but the expedition failed, not least because Henry lacked the funds to pay his men. Henry asked his mother for money, but she refused, stating that she had none available. In the end Stephen himself ended <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> off Henry's mercenaries, allowing him to return home safely; his reasons for doing so remain unclear.|$|E

The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash or credit card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E

25|$|When Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he {{was still}} married and his singing career was waning. When she {{showed up at the}} clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His {{financial}} problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Haymes got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> most of Haymes's debts.|$|E
5000|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} giving rolled <b>up</b> holiday <b>pay</b> was not permissible, {{because it could}} create a {{disincentive}} for workers to take holidays. Holidays are a principle of Community law from which {{there could be no}} derogations. Article 7(1) was intended to enable workers to actually take leave. The point of payment for holidays was that a worker would be in a position comparable during leave as when leave is taken. Article 7(2) made clear that a payment in lieu could be taken only where the employment relationship is terminated. Otherwise the right to leave would effectively be replaced by payment in lieu. However employers are entitled to set off rolled <b>up</b> <b>pay</b> against periods of leave that are [...] "actually taken".|$|R

As a result, skilled workers tend to demand more in the way of financial compensation because of their efforts. According to Greenspan, corporate managers are willing to bid <b>up</b> <b>pay</b> packages to acquire skilled workers as they identify the lack of skilled labor as one of today's greatest problems.|$|R
25|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} at the cost to users of the SmartRider system compared to its predecessor, the MultiRider. While the MultiRider could be bought as a 40-ride ticket for a 25% discount, a lesser 20% discount can now only be obtained by paying by direct debit, which {{can take up to}} 3 weeks to activate. A 10% discount is available for all other methods of payment. This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would end <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> $324 more a year for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally forgetting to do so or due to a non-working machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E
25|$|Built by the Norwegian State Railways, {{construction}} commenced in 1892 and {{was initially}} estimated {{to take one}} year. However, it took three years, largely because of inferior geological conditions, in part caused by clay in the ground. Construction did fall within the NOK750,000 budget. Of this, Brevik Municipality ended <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> NOK90,000, which would stand as a major burden for them for years. Export of ice for cooling was a major industry in Eidanger from the 1850s to the 1970s. There were several small dammed-up ice lakes, and four of these had to be expropriated to give way for the railway. The construction work was initially led by S. H. Strøm, and from January 1894 by M. Olsen. Surveying started in May 1894 and allowed negotiations for expropriation to commence in the fall, which lasted a half year. Earthwork hauling started {{in the spring of}} 1893, first with 100 men and by the summer increasing to 200.|$|E
25|$|The average water tariff {{reported}} in 2014 was KSh 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure {{is not very}} indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block tariff system is in place for household connections. This means {{that for the first}} 10 m3 a minimum charge is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m3) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote water saving practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, there are problems with this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> a higher tariff.|$|E

25|$|Obstacles to {{the project}} soon appeared. In March 1926 the U.S. {{government}} auctioned off some lots on Key Biscayne that had been retained {{when the rest of}} the island was transferred to the State of Florida. The Mathesons wanted to have clear title to all of their land, and determined to outbid other interested parties for the land. They ended <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> US$58,055 for a total of 6.84 acres (2.77 hectares) of land, a record price per acre for the auction of U.S. government land up to that date. Then, on September 18, 1926, the Great Miami Hurricane crossed over Key Biscayne on its way to Miami. While no lives were lost on the island, most of the buildings on Key Biscayne were destroyed or badly damaged, and many of the plantings were lost, including half of the coconut trees. D. P. Davis was not able to meet his end of the contract; he declared bankruptcy and then disappeared en route to Europe by ship. The Florida Land Boom was over, as were plans for a bridge.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the failure}} of Battlefield Earth and other films {{independently}} produced by Franchise Pictures, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI was probing [...] "the question of whether some independent motion picture companies have vastly inflated the budget of films {{in an effort to}} scam investors". In December 2000 the German-based Intertainment AG filed a lawsuit alleging that Franchise Pictures had fraudulently inflated budgets in films including Battlefield Earth, which Intertainment had helped to finance. Intertainment had agreed to pay 47% of the production costs of several films in exchange for European distribution rights, but ended <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> for between 60 and 90% of the costs instead. The company alleged that Franchise had defrauded it to the tune of over $75 million by systematically submitting [...] "grossly fraudulent and inflated budgets".|$|E
