50|$|A general {{parameter}} {{that indicates}} the formability and ductility of a material is the fracture strain which {{is determined by}} a uniaxial tensile test (see also fracture toughness).

Fracture strain is not an engineering strain since distribution of the deformation is inhomogeneous within the reference length. Fracture strain is nevertheless a rough indicator of the formability of a material.

30|$|Comparing {{the above}} facts {{with those from}} literature, the {{following}} are found: Sanders et al. [27] explained that larger grains would deform and work-harden, leading to the rounded shape {{at the beginning of}} the stress-strain curve and lower apparent yield strengths compared with the shape curves of GBM only and TOTAL processes. Meyers et al. [14] report that nanocrystalline and ultrafine-grained materials cannot generally sustain <b>uniform</b> tensile <b>elongation</b> and that the increased deviation from spherical grains that is exhibited in some cases comes, basically, from the inhibition of shear localization; the originations of the shape curves in the present report are different from the spherical value of 1. This fact by Meyers et al. [14] simply means that within the region of the RHPR and closer to amorphous materials, the grains are closer to a spherical shape, a fact that has been considered in this report since these shapes' plots start at values that are closer to 1. Meyers et al. [14] explain that GRC processes during grain refinement create larger paths for dislocation movement, causing homogeneous distribution (i.e. equiaxed grain structure) of dislocations which rearrange themselves into elongated dislocation cells; then, as deformation progresses, these cells become elongated subgrains, and finally, these break up into approximately equiaxed micrograins. Meyers et al. [14] further suggest that the relaxation of the broken-down elongated subgrains into an equiaxed microcrystalline structure can occur by minor rotations of the grain boundaries lying along the original elongated boundaries during grain growth.|$|R

ECAP processing was performed using route BC at different temperatures and number of passes, i. e. different processing severity conditions. The maximum load (Fmax) recorded during the last pass of each ECAP path considered {{in this study is}} a very good estimation of the processing severity. The mechanical properties were studied in terms of the balance between tensile strength and ductility. In the processed Al 7075 -O alloy, the grain size was reduced down to ∼ 150 nm. Consequently, tensile testing at room temperature revealed {{a significant increase in the}} maximum tensile strength after ECAP with respect to the as start material. In the present study, as the processing severity increases with the number of ECAP passes or with the decrease in processing temperature, there is a consistent trend of increment in ultimate tensile strength with minor decrease in <b>uniform</b> plastic <b>elongation</b> respect to the first ECAP pass at room temperature.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} two series of alloys were {{developed}} to obtain a combination of high strength, high ductility and work hardening. A new composition design strategy was proposed to create bulk metallic glass composites (BMGC) with high strength, large ductility and excellent work hardening from the brittle MgZnCa bulk metallic glass system. The volume fraction, size of both the dendrites and amorphous matrix can be effectively tuned by varying of the composition, and the yield strength, fracture strength and ductility also varies accordingly. The increase in alloying elements results {{in an increase in}} the volume fraction of amorphous matrix and a decrease in the dendrite size, which leads to higher yielding strength but lower ductility. The mechanical properties of the current Mg alloy can be interpreted by considering the BMGCs as a combination of the nanometer scale metallic glass matrix with a ductile dendritic structure. The high strength, large ductility and excellent work hardening observed in the Mg_(91. 5) Zn_(7. 5) Ca_ 1 {{can be attributed to the}} homogeneous deformation of nanometre scale amorphous matrices, which delays the formation and rapid propagation of microcracks from the interface.

Yield and tensile strengths, and <b>uniform</b> and total <b>elongations</b> all increased with increasing Si content. Therefore, the tensile strength and ductility balance was improved by Si addition due to the increasing strain-hardening rate. The fractured morphologies after hole-expansion showed that the excellent stretch-flangeability of FBDP steels was associated with the micro-cracks propagating through in ferrite phase as well as the elongated ferrite grains along the direction perpendicular to the crack. 0. 95 % Si steel had a similar high combination of tensile strength and impact toughness to 0. 55 % Si steel, and especially 0. 95 % Si steel exhibited an excellent combination of tensile strength and stretch-flangeability. <br /...|$|R
