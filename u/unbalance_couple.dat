In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. swing frame) of vertical dynamic balancing machine is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machine’s swing frame. The static <b>unbalance</b> and <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance</b> can be separated effectively by using the new dynamic balancing machine with the new swing frame. The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical dynamic balancing machine. The new dynamic balancing machine can measure static <b>unbalance</b> and <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance</b> directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical dynamic balancing machine is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machines, in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior. The vertical dynamic balancing machine with the new vibration structure can be widely used in the future application...|$|R

In this paper we present a methodology of using artificial neural networks (ANN) and frequency-domain vibration analysis to detect and classify common types of unbalances in rotating machines. Frequency domain features are used to train an artificial neural network. The artificial neural network is trained using back-propagation algorithm with a subset of experimental data obtained from a real-world rotating machine, Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS), for known types of unbalances. The trained artificial neural network is then used to classify various types of unbalances such as static <b>unbalance</b> and <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance.</b> The effectiveness of the neural network to classify these different types of unbalances is tested using the remaining set of data.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the study of a {{vibrating}} system forced by a rotating <b>unbalance</b> and <b>coupled</b> to a tuned mass damper (TMD). The analysis of the dynamic response of the entire system is used to define the parameters of such device in order to achieve optimal damping properties. The inertial forcing due to the rotating unbalance depends quadratically on the forcing frequency and it leads to optimal tuning parameters that differ from classical values obtained for pure harmonic forcing. Analytical results demonstrate that frequency and damping ratios, {{as a function of the}} mass parameter, should be higher than classical optimal parameters. The analytical study is carried out for the undamped primary system, and numerically investigated for the damped primary system. We show that, for practical applications, proper TMD tuning allows to achieve a reduction in the steady-state response of about 20 % with respect to the response achieved with a classically tuned damper.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Vibrations {{are found}} almost {{everywhere}} in rotating machines. Rotating machinery vibrates due to unbalances, misalignments and imperfect bearings. Vibrational analysis of rotating machinery {{is able to}} identify {{a large number of}} system ills. Shaft bow, shaft <b>unbalance</b> and <b>coupling</b> misalignments make up the major portion of the observed vibrational frequency spectra of rotating machinery. These vibrational spectra can be used to determine the type of rotating system abnormality. Unbalance is the most cause of machine vibration, an unbalanced rotor always cause more vibration and generates excessive force in the bearing area and reduces the life of the machine. In this paper, experimental studies were performed on a rotor to predict the unbalance in rotor. The vibration velocities were measured at five different speeds using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) at initial condition. Based on vibration readings spectrum analysis and phase analysis was carried out to determine the cause of high vibrations. By observing the spectrum unbalance was identified. Then Rotor was balanced and found that vibrations were reduced [...] The experimental frequency spectra were obtained for both balanced and unbalanced condition under different unbalanced forces at different speed conditions. This paper aims at the implementation of condition based maintenance on rotating machine, by adopting Vibration spectrum analysis which is a predictive maintenance technology. It eliminates unnecessary opening of equipment with considerable savings in personnel resources...|$|R
40|$|PaperPg. 113 - 129. Rotor {{unbalance}} {{remains one}} of the leading causes of deterioration and vibration of rotating machinery; but, if physical weight corrections can be made, many machines can be successfully balanced in-place with considerable savings in downtime and labor costs. In-place balancing can, however, pose some unique problems, and a prime concern is the time, expense, and wear and tear to simply start and stop the machine for trial data. Therefore, this paper is presented to provide guidelines for recognizing and overcoming some of the more common in-place balancing problems so that the number of balance runs can be kept to a minimum. Vibration analysis techniques are presented as the first step to verify that the problem is truly unbalance and not looseness, weakness, distortion, resonance, misalignment, eccentricity, or other problems which could be mistaken for unbalance. Problems such as repeatability, rotor sag, stratification, thermal distortion, load effects, rotor speed and other variables which can influence rotor balance are discussed. Measurement techniques and common sources of measurement error are also presented. The importance of identifying the type of rotor <b>unbalance</b> (static, <b>couple,</b> quasi-static, or dynamic) is presented along with a review of common single- and two-plane balancing procedures with emphasis on their suitability for in-place balancing. Methods are presented for determining suitable trial weights - both amount and position - to achieve the desired results. Finally, guidelines are presented for establishing realistic balance and vibration tolerances for rotors balanced in-place...|$|R

40|$|Many {{papers are}} {{available}} in literature about the identification of faults in rotor systems. However they generally deal with a fault only, usually an unbalance. Instead, in real machines, the case of multiple faults is quite common: the simultaneous presence of a bow (due to several different causes) and an <b>unbalance</b> or a <b>coupling</b> misalignment occurs often in rotor systems. In this paper a model based identification method for multiple faults is presented. The method requires {{the definition of the}} models of the elements that compose the system, i. e. the rotor, the bearings and the foundation, as well as the models of the faults, which can be represented by harmonic components of equivalent force or moment systems. The identification of multiple faults is made by a least square fitting approach in the frequency domain, by means of the minimization of a multidimensional residual between the vibrations in some measuring planes on the machine and the calculated vibrations due to the acting faults. Some numerical applications are reported for two simultaneous faults and some experimental results obtained on a test rig are used to validate the identification procedure.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} {{level of detail}} in wastewater treatment process models, oversimplified energy consumption models (i. e. constant 'average' power consumption) are being used in optimization exercises. A new dynamic model for a more accurate prediction of pumping costs in wastewater treatment has been developed to overcome this <b>unbalance</b> in the <b>coupled</b> submodels. The model is calibrated using two case studies. The first case study concerns the centrifugal influent pumps (Nijhuis RW 1 - 400. 525 A) of the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Eindhoven (The Netherlands), governed by Waterboard De Dommel. For the second case study, concerning a centrifugal pump (Flygt, type NT 3153. 181) of the intermediate pumping station (pumping primary treated wastewater) of the Mekolalde WWTP, located in Bergara (Guipuzcoa, Spain), a model extension was {{necessary in order to}} allow a better description of the pump curve, making the model more generic. Both cases showed good agreement between the model predictions and the measured data of energy consumption. The model is thus far more accurate compared with other approaches to quantify energy consumption, paving the way towards 'global' process optimization and new, improved control strategies for energy reduction at WWTPs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the mathematical models of flexible couplings in rotating mechanical systems in terms of their vibrational behavior. The residual <b>unbalance</b> of the <b>coupled</b> shafts is considered to be the main source of vibration in the rotating system. The moments and the frequencies of the forces, which result from these effects, are close to the natural frequencies of the mechanical system. Since the coupling {{is considered to be a}} flexible component in the power transmission system, it introduces a certain amount of mass, damping and stiffness to the system, influencing its natural frequencies. The present work shows the modeling of a mechanical rotor-bearing-coupling system, through the finite element method, used in this case to analyze the transverse vibrations of the system. Different modeling techniques were taken into account for this purpose. Such models are recommended for flexible couplings to analyze their influence on the natural frequencies of the system and on the unbalance response of the system. Afterwards, a model updating was carried out to fit the coupling stiffness and damping coefficients, using the minimum quadratic technique. Some sensitivity of the proposed models was observed in relation to the coupling parameters...|$|R

The present research shows an interesting development that the initial conditions are playing {{an important role in}} finding the nonlinear frequencies and this variation is strongly due to the presence of nonlinear geometric coupling.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the dynamic behaviour of a Jeffcott rotor was {{studied in the}} presence of pure static unbalance and nonlinear elastic restoring forces. The present paper extends the analysis to a rigid rotor with an axial length such as to make the transverse moment of inertia greater than the axial one. As in the previous investigation, the elastic restoring forces are assumed to be nonlinear and the effects of <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance</b> are also included but, unlike the Jeffcott rotor, the system exhibits six degrees-of-freedom. The Lagrangian coordinates were fixed so as to coincide with the three coordinates of the centre of mass of the rotor and the three angular coordinates needed in order to express the rotor''s rotations with respect to a reference frame having its origin in the centre of mass. The precession motions of such a rotor turn out to be cylindrical at low angular speeds and exhibit a conical aspect when operating at higher speeds. The motion equations of the rotor were written with reference to a system that was subsequently adopted for the experimental analysis. The particular feature of this system was the use of a steel wire (piano wire) for the rotor shaft, suitably constrained and with the possibility of regulating the tension of the wire itself, in order to increase or reduce the nonlinear character of the system. The numerical analysis performed with integration of the motion equations made it possible to point out that chaotic solutions were manifested only when the tension in the wire was given the lowest values – i. e. when the system was strongly nonlinear – {{in the presence of}} considerable damping and rotor unbalance values that were so high as to lose any practical significance. Under conditions commonly shared by analogous real systems characterised by poor damping, where the contribution to nonlinearity is almost entirely due to elastic restoring forces, the analysis pointed out that precession motions may be manifested with a periodic character, whether synchronous or not, or a quasi-periodic character, but in no case is the solution chaotic...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 93 - 102 Test stand {{vibration}} {{measurements on}} a partially loaded 54, 000 hp, parallel shaft, double helical speed increaser revealed synchronous resonant vibrations near normal operating speed. Further testing confirmed the lateral critical {{speed of the}} pinion was lower than originally designed due to modifications applied while the gear unit was in the test stand, which were aimed at lowering bearing pad operating temperatures under full load field conditions. The lateral critical speed was seen to increase as expected by sequentially removing the coupling spacer, adapter plate, and the hub. However, resulting vibration measurements showed a resonance remained near running speed. Impact testing pointed to a structural, resonant axial motion of the gear case near rated operating speed. Finite element analyses of the gear unit confirmed the existence of two structural resonances with endwall breathing mode shapes near pinion speed. Excitation {{of one of these}} modes was provided by <b>coupling</b> <b>unbalance</b> on the rotating pinion shaft that demonstrated cross-coupling of radial forces due to unbalance and axial structural motions. The near coincidence of the structural resonance and the lateral critical speed on the test stand provided vibration amplification above that normally expected due to either resonant condition alone. Amplification factors were moderate and significant overlap occurred between the flanks of the two resonances. A two-step solution was implemented to increase the resonant frequencies of both the shaft in its oil film bearings and the gear case end walls. First, a bearing clearance and preload modification were applied along with additional hot oil removal techniques. Second, a tie bar brace was added above and parallel to the pinion between the end walls of the upper section of the gear case to increase structural stiffness in an axial direction. Additional rotordynamic and finite element analyses predicted significantly improved response to unbalance. The bearing and structural modifications were installed and tested sequentially. These tests, under similar conditions as previously imposed on the unit for qualification and acceptance, were successful in proving the solution.
