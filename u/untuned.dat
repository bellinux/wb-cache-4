5|$|On Nothing, Meshuggah {{abandons}} {{the fast}} tempos of Chaosphere and concentrates on slow, tuned down tempos and grooves. The album {{was intended to}} be recorded using custom-made Nevborn eight-string guitars, but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and Hagström used detuned Ibanez seven-string guitars instead. This technique, which involved keeping the instruments <b>untuned</b> during the sessions, created additional problems. When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight-string guitars with two extra-low strings that worked properly after the initial release, the band re-recorded the guitar parts for Nothing and re-released it in 2006. Hagström notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on guitars.|$|E

According to Le Blanc (1985: 97, 140), this story's meaning revolves around a distinction between [...] "relative resonance" [...] when notes of the same pitch, such as the strings of two zithers tuned to the gong note, cause each other to vibrate in unison, and [...] "total resonance" [...] when an <b>untuned</b> note causes all 25 strings of a zither to resound simultaneously. The phenomenon of relative resonance, {{which is based on}} Yin-Yang theory, is experimentally verifiable; but the hypothesis (or [...] "super-experiment") of total resonance is not verifiable, and used as a simile pointing to a realm beyond Yin-Yang. Total resonance differs in kind, not in degree, from relative resonance. [...] "There is a difference of level. The author starts from a solid but meaningful empirical fact that displays resonance and, from there, analogizes to a metaphorical or metaphysical level where resonance is all-encompassing" [...] (Le Blanc 1985: 142).|$|E

Abel arrives and tries to persuade his brother to return to his family. Cain, struggling with conflicting feelings, urges his brother to leave (Duet: [...] "Cède à l'amitié d'un frère"). A violent storm arises and Cain strikes Abel dead with the club, before running off. Adam and the others enter and find Abel's body (Scene: [...] "Nous approchons de lui"). Initially, they think he is sleeping but Adam realises this is the first death in the world. Cain re-enters, racked with guilt, and admits the crime. He is driven to madness and flees to the mountains, followed by his wife and children. A chorus of angels appear and carry Abel off to Heaven (Chorus: [...] "Viens dans le sein de l'inno-cence").|$|E
2500|$|The avant-garde {{nature of}} Akita's work made {{acceptance}} by mainstream and unprepared [...] audiences difficult. When he performed with Kiyoshi Mizutani in 1988 at the Jazz-on-Amur festival in Khabarovsk, the Far East of USSR, his improvised, experimental electroacoustic set was praised by fellow musicians {{as well as}} the festival's producer. The number of the - jazz-oriented (and - even just curious) - crowd, however, had been expecting a more traditional (and much-much more quiet) performance, and started walking out. Prior to his second performance at the festival — which was to be made to an even more conservative audience— Akita was asked to play [...] "more musically." [...] On that first stage, Merzbow used the finest example of [...] "classical analogue live noisemaiking technologies" [...] to display: <b>untuned</b> guitar, a drumset, various micro-objects, small springs centered in its shell baffles, large aluminium boxes with strings inside to be attacked with a fiddlestick, etc. along with multi- piezo-pickuping and close-miking techniques, live processing through vintage US fuzz, ring modulator etc. boxes, and quite vivid and spontaneous approach, backed by domestically supplied slide and light shows. These live recordings were post-processed/re-mixed and released as Live in Khabarovsk, CCCP (I'm Proud by Rank of the Workers) LP – and as the (once more re-mixed comparing to the LP) CD 26 of the Merzbox later on.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the conductances and the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of double magnetic tunnel junctions, taking {{as a model}} example junctions composed of Fe/ZnSe/Fe/ZnSe/Fe (001). The calculations are done {{as a function of}} the gate voltage applied to the in-between Fe layer slab. We find that the application of a gate voltage to the in-between Fe slab strongly affects the junctions' TMR due to the tuning or <b>untuning</b> of conductance resonances mediated by quantum well states. The gate voltage allows a significant enhancement of the TMR, in a more controllable way than by changing the thickness of the in-between Fe slab. This effect may be useful in the design of future spintronic devices based on the TMR effect, requiring large and controllable TMR values.

60|$|Besides this {{difficulty}} with which I have struggled {{and made a}} shift to pass it ever, there is one remaining, which is insuperable to all translators. We are bound to our author's sense, though with the latitudes already mentioned; for I think it not so sacred as that one iota must not be added or diminished, on pain of an anathema. But slaves we are, and labour on another man's plantation; we dress the vineyard, but the wine is the owner's. If the soil be sometimes barren, then we are sure of being scourged; if it be fruitful, and our care succeeds, we are not thanked; for the proud reader will only say--the poor drudge has done his duty. But this is nothing to what follows; for being obliged to make his sense intelligible, {{we are forced to}} <b>untune</b> our own verses that we may give his meaning to the reader. He who invents is master of his thoughts and words: he can turn and vary them as he pleases, till he renders them harmonious. But the wretched translator has no such privilege, for being tied to the thoughts, he must make what music he can in the expression; and for this reason it cannot always be so sweet as that of the original. There is a beauty of sound, as Segrais has observed, in some Latin words, which is wholly lost in any modern language. He instances in that mollis amaracus, on which Venus lays Cupid in the first AEneid. If I should translate it sweet-marjoram, as the word signifies, the reader would think I had mistaken Virgil; for these village-words, as I may call them, give us a mean idea of the thing; but the sound of the Latin is so much more pleasing, by the just mixture of the vowels with the consonants, that it raises our fancies to conceive somewhat more noble than a common herb, and to spread roses under him, and strew lilies over him--a bed not unworthy the grandson of the goddess.|$|R

60|$|I do {{not know}} that the {{foregoing}} extracts ought not to be called my own rather than Mr. Biglow's, as, indeed, he maintained stoutly that my file had left nothing of his in them. I should not, perhaps, have felt entitled to take so great liberties with them, had I not more than suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself, a very near ancestor having written a Latin poem in the Harvard Gratulatio on the accession of George the Third. Suffice it to say, that, whether not satisfied with such limited approbation as I could conscientiously bestow, or from a sense of natural inaptitude, I know not, certain it is that my young friend could never be induced to any further essays in this kind. He affirmed that it was to him like writing in a foreign tongue,--that Mr. Pope's versification was like the regular ticking of one of Willard's clocks, in which one could fancy, after long listening, a certain kind of rhythm or tune, but which yet was only a poverty-stricken tick, tick after all,--and that he had never seen a sweet-water on a trellis growing so fairly, or in forms so pleasing to his eye, as a fox-grape over a scrub-oak in a swamp. He added I know not what, to the effect that the sweet-water would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves starched and ironed out, and that Pegāsus (so he called him) hardly looked right with his mane and tail in curl-papers. These and other such opinions I did not long strive to eradicate, attributing them rather to a defective education and senses <b>untuned</b> by too long familiarity with purely natural objects, than to a perverted moral sense. I was the more inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek, that his verses, as wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and point, had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner. So, only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name Pegasus, I left him to follow the bent of his natural genius.|$|E
6000|$|These {{towns of}} the Antipodes, {{not so great}} then as they are now, took an {{interest}} in the shipping, the running links with [...] "home," [...] whose numbers confirmed the sense of their growing importance. They made it part and parcel of their daily interests. This was especially the case in Sydney, where, from the heart of the fair city, down the vista of important streets, could be seen the wool- clippers lying at the Circular Quay--no walled prison-house of a dock that, but the integral part of one of the finest, most beautiful, vast, and safe bays the sun ever shone upon. Now great steam-liners lie at these berths, always reserved for the sea aristocracy--grand and imposing enough ships, but here to-day and gone next week; whereas the general cargo, emigrant, and passenger clippers of my time, rigged with heavy spars, and built on fine lines, used to remain for months together waiting for their load of wool. Their names attained the dignity of household words. On Sundays and holidays the citizens trooped down, on visiting bent, and the lonely officer on duty solaced himself by playing the cicerone--especially to the citizenesses with engaging manners and a well-developed sense of the fun that may be got out of the inspection of a ship's cabins and state-rooms. The tinkle of more or less <b>untuned</b> cottage pianos floated out of open stern-ports till the gas-lamps began to twinkle in the streets, and the ship's night-watchman, coming sleepily on duty after his unsatisfactory day slumbers, hauled down the flags and fastened a lighted lantern at the break of the gangway. The night closed rapidly upon the silent ships with their crews on shore. Up a short, steep ascent by the King's Head pub., patronized by the cooks and stewards of the fleet, the voice of a man crying [...] "Hot saveloys!" [...] at the end of George Street, where the cheap eating-houses (sixpence a meal) were kept by Chinamen (Sun-kum-on's was not bad), is heard at regular intervals. I have listened for hours to this most pertinacious pedlar (I wonder whether he is dead or has made a fortune), while sitting on the rail of the old Duke of S- (she's dead, poor thing! a violent death on the coast of New Zealand), fascinated by the monotony, the regularity, the abruptness of the recurring cry, and so exasperated at the absurd spell, that I wished the fellow would choke himself to death with a mouthful of his own infamous wares.|$|E
6000|$|It is but {{necessary}} that, after {{so much has}} been said of satire, some definition of it should be given. Heinsius, in his Dissertations on Horace, makes it for me in these words:- [...] "Satire {{is a kind of}} poetry, without a series of action, invented for the purging of our minds; in which human vices, ignorance, and errors, and all things besides which are produced from them in every man, are severely reprehended--partly dramatically, partly simply, and sometimes in both kinds of speaking, {{but for the most part}} figuratively and occultly; consisting, in a low familiar way, chiefly in a sharp and pungent manner of speech, but partly also in a facetious and civil way of jesting, by which either hatred or laughter or indignation is moved." [...] Where I cannot but observe that this obscure and perplexed definition, or rather description of satire, is wholly accommodated to the Horatian way, and excluding the works of Juvenal and Persius as foreign from that kind of poem. The clause in the beginning of it, [...] "without a series of action," [...] distinguishes satire properly from stage-plays, which are all of one action and one continued series of action. The end or scope of satire is to purge the passions; so far it is common to the satires of Juvenal and Persius. The rest which follows is also generally belonging to all three, till he comes upon us with the excluding clause, [...] "consisting, in a low familiar way of speech" [...] which is the proper character of Horace, and from which the other two (for their honour be it spoken) are far distant. But how come lowness of style and the familiarity of words to be so much the propriety of satire that without them a poet can be no more a satirist than without risibility he can be a man? Is the fault of Horace to be made the virtue and standing rule of this poem? Is the grande sophos of Persius, and the sublimity of Juvenal, to be circumscribed with the meanness of words and vulgarity of expression? If Horace refused the pains of numbers and the loftiness of figures are they bound to follow so ill a precedent? Let him walk afoot with his pad in his hand for his own pleasure, but let not them be accounted no poets who choose to mount and show their horsemanship. Holyday is not afraid to say that there was never such a fall as from his odes to his satires, and that he, injuriously to himself, <b>untuned</b> his harp. The majestic way of Persius and Juvenal was new when they began it, but it is old to us; and what poems have not, with time, received an alteration in their fashion?--"which alteration," [...] says Holyday, [...] "is to after-times as good a warrant as the first." [...] Has not Virgil changed the manners of Homer's heroes in his AEneis? Certainly he has, and for the better; for Virgil's age was more civilised and better bred, and he writ according to the politeness of Rome under the reign of Augustus Caesar, not to the rudeness of Agamemnon's age or the times of Homer. Why should we offer to confine free spirits to one form when we cannot so much as confine our bodies to one fashion of apparel? Would not Donne's satires, which abound with so much wit, appear more charming if he had taken care of his words and of his numbers? But he followed Horace so very close that of necessity he must fall with him; and I may safely say it of this present age, that if we are not so great wits as Donne, yet certainly we are better poets.|$|E

[...] But you, like Pallas, ev'ry limb infold [...] With royal robes, and bid him shine in gold; [...] Touched by your hand his manly frame improves [...] 65 [...] With grace divine, and like a god he moves. [...] Ev'n I, the meanest of the muses' train, [...] Inflamed by thee, attempt a nobler strain; [...] Advent'rous waken the Mæonian lyre, [...] Tuned by your hand, and sing as you inspire: [...] 70 [...] So armed by great Achilles for the fight, [...] Patroclus conquered in Achilles' right: [...] Like theirs, our friendship! and I boast my name [...] To thine united--for thy friendship's fame. [...] This labour past, of heav'nly subjects sing, [...] 75 [...] While hov'ring angels listen on the wing, [...] To hear from earth such heart-felt raptures rise, [...] As, when they sing, suspended hold the skies: [...] Or nobly rising in fair virtue's cause, [...] From thy own life transcribe th' unerring laws: [...] 80 [...] Teach a bad world beneath her sway to bend: [...] To verse like thine fierce savages attend, [...] And men more fierce: when Orpheus tunes the lay, [...] Ev'n fiends relenting hear their rage away.|$|E
6000|$|Say, lovely youth,[2] that dost {{my heart}} command, [...] Can Phaon's eyes forget his Sappho's hand? [...] Must then her name the wretched writer prove, [...] To thy remembrance lost, as to thy love? [...] Ask {{not the cause}} that I new numbers choose, [...] 5 [...] The lute neglected, and the lyric muse;[3] [...] Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow. [...] And tuned my heart to elegies of woe. [...] I burn, I burn, as when through ripened corn [...] By driving winds the {{spreading}} flames are borne![4] [...] 10 [...] Phaon to Ætna's scorching fields retires, [...] While I consume with more than Ætna's fires![5] [...] No more my soul a charm in music finds; [...] Music has charms alone for peaceful minds.[6] [...] Soft scenes of solitude no more can please, [...] 15 [...] Love enters there, and I'm my own disease. [...] No more the Lesbian dames my passion move, [...] Once the dear objects of my guilty love; [...] All other loves are lost in only thine, [...] Ah youth ungrateful to a flame like mine! [...] 20 [...] Whom would not all those blooming charms surprise, [...] Those heav'nly looks, and dear deluding eyes? [...] The harp and bow would you like Phoebus bear, [...] A brighter Phoebus Phaon might appear; [...] Would you with ivy wreathe your flowing hair, [...] 25 [...] Not Bacchus' self with Phaon could compare: [...] Yet Phoebus loved, and Bacchus felt the flame, [...] One Daphne warmed, and one the Cretan dame;[7] [...] Nymphs that in verse no more could rival me, [...] Than ev'n those gods contend in charms with thee.[8] [...] 30 [...] The muses teach me all their softest lays, [...] And the wide world resounds with Sappho's praise. [...] Though great Alcæus more sublimely sings, [...] And strikes with bolder rage the sounding strings, [...] No less renown attends the moving lyre, [...] 35 [...] Which Venus tunes, and all her loves inspire; [...] To me what nature has in charms denied, [...] Is well by wit's more lasting flames supplied. [...] Though short my stature, yet my name extends [...] To heav'n itself, and earth's remotest ends. [...] 40 [...] Brown as I am, an Ethiopian dame[9] [...] Inspired young Perseus with a gen'rous flame; [...] Turtles and doves of diff'ring hues unite, [...] And glossy jet is paired with shining white. [...] If to no charms thou wilt thy heart resign, [...] 45 [...] But such as merit, such as equal thine, [...] By none, alas! by none thou can'st be moved, [...] Phaon alone by Phaon must be loved! [...] Yet once thy Sappho could thy cares employ, [...] Once in her arms you centered all your joy: [...] 50 [...] No time the dear remembrance can remove, [...] For oh! how vast a memory has love?[10] [...] My music, then, you could for ever hear, [...] And all my words were music to your ear. [...] You stopped with kisses my enchanting tongue, [...] 55 [...] And found my kisses sweeter than my song.[11] [...] In all I pleased, but most in what was best; [...] And the last joy was dearer than the rest.[12] [...] Then with each word, each glance, each motion fired, [...] You still enjoyed, and yet you still desired, [...] 60 [...] Till all dissolving in the trance we lay, [...] And in tumultuous raptures died away. [...] The fair Sicilians now thy soul inflame; [...] Why was I born, ye gods, a Lesbian dame? [...] But ah! beware, Sicilian nymphs! nor boast [...] 65 [...] That wand'ring heart which I so lately lost; [...] Nor be with all those tempting words abused, [...] Those tempting words were all to Sappho used. [...] And you that rule Sicilia's happy plains, [...] Have pity, Venus,[13] on your poet's pains! [...] 70 [...] Shall fortune still in one sad tenor run, [...] And still increase the woes so soon begun? [...] Inured to sorrow from my tender years, [...] My parent's ashes drank my early tears; [...] My brother next, neglecting wealth and fame, [...] 75 [...] Ignobly burned in a destructive flame:[14] [...] An infant daughter late my griefs increased, [...] And all a mother's cares distract my breast.[15] [...] Alas! what more could fate itself impose, [...] But thee, the last and greatest of my woes? [...] 80 [...] No more my robes in waving purple flow, [...] Nor on my hand the sparkling diamonds glow; [...] No more my locks in ringlets curled diffuse [...] The costly sweetness of Arabian dews, [...] Nor braids of gold the varied tresses bind, [...] 85 [...] That fly disordered with the wanton wind: [...] For whom should Sappho use such arts as these? [...] He's gone, whom only she desired to please! [...] Cupid's light darts my tender bosom move, [...] Still is there cause for Sappho still to love: [...] 90 [...] So from my birth the sisters fixed my doom, [...] And gave to Venus all my life to come; [...] Or, while my muse in melting notes complains, [...] My yielding heart keeps measure to my strains. [...] By charms like thine which all my soul have won, [...] 95 [...] Who might not--ah! who would not be undone? [...] For those Aurora Cephalus[16] might scorn, [...] And with fresh blushes paint the conscious morn. [...] For those might Cynthia lengthen Phaon's sleep, [...] And bid Endymion[17] nightly tend his sheep. [...] 100 [...] Venus for those had rapt thee to the skies, [...] But Mars on thee might look with Venus' eyes. [...] O scarce a youth, yet scarce a tender boy! [...] O useful time for lovers to employ! [...] Pride of thy age, and glory of thy race, [...] 105 [...] Come to these arms, and melt in this embrace! [...] The vows you never will return, receive; [...] And take at least the love you will not give.[18] [...] See, while I write, my words are lost in tears![19] [...] The less my sense, the more my love appears. [...] 110 [...] Sure 'twas not much to bid one kind adieu, [...] (At least to feign was never hard to you,)[20] [...] Farewell, my Lesbian love, you might have said; [...] Or coldly thus, [...] "Farewell, O Lesbian maid!" [...] No tear did you, no parting kiss receive, [...] 115 [...] Nor knew I then how much I was to grieve. [...] No lover's gift your Sappho could confer,[21] [...] And wrongs and woes were all you left with her. [...] No charge I gave you, and no charge could give, [...] But this, [...] "Be mindful of our loves, and live." [...] 120 [...] Now by the Nine, those pow'rs adored by me, [...] And Love, the god that ever waits on thee, [...] When first I heard (from whom I hardly knew) [...] That you were fled, and all my joys with you, [...] Like some sad statue[22], speechless, pale I stood, [...] 125 [...] Grief chilled my breast, and stopped my freezing blood; [...] No sigh to rise, no tear had pow'r to flow, [...] Fixed in a stupid lethargy of woe: [...] But when its way th' impetuous passion found, [...] I rend my tresses, and my breast I wound; [...] 130 [...] I rave, then weep; I curse, and then complain; [...] Now swell to rage, now melt in tears again. [...] Not fiercer pangs distract the mournful dame, [...] Whose first-born infant feeds the fun'ral flame. [...] My scornful brother with a smile appears, [...] 135 [...] Insults my woes, and triumphs in my tears; [...] His hated image ever haunts my eyes; [...] "And why this grief? thy daughter lives," [...] he cries. [...] Stung with my love, and furious with despair,[23] [...] All torn my garments, and my bosom bare, [...] 140 [...] My woes, thy crimes, I to the world proclaim; [...] Such inconsistent things are love and shame! [...] 'Tis thou art all my care and my delight, [...] My daily longing, and my dream by night:[24] [...] Oh night more pleasing than the brightest day, [...] 145 [...] When fancy gives what absence takes away, [...] And, dressed in all its visionary charms, [...] Restores my fair deserter to my arms! [...] Then round your neck in wanton wreaths I twine, [...] Then you, methinks, as fondly circle mine: [...] 150 [...] A thousand tender words I hear and speak; [...] A thousand melting kisses give, and take:[25] [...] Then fiercer joys, I blush to mention these, [...] Yet, while I blush, confess how much they please. [...] But when, with day, the sweet delusions fly, [...] 155 [...] And all things wake to life and joy, but I, [...] As if once more forsaken, I complain, [...] And close my eyes to dream of you again:[26] [...] Then frantic rise, and like some fury rove [...] Through lonely plains,[27] and through the silent grove, [...] 160 [...] As if the silent grove, and lonely plains, [...] That knew my pleasures, could relieve my pains. [...] I view the grotto, once the scene of love, [...] The rocks around, the hanging roofs above, [...] That charmed me more, with native moss o'ergrown, [...] 165 [...] Than Phrygian marble, or the Parian stone; [...] I find the shades that veiled our joys before; [...] But, Phaon gone, those shades delight no more.[28] [...] Here the pressed herbs with bending tops betray [...] Where oft entwined in am'rous folds we lay; [...] 170 [...] I kiss that earth which once was pressed by you, [...] And all with tears the with'ring herbs bedew. [...] For thee the fading trees appear to mourn, [...] And birds defer their songs till thy return: [...] Night shades the groves, and all in silence lie, [...] 175 [...] All but the mournful Philomel and I: [...] With mournful Philomel I join my strain, [...] Of Tereus she, of Phaon I complain.[29] [...] A spring there is, whose silver waters show, [...] Clear as a glass, the shining sands below: [...] 180 [...] A flow'ry lotos spreads its arms above, [...] Shades all the banks, and seems itself a grove; [...] Eternal greens the mossy margin grace, [...] Watched by the sylvan genius of the place: [...] Here as I lay, and swelled with tears the flood,[30] [...] 185 [...] Before my sight a wat'ry virgin stood: [...] She stood and cried, [...] "O you that love in vain! [...] Fly hence, and seek the fair Leucadian main; [...] There stands a rock, from whose impending steep [...] Apollo's fane surveys the rolling deep; [...] 190 [...] There injured lovers, leaping from above, [...] Their flames extinguish, and forget to love.[31] [...] Deucalion once with hopeless fury burned, [...] In vain he loved, relentless Pyrrha scorned: [...] But when from hence he plunged into the main, [...] 195 [...] Deucalion scorned, and Pyrrha loved in vain. [...] Haste, Sappho, haste, from high Leucadia throw [...] Thy wretched weight, nor dread the deeps below!"[32] [...] She spoke, and vanished with the voice--I rise, [...] And silent tears fall trickling from my eyes. [...] 200 [...] I go, ye nymphs! those rocks and seas to prove; [...] How much I fear, but ah, how much I love! [...] I go, ye nymphs, where furious love inspires; [...] Let female fears submit to female fires. [...] To rocks and seas I fly from Phaon's hate, [...] 205 [...] And hope from seas and rocks a milder fate. [...] Ye gentle gales, beneath my body blow, [...] And softly lay me on the waves below![33] [...] And thou, kind Love, my sinking limbs sustain, [...] } [...] Spread thy soft wings, and waft me o'er the main, [...] } [...] 210 [...] Nor let a lover's death the guiltless flood profane! [...] } [...] On Phoebus' shrine my harp I'll then bestow, [...] And this inscription shall be placed below, [...] "Here she who sung, to him that did inspire, [...] Sappho to Phoebus consecrates her lyre; [...] 215 [...] What suits with Sappho, Phoebus, suits with thee; [...] The gift, the giver, and the god agree." [...] But why, alas, relentless youth, ah! why [...] To distant seas must tender Sappho fly?[34] [...] Thy charms than those may far more pow'rful be, [...] 220 [...] And Phoebus' self is less a god to me.[35] [...] Ah! canst thou doom me to the rocks and sea, [...] Oh! far more faithless and more hard than they? [...] Ah! canst thou rather see this tender breast [...] Dashed on these rocks, than to thy bosom pressed? [...] 225 [...] This breast which once, in vain! you liked so well;[36] [...] Where the loves played, and where the muses dwell. [...] Alas! the muses now no more inspire, [...] <b>Untuned</b> my lute, and silent is my lyre. [...] My languid numbers have forgot to flow, [...] 230 [...] And fancy sinks beneath a weight of woe. [...] Ye Lesbian virgins, and ye Lesbian dames, [...] Themes of my verse, and objects of my flames, [...] No more your groves with my glad songs shall ring, [...] No more these hands shall touch the trembling string: [...] 235 [...] My Phaon's fled, and I those arts resign: [...] (Wretch that I am, to call that Phaon mine!)[37] [...] Return, fair youth, return, and bring along [...] Joy to my soul, and vigour to my song: [...] Absent from thee, the poet's flame expires; [...] 240 [...] But ah! how fiercely burn the lover's fires! [...] Gods! can no prayers, no sighs, no numbers move [...] One savage heart, or teach it how to love? [...] The winds my prayers, my sighs, my numbers bear,[38] [...] The flying winds have lost them all in air! [...] 245 [...] Oh when, alas! shall more auspicious gales [...] To these fond eyes restore thy welcome sails![39] [...] If you return--ah why these long delays? [...] Poor Sappho dies, while careless Phaon stays. [...] O launch the bark, nor fear the wat'ry plain; [...] 250 [...] Venus for thee shall smooth her native main. [...] O launch thy bark, secure of prosp'rous gales; [...] Cupid for thee shall spread the swelling sails.[40] [...] If you will fly--(yet ah! what cause can be, [...] Too cruel youth, that you should fly from me?) [...] 255 [...] If not from Phaon I must hope for ease, [...] Ah let me seek it from the raging seas: [...] To raging seas unpitied I'll remove, [...] And either cease to live or cease to love! ...|$|E
