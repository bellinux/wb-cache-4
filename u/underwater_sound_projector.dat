40|$|Abstract- An <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> {{has been}} {{recently}} developed for operation {{over a decade}} long frequency range. The output of the projector has been designed for 10 kHz to 100 kHz operation on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The transducer is resonant at 100 kHz but {{has been designed to}} deliver high sound pressure levels without impedance or phase instabilities. The transducer features the f i rs t successful s tacking of 1 - 3 piezocomposite materials. The selection of the 1 - 3 piezocomposite materials has resulted in the mode-free sound output while the stacking arrangement permits acoustic operation with twice the sound output at half the resonance frequency of a single layer. The stacking is done mechanically in series and electrically in parallel with the center electrode as the positive plane. Furthermore, the center electrode has been segmented into four individual elements such that combinations of the sectors offer the ability to access nine different apertures. I...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{consolidation}} (LC) is a {{computer-aided manufacturing}} process that builds a functional net-shape part {{directly from a}} CAD model, {{without the use of}} moulds or dies. The folded shell projector (FSP) is a compact flextensional <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> developed by DRDC-Atlantic for low frequency sonar applications. The radiating surface of the FSP is a thin-walled shell of complex shape that challenges conventional manufacturing technologies. In this study, several versions of the FSP were designed using DRDC-Atlantic's MAVART finite element code. NRC-IMTI refined the laser consolidation process and successfully manufactured the complex shells from IN- 625 and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys. The laser consolidated net-shape shells are metallurgically sound and exhibit excellent surface finish, dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties. Field tests of FSP prototypes demonstrated that the shells met their design goals of resonant frequency and source level. Other manufacturing methods for building the shells (hydro-forming and Ni vapor deposition) were also explored. However, at the moment, the laser consolidation process is the only manufacturing technology capable of making the FSP shell to the required tolerances. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of pool drawdown each fall and winter to enhance flood storage, numerous fish are lost through the bottom sluices of Allegheny Reservoir (located on the western border of Pennsylvania and New York). The sudden release of pressure accompanying the passage of these fish from a deep zone of the reservoir into the tailrace {{can result in a}} substantial fish kill. The conditions under which fish are lost apparently are enhanced when the pool level is low and discharge is high. In an effort to reduce these losses, underwater broadcasts of recorded sound effects were tested. The <b>sound</b> <b>projector</b> was a low-frequency transducer mounted above the bottom sluices on the upstream face of the dam. While the sound broadcasts were being evaluated, the Corps of Engineers maintained a higher winter pool at the project to test the effect of controlled flow releases on ice formation at downriver locations.

This will have benefits in combatting global climate change, however, the technology may have local negative effects on the environment. A key concern is the potential for underwater noise pollution.

A wave energy converter (WEC; BOLT Lifesaver, Fred Olsen Ltd.) was deployed at the Falmouth Bay marine renewable energy test site (FaBTest).

40|$|For {{a proper}} (national) {{implementation}} of the European Unionâ€™s ambitious Marine Strategy Framework Directive, it is required {{that the impact of}} anthropogenic activities on the North Sea environment is assessed thoroughly. One {{of the effects of the}} use of the North Sea by humans is the generation of <b>underwater</b> <b>sound.</b> Sound propagates over longer distances in water than in air. The impact of anthropogenic <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> sources could therefore be serious. At this time, there is insufficient information on the <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> environment in the North Sea to make an impact assessment. The information on anthropogenic sources of <b>underwater</b> <b>sound,</b> i. e. the sound characteristics and source levels, is by no means complete. Once this information becomes available, the next challenge is to predict correctly how the sound propagates in the shallow water of the North Sea, i. e. to find out the sound footprint of individual anthropogenic or natural sources of sound. The research reported on in this document aims at making an inventory of the existing knowledge on the <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> environment and identifying the gaps. In the next steps towards an impact assessment, there is insufficient information on the physiology and behaviour of the marine fauna of the North Sea. There is also a lack of knowledge on the effects of the various anthropogenic sources of sound on the ecosystem of the North Sea, both individually and cumulatively...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the rapid}} {{extension}} of offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to improve our knowledge on possible adverse effects of <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> generated by pile-driving. Mortality and injuries have been observed in fish exposed to loud impulse sounds, but knowledge on the sound levels at which (sub-) lethal effects occur is limited for juvenile and adult fish, and virtually non-existent for fish eggs and larvae. A device was developed in which fish larvae can be exposed to <b>underwater</b> <b>sound.</b> It consists of a rigid-walled cylindrical chamber driven by an electro-dynamical <b>sound</b> <b>projector.</b> Samples of up to 100 larvae can be exposed simultaneously to a homogeneously distributed sound pressure and particle velocity field. Recorded pile-driving sounds could be reproduced accurately in the frequency range between 50 and 1000 Hz, at zero to peak pressure levels up to 210 dB re 1 ÂµPa 2 (zero to peak pressures up to 32 kPa) and single pulse sound exposure levels up to 186 dB re 1 ÂµPa 2 s. The device {{was used to examine}} lethal effects of sound exposure in common sole (Solea solea) larvae. Different developmental stages were exposed to various levels and durations of pile-driving sound. The highest cumulative sound exposure level applied was 206 dB re 1 ÂµPa 2 s, which corresponds to 100 strikes at a distance of 100 m from a typical North Sea pile-driving site. The results showed no statistically significant differences in mortality between exposure and control groups at sound exposure levels which were well above the US interim criteria for non-auditory tissue damage in fish. Although our findings cannot be extrapolated to fish larvae in general, as interspecific differences in vulnerability to sound exposure may occur, they do indicate that previous assumptions and criteria may need to be revise...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLarge raindrops (greater than 2. 2 mm diameter) that strike a water surface at terminal velocity {{are capable of}} creating bubbles that radiate significant underwater acoustical energy. Previous studies have revealed positive correlation between <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> spectral levels during rainfall {{and the number of}} large raindrops present. Therefore, laboratory measurements have been made of the <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> generated by large raindrops. Using the laboratory measurements, smoothed energy density spectra for various sizes of large raindrops are determined. These spectra are then used to compute a predicted <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> spectrum due to rainfall for rainfall rates of 15 mm/hr and 100 mm/hr, assuming an exponential (Marshall-Palmer) raindrop size distribution. The resulting spectra are compared to <b>underwater</b> <b>sound</b> spectra measured at sea during periods with similar rainfall rates. The predicted rainfall spectra are comparable to the measured rainfall spectra. Possible reasons for differences are discussed.
