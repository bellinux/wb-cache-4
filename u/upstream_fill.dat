5000|$|Enlarged Big Sand Wash Reservoir — The {{enlargement}} of the Big Sand Wash Reservoir (by raising {{the level of the}} dam and associated dikes and saddle dams) will provide additional water storage capacity and regulation capability. The enlarged reservoir will allow for the storage of water that had been stored in the High Mountain Lakes. This transfer also results in improved instream flow in certain reaches of the Lake Fork River and its principal tributary—the Yellowstone River. The water stored in the enlarged reservoir will serve irrigation and M&I purposes. Increasing the height of the new dam is being accomplished by removing about two-thirds of the downstream side of the old dam, excavating a new keyway immediately downstream of the remaining structure, constructing the new dam, and integrating the remnants of the old dam into the <b>upstream</b> <b>fill</b> of the new, taller structure.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Management {{of small}} dams may have {{profound}} {{implications for the}} health and integrity of small rivers and freshwater diversity. Global indicators suggest future growth in the small hydropower sector, particularly in developing countries. As a renewable energy source, it is often presumed that small hydropower entails fewer and less severe negative externalities than those associated with development of larger hydropower facilities. However, as very little study exists investigating {{the cumulative effect of}} small‐scale hydrodevelopment on ecological and social systems, limited data is available to substantiate this assumption. To enhance understanding of small hydropower effects, I present a comprehensive comparison of biophysical consequences of small and large hydropower stations in Nujiang Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China. My comparison indicates that cumulative ecological effects of small hydropower development may equal or exceed those associated with development of large hydropower. Because negligible adverse effects are anticipated, small hydropower projects often are characterized by reduced project oversight, streamlined permitting processes, relaxed requirements for environmental impact assessment and mitigation, and increased opportunity for international support relative to large hydropower projects. Outcomes from my comparison of small and large hydropower stations in Nujiang Prefecture and synthesis of available study from diversion‐design facilities suggest that current policies allowing less rigorous standards of impact assessment for the small hydropower sector should be reevaluated. Further study is necessary to optimize management that minimizes the consequences of small hydropower and to create effective policies encouraging low‐impact development of renewable energy sources. With regard to decommissioning of small dams, the restoration potential of small rivers impounded by reservoirs filled with coarse sediment may outweigh the likelihood of detrimental dam‐removal effects. After removal of the Brownsville Dam from the Calapooia River, Oregon, aquatic habitats directly below the dam became more heterogeneous over the short term, while changes further downstream were virtually undetectable. As the Brownsville Dam stored coarse rather than fine sediments, outcomes following removal differ from results of many prior dam removal studies. As current conceptual ideas of dam removal effects are largely informed by study of low‐gradient systems transporting finer sediments, I propose a refined conceptual model describing downstream geomorphic processes following small dam removal when <b>upstream</b> <b>fill</b> is dominated by coarse sediments. Dam removal monitoring studies challenge many basic assumptions of conventional experimental designs and data analysis techniques, thus the quality of information available to aid decision making may often be questionable or misleading. To assist managers in undertaking dam removal monitoring, I also discuss assets and limitations of monitoring and analysis options available for dam removal studies, with emphasis on selecting a rigorous experimental design and determining significance of results...|$|E

Introduction Jupiter and Saturn offer convenient environments to implement the knowledge of the magnetosheath turbulence obtained at the Earth.

40|$|Large-Scale Simulation {{results of}} the {{transition}} of a gas-liquid stratified flow to slug flow regime in circular 3 D oil transport pipes under turbulent flow conditions expressed. Free surface flow in the pipe is treated using the Level Set method. Turbulence is approached via the LES and VLES methodologies extended to interfacial two-phase flows. It is shown that only with the Level Set method the flow transition can be accurately predicted, better than with the two-fluid phase-average model. The transition from stratified to slug flow {{is found to be}} subsequent to the merging of the secondary wave modes created by the action of gas shear (short waves) with the first wave mode (high amplitude long wave). The model is capable of predicting global flow features like the onset of slugging and slug speed. In the second test case, the model predicts different kinds of slugs, the so-called operating slugs formed <b>upstream</b> that <b>fill</b> entirely the pipe with water slugs of length scales of the order of 2 - 4 D, and lower size (1 - 1. 5 D) disturbance slugs, featuring lower hold-up (0. 8 - 0. 9). The model predicts well the frequency of slugs. The simulations revealed important parameter effects on the results, such as two-dimensionality, pipe length, and water holdup...|$|R

There exists the possibility that the operator may forget to close a valve located <b>upstream</b> of the <b>filling</b> hose, which is a crucial part of the procedure; if overlooked, this could result in adverse consequences, of greater effect to the operator in control. The primary human error of concern in this situation is ‘failure to close V0204 prior to decoupling filling hose’. The decoupling operation required to be conducted is a fairly easy task to carry out and does not require to be completed in conjunction with any further tasks; therefore is failure occurs it will have a catastrophic impact as opposed to displaying effects in a gradual manner.|$|R

A qualitative study of the biodiversity of mosquito fauna was conducted in a relic natural creek bottom habitat inherent to the Kiwanis Nature Trail located in the College Hills residential area of College Stations Texas between Gilchrist and Francis Streets. During the different seasons ex-tending over a period beginning February 1993 and ending in March 1995, adult and larval mosquito specimens were collected, identified, and correlated with various habitat types occurring at the study site. Three main breeding areas were identified within the relic urban natural study site. These included shaded woodland, open grassland, and seasonal creek bottom areas. The woodland areas of the site contained depressions in the soil which served as floodwater-holding sites after heavy rains. The open grassland areas also contained various depressions and irregularities which served as floodwater-holding sites. The creekbed which passed through the wooded area frequently acted as a floodwater-holding site depending on rainfall, local irrigation runoff, and influxes of water from upstream. A total of 43 mosquito species were collected at the RUN site either as larvae, adults, or nth over the two year study period. As for the seasonal dynamics of larval mosquito populations occurring at the RUN site, larvae of floodwater species such as Aedes vexans Meigen and Ae. canadensls (Theobald), usually appeared first in the early spring after heavy rainfall followed by standing-water-breeders such as Culex salinarius Coquillett and Cx. restuans Theobald. This same sequence occurred in the various floodwater sites each time rains were sufficient to till the deeper depressions located in each of the areas studied at the site. After dry periods, such as occur in the slimmer, the cheeked would support the larva of floodwater species such as the aforementioned Ae. Texans when inundated by local runoff from rain or local water usage in the urban surrounding. These creekbed sites would then subsequently support standing-water-breeding species such as Cx. quinquefasciatus until such time that sites dried up. When water from <b>upstream</b> <b>filled</b> the creek, mosquito larva were at times found not to occur in the cheeked water. This was thought to be, in part, due to the influx of predatory minnows identified as Gambusia affinis brought into the study site via the water coming from upstream and in part, to some flushing out of the larval populations present in the creaked site before the upstream flooding occurred. Results {{of this study indicate that}} RUN sites do have great potential for supporting a large diversity of mosquito species in Central Texas; and creekbeds (especially those containing water only intermittently) in such settings can be prime larval development sites for both floodwater and standing water mosquito species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Four big tectonic plates: Lut, Caspian, Arabian and Persian tectonic plates {{across the}} region covered the whole of Iran. The faults on the country have caused severe dangers during {{earthquakes}}. These earthquakes may cause many damages, which are considerable within the important structures. An embankment dam is one but important of them and may lead to large financial losses, floods and mortality {{in the case of}} failure. During Earthquake, one of the main dangers that threaten an embankment is liquefaction. The phenomenon of liquefaction summarized as loose of saturated sands, gravels, or silts having a contractive structure and it may occur when such materials are subjected to earthquake`s shear deformations due to increasing pore water pressure. Liquefaction induced ground deformation and building settlements were severe and widespread during the 1990 Manjil, Iran earthquake [1]. But the first fundamental observation of damages attributed to liquefaction was made in the 1964 Niigata, Japan and 1964 Alaska, North America earthquakes. At the present paper, first, we study the phenomenon of liquefaction, parameters and also it’s affecting factors; then, we study effects of liquefaction on Sattarkhan embankment dam (East Azarbaijan Province-Iran) which is constructed on Aharchay basin/river using the yield and liquefaction strength ratios; next, our data will be modeled by a computer program. The yield strength ratio is used for correct prediction the occurrence of liquefaction in the <b>upstream</b> hydraulic <b>fill</b> of the dam and the liquefaction shear strength ratio is used for accurate prediction of the subsequent flow failure for up and downstream slopes...|$|R
30|$|A {{framework}} {{known as}} the waste input–output (WIO) model, which specifically analyses waste types and treatment flows using an extended IOT method, was developed by Nakamura and Kondo (2002, 2009). Using the WIO model, Nakamura and Kondo (2006) evaluated the economic and environmental impacts of waste treatment methods and recycling of electrical appliances in Japan. The WIO model was subsequently applied to calculate waste multipliers and footprints in Australia (Fry et al. 2016; Lenzen and Reynolds 2014; Reynolds et al. 2014). This study offers an alternative approach, by using a MU-hLCA framework where waste flows can be represented in physical units, and specific products including, but not limited to, by-products and recycled products can be distinguished without necessitating the manual disaggregation of IO sectors. This is because the process table already contains disaggregated flows with the resolution to represent specific products. The framework is compiled by integrating a comprehensive Australian-specific LCI database with a monetary supply-and-use table (SUT) in order to draw information regarding the physical input recipe and the associated emissions of producing a single unit of waste or recycled product. Physical MFA data (that represent the quantity of economy-scale flows of waste or recycled products) replace monetary flows in the IOT in the downstream cut-off (Cd) matrix (refer to S 3.1. 3) that connects the IOT with the LCI database, and the missing <b>upstream</b> inputs are <b>filled</b> in the <b>upstream</b> cut-off (Cu) matrix (refer to S 3.1. 4) (Fig.  5).|$|R
40|$|Deep erosional gullies dissect landscapes {{around the}} world. Existing erosion models focus on {{predicting}} where gullies {{might begin to}} erode, but identifying where existing gullies were initiated and under what conditions is difficult, especially when historical records are unavailable. Here we outline a new approach for fingerprinting alluvium and tracing it back to its source by combining bulk sediment optically stimulated luminescence (bulk OSL) and meteoric 10 Be (10 Bem) measurements made on gully-derived alluvium samples. In doing so, we identify where gully erosion was initiated and infer {{the conditions under which}} such erosion occurred. As both 10 Bem and bulk OSL data have distinctive depth profiles in different uneroded and depositional settings, we are able to identify the likely incision depths in potential alluvium source areas. We demonstrate our technique at Birchams Creek in the southeastern Australian Tablelands—a well-studied and recent example of gully incision that exemplifies a regional landscape transition from unchanneled swampy meadow wetlands to gully incision and subsequent wetland burial by post-European settlement alluvium. We find that such historic alluvium was derived from a shallow erosion of valley <b>fill</b> <b>upstream</b> of former swampy meadows and was deposited {{down the center of the}} valley. Incision likely followed catchment deforestation and the introduction of livestock, which overgrazed and congregated in valley bottoms in the early 20 th century during a period of drought. As a result, severe gully erosion was likely initiated in localized, compacted, and oversteepened reaches of the valley bottom...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the fundamental phenomena governing the electrochemical machining process. It excludes a detailed investigation of the electrochemistry of the anode surface, work on which is in hand at the University of Nottingham. Photographs have been obtained of both electrode surfaces during machining in a two dimensional channel, showing the important role of gas evolution both at currents below the limit and in limiting the current density achievable. The distribution of electrical potential across the gap has been measured, clearly showing that the limiting current phenomenon is governed by a process occurring very close to the cathode. Measurements have been made of the streamwise current distribution; the distribution is essentially uniform at low currents, but as the limit is approached the current at the downstream end falls, and this fall then propagates <b>upstream</b> to <b>fill</b> about two-thirds of the channel. It has been found that the limiting current is proportional to (absolute pressure) ^ 1 / 3, that the size of bubbles produced is inversely proportional to (absolute pressure) ^ 1 / 3, and that reduction of the surface tension of the electrolyte leads to a marked fall in limiting current. The efficiency of the process has been investigated by a technique involving the measurement of the gas evolved during machining. An analysis of these results leads to the formulation of an explanation of the cell voltage-current characteristic, a hypothesis to explain the current limiting process, and a suggestion of the detailed mechanism of the latter. The cell voltage-current curve (above) can be explained as follows: - AB is equilibrium dissolution with etching, BC is caused by the formulation of a solid (impure oxide?) film on the anode surface. The rise in current from C to D is caused by the anodic evolution of a gas (oxygen?), causing better mixing conditions in the diffusion layer near the anode and hence a higher metal dissolution rate. The ratio of current used for metal dissolution to current used for gas evolution appears to be a constant for this region. This process would be expected to continue along DE, but the current is limited by the achievement of a maximum rate of cathodic hydrogen evolution which brings about the reduction in current to F. This limiting current crisis has been analysed in terms of the mechanics of bubble formation, and a detailed explanation in terms of various mechanisms has been attempted. The experimental data is fitted by a model in which the hydrodynamic conditions give a velocity at which bubbles can be removed from a fixed number of nucleation sites. The limiting current is then predicted to be proportional to (surface tension) ^ 2 x (absolute pressure) ^ 1 / 3. Several proposals are made for further experiments to investigate these proposals, and for data needed to extend the industrial application of the theory developed...|$|R
40|$|Study of {{the main}} {{channels}} of an ephemeral discontinuous stream shows the presence of pool-riffle morphology scoured into underlying Holocene muds. Pools are defined as starting {{at the point of}} maximum bed slope and reaching half the distance downstream to the next point of maximum bed slope. Pool-riffle morphology correlates well with high-stage hydraulics. Channel fill along pools is subject to hydraulicjump scour during intermediate-stage flows. Pools are preferentially scoured during high-stage discharges with flow completely in the tranquil flow regime. During large-stage flows, channel fill is almost completely washed away and the variable slope of the exposed mud subfloor is found to show negative exponential correlation to energy gradients, sediment transport, and shear. Reaches of steep bed slope and low shear become the locus of kinematic particle interference and gravel deposition during recession from high stages. During low-stage flow, relationships between bed slope and energy expenditure are the reverse of those during high-stage flow. Evidence indicates that certain discontinuous streams and their fans evolve to braid chute units along gullies comprising steep slope, braided channels upstream of a single-channeled chute of low slope. During large discharges, shear and sediment transport are higher along chutes, causing net scour of channel fill. This fill is stored along the braided channels of the next braid-chute downstream. During low-stage flows, the reverse occurs. Thus, the braid-chute functions as a morphologic unit to maintain evenness of sediment transport in an environment of variable flow sizes. Long-term sediment-budget deficit is indicated by gradual scour of channel subfloors. In all braid-chutes, the bed slope of the braid is greater than the slope of the flood surface, and both are greater than the bed slope of the chute. Along chutes, average low-stage energy slopes approximately equal bed slopes. As stages rise, energy slopes increase with increasing discharge so that at bankfull stages, they approximate the flood-surface slopes. This relationship allows the inference of a feedback link between channel slopes and flood-surface slopes along a chute. Along braided channels, energy slopes decrease with increasing stage. Hypothetically, the contrasting energy-gradient changes with discharge could produce a system in which bankfull stages are reached simultaneously along the entire braid-chute. Data for discontinuous streams indicate that they may be analogous to noncontinuous braided perennial streams. Braided reaches in such perennial streams may be correlated to the alluvial fans below discontinuous channels. Straight and sinuous perennial channels between braided reaches may be analogous to the discontinuous channel. Bed slopes of the discontinuous channel and its analogues are flatter than those of adjoining flood surfaces. This contrast in gradients brings flow close {{to the level of the}} flood plain at some point downstream where the flow can begin to spread laterally onto this surface. In the ephemeral environment, this downstream branching usually takes place over a riffle. The fan, which lies below the studied discontinuous stream, contains braided-channel flow, mixed channel flow and sheetflow, and sheetflow, respectively, in a down-fan direction. It is postulated that a low water to sediment discharge ratio over a long time span would produce net deposition in the fan as well as in the discontinuous channel upstream. This, in turn, would force the fanhead to migrate <b>upstream</b> over the <b>filling</b> channel. Valley alluviation, thus caused by a discontinuous stream, would construct an elongate, tabular body of sediments composed of coarse channel deposits at the base overlain by laterally extensive channel sands and sheetflood sands. Above these, there would be finer grained sheetflood silts...|$|R
