2500|$|Gingrich {{stressed}} {{efficient use}} of warfighting resources. When he took over Task Force 95, he discovered that his ships were firing 51,700 rounds of 5-inch ammunition per month, mostly in <b>unobserved</b> <b>fire.</b> Worried about the massive expenditure, Gingrich insisted that targets be observed to evaluate {{the effect of the}} bombardment. [...] "I wanted to know specifically what damage was done, not that 'great damage' was done." [...] The resulting improvement in targeting efficiency reduced the monthly firing rate to 15,000 rounds, representing a savings of approximately $40,000,000 {{over the course of a}} year. [...] "The cost of a 5-inch shell at the end of the Korean pipeline was approximately $200," [...] he noted, so [...] "unless it did that much damage, we were hurting ourselves more than the enemy." ...|$|E
40|$|Excessive unobserved {{firepower}} expenditures by Allied forces {{during the}} Vietnam War defied the traditional counterinsurgency principle that population protection should be valued more than {{destruction of the}} enemy. Many historians have pointed to this discontinuity in their arguments, but none have examined the available firepower records in detail. This study compiles and analyzes available, artillery-related U. S. and Allied archival records to test historical assertions about the balance between conventional and counterinsurgent military strategy as it changed over time. It finds that, between 1965 and 1970, the commanders of the U. S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), Generals William Westmoreland and Creighton Abrams, shared significant continuity of strategic and tactical thought. Both commanders tolerated U. S. Army, Marine Corps, and Allied unobserved firepower at levels inappropriate for counterinsurgency and both reduced Army harassment and interdiction fire (H&I) {{as a response to}} increasing budgetary pressure. Before 1968, the Army expended nearly 40 percent of artillery ammunition as H&I ? a form of <b>unobserved</b> <b>fire</b> that sought merely to hinder enemy movement and to lower enemy morale, rather than to inflict any appreciable enemy casualties. To save money, Westmoreland reduced H&I, or ?interdiction? after a semantic name change in February 1968, to just over 29 percent of ammunition expended in July 1968, the first full month of Abrams? command. Abrams likewise pursued dollar savings with his ?Five-by-Five Plan? of August 1968 that reduced Army artillery interdiction expenditures to nearly ten percent of ammunition by January 1969. Yet Abrams allowed Army interdiction to stabilize near this level until early 1970, when recurring financial pressure prompted him to virtually eliminate the practice. Meanwhile, Marines fired H&I at historically high rates into the final months of 1970 and Australian ?Harassing Fire? surpassed Army and Marine Corps totals during the same period. South Vietnamese artillery also fired high rates of H&I, but Filipino and Thai artillery eschewed H&I in quiet areas of operation and Republic of Korea [ROK] forces abandoned H&I in late 1968 as a direct response to MACV?s budgetary pressure. Financial pressure, rather than strategic change, drove MACV?s unobserved firepower reductions during the Vietnam War...|$|E

50|$|From 26 September 1966 to 9 October 1966, the {{battalion}} supported the brigade Operation Sioux City with 2 organic 105mm batteries and a 155mm reinforcing battery from 2-25 Field Artillery. On 26 September, 3-319 departed Bien Hoa and moved by road on Route Blue to Position Fox, with Battery C firing landing zone preparations {{in support of}} 1-503’s air assault on Position Mohawk, {{and then on to}} Position Mohawk. While in Position Fox, a ¼-ton truck from {{the battalion}} hit a mine. Two vehicles (the other from E/17th Cavalry) were destroyed by mines in Position Fox, resulting in three US wounded. On 1 October, Battery C reported 2 incoming hand grenades and returned fire with M79 grenade launchers. There were no US casualties and unknown results of the M79 fire. On 6 October, the battalion returned to Position Fox, reporting laid and ready to fire at 1258hrs. On 9 October, the brigade terminated Operation Sioux City and the battalion returned to Bien Hoa by road convoy. Over the course of the operation, the battalion fired 8,611 rounds on 1,280 missions. <b>Unobserved</b> <b>fires</b> prevented a good assessment of the artillery’s effectiveness, although the brigade After Action Report noted that enemy fire stopped “in all cases” when artillery was employed during contacts.|$|R

But Florence was not there to look on; and Good Mrs Brown remained unrecognised, and sat staring at her <b>fire,</b> <b>unobserved.</b>|$|R
50|$|After his War College graduation, McNair was {{assigned}} as assistant commandant of the Field Artillery Center and School. In this position, {{he worked with}} the school's Gunnery Department to address field artillery doctrine issues that had lingered since World War I, including limited mobility, inadequate communications, and overly detailed fire direction techniques. Recognizing that continuing improvement to innovations including machine guns and tanks made the static trench warfare of World War I unlikely to be repeated, successive Gunnery Department directors Jacob Devers, Carlos Brewer, and Orlando Ward experimented with new techniques, including increasing the speed of artillery support to mobile armor and infantry by empowering Artillery-qualified fire support officers attached to those formations to direct artillery fire, and enhancing accuracy through artillery fire {{that could be seen}} and directed by forward observers rather than the <b>unobserved</b> timed <b>fire</b> and rolling barrages that had prevailed in World War I. McNair supported these innovations, and prevented interference from senior officers who tried to block them.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{intercept}} Kondo's force, Halsey, who was low on undamaged ships, detached two battleships, the [...] and , and four destroyers from the Enterprise task force. The U.S. force, {{under the command}} of Willis A. Lee aboard the Washington, reached Guadalcanal and Savo Island just before midnight on 14 November, shortly before Kondo's bombardment force arrived. Kondo's force consisted of the Kirishima plus two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and nine destroyers. After the two forces made contact, Kondo's force quickly sank three of the U.S. destroyers and heavily damaged the fourth. The Japanese warships then sighted, opened fire, and damaged the South Dakota. As Kondo's warships concentrated on the South Dakota, the Washington approached the Japanese ships <b>unobserved</b> and opened <b>fire</b> on the Kirishima, smashing into the Japanese battleship repeatedly with both main and secondary battery shells, and causing fatal damage. After fruitlessly chasing the Washington towards the Russell Islands, Kondo ordered his warships to retire without bombarding Henderson Field. One of Kondo's destroyers was also sunk during the engagement.|$|R
