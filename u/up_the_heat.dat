25|$|For the Wednesday {{night game}} at the Big 10's Ohio State, the Cougars looked to have finally found their scoring touch, even if the defense started out on shaky, wet ground. OSU's first shot was a rocket off a {{crossing}} pass that was too fast for Dal Santo to reach, giving the Buckeyes the 1–0 lead in the 8th minute. Ten minutes later, Ebbesen headed a midfield pass to former Buckeye Solawa, who fired it through to Jambga, who was racing toward the goal and fired a 16-foot shot {{into the back of}} the net, upping the score to 1–1. On a 27th minute corner kick, an OSU header, only their second shot on goal, eluded Dal Santo to put the home team back in the lead 2–1. As the clock wound down on the first half, the Cougars earned a corner kick of their own; on a classic Kendall-Moullin high-pass-to-a-leaping-crowd, Gabe Christianson headed the ball into the net with 7 seconds remaining, for a 2–2 score on his first goal since November 2, 2013 after missing two seasons with injuries. The Buckeyes tried to turn <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> in the second half, but the Cougar defense returned to its stalwart form, with Dal Santo making three strong saves.As the end of regulation time neared, McHugh sent a back-heel pass to Jambga, who shot hard and low toward the far post from fifteen yards out with one minute left on the clock for what would be the game winner.|$|E
500|$|Other {{writers were}} less enthusiastic. [...] Q {{magazine}} {{felt that the}} song was weak and that [...] "Bono falls back on his old habit of trying to be 'inspirational' by banging <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> from simmer to meltdown between the verse and chorus." [...] U2 chroniclers Bill Graham and Caroline van Oosten de Boer also see the song as {{a throwback to the}} group's earlier sound, but say that [...] "the band doesn't sufficiently develop the initial idea to warrant the five minutes of 'Ultra Violet'".|$|E

Ash Dosanjh of New Musical Express said that Cruz's downfall was when he acts the player, as on [...] "Break Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Dirty Picture". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said Cruz was [...] "proficient but generic" [...] in the song, but his [...] "autotuned vocals could have been anyone's, and this facelessness is a problem Cruz rarely surmounts." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy {{said that the}} song [...] "perfectly embodies Cruz's infectious, dancefloor-friendly sound and sleek, immaculate production", and compares it to Jason Derülo and Akon.|$|E

500|$|Superior Publishers, however, {{defied the}} ban, while also {{moving into the}} U.S. market. Watchdogs turned <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat,</b> and in 1953 a {{distributor}} {{was found guilty of}} distributing obscenities. Some of Superior's titles found themselves in Fredric Wertham's notorious and influential diatribe on the influence comics had on juvenile delinquency, Seduction of the Innocent, published in 1954. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, established in 1953, had public hearings a few months later, and called upon Kamloops. BC Member of Parliament E. Davie Fulton, one of Superior publisher William Zimmerman's most outspoken enemies, as a witness. The Comics Code Authority was soon formed, and Superior, like fellow American publisher EC Comics, saw their sales dwindle throughout 1955. Prosecutions increased throughout Canada, with Superior successfully defending themselves in one, and another supposedly comics-related murder was reported in Westville, Nova Scotia. Superior shut its doors in 1956, and until the 1970s, English Canadian newsstand comic book publishing was no more, although a number of [...] "giveaway" [...] comics continued to be produced by Orville ' [...] Productions and Owen McCarron's Comic Book World, who produced the educational and cautionary comics for governments and corporations, aimed at kids and teens.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Keith Caulfied of Billboard deemed it as a [...] "very dance-by-the-numbers with Madonna" [...] song, and further assessed that the chorus made [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] a memorable song. Robbie Daw from Idolator said that [...] "Madge [...] doing [...] {{what she does}} best: turning <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> on the dance floor," [...] but that [...] "the song is packed with tried-but-true sexual pop cliches." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone rated it three out of five stars. He commended the singer for the electro and Europop composition of the track, describing it as [...] "buoyant and warm-rinse soothing. It's {{the sound of a}} woman who hits the dance-floor for restoration more than craziness." [...] Haigh from Attitude believed that [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] should have been released as the lead single from MDNA. He felt that the track [...] "screams" [...] early 1990s Madonna's work, and complimented it for being a [...] "basic, balls-to-the-wall night out anthem", adding [...] "why does that have to be something that's considered 'below' Madonna?" [...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from the same magazine praised the [...] "pop stomper" [...] track, writing: [...] "The production might sound like she's been listening to a fair bit of Rihanna, but who's counting. Madonna brings her own authority, creating the kind of anthemic party song that she does best, the kind where everyone from your three-year-old niece to your 60-year-old mother gets up on the dancefloor." [...] MTV News journalist Bradley Stern felt that the composition emulated her single [...] "Celebration" [...] (2009).|$|E

2500|$|Spiral heat {{exchangers}} {{are often used}} in the heating of fluids that contain solids and thus tend to foul {{the inside of the}} heat exchanger. The low pressure drop lets the SHE handle fouling more easily. The SHE uses a “self cleaning” mechanism, whereby fouled surfaces cause a localized increase in fluid velocity, thus increasing the drag (or fluid friction) on the fouled surface, thus helping to dislodge the blockage and keep the heat exchanger clean.

2500|$|Liquid nitrogen, {{supplied}} in pressurized steel bottles, {{is sometimes}} used in similar fashion. In this case, boiling {{is enough to}} provide a powerful refrigerating effect. For years this has been done (in limited applications) by flooding the work zone. Since 2005, this mode of coolant has been applied in a manner comparable to MQL (with through-the-spindle and through-the-tool-tip delivery). This refrigerates the body and tips of the tool {{to such a degree}} that it acts as a [...] "thermal sponge", sucking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> from the tool–chip interface.

Raised Catholic, Hitler retained some regard for the organisational power of the Church, but had utter contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, [...] "would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure".

A threatening, though initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover. The regime agreed the Reichskonkordat Treaty with the Vatican, which prohibited clergy from participating in politics. The Concordat, wrote William Shirer, [...] "was hardly put to paper before it was being broken by the Nazi Government". On 25 July, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law, an offensive policy {{in the eyes of the}} Catholic Church. Five days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or [...] "immorality". In the face of this persecution, Pope Pius XI issued his Mit brennender Sorge Encyclical, which denounced the pagan ideology of Nazism. In response, hundreds more clergy were arrested and sent to the concentration camps.|$|E

Since the load-carrying wires are in proximity, when they <b>heat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> is shared across the wires, limiting the overall current load they can support.
