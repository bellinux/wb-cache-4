40|$|We {{solve the}} force-free {{equation}} J x B = 0 for fields which are toroidally symmetric. The technique utilizes an expansion about a cylindrical field {{and is therefore}} valid or tori with a large aspect ratio such as long, thin, coronal loops. The calculation is performed in spatial toroidal coordinates, {{rather than in the}} flux coordinates used by previous authors; this allows direct calculation of the loci of flux surfaces and of surfaces of constant magnetic pressure. Our solutions differ significantly from toroidal fields in laboratories, which are in general not force-free. They are characterized by field lines whose projections in the poloidal planes are circles with centers displaced by varying distances from the axis of the torus. In general, flux surfaces do not correspond to surfaces of constant magnetic pressure. We have examined solutions corresponding to simple analytic zero-order cylindrical fields. For moderate twists in the zero-order (cylindrical) field, the magnetic pressure is larger on the inner toroidal radius. However, this effect diminishes with twist angle and in fact, for extreme initial twists, the magnetic pressure can be larger on the outer radius.

Current experimental methods do not allow direct determination of the global metabolic state of a bacterial pathogen in vivo, but the transcriptional activity of all encoded genes has been investigated in numerous microarray studies. We describe a novel algorithm, Differential Producibility Analysis (DPA) that uses a metabolic network to extract metabolic signals from transcriptome data.

DPA successfully extracts metabolic signals that correspond to experimental data and provides novel metabolic insights. We next apply DPA to investigate the metabolic response of M. tuberculosis to the macrophage environment, human sputum and a range of in vitro environmental perturbations. The analysis revealed a previously unrecognized feature of the response of M. tuberculosis to the macrophage environment: a down-regulation of genes influencing metabolites in central metabolism and concomitant up-regulation of genes that influence synthesis of cell wall components and virulence factors.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{studies to}} assess reactivity margins and loading curves for {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) burnup-credit criticality safety evaluations. The studies {{are based on a}} generic high-density 32 -assembly cask and systematically vary individual calculational (depletion and criticality) assumptions to demonstrate the impact on the predicted effective neutron multiplication factor, k{sub eff}, and burnup-credit loading curves. The purpose of this report is to provide a greater understanding of the importance of input parameter variations and quantify the impact of calculational assumptions on the outcome of a burnup-credit evaluation. This study should provide guidance to regulators and industry on the technical areas where improved information will most enhance the estimation of accurate subcritical margins. Based on these studies, areas where future work may provide the most benefit are identified. The report also includes an evaluation of the degree of burnup credit needed for high-density casks to transport the current spent nuclear fuel inventory. By comparing PWR discharge data to actinide-only based loading curves and determining the number of assemblies that meet the loading criteria, this evaluation finds that additional negative reactivity (through either increased credit for fuel burnup or cask design/utilization modifications) is necessary to accommodate the majority of current spent fuel assemblies in high-capacity casks. Assemblies that are not acceptable for loading in the prototypic high-capacity cask may be stored or transported by other means (e. g., lower capacity casks that <b>utilize</b> <b>flux</b> traps and/or increased fixed poison concentrations or high-capacity casks with design/utilization modifications) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Dysregulated muscle {{metabolism}} is a cardinal feature of human insulin resistance (IR) and associated diseases, including {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D). However, specific reactions contributing to abnormal energetics and metabolic inflexibility in IR are unknown. Methods: We <b>utilize</b> <b>flux</b> balance computational modeling to develop the first systems-level analysis of IR metabolism in fasted and fed states, and varying nutrient conditions. We systematically perturb the metabolic network to identify reactions that reproduce key features of IR-linked metabolism. Results: While reduced glucose uptake is a major hallmark of IR, model-based reductions in either extracellular glucose availability or uptake do not alter metabolic flexibility, and thus are not sufficient to fully recapitulate IR-linked metabolism. Moreover, experimentally-reduced flux through single reactions does not reproduce key features of IR-linked metabolism. However, dual knockdowns of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), in combination with reduced lipid uptake or lipid/amino acid oxidation (ETFDH), does reduce ATP synthesis, TCA cycle flux, and metabolic flexibility. Experimental validation demonstrates robust impact of dual knockdowns in PDH/ETFDH on cellular energetics and TCA cycle flux in cultured myocytes. Parallel analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomics data in humans with IR and T 2 D demonstrates downregulation of PDH subunits and upregulation of its inhibitory kinase PDK 4, both {{of which would be}} predicted to decrease PDH flux, concordant with the model.

40|$|About {{one-half}} of the global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation accumulates in the atmosphere, where it contributes to global warming. The rest is taken up by vegetation and the ocean. The precise contribution of the two sinks, and their location and year-to-year variability are, however, not well understood. We use two different approaches, batch Bayesian synthesis inversion and variational data assimilation, to deduce the global spatiotemporal distributions of CO 2 fluxes during 2009 - 2010. One of our objectives is to assess different sources of uncertainties in inferred fluxes, including uncertainties in prior flux estimates and observations, and differences in inversion techniques. For prior constraints, we <b>utilize</b> <b>fluxes</b> and uncertainties from the CASA-GFED model of the terrestrial biosphere and biomass burning driven by satellite observations and interannually varying meteorology. We also use measurement-based ocean flux estimates and two sets of fixed fossil CO 2 emissions. Here, our inversions incorporate column CO 2 measurements from the GOSAT satellite (ACOS retrieval, filtered and bias-corrected) and in situ observations (individual flask and afternoon-average continuous observations) to estimate fluxes in 108 regions over 8 -day intervals for the batch inversion and at 3 x 3. 75 weekly for the variational system. Relationships between fluxes and atmospheric concentrations are derived consistently for the two inversion systems using the PCTM atmospheric transport model driven by meteorology from the MERRA reanalysis. We compare the posterior fluxes and uncertainties derived using different data sets and the two inversion approaches, and evaluate the posterior atmospheric concentrations against independent data including aircraft measurements.
