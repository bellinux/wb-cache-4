5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E
5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licences to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b> When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E
25|$|During the Greek period, {{the style}} of {{winemaking}} changed. Ripe grapes were first dried to concentrate the sugars, and these then produced a much sweeter and higher alcohol content wine {{that needed to be}} diluted with water to be drinkable. Before this, watered-down wine was disparaged, but {{by the time of the}} Talmud, wine that did not require dilution with water was considered <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another type of {{communal}} prayer group, favored by some contemporary Jews, is the Chavurah (חבורה, pl. chavurot, חבורות), or prayer fellowship. These groups {{meet at a}} regular place and time, either in a private home or in a synagogue or other institutional space. In antiquity, the Pharisees lived near each other in chavurot and dined together to ensure {{that none of the}} food was <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methanol is the {{simplest}} alcohol, being only a methyl group {{linked to a}} hydroxyl group. It is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor {{very similar to that}} of ethanol (drinking alcohol). However, unlike ethanol, methanol is highly toxic and <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b> At room temperature, it is a polar liquid. It is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethanol. It is also used for producing biodiesel by transesterification reaction.|$|E
25|$|Poundland were fined £24,000 in June 2012 {{following}} {{an investigation of}} a store in Croydon, London. Council inspectors found poor hygiene, mouse infestation and food contaminated by mice chewing open the packaging and leaving droppings and urine inside, which were then re-sealed and sold to the public. Poundland admitted failing to withdraw food <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption,</b> failing to control mice and failing to ensure the store was well maintained and clean. Additionally they admitted to failure to implement and maintain its own food safety management system.|$|E

25|$|After picking, {{the leaves}} of C. sinensis soon begin to wilt and oxidize unless {{immediately}} dried. An enzymatic oxidation process triggered by the plant's intracellular enzymes causes the leaves to turn progressively darker as their chlorophyll breaks down and tannins are released. This darkening is stopped at a predetermined stage by heating, which deactivates the enzymes responsible. In the production of black teas, halting by heating is carried out simultaneously with drying. Without careful moisture and temperature control during manufacture and packaging, growth of undesired molds and bacteria may make tea <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1970s, {{budget deficits}} rose {{considerably}} and domestic prices widely diverged {{from the world}} prices, while production prices averaged 2% higher than consumer prices. Many premium goods could be bought only in special stores using foreign currency generally inaccessible to most Eastern Bloc citizens, such as Intershop in East Germany, [...] Beryozka in the Soviet Union, Pewex in Poland, Tuzex in Czechoslovakia and Corecom in Bulgaria. [...] Much of what was produced for the local population never reached its intended user, while many perishable products became <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> before reaching their consumers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notion of}} {{untouchability}} {{seems to have}} emerged in the Sangam period itself with references from the work indicating water touched by pulaiyar being considered <b>unfit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> of higher caste.

5000|$|The {{river is}} 12.5 km long, {{draining}} 583 km2 and dropping 200 m in elevation between source and mouth. The river course cuts through heavily built-up areas of Panama City, subjecting it to both industrial and residential pollution.

50|$|Water markets may be {{appropriate}} {{where there are no}} or inefficient rules established to govern groundwater use. Because groundwater is generally available to anyone who sinks a well and pumps, water tables worldwide have fallen precipitously in the last several decades.
