Documentation on the prevalence and patterns of this maternal practice in the Zimbabwean setting was also lacking. Methods A cross sectional survey of 248 women at selected health centres in Harare was carried out to address the need for such data using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results Fifty-two (52 %) (95 % C. I. 44 %- 60 %) of the participants reported to have used at least one traditional medicine intervention during the third trimester of their most recent pregnancy to induce labour, avoid perineal tearing and improve the safety of their delivery process. The study found prenatal <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> to be significantly associated with nulliparity and nulligravidity. Such practice was also significant among participants residing in a particular high density suburb located in close proximity to informal traders of traditional medicines. Prenatal traditional medicine use was not significantly linked to experiencing an obstetrics-related adverse event. Instead, participants who reported not using any traditional medicine during pregnancy reported experiencing significantly more adverse events, mainly perineal tearing during delivery. Conclusions The practice of prenatal <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> was significant in the study setting, with a prevalence of 52 %.

40|$|HIV-infected {{people may}} present with co-infections, comorbidities, and side effects {{associated}} with antiretroviral therapy. This study explored {{the prevalence of}} comorbid health problems and determined {{the extent of the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> for treatment of co-infections, comorbidities of HIV infection and side effects. A cross sectional study, using researcher-administered questionnaires, was carried out among HIV-infected patients in eight public sector healthcare facilities in KwaZulu-Natal between April and October 1024. Self-reports of comorbidities, co-infections and side effects were analyzed with respect to factors such as age, gender, race, and health care seeking behavior including the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine.</b> Cross-tabulations were conducted to test the association between factors and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine,</b> using Pearson chi-squared (χ 2) test. Simple and multiple logistic regression models tested the association of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> with age, gender, race, side effects and comorbidities. Odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were estimated. Missing values were handled, defined and treated as missing values in the final analysis. Overall, 29. 5 % (n = 516) of the survey participants reported having other comorbidities and or co-infections besides their HIV condition. Same participants reported two or more comorbidities. Almost forty percent of participants (208 / 531, 39. 17 %) reported having hypertension as the most noninfectious comorbidity while 21. 65 % of participants (115 / 531) had tuberculosis accounting for the most infectious comorbidity. Almost eight percent of participants (142 / 1748, 8. 12 %) reported using traditional medicine after starting with cART. Sixty out of 142 participants (60 / 142, 42. 25 %) on cART resorted to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> for the management of comorbidities and or co-infections of their HIV infection. Overall, 311 out of 1748 participants (17. 80 %) complained of ARVs related side-effects. Forty-five percent of those with side-effects (141 / 311, 45. 34 %) reported taking various types of medicines for treating side-effects, with 90. 07 % of them (127 / 141) using medicines prescribed by biomedically trained doctors or by pharmacy personnel as over-the -counter medicines, p < 0. 001. Very few participants (14 / 141, 9. 93 %) resorted to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> for treating side effects associated with antiretroviral therapy with no significant difference (p= 0. 293). In a multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for age, gender, race and side-effects due to antiretroviral therapy, odds for using traditional medicine were almost two times higher [odds ratio = 1. 884, 95 % Confidence Interval 1. 317 - 2. 695] with those participants having comorbidities and co-infections, with a significant difference p-value< 0. 001. Comorbidities, co-infections and side effects are prevalent among HIV-infected patients attending public sector healthcare facilities. Odds of using traditional medicine were almost two times higher and significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities and co-infections than for other factors. The presence of such comorbid health problems does not explain the increased <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. Findings from this study should be interpreted cautiously as they cannot be generalized to the entire population of HIV-infected patients in KwaZulu-Natal.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> are one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{important}} means of achieving total health care coverage globally, and their importance in Tanzania extends beyond the impoverished rural areas. Their use remains high even in urban settings among the educated middle and upper classes. They are a critical component healthcare in Tanzania, but they also can have harmful side effects. Therefore we sought to understand the decision-making and reasoning processes by building an explanatory model for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> in Tanzania. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study between December 2013 and June 2014 in the Kilimanjaro Region <b>of</b> Tanzania. <b>Using</b> purposive sampling methods, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews of key informants, and the qualitative {{data were analyzed using}} an inductive Framework Method. A structured survey was created, piloted, and then administered it to a random sample of adults. We reported upon {{the reliability and validity of}} the structured survey, and we used triangulation from multiple sources to synthesize the qualitative and quantitative data. Results: A total of five FGDs composed of 59 participants and 27 in-depth interviews were conducted in total. 16 of the in-depth interviews were with self-described traditional practitioners or herbal vendors. We identified five major thematic categories that relate to the decision to use <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> in Kilimanjaro: healthcare delivery, disease understanding, credibility <b>of</b> the <b>traditional</b> practices, health status, and strong cultural beliefs. A total of 473 participants (24. 1 % male) completed the structured survey. The most common reasons for taking <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> were that they are more affordable (14 %, 12. 0 - 16. 0), failure of hospital medicines (13 %, 11. 1 - 15. 0), they work better (12 %, 10. 7 - 14. 4), they are easier to obtain (11 %, 9. 48 - 13. 1), they are found naturally or free (8 %, 6. 56 - 9. 68), hospital medicines have too many chemical (8 %, 6. 33 - 9. 40), and they have fewer side effects (8 %, 6. 25 - 9. 30). The most common <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> were for symptomatic conditions (42 %), chronic diseases (14 %), reproductive problems (11 %), and malaria and febrile illnesses (10 %). Participants currently taking hospital medicines for chronic conditions were nearly twice as likely to report <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> usage in the past year (RR 1. 97, p= 0. 05). Conclusions: We built broad explanatory model for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> in Kilimanjaro. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> is not limited to rural or low socioeconomic populations and concurrent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicines</b> and biomedicine is high with frequent ethnomedical doctor shopping. Our model provides a working framework for understanding the complex interactions between biomedicine and <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine.</b> Future disease management and treatment programs will benefit from this understanding, and it can lead to synergistic policies with more effective implementation.

MethodsA cross sectional prospective study using pretested structured questionnaires administered on 430 patients with antiretroviral therapy attending the AKTH between April and June 2009. Data was collected on socio-demographic characteristics, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>medicine</b> and attitude to antiretroviral therapy. ResultsA mean age of (33. 6 # 20381; 8. 4) years old was found with 67. 2 % females and 32. 8 % males.
