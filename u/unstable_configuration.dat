At Yasogami High School in Inaba, during the culture festival, a strange bell rings, trapping the Investigation Team inside a bizarre alternate version of the school.

Along the way, SEES and the Investigation Team realize that they come from two different time periods.|$|E
50|$|Robert Gilpin's Hegemonic {{stability}} theory also {{draws upon}} {{the idea of}} polarity, specifically the state of unipolarity. Hegemony is the preponderance of power at one pole in the international system, and the theory argues this is a stable configuration because of mutual gains by both the dominant power {{and others in the}} international system. This is contrary to many neorealist arguments, particularly made by Kenneth Waltz, stating {{that the end of the}} Cold War and the state of unipolarity is an <b>unstable</b> <b>configuration</b> that will inevitably change.|$|E
50|$|When in the <b>unstable</b> <b>configuration,</b> for a {{particular}} harmonic component of the initial perturbation, the torque on the interface creates vorticity that will tend to increase the misalignment of the gradient vectors. This in turn creates additional vorticity, leading to further misalignment. This concept is depicted in the figure, where {{it is observed that}} the two counter-rotating vortices have velocity fields that sum at the peak and trough of the perturbed interface. In the stable configuration, the vorticity, and thus the induced velocity field, will be in a direction that decreases the misalignment and therefore stabilizes the system.|$|E

However, <b>unstable</b> <b>configurations</b> (such as buckling) can in principle be controlled in smart structures using embedded sensors and actuators. In this paper we explore a new means of reconfiguring smart structures by connecting multiple <b>unstable</b> <b>configurations.</b> Methods from dynamical systems theory are used firstly to identify sets of <b>unstable</b> <b>configurations</b> in a simple smart structure model, and then to connect them through so-called heteroclinic connections in the phase space of the problem.

5000|$|Several {{models to}} explain the {{subsequent}} step - the formation of stalk and fusion pore - have been proposed. However, {{the exact nature of}} these processes remains debated. In accordance with the [...] "zipper" [...] hypothesis, as the SNARE complex forms, the tightening helix bundle puts torsional force on the transmembrane (TM) domains domains of synaptobrevin and syntaxin. [...] This causes the TM domains to tilt within the separate membranes as the proteins coil more tightly. The <b>unstable</b> <b>configuration</b> of the TM domains eventually causes the two membranes to fuse and the SNARE proteins come together within the same membrane, which is referred to as a [...] "cis"-SNARE complex. As a result of the lipid rearrangement, a fusion pore opens and allows the chemical contents of the vesicle to leak into the outside environment.|$|E
5000|$|All {{these actions}} {{led to an}} {{extremely}} unstable reactor configuration. Nearly all of the control rods were removed manually, including all but 18 of the [...] "fail-safe" [...] manually operated rods of the minimal 28 which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even {{in the event of}} a loss of coolant, out of a total 211 control rods. While the emergency SCRAM system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually (through the [...] "AZ-5" [...] button), the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level, and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed. Further, the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced, which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling, thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water. The reactor was in an <b>unstable</b> <b>configuration</b> that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers. If anything pushed it into supercriticality, it was unable to recover automatically.|$|E

40|$|Aiming {{to verify}} the concept of using heteroclinic {{connections}} to reconfigure smart structures, a multistable buckled beam with integrated Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires is utilized as a high fidelity model. The Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires are resistively heated to provide the actuation force to stabilize the <b>unstable</b> <b>configuration</b> and the transition of the beam from one unstable equilibrium condition to the other. This concept provides a means of reducing the energy requirement for transitions between configurations of the structure, which is an energy-efficient reconfiguration scheme between equal-energy unstable (but actively controlled) equilibria.

A simple scaling analysis {{is used to}} examine the relative magnitudes of the forces acting on the system and good agreement is obtained with previous studies. A two-dimensional model of crystal growth on a centrifuge is proposed and calculations are undertaken to help in understanding the fundamental transport processes within the crystal growth cell. Results from three-dimensional calculations of actual centrifuge-based crystal growth systems are presented both for the thermodynamically stable and <b>unstable</b> <b>configurations.</b> The calculations show the existence of flow bifurcations in certain configurations but not in all instances. The numerical simulations also show that the centrifugal force is the dominant stabilizing force on fluid convection in the stable configuration. The stabilizing influence of the Coriolis force is found to be only secondary in nature. No significant impact of gravity gradient is found in the calculations. Simulations of <b>unstable</b> <b>configurations</b> show that the Coriolis force has a stabilizing influence on fluid motion by delaying the onset of unsteady convection.

40|$|AbstractTesting the {{stability}} of the electroweak vacuum in any extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector is of great importance to verify the consistency of the theory. Multi-scalar extensions as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model generically lead to <b>unstable</b> <b>configurations</b> in certain regions of parameter space. An exact minimization of the scalar potential is rather an impossible analytic task. To give handy analytic constraints, a specific direction in field space has to be considered which is a simplification that tends to miss excluded regions, however good to quickly check parameter points. We describe a yet undescribed class of charge and color breaking minima as they appear in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, exemplarily for the case of non-vanishing bottom squark vacuum expectation values constraining the combination μYb in a non-trivial way. Contrary to famous A-parameter bounds, we relate the bottom Yukawa coupling with the supersymmetry breaking masses. Another bound can be found relating soft breaking masses and μ only. The exclusions follow from the tree-level minimization and can change dramatically using the one-loop potential. Estimates of the lifetime of <b>unstable</b> <b>configurations</b> show that they are either extremely short- or long-lived...|$|R

30|$|The Rayleigh–Taylor {{instability}} {{of a heavy}} fluid supported by a lighter one is investigated, with the suspended dust particles and small uniform general rotation. The fluids {{are assumed to be}} incompressible. The solutions of the linearized equations of motion using the boundary conditions lead to deriving the dispersion equation in complex formula. The real formula of dispersion relation has been analyzed and the behavior of growth rate with respect to the suspended dust particles and components of rotation have been examined. The results show that relaxation frequency of the suspended particles beside the general rotation will bring about more stability on the growth rate of <b>unstable</b> <b>configuration.</b>|$|E

This case has been plotted in Fig.  1, where the magnitude of the growth rate decreases with relaxation frequency of suspended dust particles increasing and these values decreases with wave number decreasing. Also it observes that the magnitudes of growth rate in the presence of relaxation frequency of suspended dust particles are less than their counterpart in the classical case (Ω+ = Ω z  =  0, f [...] s [...] *  =  0).|$|E
