Whatever revenues was collected was subsequently transferred to the coffers of the national government. In 1993, the Vientiane Urban Planning Committee (VUPC) became the highest decision-making organization with the prefecture; it was governed by a chairman, deputy chair, and eight additional members. In 1999, the Vientiane Urban Development and Administration Authority (VUDAA) was established at the prefecture level to manage the city's development.

This paper looks at the missing link between land use planning and <b>urban</b> <b>growth,</b> and it implications for environmental sustainability in a selected sub Saharan Africa city of Kaduna, Nigeria. We assessed <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> from historical GIS data {{of the city to}} evaluate the urban expansion. At the same time, regression analysis was used to established relationship between carbon emission and traffic volume in the city. A city characterized by weak land use planning has created a gap leading to uncoordinated land use planning and uncontrolled physical growth. A steady increase of built up area of 8, 400. 31 hectares in 1982 to an area of 17, 120. 5 hectares in 2015 can be a reflection of the presence of <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> expansion. The lack of coordination between land use planning and <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> has resulted to environmental ills within the city. One among the ills, is ubiquitous traffic congestion within the city leading to high carbon (CO 2) emission. Findings shows a strong connection between emission and volume of traffic. In addition to findings, is the decline of green areas in the city. By this findings, it is suggested that the modern concept of land use planning which embraces flexibility, public participation and integration of environmental issues should be entrenched and allow {{to take the lead in}} the process of <b>urban</b> <b>growth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Malaria is {{the primary}} cause of ill health in Africa South of Sahara, causing an {{enormous}} health and economic burden. It is estimated that malaria causes up to 500 million-illness episodes and over 1. 2 million deaths annually worldwide. More than 90 % of these illnesses and deaths occur in Africa South of Sahara, the great majority in {{children under the age of}} 5 years (Lopes et al., 2006). In Tanzania, malaria is the leading communicable disease problem, affecting over 95 % of the population. A number of malaria epidemiological studies have been conducted in Tanzania, and mostly covering rural population of northeast and south-east Tanzania. There is a significant lack of knowledge on urban malaria in the country, except for Dar es Salaam and Tanga (Yamagata, 1996; Wang et al., 2006). It is estimated that over 33 % of the population in Tanzania live in urban areas (Mbogoro, 2002); this being two-folds the proportion lived in 1978. The rapid urbanization in many areas of the country brings about major changes in ecology, social structure and disease patterns. Such changes are likely to alter the frequency and transmission dynamics of malaria, with significant effects on disease-associated morbidity and mortality. It has been reported that <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> population <b>growth</b> accompanied with poor housing and lack of sanitation and drainage of surface water can increase mosquito breeding places and human-vector contact (Keiser et al., 2004). This increase in urban population calls for the attention by health authorities and requires up-scaled and adapted strategies for malaria control and other diseases (Yamagata, 1996; Caldas de Castro et al., 2004). Data on malaria parasitaemia and transmission in many urban areas of Tanzania is scanty. Such information are urgently required to provide rational basis for the design, implementation and monitoring of malaria control programmes.

The first part of this paper shows why delinquency is a primarily urban phenomenon and how the city per se can be considered as crime-generating. The sharply contrasted examples of Niger and Nigeria, at the opposite ends of the urbanization spectrum, reveal the operation of the processes which contribute to the worsening of unbalance and dysfunction in a context of <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> In both countries, in spite of their different characteristics, it seems that urban juvenile delinquency is chiefly the resuit of an anomic situation stemming from the disruption of traditional family and community life.

40|$|Rapid <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> is {{becoming}} a serious problem in most developing countries. Tehran, the capital of Iran, stands out as a vibrant metropolitan area, facing <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>urban</b> expansion. Public authorities and decision makers require planning criteria regarding possible spatial developments. To monitor past developmental trends and to simulate emerging spatiotemporal patterns of <b>urban</b> <b>growth,</b> this research applies a geosimulation approach that couples agent-based modeling with multicriteria analysis (MCA) for the period between 1986 and 2006. To model the major determinants controlling urban development, three agent groups are defined, namely developer agents, government agents, and resident agents. The behaviors of each agent group are identified by qualitative surveys and are considered separately using multi-criteria analysis. The interactions of the agents are then combined through overlay functions within a Geographic Information System (GIS). This analysis results {{in the creation of}} a propensity surface of growth that is able to identify the most probable sites for urban development. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Model (MCM) and a concise statistical extrapolation are used to determine the amount of probable future expansion in Tehran. For validation purposes, the model is estimated using 2011 data and then validated based on actual urban expansion. Given the accurate predictions of the Markov Chain Model, further predictions were carried out for 2016 and 2026. This simulation provides strong evidence that during the next decade planning authorities will have to cope with continuous as well as heterogeneously distributed <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> Both the monitoring of growth and simulation revealed significant developments in the northwestern part of Tehran, continuing toward the south along the interchange networks...|$|R

Through both, theoretical and empirical studies, three major determinants were identified: accessibility, industrial structure, and development institutions. The term "accessibility" indicates-not only physical nearness but also functional connections with relevant areas. The findings -of the research show that there are strong positive relationship between-accessibility and <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in -Korea. As a composite economic indicator, - urban industrial structure reflects the soundness of urban economic activities in terms of employment opportunities, income generation, and innovation adoption. Thus, it can be assumed that an urban place which has a more advanced industrial structure can bring more <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> than one without such a structure. This study suggests that <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in Korea has been strongly influenced by manufacturing oriented' industry growth. Development institutions have particular meanings for <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> in Korea as <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> has been greatly influenced by development policies initiated by central government. These include economic development, national land development, and industrial location policies. These three determinants reinforce or counteract each other to influence the speed and direction of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and change. The impacts of these determinants can change according to the circumstances of the <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> environment in Korea. The meaning of locational factors has changed from their physical aspects to their functional oriented aspects. In many more developed countries, the emphasis has shifted from manufacturing oriented industrial structures to service and/or information oriented industrial activities. Development institutions, can also be changed from centralised to decentralised forms in terms of decision making regarding <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and change. However, although circumstances may changes, the importance of the three determinants will not be weakened because of their critical importance for <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> and change. These three determinants are proxy factors of three important aspects in the urban environment: accessibility for location, industrial structure for economic activities, and development institutions for the institutional context.

This study used Remote sensing and GIS techniques to identify, mark and measure the extent of the various land uses from the Landsat TM image of 1995 and Landsat ETM+ image of 2006. The study revealed that the spatial and temporal changes in the land uses have greatly influenced the increase in the land surface temperature of each of the identified land uses. As vacant land and built-up area increased by 3. 28 ha/yr and 78. 34 ha/yr so did their land surface temperature increased by 0. 083 o C/yr. While vegetation and water and wetland vegetation decreased, their respective land surface temperature increased by 0. 075 o C/yr and 0. 083 o C/yr. This increase in land surface temperature of the study area within the period of study suggest that the rise in temperature of the various land uses may encourage environmental problems associated with local climate change as heat waves and mosquito infestations which can cause human discomfort as its been witnessed today in Anyigba.

In this context, the hinterland of Huancayo, Peru, represents a case in point, given that the urbanization of irrigated land resources on the valley floor endangers agricultural production during the dry season and thus forces agriculturalists to adapt their land use—a problem largely attributed to policy failures. If smallholder farmers had been policy-makers in the past, what type of urban growth would have taken place? Which future settlement structure would they prefer? To answer these questions, an easy-to-use and practice-oriented method for visualizing smallholder views on urbanization and landscape change was developed and tested. A combination of photomontage-based visualization exercises and interviews revealed that the interviewees mostly agreed that agricultural areas should remain between a mix of low and high buildings along the existing road. Hence, to a certain degree, their perception toward dispersed urban development seems not to be as negative as one could suppose. Additionally, some peasants argue that urban expansion should be on the steep and nonirrigated slopes adjacent to the city in order to conserve the fertile and irrigated land on the valley floor. Finally, {{the results of this study}} point to the potential of landscape visualizations for enabling mountain smallholders to participate in periurban land use planning and lead to the conclusion that photomontages, visualization exercises, and interviews should increasingly be used to improve understanding of smallholders' views, for this method includes an important emotional component that is rarely considered by planners and policy-makers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Developed for Internet-based simulations, the <b>Urban</b> <b>Growth</b> Simulator {{allows users}} to select from a suite of {{available}} options for growth management when generating build-out scenarios. With all required data layers for the 15 -county region in northeast Ohio freely accessible and available from the simulator's server, planners, government officials, {{and the general public}} can use the <b>Urban</b> <b>Growth</b> Simulator to examine how their communities are to be affected by potential growth. With generated build-out scenarios, the <b>Urban</b> <b>Growth</b> Simulator also performs calculations for estimating environmental impacts due to simulated <b>growth.</b> The <b>Urban</b> <b>Growth</b> Simulator was developed by using a combination of codes in Visual Basics with MapObjects and functions in ArcIMS. The implementation of the simulator demonstrates the versatile capability of combining MapObjects and ArcIMS. In addition to county-level planning agencies, the <b>Urban</b> <b>Growth</b> Simulator is being used to support a watershed management project for Grand River, also in Northeast Ohio.

40|$|AbstractUrban environments {{are complex}} dynamic systems whose {{prediction}} {{of the future}} states cannot exclusively rely on deterministic rules. Although several studies on <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> were carried out using different modelling approaches, the measurement of uncertainties was commonly neglected in these studies. This paper investigates the effect of uncertainty in <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> models by introducing a stochastic perturbation method. A cellular automaton is used to simulate predicted <b>urban</b> <b>growth.</b> The effect of stochastic perturbation is addressed by comparing series of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> simulations based on different degree of stochastic perturbation randomness with the original <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> simulation, obtained with the sole cellular automata neighbouring effects. These simulations are evaluated using cell-to-cell location agreement {{and a number of}} spatial metrics. The model framework has been applied to the Ourthe river basin in Belgium. The results show that the accuracy of the model is increased by introducing a stochastic perturbation component with a limited degree of randomness, in the cellular automata <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>growth</b> {{management}} {{is a popular}} topic for study area all over the world. Despite the increasingly rich literature, however, little has been considered of the complex relationship between the various urban development factors and their feedback structure. This paper contributes in understanding the mechanism of, and establishing a link between, <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> management oriented by zoning in China (namely development priority zoning or DPZ). A system dynamics <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> model is presented that is integrated with China's socio-economic development situation. With Yiwu city and Qingtian County as case studies, the model is applied in simulating <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> under different driving modes. The {{results indicate that the}} DPZ in these two areas has an influence on <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> management strategy, with the driving mode of <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> affecting economic development levels, migration and types of land conversion. It is concluded that different driving modes are needed for different types of regions according to the functional positioning of their DPZ and that the model contributes to their identification...|$|R
