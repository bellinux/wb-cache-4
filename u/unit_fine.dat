50|$|A day-fine, day fine, <b>unit</b> <b>fine</b> or {{structured}} fine is {{a unit of}} fine payment that, above {{a minimum}} fine, {{is based on the}} offender's daily personal income. A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days, or with fines. As incarceration is a financial punishment, in the effect of preventing work, a day-fine represents one day incarcerated and without salary. It is argued to be just, because if both high-income and low-income population are punished with the same jail time, they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss. An analogy may be drawn with income tax, which is also proportional to the income, even progressively.|$|E

40|$|Root {{morphology}} {{will affect}} interplant competition for soil nutrients. Research {{was conducted to}} assess fine root fraction, mean root radius, specific root length, root length density, and nitrogen (N) uptake per <b>unit</b> <b>fine</b> root biomass of corn and velvetleaf over time {{and in response to}} nitrogen supply. Pots containing either corn or velvetleaf were embedded in the ground and received one of three N treatments. Plants were destructively sampled on 10 dates during each of two years and root subsamples analyzed using root scanning software. While corn root morphology was more responsive to N supply than velvetleaf, velvetleaf N uptake per <b>unit</b> <b>fine</b> root length was greater than that of corn at similar biomass. Results suggest that, in lieu of modifying root morphology to increase uptake efficiency when N is deficient, velvetleaf may invest more root biomass to produce a deeper tap root to reach nutrients deeper in the profile...|$|E

40|$|We {{focus on}} {{the role played by}} waste policy and {{enforcement}} in determining waste related corruption. We develop a simple model in which an economic agent chooses the level of illegal disposal of its waste. The polluting agent can be detected by the local police authority. In the event of discovery of illegal waste disposal, the local administration may decide to report the agent's illegal activity (implying that the agent itself will have to pay a <b>unit</b> <b>fine</b> on such activity), or to protect the polluting agent in exchange for a bribe. The official in charge is herself subject to enforcement from the central government. By varying the exogenous enforcement and waste tax levels, we derive several interesting trade-offs among the goals of reducing corruption, financing legal disposal costs and illegal dumping. For example, high charges for legal disposal lead to increased illegal disposal and corruption. Also, somewhat surprisingly, a stricter enforcement on the regulated agent may lead to an increased likelihood of corruption and to higher rates of illegal disposal...|$|E
40|$|Based upon a stereochemical guideline, both right- and left-handed duplexes were {{generated}} for A, B, and D forms of DNA using a mononucleotide as the repeat. Structure factor amplitudes were computed following two methods: (i) one employed an infinite helix as the motif and (ii) {{the other had}} an exact crystallographic repeat (e. g., 10 b. p. for B-DNA) as the motif. Both the procedures showed that DNA in either handedness for A, B, and D forms of DNA {{are consistent with the}} observed fiber data. This observation is attributed to the fact that fibre pattern (resolved only upto 3 A) only gives the image of the gross structure of the molecule. Thus, when the gross structure is suitably fitted to match the observed pattern, it is immaterial as to what the precise stereochemistry of the repeating <b>unit</b> (<b>fine</b> structure) and handedness of a model are. Sequence specific helical conformations were obtained using dinucleotide as the repeating unit. Helices fell into two classes: (i) right-handed uniform (RU) and (ii) left-handed zig-zag (LZ) structures. A few aspects concerning the scattering profile of these helices are discussed...|$|E
30|$|The neural network, a {{prediction}} method for {{the estimation of}} the TCC, was constructed and trained using 124 experimental data obtained by previous studies (Kim et al. 2003; Morabito 1989; Harmathy 1983; Yamazaki et al. 1995; Lie and Kodur 1996; Van Geem et al. 1997; Khan et al. 1998; Khan 2002; Kodur and Sultan 2003). Based on their data sets, the developed neural network model was trained with regard to eleven parameters: nine parameters representing the composition of concrete constituents, which were the waterâ€“cement ratio, the fine aggregate percentage, the coarse aggregate percentage, the unit water weight, the unit cement weight, the <b>unit</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate weight, the unit coarse aggregate weight, the unit fly ash weight, and the unit silica fume weight, and two parameters representing the state of concrete, which were {{the temperature of the}} concrete and the water content in the concrete. Finally, the TCC estimated by the neural network model was compared with 28 randomly-selected measured data not included in the neural network training. As a result, the neural network model, trained by the eleven parameters, accurately estimated the values of the TCC. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the proposed prediction method based on a neural network algorithm {{could be used as a}} reliable and effective technique for determining thermal conductivity in the thermal design and analysis of concrete structures.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of penalty <b>units,</b> <b>fines</b> and other charges were usually prescribed in terms of ordinary money (pounds or, later, dollars). However, the effects of inflation meant that originally substantial penalties were eventually reduced to trifling sums.

Penalty units provide a quick and simple way to adjust many different fees and charges.|$|R

40|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} on the Loess Plateau {{are receiving}} increasing attention for their special importance in carbon fixation and {{conservation of soil}} and water in the region. Soil respiration was investigated in two typical forest stands of the forest-grassland transition zone in the region, an exotic black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) plantation and an indigenous oak (Quercus liaotungensis) forest, in response to rain events (27. 7 mm in May 2009 and 19 mm in May 2010) during the early summer dry season. In both ecosystems, precipitation significantly increased soil moisture, decreased soil temperature, and accelerated soil respiration. The peak values of soil respiration were 4. 8 and 4. 4 mu mol CO(2) m(- 2) s(- 1) in the oak plot and the black locust plot, respectively. In the dry period after rainfall, the soil moisture and respiration rate gradually decreased and the soil temperature increased. Soil respiration rate in black locust stand was consistently less than that in oak stand, being consistent with the differences in C, N contents and fine root mass {{on the forest floor}} and in soil between the two stands. However, root respiration (R(r)) per <b>unit</b> <b>fine</b> root mass and microbial respiration (R(m)) per unit the amount of soil organic matter were higher in black locust stand than in oak stand. Respiration by root rhizosphere in black locust stand was the dominant component resulting in total respiration changes, whereas respiration by roots and soil microbes contributed equally in oak stand. Soil respiration in the black locust plantation showed higher sensitivity to precipitation than that in the oak forest. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|An {{interesting}} {{question is that}} of scalability {{with the amount of}} users per cell.
