He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish.

He played for the <b>U.S.</b> <b>again</b> the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E

25|$|Since 2011, Sanjeev Sanyal, a {{colleague}} of Dooley, Garber and Folkerts-Landau has taken the framework a step further to argue that periods of global economic expansions are almost always underpinned by symbiotic imbalances. Such imbalances cause distortions but are an inevitable part of expanding economic ecosystems. Thus, {{he argues that the}} next round of economic growth will again be underpinned by a return to global imbalances, probably with China supplying capital and the <b>US</b> <b>again</b> running deficits to absorb it.

25|$|The {{first episode}} {{to be removed}} from {{rotation}} after the September 11 attacks of 2001, mainly because the censors noted similarities between the attacks and Tentacruel attacking the city. The character Nastina also used military-style weapons during the fight scenes in the episode. However, Tentacruel striking a building was not removed from the dub's opening theme, and the episode is still readily available on the home video and DVD markets. The episode was aired a month after the September 11 attacks, and was not aired in the <b>US</b> <b>again</b> until the series began airing on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. It was also not shown for a short time in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina as it portrays a city flooded underwater.|$|E

In 1998, Christianity Today compared What's So Amazing About Grace? to Joel A. Carpenter's Revive <b>Us</b> <b>Again,</b> writing that both books productively analyze Christian fundamentalism. That year, Karla Vallance's Christian Science Monitor review called the book similarly sentimental to John Newton's hymn [...] "Amazing Grace".|$|E

In an interview with Greg Kelton of The Advertiser, Loughnan outlined the band's future: [...] "If Beyond doesn't make it {{for us in the}} States we might as well forget all about Ayers Rock." [...] From May to July they toured the <b>US</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "only achiev limited success overseas." [...] After the tour Dunlop and Loughnan left, and on 25 August Mushroom Records announced that Ayers Rock had broken up after Loughnan decided to remain in the US to study. Brown, Doyle, and McGuire indicated that they would revive the group with new members.|$|E

500|$|Subsequently, Konoe removed Matsuoka {{from his}} cabinet and stepped up Japan's {{negotiations}} with the <b>US</b> <b>again,</b> which still failed over the China and Indochina issues, however, and the American demand to Japan {{to withdraw from the}} Tripartite Pact in anticipation of any settlement. Without any perspective with respect to Washington, Matsuoka felt that his government had to reassure Germany of its loyalty to the pact. In Berlin, Ōshima was ordered to convey to the German foreign minister Ribbentrop that the [...] "Japanese government have decided to secure 'points d'appui' in French Indochina to enable further to strengthen her pressure on Great Britain and the United States of America," [...] and to present this as a [...] "valuable contribution to the common front" [...] by promising that [...] "We Japanese are not going to sit on the fence while you Germans fight the Russians." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Hermits tour, the Who {{recorded}} {{their next}} single, [...] "I Can See for Miles", which Townshend {{had written in}} 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well. [...] Townshend called it [...] "the ultimate Who record", and was disappointed it reached only No.10 in the UK. It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No.9. The group toured the <b>US</b> <b>again</b> with Eric Burdon and the Animals, including an appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, miming to [...] "I Can See For Miles" [...] and [...] "My Generation". Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by flying cymbal shrapnel. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.|$|E
500|$|During August and September 1987, Echo & the Bunnymen co-headlined {{a tour of}} the United States {{with popular}} {{electronic}} group New Order. Despite the tour passing without incident, the performances were deemed to be of poor quality. Although American audiences were apparently satisfied by the shows, when the group returned to the United Kingdom for an autumn tour the British music press and audiences were not as equally enthusiastic. Shortly thereafter the band announced plans to record a self-produced album of [...] "savage rock" [...] when there was more free time. The group toured the UK and the <b>US</b> <b>again</b> in early 1988. These concerts were more positively received than their tour the previous year, with guitarist Will Sergeant being singled out for praise– BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel said, [...] "Will Sergeant was superb, moving in a trice from squalls of angry sound to playing with such care and subtlety that there were whispered asides from his guitar that I would have sworn only he and I had heard." [...] In March 1988, the band released a cover version of The Doors' song [...] "People Are Strange". However, this failed to impress critics; music paper Melody Maker called it a [...] "rancid effort" [...] and Q said the band had [...] "thrown in the towel".|$|E
