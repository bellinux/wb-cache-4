[...] For example, when copying {{a set of}} 20 pages 20 times, a <b>digital</b> <b>copier</b> scans each page only once, then uses the stored information to produce 20 sets. In an analog copier, either each page is scanned 20 times (a total of 400 scans), making one set at a time, or 20 separate output trays are used for the 20 sets.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, wedevelop {{real-time}} {{image processing}} programs for a <b>digital</b> <b>copier</b> using a general purpose microprocessor. Toexploit the inherent data parallelism in many image processing algorithms, {{we use the}} Intel's Pentium processor with multimedia-extension (MMX). Each step of the <b>digital</b> <b>copier</b> process including the X-Zoom and the error diffusion halftoning is aggressively optimized for the Pentium MMX processor. The X-Zoom process {{that is based on}} the linear interpolation method is optimized using the software pipelining technique. For the error diffusion halftoning which requires non-linear feedback, we exploit both the control-level and data-level parallelism. For the latter approach, a speculative quantization method is developed to break the dependency relation due to feedback and quantization operations. Our implementation acquires the maximum throughput of 30 ppm for the A 4 size paper using one 166 MHZ Pentium MMX CPU, which is approximately five times faster than the code [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation in <b>digital</b> <b>copiers</b> is {{designed}} to improve overall image quality by explicitly identifying significant elements in the input that require diverse and specialized treatment with respect to filtering, halftone generation, and marking strategies. Similarly, segmentation can greatly improve compression ratios while preserving image quality by selecting, for each region of the image, the compression method best suited {{to the content of}} that region. However, the performance requirements in <b>digital</b> <b>copier</b> and compression scenarios impose serious constraints on the extent and nature of feasible computation. In this paper we define the segmentation problem and discuss its implications for copier and compression tasks. We also examine the various tradeoffs involved with each task in terms of computation and image quality. We then show examples of two original segmen-tation methods: one achieving reasonable segmentation within the constraints of a low-cost copier product; the other producing high compression ratios while preserving image quality...|$|R

40|$|In 1990, {{when the}} first {{high-speed}} <b>digital</b> <b>copiers</b> came on the market, it appeared {{as if we were}} at the dawn of a new era in publishing. The new machines were hailed to bring about a revolution in the publishing industry as radical as Gutenberg’s introduction of the movable character press. The traditional printing industry requires large capital investments, long print runs, large warehousing facilities, and careful printing volume forecasting. Compared to traditional presses, high-speed <b>digital</b> <b>copiers</b> are an order of magnitude cheaper, can print cost-efficiently runs as short as a single copy, have small warehousing requirements for the digital storage media, and eliminate the risk of volume forecasting. The new machines have been very successful in the market place, both for in-house printing and in traditional print shops. The traditional printing press manufacturers have quickly responded to the new market situation by introducing direct-to-plate presses, where the pre-press and platemaking workflow steps are carried out completely in the digital domain.

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>copiers</b> and {{printers}} {{require that}} processing steps be performed on image data {{after it is}} captured and before it is finally printed. Grayscale data is typically captured using an image scanner or generated using image composition software. Single bit data is usually printed using a laser, LED, ink-jet, or thermal writer. This thesis describes the design of an ASIC that implements several image processing algorithms. Image histogram modification and convolution filtering are used for operating on gray data. Ordered dither, error diffusion and thresholding convert gray data to binary. A pipe line architecture is used to maximize both the modularity and the throughput of the design. A CPU interface is used to allow flexible programming of the image processing parameters. The design is implemented and simulation stimulus is generated entirely in VHDL. A design of this type allows many of the image processing operations commonly required in <b>digital</b> <b>copiers</b> and printers to be performed in real time {{rather than as a}} pre-processing software step. The programmability of the image processing parameters makes the design suitable {{for a wide variety of}} applications.

For example, while the text mode would enhance the edge detail, the photo mode would improve the appearance of very pale colors and smooth the scanned document for noise reduction. Even if the user is aware of different copy modes, it is still cumbersome to select the appropriate copy mode page by page for multi-page documents. Hence, it is essential to develop an automatic page classifier.|$|R

The SVM multiple classifiers {{can be constructed}} based on Huffman tree with the paragraph and local pixel feature of the input document images. Their scheme can distinguish the texture, character and color from the document images. However, the schemes [11, 12] are complexity and infeasible of distinguishing different modes, such as text, picture, photo, mix, and periodic, for the common scanned image. The article [13] proposed an incremental learning approach for document image with zone classification. The scheme segments the document image into physical zones according to a zone-model with incremental learning. The scheme provides five classes (handwritten, tables, stamps, signatures, and logos) with 1117 zones. However, the five classes are unsuitable for applied in the <b>digital</b> <b>copier.</b>|$|R

For {{this approach to}} succeed the effort to capture and file documents must be very nearly zero, yet document retrieval {{must be at least}} as convenient and effective as it would be using conventional retrieval methods. To achieve zero-effort document capture, we have modified conventional printers, <b>digital</b> <b>copiers</b> and fax machines to automatically save, as a side effect, representations of every document processed. To enable effective document retrieval in the absence of user-assigned filenames, paths, or keywords, we have developed a new set of retrieval methods that exploit the user’ s familiarity with a personal document collection. This perhaps counter-intuitive approach has been implemented and placed in daily use for three years in a workgroup of some 20 - 30 people.

40|$|After scanning, a {{document}} is typically blurred, and some noise is introduced. Therefore, the enhancement process of a scanned document requires a denoising and deblurring step. Typically, these steps are performed using techniques {{originated in the}} Fourier-domain. It {{has been shown in}} many image processing applications such as compression and denoising that wavelet-domain processing outperforms Fourier-domain processing. One main reason for the success of wavelets is that wavelets adapt automatically to smooth and non-smooth parts in an image due to the link between wavelets and sophisticated smoothness spaces, the Besov spaces. Recently smoothing and sharpening of an image − interpreted as an increasing and decreasing of smoothness of an image − has been derived using Besov space properties. The goal {{of this paper is to}} use wavelet-based denoising and sharpening in Besov spaces in combination with characterization of lines and halftone patterns in the wavelet domain to build a complete wavelet-based enhancement system. It is shown that characteristics of a scanned document and the enhancement steps necessary for a <b>digital</b> <b>copier</b> application are well-suited to be modeled in terms of wavelet bases and Besov spaces.

40|$|Holographic-based {{scanning}} {{systems have}} been used for years in the high resolution prepress markets where monochromatic lasers are generally utilized. However, until recently, due to the dispersive properties of holographic optical elements (HOEs), along with the high cost associated with recording “master ” HOEs, holographic scanners {{have not been able to}} penetrate major scanning markets such as the laser printer and <b>digital</b> <b>copier</b> markets, low to mid-range imagesetter markets, and the non-contact inspection scanner market. Each of these markets has developed cost effective laser diode based solutions using conventional scanning approaches such as polygon/f-theta lens combinations. In order to penetrate these markets, holographic-based systems must exhibit low cost and immunity to wavelength shifts associated with laser diodes. This paper describes recent developments in the design of holographic scanners in which multiple HOEs, each possessing optical power, are used in conjunction with one curved mirror to passively correct focal plane position errors and spot size changes caused by the wavelength instability of laser diodes. This paper also describes recent advancements in low cost production of high quality HOEs and curved mirrors. Together these developments allow holographic scanners to be economically competitive alternatives to conventional devices in every segment of the laser scanning industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a real-time system for image acquisition, where images are corrected for lens- distortion. Three kinds of distortion can be corrected by the system: barrel, pincushion and pocket-handkerchief. Applications {{can be found}} in very high light-efficient systems where lenses with a large numerical aperture produce barrel- or pincushion distortion. Examples are medical X-ray systems, where pincushion distortion is introduced by the curved output screen of the image intensifier. Another example {{can be found in}} <b>digital</b> <b>copiers</b> and scanners. Since distortion does not blur the image, but merely destroys the proportionality between image and object coordinates, it can be corrected by digital image processing. A method for correction is discussed, where a third ordertwo dimensional polynomial is used. An algorithm to determine the parameters for this polynomial will also be addressed. Because the correction requires resampling of the inputimages, a cubic spline interpolation technique is used to obtain the output image. The system has to process 25 frames of 512 x 512 pixels, while 16 pixels are used for interpolation of one output pixel. So, high processing power and I/O bandwidth are required. Therefore instead of using DSP's, we have designed two dedicated VLSI-circuits. Both circuits will be presented in this paper. 1 Introductio...|$|R

40|$|Freeform feature fitting is a {{technique}} underlying different applications, including reverse engineering, object recognition and conceptual shape design. The latter application poses specific requirements to the fitting technique with regard to speed, robustness and interactivity. On the other hand, the spatial accuracy and {{the density of the}} input data can be permitted to be relatively low. We have performed freeform feature fitting to physical shapes using both a high-density mechanical scanning device and a low-cost desktop laser scanner. The performance of these technologies have been compared. The fitting technique is based on direct template matching, where a template is a 3 D shape feature under control of 6 placement parameters (defining the ridged body transformation) and a number of intrinsic form parameters. We found that template matching remained reliable even for sparse and partly missing data.

As the manufacturer of the Bookeye® family of scanners we {{have had a lot of}} discussions with libraries and their needs. One topic was the gap between the increasing demand for electronic availability of documents like dissertations and theses and their real availability on paper or microfilm. To close this gap - besides others like electronic document delivery via ILL and/or an alternative to ARIEL - we were asked to develop an open WEB-based system together with librarians. The development guidelines were a browser-based user interface, usage of PHP, Apache, MySQL, and the system should run on Windows and Linux. The result was Mybib, a platform to cover: * electronic document delivery * scan on demand applications, as an alternative to scanning entire stocks * back file conversion to supply extended OPAC´s Requests for documents to be scanned and delivered can be issued to Mybib by any library system, OPAC or free style WEB-form via ILL, XML or E-Mail. The whole process from the incoming request, through scanning to the delivery is cov-ered by Mybib. Modules for tracking, billing, claim handling, statistics and others support the management and supervisor of the library. MyBib is scalable from one to many scanning, operation and management workplaces. It covers the needs of big libraries located in one place, as well as libraries with departments located in different places. And all of them can be supervised from one place anywhere in the world via Internet or VPN with a Browser To get theses and documents from paper/microfilm to a digital form, they have to be scanned, which is realized by the My-Bib Scan-client.
