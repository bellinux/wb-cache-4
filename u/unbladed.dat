The knives used by performers in American Samoa are still made of machetes, although they are often dulled for younger dancers.|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic instabilities of axial {{compressors}} are investigated numerically {{and compared}} with experimental results. In <b>unbladed</b> {{regions of the}} compressor the flow is simulated by means of 2 D Euler equations. The coupling of {{different parts of the}} compressor, which is characterized by the influence of stator and rotor, is captured in terms of conservation laws and source terms from compressor characteristics. At inflow and outflow nonreflecting boundary conditions have been used in order to avoid any nonphysical reflexions at the boundary. Numerically simulating the system for selected initial and boundary conditions, we observed that for increasing values of exit pressure the compressor flow undergoes several qualitative changes. At some critical value of exit pressure a primary stable steady state loses stability to several coexisting time periodic states with a number of rotating stall cells. While for these time periodic states the mass flow does not depend on time, all solution branches lead finally to surge, i. e. to states with an oscillation of mass flow in time if the exit pressure is sufficiently large. In addition it is shown that the numerical results correspond well to measurements from a low-speed research compressor. (orig.)

40|$|The Five-Axis, Three-Magnetic-Bearing Dynamic Spin Rig, a {{significant}} advancement in the Dynamic Spin Rig (DSR), {{is used to}} perform vibration tests of turbomachinery blades and components under rotating and nonrotating conditions in a vacuum. The rig has as its critical components three magnetic bearings: two heteropolar radial active magnetic bearings and a magnetic thrust bearing. The bearing configuration allows full vertical rotor magnetic suspension along with a feed-forward control feature, which will enable the excitation of various natural blade modes in bladed disk test articles. The theoretical, mechanical, electrical, and electronic aspects of the rig are discussed. Also presented are the forced-excitation results of a fully levitated, rotating and nonrotating, <b>unbladed</b> rotor and a fully levitated, rotating and nonrotating, bladed rotor in which a pair of blades was arranged 180 degrees apart from each other. These tests include the bounce mode excitation of the rotor in which the rotor was excited at the blade natural frequency of 144 Hz. The rotor natural mode frequency of 355 Hz was discerned from the plot of acceleration versus frequency. For nonrotating blades, a blade-tip excitation amplitude of approximately 100 g/A was achieved at the first-bending critical (approximately 144 Hz) and at the first-torsional and second-bending blade modes. A blade-tip displacement of 70 mils was achieved at the first-bending critical by exciting the blades at a forced-excitation phase angle of 908 relative to the vertical plane containing the blades while simultaneously rotating the shaft at 3000 rpm...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTheoretical analyses of flow with rotating passages of turbi 0 machinery have become {{necessary for the}} proper design of turbo-pump elements in liquid fuel boosters and power conversion units. One such theory is presented, and a numerical solution derived. this theory develops a method for the analysis of steady, inviscid, adiabatic flow through arbitrary rotors. A detailed analysis in a meridional plane is given, assuming axial symmetry. A simplified approach to the blade to blade solution is also presented. The merits of these theories are compared with other proposed methods. The inverse, or design, approach is considered, and found to be unnecessary. A numerical solution for incompressible flow is derived and applied to the flow solution in the impeller of a mixed flow compressor with backwards-bent blades of arbitrary shape. Meridional streamlines and relative vorticity distributioins are progressively calculated on a CDC 1604 computer, using FORTRAN program language. Data are measured from a detailed presentation of the blade shape in a meridional plane. Blade to blade relative velocity distributions are calculated from the meridional plane analysis. It is concluded that the results completely define the flow and are sufficiently accurate for engineering applications. Validation is based upon the reliability of the theory, and upon comparisons with results of other methods. Extensions of the scope of this approach are recommended, which include the compressible solution and the solution of flows in <b>unbladed</b> passages. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
