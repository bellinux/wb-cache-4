5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E
25|$|Personality {{differences}} between Barry and Colin causes friction in their relationship. Having been imprisoned in 1983 for motor theft, Barry gets involved in crime again in 1986 under Nick Cotton's (John Altman) influence. This goes against Colin's morals {{and he is}} invariably left to clean up Barry's blunders. When Dot Cotton (June Brown) discovers Colin and Barry are in a relationship, she worries they will infect her with AIDS. Her rumours evoke hostility from {{some members of the}} community but gradually, they get <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of having gay neighbours and Barry is relieved when his older brother, Graham (Gary Webster), gives his blessing too.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} to get <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E

[...] While noting its {{importance to the}} development of the RPG genre, Allgame reviewer Kyle Knight states that [...] "taken on its own merits, it's just not an enjoyable game to play." [...] 1UP.com explained why the series was not immensely popular at first in North America; American console gamers were not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of RPGs, and they said that it would take a decade for the genre to be [...] "flashy enough to distract from all of those words they made you read". GameCritics' Chi Kong Lui wrote that the game added realism to video games, and added, [...] "If a player perished in Dragon Warrior, he or she had to suffer the dire consequences of losing progress and precious gold. That element of death evoked a sense of instinctive fear and tension for survival." [...] This, he said, allowed players to identify with the main character on a much larger scale. IGN writer Mark Nix compared the game's seemingly archaic plot to more modern RPGs; he said: [...] "Noble blood means nothing when the society is capitalist, aristocratic, or militaristic. Damsels don't need rescuing â€“ they need a battle axe and some magic tutoring in the field." [...] While reviewing , GameSpy staff wrote that, for many gamers, Dragon Warrior is their first exposure to the console RPG. Recalling their past, a staff member commented: ...|$|E

In autumn 1862 Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter.

Brahms's circle grew to include the notable critic (and opponent of the 'New German School') Eduard Hanslick, the conductor Hermann Levi and the surgeon Theodor Billroth, who were to become amongst his greatest advocates.|$|E

Not only did EastEnders brave the wrath of many viewers and journalists, but they also explored anti-gay bigotry through the characters in the show - most notably via Albert Square's local gossip Dot Cotton (June Brown), who erupted into horror and ignorant self-righteousness upon discovering Colin and Barry's secret, and even spread rumours that Colin had AIDS. The episode featuring the kiss was watched by over 17 million viewers, and Colin and Barry remained on-screen for several years, accessing millions of viewers each episode â€” the gay community were finally being represented on mass audience mainstream television.

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the year, the band fluctuated {{frequently}} between recording for the new album and touring in support of their previous studio album, The Temper Trap, which included a tour of the Australian east coast, music festival appearances such as Lollapalooza Chile and Wanderland, and serving as support for bands such as The Rolling Stones during the final leg of their 50 & Counting Tour. The album was on-pace for a slated early 2014 release, however, production was jolted by guitarist and founding member Lorenzo Sillitto's resignation from the band in late September 2013. Citing a need to [...] "try new things" [...] after spending over eight years with the band, his departure was not of ill-faith, with Sillitto describing his time in the band as [...] "an amazing journey, an experience I will never forget and one that changed my life." [...] A statement by the band, released later that same day, read in support of Sillitto, calling him [...] "a great friend and a valued and important member of The Temper Trap since he joined in 2006." [...] The statement further read, [...] "his creativity and commitment to the band over the years has been first class and we wish him all the best with the exciting events that are about to come into his life; while we're sad to lose a guitarist, we are not losing a friend." [...] After departing the band peacefully, with [...] "zero drama", Sillitto moved back to the band's hometown of Melbourne, where he got married, started a family, and went on the become the manager of indie rock band Edward R. With Sillitto's departure, the band were reduced to four members once again; guitarist Joseph Greer was originally made the permanent fifth member of the band as its keyboardist and secondary guitarist to Sillitto's lead, after the release of Conditions. The workload heavily shifted towards Greer, once he became the band's lead guitarist, though Greer had stated that he had [...] "really enjoyed the challenge", still maintaining a role with keyboard work, despite becoming the lead guitarist.
