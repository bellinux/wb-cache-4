General response from guests {{as well as}} fans of the ride criticised the [...] "unprofessional" [...] nature of the new <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>lighting</b> and audio alterations, citing missing sound effects, many animations still broken, missing pieces of the sets and excessive light spillage that revealed the areas intended to be covered by darkness.|$|E
5000|$|Turnmill's {{dance floor}} was {{originally}} constructed {{of metal and}} the walls where covered in Athena and film poster. Laurence would spend all week washing and fire-retarding heavy black wool fabric, which was used to cover the tacky décor of the venue. Mr Newman would turn up at his venue prior to the Trade party, produce a lighter {{from his pocket and}} try and burn the fabric. This was a tedious weekly ceremony. After many many months, Mr Newman ditched the ceremony, dumped his kitsch decoration and painted the walls with black paint to create a [...] "theatrical" [...] (infinite) background. Using this blank canvas, Trade produced fluorescent banners and wall hangings illuminated by <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>lighting.</b> These were created by Tim, Martin Brown and TradeMark (the artist who became closely associated with the club, later becoming Trade's manager). The banner and decoration themes changed regularly, usually on the special events parties held at Easter and on the Trade birthday party each October with spectacular fluorescent mobiles and effects projections.|$|E

40|$|Metal oxide {{semiconductor}} gas sensors {{are widely used}} {{for a variety of}} applications from pollution monitoring to medical breath analysis. One disadvantage for the use of such sensors is the relatively large power requirement that originates from the need to heat the semiconductor material in order to produce a measurable baseline resistance. The use of <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>light</b> emitting diodes has been suggested as an alternative way of promoting charge carriers from the materials valence band into the conduction band. In this paper we examine the use of 360 nm <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>light</b> emitting diodes as a way of activating a variety of metal oxide thick film sensors. The sensors were evaluated under a variety of irradiation and heating conditions against varying concentrations of ethanol gas.

50|$|The {{surface of}} the plant is covered in a mix of {{chemicals}} including psoralen, xanthotoxin and bergapten that causes a phototoxic reaction resulting in blistering {{two or three days}} after exposure. The moment of exposure is innocuous, without any untoward sensations to the unwary. Exposure of the affected skin to <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>light,</b> such as contained in sunlight, triggers the effects of the plant's toxins, leading to severe itching and blistering. The welts and resulting blisters can be as small as the size of a coin to covering as much exposed skin as came into contact with the plant. Where more than 5% of the body is afflicted, the scarring can be a serious matter. Washing the affected area immediately after exposure may help but preventing any further exposure to <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>light</b> such as the sun or many artificial light sources will reduce and /or eliminate blistering.|$|R

40|$|Modern theory regards {{light as}} an {{electromagnetic}} disturbance {{and a change}} in electrification as the removal or addition of electrons which are negatively charged. Hence a photo electric change {{can be considered as}} the liberation of some of these negative electrons by the action of electro magnetic waves. Hertz in 1887 found that ultra-violet light falling on a spark gap caused the discharge across that gap to be made more easy, and that the effect was proportional to the actinic quality of the light source used. In 1888, Wiedmann and Ebert proved that the phenomenon takes place at the cathode of the spark gap. The “Hallwachs Effect” was discovered in the same year (1888). W. Hullwachs found that <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>light</b> falling on a body carrying a charge of negative electricity caused that body to lose its charge of negative electricity very readily, but that <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>light</b> falling on a positively charged body does not cause the charge to be liberated. Here then we have a difference between positive and negative electrification. Hallwachs showed later that if a body, carefully insulated and initially free from electrical charge, be exposed to <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> <b>light,</b> it requires a positive charge. The experimental methods of studying the photo electric discharge was as follows: The brightly polished metal plate which received the illumination formed one plate of an air condenser, of which the other plate, likewise polished was positively charged by means of a battery, and the continuous currant produced was measured by means of an electrometer. For a condenser constructed of a certain metal, it was found that beyond a certain potential difference, this current became independent of the field, and this saturation current could then be regarded as a measure of the photo electric activity of that metal. It was found by Elster and Geitel that the photo electric effect was more pronounced the more electro positive the body, Rubidium for example losing a negative charge when illuminated by light from a glass rod heated to redness...|$|R
