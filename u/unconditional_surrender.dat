5|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{that had brought}} the Allies to the border of their homeland, German morale was {{surprisingly}} strong. The men knew the Allies were demanding an <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender.</b> They were now fighting for the fatherland, defending the soil of their country, not just fighting for Hitler.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Many major {{ports and}} {{positions}} {{were incorporated into}} the Atlantic Wall, receiving heavy fortifications. Hitler ordered all positions {{to fight to the}} end, and some of them remained in German hands until Germany's <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender.</b> Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarines after being surrounded by Allied Forces. The defenders of these positions included foreign volunteers and Waffen-SS troops.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E

50|$|General Rogers {{simultaneously}} {{served as}} liaison with {{the headquarters of}} Walter Krueger's Sixth Army and also participated in the planning of an assault on Japanese homeland (Operation Downfall) and its subsequent occupation. The invasion was cancelled after the <b>unconditional</b> Japanese <b>surrender</b> on 15 August 1945. Nevertheless, Rogers was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal {{for his part in}} the planning of the invasion.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 May (thirteen hours after the event), Stalin was {{informed}} of Hitler's suicide. General Hans Krebs had given this information to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov when they met at 04:00 on 1 May, when the Germans attempted to negotiate acceptable surrender terms. Stalin demanded <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> and asked for confirmation that Hitler was dead. He wanted Hitler's corpse found. In {{the early morning hours}} of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head.|$|E
5|$|Strong became Head of the German Section at MI14 in August 1939, {{shortly before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. He commanded the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1941, before becoming Brigadier General Staff (BGS) for Intelligence at Home Forces in 1942. In March 1943, Strong was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G-2) at General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ). He attended the Italian peace negotiations. In May 1944 he joined Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), and played a leading part in the negotiations for the <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> of Germany in 1945.|$|E
5|$|As the Batavian force {{prepared}} to sail, on 16 August Elphinstone's fleet appeared off the bay, {{led by the}} scouting frigate Crescent. He {{sent a letter to}} Lucas demanding his surrender but this was refused. Ascertaining the strength of the Batavian force, on 17 August Elphinstone led his fleet into the bay in line of battle and brought the line to anchor at close gunshot range from Lucas's ships. Trapped between the coast and the British, Lucas immediately raised a flag of truce. He then sent an officer to negotiate terms with Elphinstone. By 17:00, hopelessly outnumbered and his crews in open rebellion, Lucas agreed to terms that dictated an almost <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> of the Batavian force. Elphinstone furthermore refused Lucas's request for cartels to immediately send his crews back to the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|The Allies {{tried to}} start {{negotiations}} about an <b>unconditional</b> German <b>surrender.</b> Seyss-Inquart {{did not want}} to comply there and then, although a general cease-fire was convened. The Germans ceased their resistance only on May 5 following, in Wageningen.

50|$|The War in Vietnam, codenamed Operation Masterdom by the British, {{and also}} known as Nam Bộ kháng chiến (Southern Resistance War) by the Vietnamese, was a post-World War II armed {{conflict}} involving a largely British-Indian and French task force and Japanese troops from the Southern Expeditionary Army Group, versus the Vietnamese communist movement, the Viet Minh, {{for control of the}} country, after the <b>unconditional</b> Japanese <b>surrender.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fighting in the {{northern}} sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards Buin continued into August, combat operations on the island ceased as the war {{came to an end}} before these were completed. As a result, the final Australian operations on Bougainville took place on the Ratsua front in {{the northern}} sector, where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at Porton Plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the Bonis Peninsula. By mid-August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan's subsequent <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender,</b> a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{outbreak}} of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces, recently engaged in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India. Only Pondicherry was able to resist, and a siege was instigated on 1 August 1793 by Colonel John Braithwaite while Cornwallis imposed a naval blockade. British forces constructed trenches and batteries, often under heavy fire, over the following weeks. Twenty days after the city was cut off, Braithwaite began a bombardment of the defences. Within hours the French commander Colonel Prosper de Clermont requested a truce, followed the next morning by an <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 15, {{with the}} fort surrounded, the Confederates, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd, launched a surprise {{attack against the}} right flank of Grant's army {{in an attempt to}} open an escape route to Nashville, Tennessee. Grant, who was away from the battlefield {{at the start of the}} attack, arrived to rally his men and counterattack. Despite achieving partial success and opening the way for a retreat, Floyd lost his nerve and ordered his men back to the fort. The following morning, Floyd and his second-in-command, Brig. Gen. Gideon Johnson Pillow, escaped with a small detachment of troops, relinquishing command to Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, who accepted Grant's terms of <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> later that day.|$|E

50|$|Von Strohm and Gruber, still {{dressed as}} Göring and Hitler, {{are sitting in}} the barn, pondering on how to escape. Suddenly, Louise and Maxine enter, {{demanding}} Hitler broadcast an <b>unconditional</b> German <b>surrender.</b> As they cannot refuse, being held at gunpoint, they agree to do it. When the two girls have left, Gruber realises the impossibility of him ending the war without the real Hitler's permission. The two of them desperately try going through the medals pinned to their chests, to see if they contain any suicide pills.|$|R
50|$|On 1 May 1945, Graziani {{ordered the}} RSI forces {{under his command}} {{to lay down their}} arms and Army Group Liguria ceased to exist.

5|$|The 1st Army was not {{directly}} attacked {{during the first}} few days after the invasion commenced, but attacks on its flanks resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Danube and then the Sava. The Hungarians then crossed the border in the sector for which the 1st Army had been responsible, but the Yugoslavs were already withdrawing and the Hungarians faced almost no resistance. This was followed by the German capture of Belgrade and the rear area units of 1st Army. Remnants of the 1st Army continued to resist along the line of the Sava, within days, tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers had been captured. The Germans closed on Sarajevo, and accepted the <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April, which came into effect at the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Jin assault {{commenced}} in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong {{continued to}} sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> a few days later.|$|E
5|$|The war in Europe {{concluded}} with {{an invasion of}} Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the subsequent German <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, {{after the}} fall of France, and with the German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands imminent, the school was evacuated and Blunt found himself in an RASC training battalion. He saw active service in the Italian campaign in 1944 before returning to England for officer training. He was then commissioned into the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers as a second lieutenant and commanded a close protection platoon defending Field Marshal Montgomery's 21st Army Group headquarters. He was present at the signing of the <b>unconditional</b> German <b>surrender</b> at Lüneburg Heath on 4 May 1945.|$|R
500|$|In {{the face}} of their failing war plans, Japanese and German representatives more and more began to deceive each other at {{tactical}} briefings by exaggerating minor victories and deemphasizing losses. In several talks in spring and summer 1943 between Generaloberst Alfred Jodl and the Japanese naval attaché in Berlin, Vice Admiral Naokuni Nomura, Jodl downplayed the afore described defeats of the German Army, e.g. by claiming the Soviet offensive would soon run out of steam and that [...] "anywhere the Wehrmacht can be sent on land, it is sure of its untertaking, but where {{it has to be}} taken over sea, it becomes somewhat more difficult." [...] Japan, on the other hand, not only evaded any disclosure of its true strategic position in the Pacific, but also declined any interference in American shipments being unloaded at Vladivostok and large numbers of men and amounts of material being transported from East Siberia to the German front in the west.

2500|$|German {{forces in}} North West Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands surrender: On 4 May 1945, the British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery took the <b>unconditional</b> {{military}} <b>surrender</b> at Lüneburg from Generaladmiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, and General Eberhard Kinzel, of all German forces [...] "in Holland , in northwest Germany including the Frisian Islands and Heligoland {{and all other}} islands, in Schleswig-Holstein, and in Denmark… includ all naval ships in these areas", at the Timeloberg on Lüneburg Heath; an area between the cities of Hamburg, Hanover and Bremen. The number of German land, sea and air forces involved in this surrender amounted to 1,000,000 men.|$|R
5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender</b> of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting in the birth of Bangladesh as a new nation. Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed POWs personally, talking to them privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while they shared a cup of tea. He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 15 August, the Japanese Emperor Hirohito {{publicly}} announced Japan's <b>unconditional</b> <b>surrender,</b> effectively {{bringing about}} {{an end to}} the war. On 18 August, in the southern sector of the island the Japanese commander, General Masatane Kanda, dispatched an envoy across the flood swollen Mivo River to begin negotiations with the Australians for the surrender of the over 23,000 Japanese soldiers left on the island, bringing about {{an end to the}} campaign. Throughout the course of the fighting on Bougainville from November 1944 to August 1945, 526 Australians were killed, while a further 1,572 were wounded. Approximately 8,500 Japanese were killed in action and a further 9,800 died from disease during this same period.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July the {{battalion}} undertook garrison duties in Trieste before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Lake Trasimene.

In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre, memorial services would be held at the locations of the division's major battles. As a part of this program services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete, while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge, Faenza, Forli, Padua, Monfalcone and Udine.|$|E

50|$|On 29 April, Graziani {{surrendered}} and {{was present}} at Caserta when a representative of German General Heinrich von Vietinghoff-Scheel signed the <b>unconditional</b> instrument of <b>surrender</b> for all Axis forces in Italy.

5000|$|An {{important}} principle {{enshrined in}} the Geneva Convention was that POWs must be provided with the same living conditions as the holding power's own troops. The British government was generally able to meet these strict requirements: however, wartime shortages of food, clothing, fuel for heating, and other necessities, dictated that {{the requirements of the}} Convention could not always be fully complied with. While food given to prisoners was of similar nutritional value to that provided for British troops, it was not always of the same quality, and some POWs complained that the diet was monotonous. [...] However, after the <b>unconditional</b> German <b>surrender,</b> Britain adopted the position that the Convention no longer applied, since the two sides were no longer at war.
