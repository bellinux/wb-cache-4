5|$|In October 2013, the OPCW {{directly}} inspected 21 of the 23 sites. The OPCW {{was able}} to indirectly confirm that the other two, <b>unreachable,</b> sites had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|For their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden {{commissioned}} an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport. The aeroplane {{was converted}} into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, thereby allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed <b>unreachable</b> logistically. It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway <b>unreachable</b> with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home with}} Kaminsky, Incanto invites her inside, but quickly retracts his {{invitation}} {{when he sees}} the lights on in his apartment. After leaving Kaminsky, Incanto finds and kills Monica in his apartment after she discovers Cross' body in his bathtub. When Jessie asks Incanto about her mother's whereabouts, he denies seeing her. However, Jessie smells her mother's perfume in Incanto's apartment and calls the police. When they arrive, Incanto is gone, but his computer gives a list of women he has been in contact with. After trying to contact each woman in the given list, only two are <b>unreachable,</b> one being Kaminsky.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} access to unlockable {{abilities}} that can open new paths of exploration, such as shrinking to access small areas like vents, teleportation which allows the player to reach otherwise <b>unreachable</b> platforms, and farts which trigger an explosion that defeats nearby enemies when combined with a naked flame. Actions committed against enemies outside of battle affects them in combat; the player or opponent who strikes first to trigger a fight will have the first turn in battle. Combat {{takes place in a}} battle area separate from the open game world. Battles use turn-based gameplay and each character takes a turn to attack or defend before yielding to the next character.|$|E
5|$|While there, Lennon was {{inspired}} to embark on two recording projects: to make an album of the old rock 'n' roll songs that inspired {{him to become a}} musician, and to produce another artist. In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album, Rock 'n' Roll. The alcohol-fueled recording sessions became legendary. Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate, but soon Lennon's drinking and Spector's erratic behavior (which included his firing a gun in the studio control room) caused the sessions to break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took the sessions tapes and was <b>unreachable.</b>|$|E
5|$|God of War is a third-person single player action-adventure {{video game}} with hack and slash elements, viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player {{controls}} the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including undead soldiers, harpies, minotaurs, Medusa and her Gorgons, cyclopes, wraiths, Sirens, satyrs, centaurs, cerberuses, and boss opponents—the Hydra {{and a giant}} minotaur known as Pandora's Guardian. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can {{use it as a}} jumping-off point to access a pathway <b>unreachable</b> with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus is a third-person single-player {{video game}} viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player {{controls}} the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including cyclopes, Gorgons, satyrs, harpies, minotaurs, hoplites, and sphinxes. Morpheus beasts, shades, banshees, fire guards, fire sentries, hyperion guards, and death knights were created {{specifically for the}} game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can {{use it as a}} jumping-off point to access a pathway <b>unreachable</b> with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two weapons {{new to the}} Metroid series: the tri-splitting Spazer Laser Beam, and the Plasma Beam, which {{passes through}} enemies when shot. Samus can only equip one beam at a time; however, she can switch between them by returning to where they are first found. Metroid II features the Space Jump, a new suit enhancement that allows Samus to jump infinitely and access otherwise <b>unreachable</b> areas. The game also sees the return of Samus' Morph Ball, a mode in which she curls up into a ball to travel through small tunnels. In addition, the game {{is the first in}} the series to feature the Spider Ball and Spring Ball. The Spider Ball allows Samus to climb most walls or ceilings, giving her freedom to explore both the surfaces and ceilings of caverns, and the Spring Ball gives Samus the ability to jump while curled up into a ball in the Morph Ball form.|$|E
5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an <b>unreachable</b> goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E
5|$|The game world {{consists}} {{of a number of}} rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The player character is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world. The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly. Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be <b>unreachable</b> or require a detour. The player starts each game with three lives; the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured. If the player loses all their heart strength, their heart stops, resulting in a lost life. Players can render themselves invisible and invincible for a limited period three times on a single life. When the player character is invisible, he can fire the laser in order to determine his current location.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was <b>unreachable</b> due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine cable system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E
25|$|The BlackNurse {{attack is}} an example of an attack taking {{advantage}} of the required Destination Port <b>Unreachable</b> ICMP packets.|$|E
25|$|Every {{context-free}} grammar can be effectively {{transformed into a}} weakly equivalent one without <b>unreachable</b> symbols, a weakly equivalent one without unproductive symbols, and a weakly equivalent one without cycles.|$|E
25|$|UDP {{scanning}} is also possible, {{although there}} are technical challenges. UDP is a connectionless protocol {{so there is no}} equivalent to a TCP SYN packet. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a port that is not open, the system will respond with an ICMP port <b>unreachable</b> message. Most UDP port scanners use this scanning method, and use the absence of a response to infer that a port is open. However, if a port is blocked by a firewall, this method will falsely report that the port is open. If the port <b>unreachable</b> message is blocked, all ports will appear open. This method is also affected by ICMP rate limiting.|$|E
25|$|Count to {{infinity}} if link or node failures render a node <b>unreachable</b> from some set of other nodes, those nodes may spend forever gradually increasing their {{estimates of the}} distance to it, {{and in the meantime}} there may be routing loops.|$|E
25|$|For back-country campers, hanging food between {{trees at}} a height <b>unreachable</b> to bears {{is a common}} procedure, {{although}} some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An alternative to hanging food {{is to use a}} bear canister.|$|E
25|$|A scammer {{contacts}} {{the victim}}'s banker or broker, impersonating the victim {{to request a}} funds transfer. The banker's attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim's telephone lines are being flooded with thousands of bogus calls, rendering the victim <b>unreachable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{structure of}} graphene improves charging and discharging. Charge carriers in vertically oriented sheets can quickly migrate into {{or out of}} the deeper structures of the electrode, thus increasing currents. Such capacitors may be suitable for 100/120Hz filter applications, which are <b>unreachable</b> for supercapacitors using other carbon materials.|$|E
25|$|Prodi's {{economic}} programme consisted {{in continuing}} the past governments' work of {{restoration of the}} country's economic health, in order to pursue the then seemingly <b>unreachable</b> goal of leading the country within the strict European Monetary System parameters {{in order to allow}} the country to join the Euro currency. He succeeded in this in little more than six months.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} an article in Journal of Navigation, Vol. 9, No. 3, December 2011, avers that due to {{insufficient}} fuel reserves from 1912 GMT, no land other than Howland itself and Baker at 45 miles could be reached. With a maximum ferry range of 2,740 statute miles even the closest islands Winslow Reef and McKean Island at 210 and 350 miles away respectively, were <b>unreachable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Players gain {{influence}} {{in areas of}} the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort or establishing camps, which are used to provide fast travel and resupply points. Operations can be discovered to repair various structures and pathways, such as bridges or collapsed caves. These operations will allow exploration of previously <b>unreachable</b> locations and side quests.|$|E
25|$|Despite the momentous event, Lee did {{not call}} for the {{parliament}} to convene to reconcile issues that Singapore would face immediately as a new nation. Without giving further instructions on who should act in his absence, he went into isolation for six weeks, <b>unreachable</b> by phone, on a Singapore island. According to Dr Toh Chin Chye, the parliament hung in suspended animation until the sitting in December that year.|$|E
25|$|Digg's version 4 {{release was}} {{initially}} unstable. The site was <b>unreachable</b> or unstable for weeks after its launch on August 25, 2010. Many users, upon finally reaching the site, {{complained about the}} new design {{and the removal of}} many features (such as bury, favorites, friends submissions, upcoming pages, subcategories, videos and history search). Kevin Rose replied to complaints on his blog, promising to fix the algorithm and restore some features.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{dressing}} in that the limb is <b>unreachable</b> during treatment; the skin under the plaster becomes dry and scaly because the discarded outer skin cells are not washed or brushed off. Also, plaster of Paris casts can result in cutaneous complications including macerations, ulcerations, infections, rashes, itching, burns, and allergic contact dermatitis, which may also be due to the presence of formaldehyde within the plaster bandages. In hot weather, staphylococcal infection of the hair follicles and sweat glands can lead to severe and painful dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|The Barton {{was also}} used to officially {{introduce}} a higher 400MT/s bus clock for the Socket A platform, which was used to gain some Barton models more efficiency (and increased PR). However, it was clear by this time that Intel's quad-pumped bus was scaling well above AMD's double-pumped EV6 bus. The 800MT/s bus used by many later Pentium 4 processors was well out of the Athlon XP's reach. In order to reach the same bandwidth levels, the AthlonXP's bus {{would have to be}} clocked at levels simply <b>unreachable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 32nd Division was {{subordinated to}} the 12th Army and {{transferred}} to China in May 1939 {{to participate in the}} Second Sino-Japanese War, initially posted to Shanxi. Due to the Japanese defeat in the Battle of Suixian–Zaoyang, the initially assigned positions became <b>unreachable</b> and the 32nd Division arrived in southeast Shantung in June 1939 and saw action in the 1939–40 Winter Offensive, initially protecting the Tai'an - Tengzhou line. The division was able to start a counter-attack on 2 December 1939 as part of the Shandong Operation. After the offensive, the 32nd Division was garrisoned at Jinan.|$|E
25|$|The Fujinuma {{irrigation}} dam in Sukagawa ruptured, causing {{flooding and}} washing away five homes. Eight people were missing and four bodies were {{discovered by the}} morning. Reportedly, some locals had attempted to repair leaks in the dam before it completely failed. On 12 March 252 dams were inspected and {{it was discovered that}} six embankment dams had shallow cracks on their crests. The reservoir at one concrete gravity dam suffered a small non-serious slope failure. All damaged dams are functioning with no problems. Four dams within the quake area were <b>unreachable.</b> When the roads clear, experts will be dispatched to conduct further investigations.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, {{letters from}} readers in The Ladder {{appeared}} that expressed exasperation {{with the emphasis}} on conformity in the DOB. In the 1970s, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon reflected that by contemporary standards, the early ideals of the DOB for integration and adjustment of the lesbian into society were outmoded, but they remembered that in the 1950s and early 1960s many gay men and lesbians considered those ideals <b>unreachable,</b> and this approach radical. The DOB never had the number of members comparable to the Mattachine Society's. Although some may have considered the DOB's ideals unrealistic, some also considered them too tame.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin {{changes are}} a {{plausible}} {{explanation for the}} co-regulation seen in clusters. Chromatin consists of the DNA strand and histones that {{are attached to the}} DNA. Regions were chromatin is very tightly packed are called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin consists very often of remains of viral genomes, transposons and other junk DNA. Because of tight packing the DNA is almost <b>unreachable</b> for the transcript machinery, covering deleterious DNA with proteins {{is the way in which}} the cell can protect itself. Chromatin which consists of functional genes is often an open structure were the DNA is accessible. However, most of the genes are not needed to be expressed all the time.|$|E
25|$|During Matthew's passage, high winds, heavy rainfall, {{and deadly}} tides lashed the Tiburon Peninsula in {{southwest}} Haiti. Nationwide, the hurricane nearly or completely destroyed around 200,000homes, leaving 1.4million {{people in need}} of humanitarian aid. Monetary damage was estimated at US$1.9billion. Nearly complete crop damage occurred in Grand'Anse and Sud departments, leaving the impoverished population without a source of food. Communication networks and the road system were also compromised. After the hurricane washed away the Petit-Goâve Bridge, southwestern Haiti was temporarily <b>unreachable</b> from {{the remainder of the}} country, which slowed the distribution of emergency aid. The ongoing cholera outbreak worsened after the hurricane, killing at least 29people.|$|E
25|$|Heavensward {{features}} {{new areas}} which are {{about three times}} as large as zones in the base game. The reason for the size increase is to accommodate flying gameplay. After completing certain quests and attuning to the air currents in an area, players gain {{the ability to use}} new flying mounts, such as airships, in that location. Flying allows access to previously <b>unreachable</b> points in the terrain. Airships built by Free Companies also have the ability to explore the Sea of Clouds for rare materials, as well as the Diadem—an open world area where players can challenge large monsters for high level gear and spoils.|$|E
25|$|E. imperialis {{typically}} feed on nectar from flowering plants, {{particularly of}} the orchid species. Studies {{have shown that}} the nectar intake rate for E. imperialis is determined primarily by nectar viscosity rather than nectar sweetness, as measured by sucrose concentrations. E. imperialis also visits a wide variety of deep flowering plants, <b>unreachable</b> to most other bee species, such as Bignoniaceae, Costaceae, and Marantaceae, as well as understorey herbs such as Costus laevis and Costus allenii, which are entirely dependent on female E. imperialis for pollination and cross-fertilization. Male euglossines have also been observed to collect chemical fragrances from floral sources—such as Orchidaceae, Solanaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Euphorbiaceae—as well as non-floral sources, including decaying wood, rotting fruit, animal feces, and tree wounds.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, {{a series}} of Michelson–Morley type {{experiments}} were conducted, confirming relativity to even higher precision than the original experiment. Another type of interferometer experiment was the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment in 1932, by which {{the independence of the}} speed of light from the velocity of the apparatus was confirmed. Also time dilation was directly measured in the Ives–Stilwell experiment in 1938 and by measuring the decay rates of moving particles in 1940. All of those experiments have been repeated several times with increased precision. In addition, that the speed of light is <b>unreachable</b> for massive bodies was measured in many tests of relativistic energy and momentum. Therefore, knowledge of those relativistic effects is required in the construction of particle accelerators.|$|E
25|$|After the British {{victory in}} the Mauritius {{campaign}} of 1809–1811, all French possessions in the Indian Ocean were {{at the hands of}} Britain. France had already lost the use of Cape Town in 1806 after the Battle of Blaauwberg, and of Batavia in 1811 with the British Invasion of Java. Thus, in 1813, the French Navy lacked the advance bases it needed to support the commerce raiding frigate squadron that it had operated in the previous decade. It was therefore decided to send a force off the Western coast of Africa to disrupt British shipping closer to the metropole, but still far enough to be <b>unreachable</b> to the powerful British naval divisions that blockaded the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
25|$|After his arduous travels, Nansen {{decided on}} 7April that the pole was <b>unreachable</b> and instead headed for Cape Fligely on Rudolf Island, {{which had been}} {{discovered}} by Payer. Nansen and Johansen were thus able to establish that there was not, as Payer had predicted, any land north of 82°. The duo spotted their first land on 24July, which Nansen named Eva Island after his wife and Liv Island for his daughter. These {{turned out to be}} the same island and is now named Eva-Liv Island. They reached Adelaide Island on 10August, and for the first time in two years stood on dry land. By this point both their watches had become unreliable and they were therefore unable to establish exact locations. The last dog was subsequently shot and the journey continued by kayak.|$|E
