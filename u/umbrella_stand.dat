5|$|Inside a large, modernist house, Gerald (Lawson) {{turns on}} Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 {{and sits down}} to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen. Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked {{to see that the}} pair have come to steal an almost {{completely}} white painting. Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a Yorkshire Terrier out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an Irish Wolfhound. As Ray releases the wolfhound, Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window, so Ray stuffs the dog into an <b>umbrella</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his career, {{it becomes}} clear that Poirot's {{retirement}} is no longer a convenient fiction. [...] He assumes a genuinely inactive lifestyle during which he concerns himself with studying famous unsolved cases of the past and reading detective novels. He even writes a book about mystery fiction in which he deals sternly with Edgar Allan Poe and Wilkie Collins. [...] In the absence of a more appropriate puzzle, he solves such inconsequential domestic riddles as the presence of three pieces of orange peel in his <b>umbrella</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some people {{argue that}} the Gibson Girl was the first {{national}} beauty standard for American women. Gibson's fictional images of her published in newspapers and magazines during the Belle Époque were extremely popular.

50|$|James Rowland Ward (1848-1912) was a British {{taxidermist}} {{and founder}} of the firm Rowland Ward Limited of Piccadilly, London. The company specialised in and was renowned for its taxidermy work on birds and big-game trophies, but it did other types of work as well. In creating many practical items from antlers, feathers, feet, skins, and tusks, the Rowland Ward company made fashionable items from animal parts, such as zebra-hoof inkwells, antler furniture, and elephant-feet <b>umbrella</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R

A Kate Greenaway stand was made, which contained figures on panels representing spring and autumn.

30|$|Built form {{can suggest}} territory, {{but it is}} the act of {{occupation}} that defines the extent of a territorial claim. The actual territorial boundary is indicated not by the building but by parts and objects; potted plants, door mats, and <b>umbrella</b> <b>stands</b> in front of residents’ entries in the corridors as examples. Their claim is understood and respected as an identification of territory. The margin created thus softens and articulates the razor-thin line of demarcation offered by architecture (Habraken 2000).|$|R

5000|$|Wedgwood {{began to}} {{manufacture}} majolica {{about ten years}} after Mintons. Wedgwood's glazes and modelling were denser and more formal than Minton's, but there were many pieces that displayed the naturalism and humour of Minton shapes. Wedgwood's majolica included cachepots, jugs, candlesticks, cheese bells, <b>umbrella</b> <b>stands,</b> sardine boxes, plates in naturalistic patterns, bread trays, etc. In Wedgwood's [...] "greenware" [...] the green glaze emphasizes the low relief patterning, typically of basketwork and foliage. Numerous smaller factories in the Staffordshire Potteries specialised in such green majolica wares in which the translucent glaze brought out the low relief of the cast body: some, like Wedgwood, marked their majolica with impressed stamps.|$|R
6000|$|Booth's home at {{this time}} was on Beacon Hill, and I used to walk reverently by just {{to see where the}} great man housed. Once, the door being open, I caught a {{momentary}} glimpse of a curiously ornate <b>umbrella</b> <b>stand,</b> and the soft glow of a distant lamp, and the vision greatly enriched me. This singularly endowed artist presented to me the radiant summit of human happiness and glory, and to see him walk in or out of his door was my silent hope, but alas, this felicity was denied me! ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{they heard}} slippered feet going {{to and fro}} in Hapley's room. A chair was overturned, {{and there was a}} violent dab at the wall. Then a china mantel {{ornament}} smashed upon the fender. Suddenly the door of the room opened, and they heard him upon the landing. They clung to one another, listening. He seemed to be dancing upon the staircase. Now he would go down three or four steps quickly, then up again, then hurry down into the hall. They heard the <b>umbrella</b> <b>stand</b> go over, and the fanlight break. Then the bolt shot and the chain rattled. He was opening the door.|$|E
60|$|The glass {{pavilion}} {{springs from}} a bridgelike arch {{in the wall}} of the house, through which one comes into a big hall with tiled flooring, which suggests that the proprietor's notion of domestic luxury is founded on the lounges of week-end hotels. The arch is not quite in the centre of the wall. There is more wall to its right than to its left, and this space is occupied by a hat rack and <b>umbrella</b> <b>stand</b> in which tennis rackets, white parasols, caps, Panama hats, and other summery articles are bestowed. Just through the arch at this corner stands a new portable Turkish bath, recently unpacked, with its crate beside it, and on the crate the drawn nails and the hammer used in unpacking. Near the crate are open boxes of garden games: bowls and croquet. Nearly {{in the middle of the}} glass wall of the pavilion is a door giving on the garden, with a couple of steps to surmount the hot-water pipes which skirt the glass. At intervals round the pavilion are marble pillars with specimens of Viennese pottery on them, very flamboyant in colour and florid in design. Between them are folded garden chairs flung anyhow against the pipes. In the side walls are two doors: one near the hat stand, leading to the interior of the house, the other on the opposite side and at the other end, leading to the vestibule.|$|E
60|$|Morel, {{thinking}} nothing, dragged {{his way up}} {{the garden}} path, wearily and angrily. He closed his <b>umbrella,</b> and <b>stood</b> it in the sink; then he sluthered his heavy boots into the kitchen. Mrs. Bower appeared in the inner doorway.|$|R
50|$|Owens Pottery {{was founded}} by J. B. Owens in Roseville, Ohio, in 1885. In 1891 it moved to Zanesville, where Owens built a new factory on a site with its own rail spur. It began {{producing}} art pottery in 1896, when it introduced the Utopian line with botanical decorations under a brown glaze. All told, it produced some four dozen different lines of art pottery, with types ranging from vases, bowls, and pitchers to <b>umbrella</b> <b>stands</b> and lamps. Popular lines included Utopian, Lightweight, Lotus, Henri Deux, and Matte Green. Especially distinctive lines include Red Flame (featuring slip decoration under a red glaze), Mission (depicting Spanish missions), and Coralene (featuring small bead decorations).|$|R
60|$|Dan {{answered}} not at all, but crept on tip-toe, {{with large}} strides, to the mess-room, the men following. The room was empty. In a corner, cased like the King of Dahomey's state <b>umbrella,</b> <b>stood</b> the regimental Colours. Dan lifted them tenderly and unrolled {{in the light}} of the candles the record of the Mavericks--tattered, worn, and hacked. The white satin was darkened everywhere with big brown stains, the gold threads on the crowned harp were frayed and discoloured, and the Red Bull, the totem of the Mavericks, was coffee-hued. The stiff, embroidered folds, whose price is human life, rustled down slowly. The Mavericks keep their colours long and guard them very sacredly.|$|R
60|$|Having {{little or}} no notion where to go, they walked in the {{direction}} of Bayswater. To place the Park between Hound Street and the little model was the first essential. On arriving at {{the other side of the}} Broad Walk, they made instinctively away from every sight of green. In a long, grey street of dismally respectable appearance they found what they were looking for, a bed-sitting room furnished, advertised on a card in the window. The door was opened by the landlady, a tall woman of narrow build, with a West-Country accent, and a rather hungry sweetness running through her hardness. They stood talking with her in a passage, whose oilcloth of variegated pattern emitted a faint odour. The staircase could be seen climbing steeply up past walls covered with a shining paper cut by narrow red lines into small yellow squares. An almanack, of so floral a design that nobody would surely want to steal it, hung on the wall; below it was an <b>umbrella</b> <b>stand</b> without umbrellas. The dim little passage led past two grimly closed doors painted rusty red to two half-open doors with dull glass in their panels. Outside, in the street from which they had mounted by stone steps, a shower of sleet had begun to fall. Hilary shut the door, but the cold spirit of that shower had already slipped into the bleak, narrow house.|$|E
6000|$|I {{suggest that}} the causes which have {{produced}} this sudden clearing of the air include the transformation of many modern States, notably the old self-contained French Republic and the tight little Island of Britain, into empires which overflow the frontiers of all the Churches. In India, for example, there are less than four million Christians out of a population of three hundred and sixteen and a half millions. The King of England is the defender of the faith; but what faith is now THE faith? The inhabitants of this island would, within the memory of persons still living, have claimed that their faith is surely the faith of God, and that all others are heathen. But we islanders are only forty-five millions; and if we count ourselves all as Christians, there are still seventy-seven and a quarter million Mahometans in the Empire. Add to these the Hindoos and Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains, whom I was taught in my childhood, by way of religious instruction, to regard as gross idolators consigned to eternal perdition, but whose faith I can now be punished for disparaging by a provocative word, {{and you have a}} total of over three hundred and forty-two and a quarter million heretics to swamp our forty-five million Britons, of whom, by the way, only six thousand call themselves distinctively [...] "disciples of Christ," [...] the rest being members of the Church of England and other denominations whose discipleship is less emphatically affirmed. In short, the Englishman of today, instead of being, like the forefathers whose ideas he clings to, a subject of a State practically wholly Christian, is now crowded, and indeed considerably overcrowded, into a corner of an Empire in which the Christians are a mere eleven per cent of the population; so that the Nonconformist who allows his <b>umbrella</b> <b>stand</b> to be sold up rather than pay rates towards the support of a Church of England school, finds himself paying taxes not only to endow the Church of Rome in Malta, but to send Christians to prison for the blasphemy of offering Bibles for sale in the streets of Khartoum. Turn to France, a country ten times more insular in its pre-occupation with its own language, its own history, its own character, than we, who have always been explorers and colonizers and grumblers. This once self-centred nation is forty millions strong. The total population of the French Republic is about one hundred and fourteen millions. The French are not in our hopeless Christian minority of eleven per cent; but they are in a minority of thirty-five per cent, which is fairly conclusive. And, being a more logical people than we, they have officially abandoned Christianity and declared that the French State has no specific religion.|$|E

5000|$|An {{element of}} poetry {{injected}} into the tale of Mozart's death and funeral is a winter storm. A memoir attributed to one Joseph Deiner, who was {{claimed to have been}} present, appeared in the Vienna Morgen-Post of 28 January 1856. The night of Mozart's death was dark and stormy at the funeral, too, it began to rage and storm. Rain and snow fell at the same time, as if Nature wanted to shew her anger with the great composer's contemporaries, who had turned out extremely sparsely for his burial. Only a few friends and three women accompanied the corpse. Mozart's wife was not present. These few people with their <b>umbrellas</b> <b>stood</b> round the bier, which then taken via the Grosse Schullerstrasse to the St. Marx Cemetery. As the storm grew ever more violent, even these few friends determined to turn back at the Stuben Gate, and they betook themselves to the [...] "Silver Snake". Deiner, the landlord, was also present for the funeral. As Slonimsky (1960:12-14) notes, the tale was widely adopted and incorporated into Mozart biographies.|$|R
