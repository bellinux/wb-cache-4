40|$|In {{the last}} decade diode-array {{detection}} {{has proved to be}} extremely useful in high performance liquid chromatography in recording <b>UV-visible</b> <b>spectra</b> directly and on-line in the column effluent. In capillary electrophoresis (CE) only fast-scanning detectors with long scan times (up to 2 s) are commercially available. A home-made CE instrument with a diode-array detector (DAD) was built and compared with a commercial fast-scanning detector. It is shown that the fast-scanning detector is advantageous when less than eight wavelengths are monitored. Due to the high data collection rate the DAD is superior if high resolution <b>UV-visible</b> <b>spectra</b> are acquired or if several spectra of a narrow peak (usual peak width in CE below 5 s) are needed for peak purity control.
