50|$|The major motives {{behind the}} {{creation}} of National Parks in Canada were profit and preservation. Inspired by the establishment and success of Yellowstone National Park in the United States, Canada blended the conflicting ideas of preservation and commercialism {{in order to satisfy}} its natural resource needs, conservationist views of modern management, a growing public interest in the outdoors and the new popularity of getting back to nature. This growing interest to escape the hustle and bustle of the city brought about ideas of conserving Canada's <b>unspoiled</b> <b>wildernesses</b> by creating public parks. As a country dependent on natural resources, Canada’s National Parks represent an example of a compromise between the demand for profit from the land’s resources and tourism, with the need for preservation and sustainable development.|$|R

5000|$|Walker has {{traditionally}} been considered a “regionalist” writer, as four of her novels, including “Winter Wheat” and “Curlew’s Cry”, are set {{in the state of}} Montana.

It has been suggested that the publication of A.B Guthrie’s “The Big Sky” in 1947 and “The Way West” in 1950, with its romanticized [...] "mutely tragic" [...] mountain man character and <b>unspoiled</b> scenic <b>wildernesses,</b> turned American reader interest away from the modern West to a focus on the vision of a “…prairie-and mountain Eden, always long-gone.” [...] Walker’s grounded work that explored the farming and ranching life that came after the period of westward exploration, became less memorable in the shadow of this new, heroic, and mythologized “Old West”.|$|R

40|$|When I {{joined the}} faculty of the University of Michigan Law School in 2007, the first {{assignment}} I gave students in my Environmental Law and Policy class was John McPhee 2 ̆ 7 s Encounters with the Archdruid. It must have seemed like a curious choice to them, particularly coming from a professor who just three months earlier had been the Chief of the Environmental Crimes Section at the U. S. Department of Justice. The book was not a dramatic tale of courtroom battles. In fact, the book was not even about the law, and the clash of environmental values it depicted pre-dated the environmental statutes that were the focus of the course. Encounters with the Archdruid chronicles outings McPhee organized during the 1960 s with David Brower, the first Executive Director of the Sierra Club {{and one of the most}} influential environmental activists of his generation. Brower was an unapologetic advocate for conservation at a time when we still believed that anything was possible in the United States and that America had an endless bounty of natural resources to support economic growth. McPhee paired Brower with three antagonists who had very different ideas about our relationship with the environment: Charles Park, the former Dean of Stanford University 2 ̆ 7 s School of Earth Sciences and a proponent of mining in the Cascade mountains; Charles Fraser, the developer of Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, who had similar plans to develop Cumberland Island off the Georgia coast; and Floyd Dominy, the indomitable Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, who wanted to dam the Colorado River near the Grand Canyon. The stories in Encounters with the Archdruid occurred more than forty years ago, but I assigned the book to my students both for historical context and because the disagreements it describes about our environmental values remain potent today. As they hiked in the Cascades, Brower and Park argued about whether copper mining should be allowed in protected wilderness near Glacier Peak. Brower observed that the Cascades are 2 ̆ 2 one of the few remaining great wildernesses in the lower forty-eight 2 ̆ 2 and asked, 2 ̆ 2 Would America have to go without much to leave its finest <b>wilderness</b> <b>unspoiled?</b> 2 ̆ 2 Park countered that 2 ̆ 2 [m]inerals are where you find them. The quantities are finite. It 2 ̆ 7 s criminal to waste minerals when the standard of living of your people depends upon them. 2 ̆ 2 For anyone who has followed the debate over proposals to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the conflict and the language are familiar (only now the argument is about oil rather than copper, and the wilderness is in Alaska instead of Washington) ...|$|R

50|$|Arcadia (Ἀρκαδία) {{refers to}} a vision of {{pastoralism}} and harmony with nature. The term {{is derived from the}} Greek province of the same name which dates to antiquity; the province's mountainous topography and sparse population of pastoralists later caused the word Arcadia to develop into a poetic byword for an idyllic vision of <b>unspoiled</b> <b>wilderness.</b> Arcadia is a poetic shaped space associated with bountiful natural splendor and harmony. The 'Garden' is often inhabited by shepherds. The concept also figures in Renaissance mythology. Although commonly thought of as being in line with Utopian ideals, Arcadia differs from that tradition in that it is more often specifically regarded as unattainable. Furthermore, it is seen as a lost, Edenic form of life, contrasting to the progressive nature of Utopian desires.|$|E

40|$|Wilderness Lodge, {{one of the}} deluxe-category {{hotels in}} Walt Disney World, opened for {{business}} {{in the spring of}} 1994. This 728 room, luxury to semi-luxury priced, hotel is imagineered to resemble Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful Inn. It is built with massive logs imported directly from Washington State and rises eight floors above the shores of similarly Disney-imagineered Bay Lake within the Magic Kingdom compound. The themed back story of Wilderness Lodge harkens to the early 1900 s period of National Park development, where "rustic " lodg-ing was considered a more appropriate means by which to con-sume, yet also preserve nature's wonders.

They did not run into wild bands of ravenous savages bent on their destruction, nor did they ever have to contend with the full force of nature’s fury. In fact, they walked into an abandoned village, whose inhabitants had been gone barely long enough for weeds to grow over the tilled fields of corn. They discovered caches of crops, tools, and other supplies, as if they were waiting to be found and put into use by industrious hands. They moved quietly into a graveyard and built their shining example of a city on the hill directly on the still-exposed carcasses of dead Indians...|$|E
