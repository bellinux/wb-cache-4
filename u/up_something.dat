Jerking activity may start {{in a specific}} muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it {{is known as a}} Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick <b>up</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put <b>up</b> <b>something</b> he likes instead.|$|E

Xander enters Giles' {{apartment}} as Spike, his mouth wet with blood, bends down to pick <b>up</b> <b>something</b> that he dropped {{in front of the}} sofa where Anya sleeps. Inferring that Spike bit and drank from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E

25|$|Lou Henry {{was born}} in Waterloo, Iowa, to banker Charles Delano Henry and Florence Ida Weed. Lou grew <b>up</b> <b>something</b> of a tomboy in Waterloo, as well as Whittier, California, and Monterey, California. Charles Henry took his {{daughter}} on camping trips in the hills—her greatest pleasures in her early teens. Lou became a fine horsewoman; she hunted, and preserved specimens with the skill of a taxidermist; she developed an enthusiasm for rocks, minerals, and mining.|$|E
25|$|Located {{in central}} Highbury {{the library is}} about seven miles (11km) distant from the more remote areas of Beach Haven and Birkdale. As a consequence, from the mid-1960s there was a {{persistent}} call to establish a more convenient branch location. Petitioned by residents the Borough Council considered the possibility of setting <b>up</b> <b>something</b> in the Beach Haven hall on a temporary basis, {{to see if it}} would take. They asked the then Chief Librarian Ann Clegg to prepare a report looking into the details.|$|E
25|$|More {{surprising}} was {{the analysis}} of the rat-poison paste; {{it turned out to be}} nothing more than a mixture of flour, water and soda. This led to the possibility that Marie used the real arsenic to murder her husband. Any remaining doubts that may have lingered vanished when Emma Pontier turned over the small malachite box, and Dr. Lespinasse found it to contain arsenic. Marie was arrested and held in jail in Brive. A young French lawyer, Charles Lachaud, was appointed to her defence and was assisted by three others, Maîtres Théodore Bac (who later became mayor of Limoges during the 1848 Revolution), Paillet, and Desmont. Before they began their work, there was another surprise in store. The newspaper stories regarding Marie Lafarge turned <b>up</b> <b>something</b> from her past.|$|E

25|$|The Smiths then {{agreed to}} sign a record {{contract}} with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract. Only Morrissey and Marr signed it {{on behalf of the}} band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided <b>up,</b> <b>something</b> that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case. To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in Troy Tate of The Teardrop Explodes, and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, at the Elephant Studios in Wapping, East London. Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, John Porter.|$|E

500|$|George's {{character}} {{has been described}} as [...] "naughty" [...] and [...] "mischievous", as well as [...] "nutty". She added that Harris' sexuality is not the main aspect of her personality. George called her character [...] "broken", and opined that her outgoing personality is meant to cover <b>up</b> <b>something</b> else. George stated that the way she portrayed Harris was influenced by the outspokenness of Lisa Rowe, a sociopathic character from Girl, Interrupted (1999) played by Angelina Jolie.|$|E

500|$|Mitch Pileggi was {{disappointed}} {{in the fact that}} the episode featured his character, Walter Skinner, getting beat <b>up,</b> <b>something</b> which had occurred in multiple episodes already by this point: [...] "I was feeling a little uncomfortable with him getting his ass kicked so much, and I think the fans were, too." [...] Dave Grohl, the lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters and former drummer for Nirvana, made a small cameo, along with his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood, in the episode during the scene wherein Modell sneaks into the FBI building. Grohl, who has an active interest in UFO lore, called the episode [...] "his acting debut".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} officially premiered on February 21, 2010 on ABC Family, but was {{previously}} {{leaked to the}} Internet on September 11, 2009. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News congratulated Shankman for capturing romance in the video. She further commented, [...] "Cyrus is definitely growing <b>up,</b> <b>something</b> she's wanted {{to prove to the}} world for a while now. And although there's nothing particularly jarring in the clip, the vibe shows that Cyrus is most certainly ready to leave Hannah Montana behind." [...] Jefferson Reid of E! reviewed the version where clips from the film are used, and said the clips made production values high, [...] "but also helping to keep things easy on the eyes".|$|E
500|$|In response, Angus Fraser wrote: [...] "Obviously, {{it is sad}} to {{see such}} a dedicated, {{patriotic}} and likeable man forced to give <b>up</b> <b>something</b> that patently {{meant so much to}} him, but the inner torment that came with attempting to overcome the mental illness that prevented him from touring with England {{for more than two years}} had to be brought to an end. It was doing Trescothick and his family no good at all. Representing your country is a source of huge pride, but there are far more important things in life". Fraser also wrote: [...] "It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick's mental illness began to stir and the opener has not played an overseas test since".|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I {{was on the way}} to the bank, and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I was involved in this relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm {{on the way to the}} bank and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given <b>up</b> <b>something</b> that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|Given the UFA's formal {{adoption}} of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart [...] "an honourable, upright citizen, doing {{the best he could}} under difficult circumstances" [...] and boasted that [...] "if I have got to tear down the character of an honourable man to build <b>up</b> <b>something</b> that I want, I am not going to build it up." [...] When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to [...] "old style politics," [...] the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Benjamin Lee of The Guardian {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "despite the film {{constantly}} informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is, it's disappointingly difficult to truly care about what's taking place." [...] He blames Sorkin's [...] "dominating" [...] script, arguing that [...] "the dialogue stifles" [...] and that [...] "the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer <b>up</b> <b>something</b> of their own." [...] He also feels that while it is [...] "Boyle's best film for years," [...] his direction [...] "plays second fiddle" [...] to a script that verges {{on a kind of}} [...] "Apple-sponsored hero iWorship." [...] Joe Nocera of The New York Times, who knew Jobs well, took issue with [...] "how little the film {{has to do with the}} flesh and blood Steve Jobs." [...] Characterizing the movie as pure [...] "fiction", he went on to say, [...] "In ways both large and small, Sorkin − as well as Michael Fassbender, the actor who plays Jobs − has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2015, Michael Doran of Newsarama and Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter had a [...] "point-counterpoint" [...] {{debate in}} {{response}} to the first Ant-Man trailer. Doran stated, [...] "Marvel has raised the bar [...] high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [...] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it". McMillian responded, [...] "at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer <b>up</b> <b>something</b> like [...] it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it [...] offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience [...] expecting something to knock their socks off." [...] Doran concluded, [...] "That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... Marvel [...] going to eventually falter." ...|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick <b>up</b> <b>something,</b> but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
500|$|She then won a {{supporting}} role in the futuristic 1995 film Tank Girl, winning the role of [...] "Jet Girl" [...] after nine auditions. While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it {{has gone on to}} become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: [...] "there were always little bites. Whenever I felt I {{was at the end of}} my rope, something would come <b>up.</b> <b>Something</b> bad. But for me it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto." [...] In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; and as the lead role in , in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.|$|E
