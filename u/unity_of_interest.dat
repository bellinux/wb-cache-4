When Mr. Carr accepted the hospitality of the old cabin again, it was understood that he had sacrificed the new house and its furniture {{to some of the}} more pressing debts of the mine, and the act went far to restore his waning popularity. But a more genuine feeling of relief was experienced by Devil's Ford when it was rumored that Fairfax Munroe had asked for the hand of Jessie Carr, and that some promise contingent upon the equitable adjustment of the affairs of the mine had been given by Mr. Carr. To the superstitious mind of Devil's Ford and its few remaining locators, this new partnership seemed to promise that <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and stability of fortune that Devil's Ford had lacked. But nothing could be done until the rainy season had fairly set in; until the long-looked-for element that was to magically separate the gold from the dross in those dull mounds of dust and gravel had come of its own free will, and in its own appointed channels, independent of the feeble auxiliaries that had hopelessly riven the rocks on the hillside, or hung incomplete and unfinished in lofty scaffoldings above the settlement.|$|E
60|$|The {{tragedy of}} Tell wants <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and of action; {{but in spite}} of this, it may justly claim the high dignity of ranking with the very best of Schiller's plays. Less {{comprehensive}} and ambitious than Wallenstein, less ethereal than the Jungfrau, it has a look of nature and substantial truth, which neither of its rivals can boast of. The feelings it inculcates and appeals to are those of universal human nature, and presented in their purest, most unpretending form. There is no high-wrought sentiment, no poetic love. Tell loves his wife as honest men love their wives; and the episode of Bertha and Rudenz, though beautiful, is very brief, and without effect on the general result. It is delightful and salutary to the heart to wander among the scenes of Tell: all is lovely, yet all is real. Physical and moral grandeur are united; yet both are the unadorned grandeur of Nature. There are the lakes and green valleys beside us, the Schreckhorn, the Jungfrau, and their sister peaks, with their avalanches and their palaces of ice, all glowing in the southern sun; and dwelling among them are a race of manly husbandmen, heroic without ceasing to be homely, poetical without ceasing to be genuine.|$|E

It is not even always, or of necessity, an objection to them, that they prevent the illusion from rising to as great a height as it might otherwise have attained;—it is enough that they are simply compatible with as high a degree of it as is requisite for the purpose. Nay, upon particular occasions, a palpable improbability may be hazarded by a great genius for the express purpose of keeping down the interest of a merely instrumental scene, which would otherwise make too great an impression for the harmony of the entire illusion.

This want of public feeling, of 'solidarity,' amongst the several mining companies should be remedied with a strong hand. These men seem not to know that rivalry may be good in buying palm-oil, but is the wrong thing in mining. Such a jealousy assisted in making the Spanish proverb 'A silver mine brings wretchedness; a gold mine brings ruin.' Even in England I have met with unwise directors who told me, 'Oh, you must not say that, or people will prefer such and such a mine.' But, speaking generally, employers are aware that <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> should produce solidarity of action. The local employés like to breed divisions, {{in order to increase}} their own importance.

Not a single good quality {{traceable}} to this system has been brought to light in the white race at the South by the searching test of war. In the black it may have engendered that touching piety of which we have had so many proofs, and it has certainly given them the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and the sympathy of intelligence which make them everywhere our friends, and which have saved them from compromising their advantage, and still further complicating the difficulties of civil war by insurrection. But what have been its effects upon the ruling class, which is, after all, the supreme test of institutions? It has made them boastful, selfish, cruel, and false, to a degree unparalleled in history. So far from having given them any special fitness for rule, it has made them incapable of any but violent methods of government, and unable to deal with the simplest problems of political economy. An utter ignorance of their own countrymen at the North led them to begin the war, and an equal misconception of Europe encouraged them to continue it. That they have shown courage is true, but that is no exclusive property of theirs, and the military advantage they seemed to possess is due less to any superiority of their own than to the extent of their territory and the roadless wildernesses which are at once the reproach and the fortification of their wasteful system of agriculture. Their advantages in war have been in proportion to their disadvantages in peace, and it is peace which most convincingly tries both the vigor of a nation and the wisdom of its polity. It is with this class that we shall have to deal in arranging the conditions of settlement; and we must do it with a broad view of the interests of the whole country and of the great mass of the Southern people, whose ignorance and the prejudices consequent from it made it so easy to use them as the instruments of their own ruin. No immediate advantage must blind us to the real objects of the war,--the securing our external power and our internal tranquillity, and the making them inherent and indestructible by founding them upon the common welfare.|$|E

A key assumption {{is the extent}} to which {{the employment}} relationship necessarily includes conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> between employers and employees, and the form of such conflicts.

Eufronip Alip’s Philippines History (1967), a textbook for public school education, states at the outset the purpose of history is to “teach nationalism”, to enable people to “love their country, with determination and dignity…Common experiences and traditions, common struggles and sufferings, develop a <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and a deep attachment to one’s native land”. Using three sources of materials - oral traditions, relics and written records by Spanish missionaries and royal officials as well as accounts by other foreign writers, Alip replays this linear causal historiographical construction of the struggle for independence, manifested in three centuries of revolts, from the tribal and regional uprisings of 16th to 18th century, to the political and religious struggles in the 19th century, calling them “acts of Filipino heroism”. Alip’s historical narrative asserts the conventional view that unlike the disunified revolts of past centuries, the uprisings of the 19th century became much more widespread and culminated in the Revolution of 1896 that reverberated across “the entire Archipelago” {{and the emergence of}} a “consciousness <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> and homogeneity”.|$|R

40|$|Social {{scientists}} {{dealing with}} business and politics {{have tended to}} focus mostly {{on the power of}} business and less on the political challenges and constraints that business interest groups face. This paper analyses how business interest groups respond to political initiatives that challenge their interests, using four episodes of political conflict in Germany. The paper elaborates a model of response strategies and their likely impact on political outcomes. The model suggests that business interest groups can respond to political challenges in two ways: by seeking confrontation or by pursuing adaptation. The paper illustrates these two response strategies with four episodes of political conflict in the political-economic history of Germany: (i) the adoption of social insurance under Bismarck, (ii) the adoption of unemployment insurance in the 1920 s, (iii) the adoption of board-level codetermination in the early 1950 s, (iv) and the Agenda 2010 labour market reforms of the early 2000 s. These four case studies show that adaptation facilitates social compromise, while confrontation results in a bifurcated outcome, producing either dominance or defeat <b>of</b> business <b>interests,</b> depending on what side government takes. Furthermore, the analysis finds that confrontation tends to be associated with a <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> within the business community, while adaptation tends to be associated with a fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> The discussion emphasises that the role of business in politics should not be seen solely in terms of business ‘influencing’ politics, but also as potentially adaptive...|$|R
