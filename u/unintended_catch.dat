5000|$|Permanent or semipermanent {{deployment}} of shark-fishing gear off high-use beaches (which includes drum lines) {{have been very}} successful in reducing the incidence of shark attack at the protected beaches. [...] More recently, drumlines have also been used with great success in Recife, Brazil where the number of attacks {{has been shown to}} have reduced by 97% when the drumlines are deployed. While shark nets and drum lines share the same purpose, drum lines are more effective at targeting the three sharks that are considered most dangerous to swimmers: the bull shark, tiger shark and great white shark. [...] Drum Lines physically attract sharks from within the immediate vicinity using bait while shark nets allow the sharks to swim over or around them. The bycatch, or <b>unintended</b> <b>catch,</b> of drum lines is considerably less than that of shark nets.|$|E
40|$|The ocean covers nearly {{three-quarters of}} the planet and plays an {{essential}} role in supporting life on Earth. Its waters help regulate global chemistry and climate, and are home to over 2 million species, many of which still await discovery. 1 This rich biodiversity enhances the fisheries that provide food for more than 4 billion people. 2 As the human impact on the ocean intensifies, critical ecosystem benefits are being lost. Currents carry millions of tons of plastics and other debris from the shore into open waters, where the waste harms marine life and changes the way healthy ecosystems function. 3 Fishing also takes a toll. Worldwide, 4 million open-sea vessels catch more than 80 million metric tons of fish every year, 4 which has led to the global decline of marine fisheries. Today, 90 percent of stocks are fully exploited or overexploited. 5 New fishing technologies, such as massive steel deep-sea bottom trawls and sonar- and GPS-equipped fish aggregating devices, also degrade important ocean habitats and increase the amount of <b>unintended</b> <b>catch,</b> known as bycatch. The effects of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, such as rising ocean temperatures and increasingly acidic waters, further compound the stress on marine ecosystems. Large, fully protected marine reserves are a key tool for addressing many challenges to ocean health. These reserves protect ocean areas from human activities, such as large-scale fishing, extraction of natural resources, and other destructive uses. And that helps conserve species, habitats, and ecosystem processes. To date, however, about 2 percent of the world's ocean has been designated as fully protected marine reserves. Leading scientists strongly recommend that at least 30 percent be fully protected...|$|E
25|$|Fly {{fishing is}} most renowned {{as a method}} for {{catching}} trout, grayling and salmon, {{but it is also}} used {{for a wide variety of}} species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. Many fly anglers <b>catch</b> <b>unintended</b> species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for 'main target' species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. With the advancement of technology and development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become target species on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.|$|R
