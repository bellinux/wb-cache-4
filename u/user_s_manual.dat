40|$|The Prioritization Analysis Tool for All-Hazards/Analyzer for Wide Area Restoration Effectiveness (PATH/AWARE) {{software}} system, {{developed by}} Sandia National Laboratories, {{is a comprehensive}} decision support tool designed to analyze situational awareness, as well as response and recovery actions, following a wide-area release of chemical, biological or radiological materials. The system provides capability to prioritize critical infrastructure assets and services for restoration. It also provides a capability to assess resource needs (e. g., number of sampling teams, laboratory capacity, decontamination units, etc.), timelines for consequence management activities, and costs. PATH/AWARE is a very comprehensive tool set with {{a considerable amount of}} database information managed through a Microsoft SQL (Structured Query Language) database engine, a Geographical Information System (GIS) engine that provides comprehensive mapping capabilities, as well as comprehensive decision logic to carry out the functional aspects of the tool set.

40|$|Pratt & Whitney has {{developed}} a Broadband Fan Noise Prediction System (BFaNS) for turbofan engines. This system computes the noise generated by turbulence impinging on the leading edges of the fan and fan exit guide vane, and noise generated by boundary-layer turbulence passing over the fan trailing edge. BFaNS has been validated on three fan rigs that were tested during the NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology Program (AST). The predicted noise spectra agreed well with measured data. The predicted effects of fan speed, vane count, and vane sweep also agreed well with measurements. The noise prediction system consists of two computer programs: Setup_BFaNS and BFaNS. Setup_BFaNS converts user-specified geometry and flow-field information into a BFaNS input file. From this input file, BFaNS computes the inlet and aft broadband sound power spectra generated by the fan and FEGV. The output file from BFaNS contains the inlet, aft and total sound power spectra from each noise source. This report is {{the first volume of}} a three-volume set documenting the Broadband Fan Noise Prediction System: Volume 1 : Setup_BFaNS <b>User</b> <b>s</b> <b>Manual</b> and Developer s Guide; Volume 2 : BFaNS User's Manual and Developer s Guide; and Volume 3 : Validation and Test Cases.

It concludes with technical documentation of the Setup_BFaNS computer program...|$|E
40|$|Today s modern {{aircraft}} {{is based}} on air-breathing jet propulsion systems, which use moving fluids as substances to transform energy carried by the fluids into power. Throughout aero-vehicle evolution, improvements {{have been made to}} the engine efficiency and pollutants reduction. The major advantages associated with the addition of ITB are an increase in thermal efficiency and reduction in NOx emission. Lower temperature peak in the main combustor results in lower thermal NOx emission and lower amount of cooling air required. This study focuses on a parametric (on-design) cycle analysis of a dual-spool, separate-flow turbofan engine with an Interstage Turbine Burner (ITB). The ITB considered in this paper is a relatively new concept in modern jet engine propulsion. The ITB serves as a secondary combustor and is located between the high- and the low-pressure turbine, i. e., the transition duct. The objective {{of this study is to}} use design parameters, such as flight Mach number, compressor pressure ratio, fan pressure ratio, fan bypass ratio, and high-pressure turbine inlet temperature to obtain engine performance parameters, such as specific thrust and thrust specific fuel consumption. Results of this study can provide guidance in identifying the performance characteristics of various engine components, which can then be used to develop, analyze, integrate, and optimize the system performance of turbofan engines with an ITB. Visual Basic program, Microsoft Excel macrocode, and Microsoft Excel neuron code are used to facilitate Microsoft Excel software to plot engine performance versus engine design parameters. This program computes and plots the data sequentially without forcing users to open other types of plotting programs. A <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>manual</b> on how to use the program is also included in this report. Furthermore, this stand-alone program is written in conjunction with an off-design program which is an extension of this study. The computed result of a selected design-point engine will be exported to an engine reference data file that is required in off-design calculation...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{and analysis of}} turbomachinery components for industrial and aerospace applications has been greatly enhanced in recent years through the advent of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes and techniques. Although {{the use of this}} technology has greatly reduced the time required to perform analysis and design, there still remains much room for improvement in the process. In particular, there is a steep learning curve associated with most turbomachinery CFD codes, and the computation times need to be reduced in order to facilitate their integration into standard work processes. Two turbomachinery codes have recently been developed by Dr. Daniel Dorney (MSFC) and Dr. Douglas Sondak (Boston University). These codes are entitled Aardvark (for 2 -D and quasi 3 -D simulations) and Phantom (for 3 -D simulations). The codes utilize the General Equation Set (GES), structured grid methodology, and overset O- and H-grids. The codes have been used with success by Drs. Dorney and Sondak, as well as others within the turbomachinery community, to analyze engine components and other geometries. One of the primary objectives {{of this study was to}} establish a set of parametric input values which will enhance convergence rates for steady state simulations, as well as reduce the runtime required for unsteady cases. The goal is to reduce the turnaround time for CFD simulations, thus permitting more design parametrics to be run within a given time period. In addition, other code enhancements to reduce runtimes were investigated and implemented. The other primary goal of the study was to develop enhanced users manuals for Aardvark and Phantom. These manuals are intended to answer most questions for new users, as well as provide valuable detailed information for the experienced user. The existence of detailed <b>user</b> <b>s</b> <b>manuals</b> will enable new users to become proficient with the codes, as well as reducing the dependency of new users on the code authors. In order to achieve the objectives listed, the following tasks were accomplished: 1) Parametric Study Of Preconditioning Parameters And Other Code Inputs; 2) Code Modifications To Reduce Runtimes; 3) Investigation Of Compiler Options To Reduce Code Runtime; and 4) Development/Enhancement of Users Manuals for Aardvark and Phanto...|$|R

40|$|RESRAD-BUILD is a {{computer}} model for analyzing the radiological doses resulting from the remediation and occupancy of buildings contaminated with radioactive material. It {{is part of a}} family of codes that includes RESRAD, RESRAD-CHEM, RESRAD-RECYCLE, RESRAD-BASELINE, and RESRAD-ECORISK. The RESRAD-BUILD models were developed and codified by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL); version 1. 5 of the code and the user's manual were publicly released in 1994. The original version of the code was written for the Microsoft DOS operating system. However, subsequent versions of the code were written for the Microsoft Windows operating system. The purpose of the present verification task (which includes validation as defined in the standard) is to provide an independent review of the latest version of RESRAD-BUILD under the guidance provided by ANSI/ANS- 10. 4 for verification and validation of existing computer programs. This approach consists of a posteriori V&V review which takes advantage of available program development products as well as user experience. The purpose, as specified in ANSI/ANS- 10. 4, is to determine whether the program produces valid responses when used to analyze problems within a specific domain of applications, and to document the level of verification. The culmination of these efforts is the production of this formal Verification Report. The first step in performing the verification of an existing program was the preparation of a Verification Review Plan. The review plan consisted of identifying: Reason(s) why a posteriori verification is to be performed; Scope and objectives for the level of verification selected; Development products to be used for the review; Availability and use of user experience; and Actions to be taken to supplement missing or unavailable development products. The purpose, scope and objectives for the level of verification selected are described in this section of the Verification Report. The development products that were used for the review and any actions that were taken when these items were missing are documented in Section 5 of this report. The availability and use of user experience were limited to extensive experience in performing RESRAD-BUILD calculations by the verification project manager and by participation in the RESRAD-BUILD workshop offered by the code developers on May 11, 2001. The level of a posteriori verification that was implemented is defined in Sections 2 through 4 of this report. In general, a rigorous verification review plan addresses program requirements, design, coding, documentation, test coverage, and evaluation of test results. The scope of the RESRAD-BUILD verification is to focus primarily on program requirements, documentation, testing and evaluation. Detailed program design and source code review would be warranted only in those cases when the evaluation of test results and user experience revealed possible problems in these areas. The verification tasks were conducted in three parts and were applied to version 3. 1 of the RESRAD-BUILD code and {{the final version of the}} <b>user.</b> <b>s</b> <b>manual,</b> issued in November 2001 (Yu et al. 2001). These parts include the verification of the deterministic models used in RESRAD-BUILD (Section 2), the verification of the uncertainty analysis model included in RESRAD-BUILD (Section 3), and recommendations for improvement of the RESRAD-BUILD user interface, including evaluations of the user's manual, code design, and calculation methodology (Section 4). Any verification issues that were identified were promptly communicated to the RESRAD-BUILD development team, in particular those that arose from the database and parameter verification tasks. This allowed the developers to start implementing necessary database or coding changes well before this final report was issued...|$|E
