6000|$|I {{apply this}} remark indeed to those extractions of the quintessence that had for their {{occasion}} either one's more undirected though never fruitless walks and wanderings or one's earnest, one's positively pious approach to whatever consecrated ground or shrine of pilgrimage {{that might be}} at the moment in order. There was not a regular prescribed [...] "sight" [...] that I during those weeks neglected--I remember haunting the museums in especial, though the South Kensington was then scarce more than embryonic, {{with a sense of}} duty and of excitement that I was never again to know combined in equal measure, I think, and that it might really have taken some element of personal danger to account for. There was the element, in a manner, to season the cup with sharpness--the danger, all the while, that my freedom might be brief and my experience broken, that I was under the menace of uncertainty and subject in fine to interruption. The fact of having been so long gravely unwell sufficed by itself to keep apprehension alive; it was our idea, or at least quite intensely mine, that what I was doing, could I but put it through, would be intimately good for me--only the putting it through was the difficulty, and I sometimes faltered by the way. This makes now for a general air on the part of all the objects of vision that I recover, and almost as much in those of accidental encounter as in the breathlessly invoked, of being looked at for the last time and giving out their message and story as with the still, collected passion of an only chance. This feeling about them, not to say, as I might have imputed it, in them, wonderfully helped, as may be believed, the extraction of quintessences--which sprang at me of themselves, for that matter, out of any appearance that confessed to the least value in the compound, the least office in the harmony. If the commonest street-vista was a fairly heart-shaking contributive image, if the incidents of the thick renascent light anywhere, and the perpetual excitement of never knowing, between it and the historic and determined gloom, which was which and which one would most [...] "back" [...] for the general outcome and picture, so the great sought-out compositions, the Hampton Courts and the Windsors, the Richmonds, the Dulwiches, even the very Hampstead Heaths and Putney Commons, {{to say nothing of the}} Towers, the Temples, the Cathedrals and the strange penetrabilities of the City, ranged themselves like the rows of great figures in a sum, an amount immeasurably huge, that one would draw on if not quite as long as one lived, yet as soon as ever one should seriously get to work. That, to a tune of the most beautiful melancholy--at least as I catch it again now--was the way all values came out: they were charged somehow with a <b>useability</b> the most immediate, the most urgent, and which, I seemed to see, would keep me restless till I should have done something of my very own with them.|$|E

In the past, protocols for secure transactions have traded o <b>useability</b> against security whereas the protocols presented here are designed so that they tradeo security against hardware complexity and always give high <b>useability.</b> Our protocols utilise some of the concepts and assumptions present in sessional authentication, but also make improvements to this model. We do not propose the use of biometrics for authentication. Biometrics are viewed with apprehension by many users since they are irrevocable...|$|E

40|$|Background: Older people {{commonly}} experience difficulty using public transport, {{and identify}} {{a range of}} barriers and facilitators to bus use. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of implementing age-friendly guidelines for public buses on bus use, <b>useability</b> and social participation for older people. Methodology: Age-friendly changes were implemented in Hervey Bay, Queensland, over a 3 year period. Changes included more lower floor buses, age-awareness training for bus drivers, more frequent scheduling, improved pedestrian infrastructure, a bus buddy program and trial of a flexible route bus. Brisbane, Queensland, served as a control site. This study adopted two complementary methodologies for evaluating the impact of age-friendly changes. The first study incorporated on-board satisfaction surveys with 335 bus users. The second involved a repeated measures cohort study (n = 100) with bus users and non-users. Results: Implementation of age-friendly changes in Hervey Bay, Queensland, resulted in improved satisfaction with, and perceived <b>useability</b> of, the bus system. Participants in Hervey Bay maintained their bus use and social activity participation, while participants in Brisbane experienced a decline in ease of bus use and social activity participation over the intervention period. Conclusion: The implementation of age-friendly guidelines for public buses may improve the <b>useability</b> of bus systems for older people and result in maintenance of participation in social activities...|$|E

Participants suggested that the program was clear and consistent, the text font and colour easily read and the graphics aesthetically attractive; however, the technical language used throughout, some navigational aspects and the layout of pages needed to be modified. This is the first study to evaluate the <b>useability</b> and functionality of an online educational program for parents of preschool children and highlighted three critical components of the program that need to be modified prior to subsequent pilot and full-scale efficacy and effectiveness trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of physical assets {{has become a}} popular field recently, and is acknowledged in many disciplines worldwide. Physical Asset Management (PAM) is a complex subject that requires the participation of many disciplines. Maintenance management, together with accurate and effective decisionmaking, is vital for achieving successful PAM. The primary objective of this research project was to identify the possibility of simplifying maintenance-related decision-making. With the focus on numerical decision-making techniques, the secondary objective {{was to investigate the}} practicality and <b>useability</b> of combining appropriate techniques to create an easily useable and understandable methodology to support maintenance-related decisions. The results confirm the practicality and <b>useability</b> of a simplified numerical decision-making methodology. By concentrating on the core operational questions related to maintenance, and by combining the most appropriate techniques, a simplified numerical decision-making methodology can ease the decision-making process on an operational level. This can accomplish successful PAM in a proactive, preventive and simplified manner...|$|E

Although there are many physical simulation tools available today, there is no one which covers all the needs of urban design. After initial research of available software, we have chosen to assess three applications: ENVI-met, Project Vasari and IES VE-Pro. The assessment is composed from two parts: functionality assessment, which deals with the available features of the application and <b>useability</b> assessment, which deals with the user experience and friendliness. Since different aspects of assessed functionality and <b>useability</b> are not equally important, we have also included pondering mechanism in order to find the most suitable software for specific requirements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} {{methodology}} for the specification and verification of heap-manipulating software programs. This methodology will support an engineering approach to software development, whereby formal specifications can be used to guide and verify code implementations. The project will focus on three key aspects, namely (i) expressivity, (ii) scalability and (iii) <b>useability,</b> which are important for promoting the methodology to future programmers. Expressity of specification will allow us to capture full functional correctness of our programs, where desired. Scalability is important to ensure that automated verification can be effectively carried out using present day’s computational platforms. <b>Useability</b> of the technology ensures that creativity of programers could be enhanced rather than hindered by the use of our tools. As a novel test-bed, we shall deploy the methodology and tools developed in this project for the teaching an advanced course on data structures and algorithms. This step will act as an concrete goal for our research work and will also allow the effectivenes of our methodology to be properly evaluated. ...|$|E

An efficient information service which offers comfortable and powerful information retrieval and manipulation functions and {{takes over the}} administration and security of the data is needed by many applications. Regarding implementation, some general requirements for such an information service are considered like an efficient but easy to use application interface, fast processing of data, a simple interface to the operating system to assure portability and the connection to other services (communication, man-machine-interface, [...] .). These points {{may very well be}} fulfilled by using the relational data modell. The results from first applications are very positive concerning the realtime capabilities and <b>useability</b> as well as programming which is made easier by the use of MERLIN.
