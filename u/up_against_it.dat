5|$|The fourth {{match was}} a triple threat match, for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, in which {{champion}} Shelton Benjamin defended the title against Carlito and Johnny Nitro. The match began with Carlito performing a springboard moonsault from the ring apron hitting both Nitro and Benjamin in the process. A {{spot in the}} match saw Carlito set up Nitro in a Tree of Woe, a move in which a wrestler suspends his opponent upside down on a turnbuckle, with the opponent's back being <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>it,</b> Carlito stood on the turnbuckle, in which Benjamin followed by jumping up with Carlito. Nitro lifted Benjamin on his shoulders and threw him down, while Benjamin dropped Carlito, making both men hit the mat. Later in the match, Carlito performed a backcracker on Benjamin. Nitro, who {{was thrown out of}} the ring, returned and removed Carlito from making the cover on Benjamin. He instead covered Benjamin for the pinfall victory, thus becoming the new Intercontinental champion.|$|E

Many of the industrial mills on the River Don were badly damaged and all the boundary walls by the river were swept away. The Neepsend Bridge managed to withstand the onslaught although a large amount of debris was piled <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>it.</b> Hillfoot Bridge, then made of timber, was swept away and later replaced by a stone structure.|$|E
