50|$|The title {{refers to}} a method {{prescribed}} to Trumper {{for the treatment of}} non-specific urological disorders relating to his abnormally narrow urinary tract. Trumper's urologist, Dr. Jean Claude Vigneron, offers him three options for the treatment of his disorder: abstinence from sex and alcohol, a painful operation to widen the <b>urinary</b> <b>canal,</b> or the Water Method, which consists simply of consuming abnormal quantities of water before and after sex to flush bacteria out of the urinary tract. Trumper opts for the Water Method, suggesting both his generally comical cowardice and lack of self-discipline.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study on the}} {{development}} of an artificial urethral valve for treatment of urinary incontinence which occurs frequently in the aged. Urinary incontinence is caused by the weakening of the <b>urinary</b> <b>canal</b> sphincter muscles and the expansion of the prostate gland, and occurs in persons of all ages from infants to the aged. The prototype urethral valve was assembled in hand-drum form with four thin nitinol (nickel-titanium alloy) plates with a thickness of 0. 3 mm. Animal experiments show the prototype urethral valve controls well the opening and closing functions of the canal...|$|E

40|$|Penicillin is a {{peculiar}} antibacterial therapeutic, for it has both strong antibacterial activities and biological effects including {{the enhancement of}} body defense power. The author has previously clarified the enhancement of the leucocyte function by penicillin G and equal enhancement by its degradatives (penicillamine), and observed the degradation process of penicillin by polarographic determination of thiol group. In the present papers, the author observed polarographically the cystine-SH value in human urine, after intramuscular administration of penicillin G, and confirmed the apparent increase of its value. In conclusion, {{it is suggested that}} most of penicillin administered parenterally is excreted through the kidney, but a portion of it is degraded in vivo to penicillamine which has useful biological activities. Penicillin is also degraded in human <b>urinary</b> <b>canal</b> by penicillinase produced by Esch. coli and certain saprophytic and commensal bacteria...|$|E

40|$|Catheterization is a performance, {{that can}} be found nearly in all {{departments}} of the hospital, in old people´s homes, different institutes and last but not least also in the home environment. Many things have changed since the distant times, when a red tube was used as a catheter. The aids for catheterization are firstly manufactured so that they are so gentle as possible and secondly so that the use of them reduce the possible risks on a minimum. Moreover some types of catheters have some attributes of the modern technologies included, e. g. X-ray contrast strips or contrastive sensors for the monitoring of the inside body temperature. Even though the right execution of the performance seems to be easy, it still has its own specifics, and this is the observance of the right course of action under the high-asepticconditions. Since it is about an invasive input of the ureter to the urinary bladder, together with the wrong execution, the possibility of the undesirable complications increases, most often {{in the form of the}} infection of the <b>urinary</b> <b>canal,</b> that not only worsen the state of health, but also has the economic impacts on the medical institutes. The catheterization of a woman shall therefore be carried out only by the registered nurse or by the undergraduate nurse or the nurse with a specialist education. In this thesis I focused mainly on the execution of catheterization from the student point of view, as already there is being decided with the help of the right education, how he or she will be able to carry out this execution on his/her own (how much he or she will be reliable, on which level of knowledge and skills). The aim of this thesis was to chart the most frequent problems, that the students meet during the execution of the female catheterization and to find out, if they have the needed information and how they advise the clients during the one-time catheterization, as well as the clients with the permanent urinary catheter. In the practical part of the thesis the qualitative survey in the form of the structured conversation was used. Ten students of the second and third grade ZSF JCU, Department for nursing and midwifery, General nursing and midwifery assistant, were addressed on the base of the intentional choice. Four interviews were recorded with the help of the voice recorder, the next were noticed with the respect to the wish of the respondents only in a written form. The answers of the students were then transcribed and encoded into categories and under categories and thus with the help of the method. It has been found out from the research that the most common problem during the female catheterization mentioned by the students, is the difficult orientation in the sometimes confused field of the anatomic ratio of the genital and thus mainly in the case of older or obese female patients and and on the second place the is the difficulty of the execution by means of the observance of asepsis and the general technique of the performance, particularly if it is carried out without assistance. In the next evaluation it has been found out that the students are aware of the risks, especially in the form of an infection and they know how to minimize them. The issue of the presentation of the needed information to the female patient was evaluated as not fully sufficient, mainly in the case of the one- time catheterization...|$|E
