5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the <b>understory</b> {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long {{branches}} in the <b>understory</b> affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey {{because it is more}} difficult to glean among thick <b>understory</b> foliage.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Scott Township, Hull Creek is {{flanked by}} native trees and <b>understory.</b> However, further downstream, in Blakely, {{there is virtually no}} riparian buffer. Beyond this reach, the creek's riparian buffer again contains native trees and <b>understory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Agnes Banks Woodland {{in western}} Sydney has been {{recognised}} by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here Banksia aemula is an <b>understory</b> plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla), narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) and B. serrata as canopy trees, and B. oblongifolia, Conospermum taxifolium, Ricinocarpus pinifolius, Dillwynia sericea and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other <b>understory</b> species.|$|E
50|$|In western Washington, snowshoe hares {{routinely}} used {{steep slopes}} where cover was adequate; most studies, however, suggest {{they tend to}} prefer gentle slopes. Moonlight increases snowshoe hare vulnerability to predation, particularly in winter. They tend to avoid open areas during bright phases of the moon and during bright periods of a single night. Their activity usually shifts from coniferous <b>understories</b> in winter to hardwood <b>understories</b> in summer.|$|R

5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a secondary regrowth of <b>understory</b> species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.|$|E
5|$|Additional live {{specimens}} {{recovered in}} 2010 and 2011 from Oregon were all found deep inside caves.

50|$|Major {{variables}} in habitat quality include average visual obstruction and browse biomass. Snowshoe hares prefer young forests with abundant <b>understories.</b> The presence of cover {{is the primary}} determinant of habitat quality, and is more significant than food availability or species composition. Species composition does, however, influence population density; dense softwood <b>understories</b> support greater snowshoe hare density than hardwoods because of cover quality. In Maine, female snowshoe hares were observed to be more common on sites with less cover but more nutritious forage; males tended to be found on sites with heavier cover.|$|R
5|$|Associated {{species in}} the Sydney region include {{heathland}} species such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla) and mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and prickly-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca nodosa) in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in woodland. The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here B.oblongifolia is an <b>understory</b> plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia (B.serrata) as canopy trees, and wallum banksia (B.aemula), variable smoke-bush (Conospermum taxifolium), wedding bush (Ricinocarpos pinifolius), showy parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea) and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other <b>understory</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the <b>understory.</b> The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the <b>understory</b> of its habitat and {{occasionally}} perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the <b>understory,</b> where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Unlike {{other species}} of the genus Blechnum, the fern Blechnum chilense occurs {{in a wide range}} of {{habitats}} in Chilean temperate rainforest, from shaded forest <b>understories</b> to abandoned clearings and large gaps. We asked if contrasting light environments can exert differential selection on ecophysiological traits of B. chilense. We measured phenotypic selection on functional traits related to carbon gain: photosynthetic capacity (Amax), dark respiration rate (Rd), water use efficiency (WUE), leaf size and leaf thickness in populations growing in gaps and understorey environments. We assessed survival until reproductive stage and fecundity (spo-rangia production) as fitness components. In order to determine the potential evo-lutionary response of traits under selection, we estimated the genetic variation of these traits from clonally propagated individuals in common garden experiments. In gaps, survival of B. chilense was positively correlated with WUE and negatively correlated with leaf size. In contrast, survival in shaded <b>understories</b> was positively correlated with leaf size. We found positive directional fecundity selection on WUE in gaps population. In <b>understories,</b> ferns of lower Rd and greater leaf size showed greater fecundity. Thus, whereas control of water loss was optimized in gaps, light capture and net carbon balance were optimized in shaded <b>understories.</b> We found a significant genetic component of variation in WUE, Rd and leaf size. This study shows the potential for evolutionary responses to heterogeneous light environments in functional traits of B. chilense, a unique fern species able to occupy a broad successional niche in Chilean temperate rainforest...|$|R

5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an <b>understory</b> of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|The {{area in the}} {{vicinity}} of Keyser Creek has experienced habitat loss due to abandoned mine impacts. What remains of the creek's riparian buffer in some reaches is overrun with invasive plants. The <b>understory</b> in the creek's riparian area is covered in knotweed.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Effects of vegetation density on overall canopy reflectance differed dramatically, depending on spectral band, base material, and vegetation type. For example, reflectance changes caused by variations in vegetation density were hardly apparant for a simulated burned surface in LANDSAT band 5, while large changes occurred in band 7. When increasing densities of tree overstory were placed over <b>understories,</b> intermediate to dense overstories effectively masked the <b>understories</b> and dominated the spectral signatures. Dramatic changes in reflectance occurred for canopies {{placed on a}} number of varying topographic positions. Such changes were seen to result in the spectral overlap of some nonforested with densely forested situations...|$|R
