5|$|Although No Code debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200, it left a large section of the band’s fanbase <b>unsatisfied</b> and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but the album being {{considered}} inconsistent. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single platinum certification by the RIAA in the United States.|$|E
5|$|During filming, {{after the}} strike ended, Forster read a spec script by Joshua Zetumer, which he liked, and {{hired him to}} reshape scenes for the later parts of the shoot, which the {{director}} was still <b>unsatisfied</b> with. Forster had the actors rehearse their scenes, as he liked to film scenes continually. Zetumer rewrote dialogue depending on the actors' ideas each day.|$|E
5|$|Not doing {{anything}} creative is nearly killing me. The {{trouble is that}} there is no one near me who cares whether I ever do any more work or not... I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching <b>unsatisfied.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, Tennessee coach Fulmer {{pronounced}} himself <b>unsatisfied</b> {{with the}} Vols' performance in opponents' red zone {{during the regular}} season. Tennessee scored on just 36 of 52 possessions inside the opposition's 20-yard line, a conversion rate of 69.2 percent. Fulmer vowed to raise that percentage to {{what it had been}} the previous season, when Tennessee converted 41 of 46 possessions, or 89.1 percent.|$|E
5|$|With Carlos in prison, John {{assumes that}} he and Gabrielle will {{continue}} their relationship, but Gabrielle is livid after John told Carlos about their affair. Meanwhile, Carlos demands a paternity test if he and Gabrielle are {{to work on their}} marriage. Unwilling to actually take a test, Gabrielle obtains another patient's results and passes them off to Carlos as her own. Nevertheless, Carlos tells her that he still is not <b>unsatisfied.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Tolliver had the {{confidence}} of Dan Henning, Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard and owner Alex Spanos were <b>unsatisfied</b> with his production during the 1990 season, and they were looking towards Friesz as the future quarterback. Tolliver was the leading man for the starting quarterback position as training camp for the 1991 season began, with Friesz battling Bob Gagliano for the backup spot. However, after training camp ended, Friesz was named the starting quarterback for the 1991 season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. <b>Unsatisfied</b> with what he found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was <b>unsatisfied</b> with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati {{is always}} {{considered}} a widow, and thus, {{is the only}} Mahavidya without a consort. Though associated with Shiva, having eaten him, he has since left her. Having destroyed the male element (Purusha) in the universe, she is left with nothing, but she is still Shakti, the female element with latent energy. Dhumavati's insatiable hunger and thirst is highlighted in many texts, and has been interpreted as the manifestation of her <b>unsatisfied</b> desires.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, <b>unsatisfied</b> with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E
5|$|Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, {{including}} Dow, believed drunkenness {{was a great}} {{threat to}} the city's moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became {{a founding member of}} the Maine Temperance Society. The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with anti-Masonic and anti-slavery causes, and became more involved with politics generally. In the 1832 presidential election, <b>unsatisfied</b> with both Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay, Dow backed William Wirt, a minor-party candidate.|$|E
5|$|Oasis {{evolved from}} an earlier band called the Rain, {{composed}} of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). <b>Unsatisfied</b> with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster that hung in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the poster listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon.|$|E
5|$|Orozco {{remained}} <b>unsatisfied</b> {{with the}} political positions he was offered in the Madero government. He became even more angry when Madero asked him to fight Zapata in central Mexico. As a result, in March 1912--less {{than a year after}} the battle of Ciudad Juárez--Orozco formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero. He subsequently supported Victoriano Huerta in his coup d'état against Madero. After Huerta's fall Orozco went into exile in the US and was eventually killed by Texas Rangers while trying to make his way back into Mexico to start another revolt.|$|E
5|$|Over {{this period}} Vaughan Williams {{composed}} steadily, producing songs, choral music, chamber works and orchestral pieces, gradually finding {{the beginnings of}} his mature style. His compositions included the tone poem In the Fen Country (1904) and the Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1 (1906). He remained <b>unsatisfied</b> with his technique as a composer. After unsuccessfully seeking lessons from Sir Edward Elgar, he contemplated studying with Vincent d'Indy in Paris. Instead, he was introduced by the critic and musicologist M.D.Calvocoressi to Maurice Ravel, a more modernist, less dogmatic musician than d'Indy.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} <b>unsatisfied</b> {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Strategically, {{the group}} {{experienced}} internal divisions between a faction that argued for more offensive {{and another that}} wanted to thread lightly {{in order to avoid}} justifying the classification of terrorism. While the pacifist faction carried damage control and held two toy give always for Three Kings Day in Puerto Rico, Ojeda was removed from the political branch on June 4, 1985, due to these conflicts, being only left in charge of his unit. Besides the boldness of the action, the EPB strategists were also <b>unsatisfied</b> when Ramírez failed to account for food expenses in his report.|$|E
5|$|The Miller {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were <b>unsatisfied</b> with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel is much harder than writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the novels are made to look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers and pages darkened as though with time and use.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unsatisfied</b> {{with his}} own efforts, Homer takes on the biggest danger in Springfield, the nuclear power plant. After Homer rallies people to his cause, Mr. Burns decides to end the furor he is {{creating}} by offering him a new position as the plant safety inspector, along with a higher salary. Homer, torn between his principles and his livelihood, tearfully tells his followers that they must fight their battles alone {{from this point on}} and takes the job.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself <b>unsatisfied</b> and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|Huseby's demands were {{to talk to}} Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke, {{both from}} the Conservative Party. He also wanted to hold a press conference at Fornebu. Huseby was <b>unsatisfied</b> with his {{treatment}} after he left prison. He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One hour after the plane landed, 70 passengers were let out of the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or claimed they had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. The passengers were picked up by a bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police. The remaining passengers were let out thirty minutes later. Only the five crew members remained.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was <b>unsatisfied</b> with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E
5|$|In November 1830, a National Congress was {{established}} to create a Belgian constitution. Fears of mob rule associated with republicanism after the French Revolution of 1789, {{as well as the}} example of the recent July Revolution in France, led the Congress to decide that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. The Congress approached several candidates, but chose Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a minor but well-connected German noble, to be the first King of the Belgians. He was officially inaugurated on 21 July 1831, after taking an oath to abide by the Constitution. Leopold I was generally <b>unsatisfied</b> with the amount of power allocated to the monarch, and sought to extend it wherever the Constitution was ambiguous or unclear while generally avoiding involvement in routine politics.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June {{the royal}} {{government}} and the remaining rebels, who were <b>unsatisfied</b> with the charters granted the previous day, agreed to meet at Smithfield, just outside the city walls. London remained in confusion, with various bands of rebels roaming the city independently. Richard prayed at Westminster Abbey, before setting out for the meeting in the late afternoon. The chronicler accounts of the encounter all vary on matters of detail, but agree on the broad sequence of events. The King and his party, at least 200 strong and including men-at-arms, positioned themselves outside St Bartholomew's Priory {{to the east of}} Smithfield, and the thousands of rebels massed along the western end.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} anxious departure, five buses {{containing}} crowds of ravenous tourist anchovies {{stop at the}} Krusty Krab, its abundance of passengers furiously demanding meals. Unable to satisfy the anchovies' hunger and alarmed by the mob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the <b>unsatisfied</b> crowd. Before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula, which he uses in speedily whipping up bundles of Krabby Patties for the anchovies and satisfying their hunger. After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick orders a Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly-unseen, and audibly manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat.|$|E
5|$|Spiritualism {{appealed to}} many educated Victorians {{who no longer}} found {{traditional}} religious doctrine, {{such as that of}} the Church of England, acceptable yet were <b>unsatisfied</b> with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E
5|$|The French {{submarine}} Mariotte (Q74) was {{a submarine}} {{built for the}} French Navy prior to World War I. Intended to accompany the fleet, she was designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was <b>unsatisfied</b> with her performance on the surface, the boat had a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before or during the following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and the navy spent years fixing the various issues before finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction. During the war, she participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in the cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|The Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town (or simply Death Comes to Town) is an eight-episode Canadian mini-series that {{aired on}} CBC Television on Tuesdays between January 12 and March 16, 2010. The show {{takes place in}} a fictional Ontario town called Shuckton where their mayor has been murdered. As the Shuckton {{residents}} cope with the loss, a new lawyer moves in to prosecute a suspect – though another resident, <b>unsatisfied</b> with the evidence, tries to find the real killer. At the same time, a character who is a personification of death waits at a motel room for the latest Shuckton residents to die.|$|E
5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a trolley. White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being <b>unsatisfied</b> with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E
5|$|The {{quotation}} {{price of}} Olympus shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on 15 November had fallen by some 75percent since the scandal erupted. The price {{continued to be}} volatile: trading was halted as its price hit the upper limit for price falls. On 14 and 15 November, after the threat of delisting ebbed, trading in its shares was once again halted when buy orders heavily outnumbered sell orders; the price rose by the upper limit of ¥100. Trading only took place after hours as there was a glut of <b>unsatisfied</b> buy orders. The share price rose in four straight trading sessions, reaching 834yen at one point on 16 November.|$|E
5|$|This film {{marks the}} second {{adaptation}} of Shūsaku Endō's novel, which was previously adapted by Masahiro Shinoda into the 1971 {{film of the}} same name. Scorsese penned the initial screenplay in 1991 with co-writer and longtime collaborator Jay Cocks. However, they were <b>unsatisfied</b> with the script and conducted rewrites for an additional 15 years. Later, Endō's official translator, Van C. Gessel, who has translated eight of his novels, assisted as a consultant on the film. The screenplay as finally filmed was assessed in critical review as an accurate depiction of the novel as written by Endo. Religious historian Haruko Nawata Ward has indicated that {{the inclusion of the}} small crucifix in the deceased priest's hand {{at the end of the}} film was an auteur decision made by Scorsese not included in Endo's original book.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unsatisfied</b> {{with the}} low pay, in Kremenchuk Adler led an {{unsuccessful}} actors' strike. A series of intrigues almost {{led to a}} breakup with Sonya, but ultimately led both back into Rosenberg's troupe and led to their marriage in Poltava. When this particular troupe broke up, the Adlers were among the few players to remain with Rosenberg {{to form a new}} one that included the actress who later became famous under the name of Keni Liptzin. In Chernigov, Adler turned down the opportunity to act in a Russian-language production of Boris Gudonov. Around this time Goldfaden appeared again and, after using an elaborate intrigue to demonstrate to the Adlers that Rosenberg had no loyalty to them, recruited them to his own troupe, which at the time appeared to be headed for a triumphant entry into Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|West {{took over}} a year and {{invested}} two million dollars towards the construction of Late Registration. The majority of the recording sessions for the album took place at Sony Music Studios in New York City and at The Record Plant in Hollywood, California; other sessions took place at Chalice Recording Studios and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood. He began working in the studio after he finished touring with Usher on the R singer's The Truth Tour. By November 2004, West had completed nearly seventy-five percent of the album. However he felt <b>unsatisfied</b> with its outcome and in March of the following year, he brought in Jon Brion, which drastically altered the project's direction.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{a series}} of {{newspaper}} supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, Le Petit Vingtième (The Little Twentieth), which subsequently appeared in Le Vingtième Siècle every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Hergé illustrated L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet), a comic strip authored {{by one of the}} paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was <b>unsatisfied,</b> and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus' Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's The Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.|$|E
5|$|Hammond's health {{remained}} poor at {{the start}} of the 1935 season. He developed septic tonsillitis which made it difficult for him to breathe, eat and sleep, and ultimately required an operation to remove his tonsils in early 1936. Hammond's form was indifferent and he believed it was his worst season. In first-class matches, he scored 2,616 runs (average 49.35) and took 60 wickets (average 27.26). He became the ninth player to reach 100 first-class centuries, emerging from a run of bad form against Somerset. Long a regular in the side, for the first time he captained the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. In the five-Test series against South Africa, a run of low scores again brought press speculation about his place in the national side. He did not pass fifty until the third Test, when he scored 63 and 87 not out, ending a run of 22 innings without a fifty, in which time he averaged 23.47 over 14 Tests. Hammond made two more fifties in the last two Tests, although they were insufficient to prevent England from losing 1–0, their third successive series defeat. He finished the series with 389 runs at an average of 64.83, but remained <b>unsatisfied</b> with his form.|$|E
