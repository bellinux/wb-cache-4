40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} union wages and the international pattern of production and trade. If union goods are heterogeneous in labor intensity, the introduction of an active union in the domestic country causes only the least labor-intensive range of union goods to be produced there, with goods of greatest labor intensity produced abroad because of the relatively high cost of domestic union labor. A narrowing {{of the scope of}} domestic <b>union</b> <b>production</b> will eliminate relatively labor-intensive goods, leading a rent-maximizing union to raise its union premium. The implications of this union behavior for comparative statics results are considered. Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Our goal is the {{estimation}} of country - level production function aimed at understanding the role of human capital. We analyze the effect of education, especially {{the effect of the}} share of college graduates in prime-age population (between 25 - 54 years) on the European Union (EU) countries' labor productivity. Here, an important issue is efficiency of tertiary education institutions. We split the ratio of human capital to observe it from different aspects. We compare an effect of lower and upper tertiary educated, by specializations and by gender. The relationship between human capital and labor productivity was found positive though not significant or significant only on 10 % confidence level. The influence of human capital on labor productivity was found very low, in some cases even negative. Assuming that {{one of the main reasons}} behind these contra-intuitive results is the problem of unobserved heterogeneity, we also run instrumental variable estimation. We found positive and significant on 5 % confidence level relationship between human capital and labor productivity. The influence of larger share of tertiary educated people on labor productivity is more evident after some period of time, in our example after two years.

40|$|This is {{the fourth}} EAC Trade Report since 2005. The EAC Trade Report 2005 set the pace in {{analysing}} the trade flows of EAC as a unified trade entity. Over the period the analysis has improved in quality. The 2008 trade flows reflect continued growth of intra-EAC trade. In spite of some trade imbalances which emanate the inherited historical economic structures of Partner States, some reversal of the hitherto skewed trade pattern is beginning to emerge whereby Partners States that were predominant importers of goods from within EAC are also making entry into the export arena. The report further manifests a commitment of Partner States {{in the implementation of}} the Customs Union particularly the uniform application of the customs instruments. In addition, the report is a tool which will enable EAC to model and shape its trade policy with other regions. The ongoing tripartite trade framework being developed between EAC, COMESA and SADC will be informed by the information provided in this and similar trade reports. Statistical data are pivotal factor at all the integration stages of the EAC and become increasingly pertinent as the region moves towards a common market and subsequently a monetary union. Under the Customs <b>Union,</b> <b>production</b> and exchange of customs and trade statistics and information is one of the areas of co-operation and the EAC Customs Management Act provides for the compilation and dissemination of such statistics. This report is therefore a beginning of the harmonisation and development of regional statistical information. Trade information will particularly be useful when rolling out to cover intra-regional flows of other factors of production under the common market...|$|E
40|$|Historically, American {{industry}} {{has had a}} poor reputation for safe and clean working conditions, however, it has remained highly respected in the Northeast areas of our country - being affectionately termed "the Foundry" of the nation. In fact, in recent years owners and management have come {{to better understand the}} idea of "increasing employee productivity via improved working conditions. " This thesis project is a study of design ideas aimed at providing not only a corporate identity of quality, teamwork, and strength, but also an effective and productive working environment for every employee - salaried, <b>union</b> <b>production</b> personnel, and contract laborers. The project consists of the design of a new industrial manufacturing facility for the Indiana Steel & Wire Co. located in Muncie, Indiana. The focus is on the central core spaces - how they become the communication center for the facility and how they encourage interaction, teamwork in management relationships, and efficiency in the manufacturing processes. The design all of the production facilities, proposed conveyance systems, and discussions of the potential for robotics were limited to schematics only. The design entails approximately 870, 000 square feet, including atriums and outbuildings, and was designed to fit an existing site, severely restricted in size on all four sides by a railroad, highway, river, and residential property. Research on industrial precedent has revealed that "people places" {{are some of the most}} important aspects of a successful facility. Providing a good working environment is paramount to promoting good attitudes, quality and productivity. Frequently a high-tech architectural language is used to connote strength, stability, state-of-the-art engineering excellence, and expandability. It is a tremendous means of celebrating the technology of a business/industry one is attempting to promote. This research project has explored the interrelationships of high-tech architectural design, pragmatic facilities engineering and employee productivity in the industrial environment.

40|$|This is {{the seventh}} EAC Trade Report since 2005. The EAC Trade Report 2005 {{set the pace}} in {{analysing}} the trade flows of EAC as a unified trade entity. Over the period the analysis has improved in quality. The 2011 trade flows reflect continued growth of intra-EAC trade. The Intra EAC trade in 2011 amounted US$ 4, 485. 9 Millions compared to US$ 3, 722. 9 Millions in 2010 representing a 20. 5 percent increase. The increase was attributed to increase of both imports and exports within the bloc that went up by 23. 7 percent and 18. 2 percent, respectively. The share of intra EAC trade among the Partner States remained almost the same with Kenya continuing to dominate, accounting for about 41 percent of total intra-trade. Moreover, during the period, only Burundi recorded an increase in its share to 4. 2 percent from 2. 6 {{percent of the total}} intra EAC trade in 2010. The report further manifests a commitment of Partner States in the implementation of the Customs Union particularly the uniform application of the customs instruments.

50|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, major motion picture studios never release their dailies for outside use.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} history of the Waterside Workers 2 ̆ 7 Federation Film Unit. Comprising three filmmakers, Norma Disher, Keith Gow and Jock Levy, this <b>union</b> <b>production</b> group {{operated}} in Sydney from 1953 to 1958. Within an environment which was generally hostile towards militant labour, it produced seventeen short films on a range of topics for the Waterside Workers 2 ̆ 7 Federation and other labour and left wing organisations. To date, no comprehensive history of the work of the Unit exists. The work begins by giving a history of the Unit 2 ̆ 7 s operation. The second chapter explores the theoretical approaches to the topic. The Unit operated at a point of intersection of film, industry and culture, and the disciplinary areas of cinema studies, labour history and cultural studies are interrogated as to their utility in presenting a critical history of this group. The following chapter provides the context for the WWFFU, and examines the industrial, cultural and cinematic spheres of activity which existed as a background for the WWFFU 2 ̆ 7 s existence in Sydney from 1953 to 1958. Chapter Four undertakes a close analysis of three key films, examining how these filmmakers responded to industrial and political campaigns, and how the Unit 2 ̆ 7 s output related to its context. The final chapter reflects upon the provision of this history and the issues raised, including the changing nature of class in Australia, and representation within the documentary. This thesis contributes to a succession of Australian cultural histories. The localised milieux in which the Film Unit operated, its economic, political and social structures, were historically specific formations. Popular culture of the 1950 s has often been positioned as predictable, but this is because a specific activist working class culture has seldom been examined. Bringing a localised working class cultural formation, such as the WWFFU, to a critical analysis is a valuable way to see beyond such positionings...|$|E
