25|$|Two Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 {{envisioned a}} full {{invasion}} of Cuba by Army and Marine units, {{supported by the}} Navy following Air Force and naval airstrikes. However, Army units in the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had trouble fielding mechanized and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armored contingent from the Army.|$|E
25|$|Sociologist David Gibson has {{explored}} the ExComm's deliberations from a discourse-analytic, or conversation-analytic, perspective. He argues that inasmuch as Kennedy's decisions were {{shaped by the}} ExComm's deliberations, they hinged on the group {{not talking about the}} dangers that awaited around every corner—such as the danger that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to bomb operational nuclear missiles were the blockade to fail to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{the very}} {{features}} that made Bermuda such a prized {{base for the}} Royal Navy (its headquarters in the North Atlantic and West Indies 'til after the Second World War, also meant it was perpetually threatened by US invasion, as the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked to both deny the base to an enemy, {{and use it as}} a way to extend its defences hundreds of miles out to sea, which would not happen 'til the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|Covert {{operations}} {{was another}} {{focal point of}} the Report. With little open source information available from communist nations, the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to use clandestine operations to obtain vital information. The Dulles Report suggested the incorporation of covert and clandestine intelligence into one single office within the CIA, therefore the Office of Special Operations (OSO), responsible for clandestine intelligence collection, and the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), responsible for covert actions, should integrate into a single division.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. fiscal {{position}} changed dramatically {{for the worse}} during the Bush years. CBO projected in its January 2001 baseline that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a total of $5.6 trillion in annual surpluses over the 2002-2011 decade, assuming the laws in place during the Clinton era continued and the economy performed as expected. However, the actual deficits during those years ended up being $6.1 trillion, a negative swing of $11.7 trillion. Two recessions, two wars, and tax cuts were the primary drivers of the differences.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs are considerably higher than other countries {{as a share}} of GDP, among other measures. According to the OECD, U.S. {{healthcare costs}} in 2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person relative to the next most expensive country. In other words, the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to cut healthcare costs by roughly one-third ($1 trillion or $3,000 per person on average) to be competitive with the next most expensive country.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP {{according to the}} OECD, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country. With U.S. GDP of $19 trillion, {{healthcare costs}} were about $3.2 trillion, or about $10,000 per person {{in a country of}} 320 million people.

25|$|The US {{interest}} rates were also affected by France's decision {{to raise their}} {{interest rates}} to attract gold to their vaults. In theory, the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> two potential responses to that: Allow the exchange rate to adjust, or increase their own interest rates to maintain the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. was pegged to the gold standard. Therefore, Americans converted their dollars into francs to buy more French assets, the demand for the U.S. dollar fell, and the exchange rate increased. The only thing the US could do {{to get back into}} equilibrium was increase interest rates.|$|E

These first three categories accounted for 62% of spending.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he {{was taken}} in a {{military}} aircraft to neighboring Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called {{for the restoration of}} Zelaya. Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico. The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, refrained from expressing support. She has since explained that the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses. Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.|$|E
25|$|As a {{strategic}} blow {{intended to prevent}} American interference in the Dutch East Indies for six months, the Pearl Harbor attack was a success, but unbeknownst to Yamamoto, it was a pointless one. In 1935, {{in keeping with the}} evolution of War Plan Orange, the US Navy had abandoned any intention of attempting to charge across the Pacific towards the Philippines at the outset of a war with Japan. In 1937, the US Navy had further determined even fully manning the fleet to wartime levels could not be accomplished in less than six months, and myriad other logistic assets needed to execute a trans-Pacific movement simply did not exist and would require two years to construct after the onset of war. In 1940, US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Harold Stark had penned a Plan Dog memorandum, which emphasized a defensive war in the Pacific while the US concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany first, and consigned Admiral Husband Kimmel's Pacific Fleet to merely keeping the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia. Moreover, it is questionable whether the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone to war at all had Japan attacked only British and Dutch possessions in the Far East.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the early}} years of the war, British foreign {{secretary}} Lord John Russell, Emperor Napoleon III of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, showed interest in recognition of the Confederacy or at least mediation of the war. William Ewart Gladstone, the British finance minister whose family wealth was based on slavery, was the key advocate calling for intervention to help the Confederacy achieve independence. He failed to convince prime minister Palmerston. By September 1862 the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and abolitionist opposition in Britain put an end to these possibilities. The cost to Britain of a war with the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been high: the immediate loss of American grain shipments, the end of exports to the U.S., and the seizure of billions of pounds invested in American securities. War would have meant higher taxes, another invasion of Canada, and full-scale worldwide attacks on the British merchant fleet. Outright recognition would have meant certain war with the United States; in mid-1862 fears of race war as had transpired in Haiti led to the British considering intervention for humanitarian reasons. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did not lead to interracial violence let alone a bloodbath, but it did give the friends of the Union strong talking points in the arguments that raged across Britain.|$|E

500|$|Russian and Chinese fighter {{developments}} have fueled concern, and in 2009, General John Corley, head of Air Combat Command, stated that {{a fleet of}} 187 F-22s would be inadequate, but Secretary Gates dismissed this concern. In 2011, Gates explained that Chinese fifth-generation fighter developments had been accounted for {{when the number of}} F-22s was set, and that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a considerable advantage in stealth aircraft in 2025, even with F-35 delays. In December 2011, the 195th and final F-22 was completed out of 8 test ("EMD" [...] - Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) and 187 operational aircraft produced; the aircraft was delivered to the USAF on 2 May 2012.|$|E
500|$|Despite Teller's reassurances, Kennedy himself [...] "hated {{the idea}} of reopening the race" [...] and was uneasy with {{continued}} production of fallout, a negative consequence of resumed testing that its opponents within the administration stressed. Opponents of the tests also argued that renewed atmospheric tests would come at a significant moral cost to the US, given broad public opposition to the plan, and claimed that further tests were largely unnecessary, with the US already having an adequate nuclear arsenal. Arthur Dean believed that public opposition to atmospheric testing {{was so great that}} the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to halt such tests within four years even without an agreement. John Kenneth Galbraith, then the ambassador to India, had advised Kennedy in June 1961 that resumed testing [...] "would cause us the gravest difficulties in Asia, Africa and elsewhere."

The demo for the song was originally acoustic with an organ, mostly instrumental, and ran for 6–7 minutes. Fazzi praised the track, as did Rubano. The song subsequently went through various arrangement changes.

[...] Lazzara described it as [...] "a little choppy" [...] with [...] "a nice groove to it". Fazzi said the track has a [...] "crazy 80s vibe, it's a very different song for Taking Back Sunday", while Rubano said it contained hints of Phoenix and Bloc Party. When [...] "Catholic Knees" [...] existed as a rough idea, Fazzi suggested that the group change the time signature to 7/4. Lazzara cited it as an example of Fazzi's influence on the band: [...] "Cause none of <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought to [...]" [...] Reyes compared the track to Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters.|$|E
