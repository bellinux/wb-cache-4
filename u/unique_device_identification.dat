40|$|Convergence of {{technologies}} from several domains of computing and healthcare have aided {{in the creation}} of devices that can help health professionals in monitoring their patients remotely. An increase in networked healthcare devices has resulted in incidents related to data theft, medical identity theft and insurance fraud. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a secure lightweight wearable health sensing system. The proposed system is based on an emerging security technology called Integrated Circuit Metric (ICMetric) that extracts the inherent features of a device to generate a <b>unique</b> <b>device</b> <b>identification.</b> In this paper, we provide details of how the physical characteristics of a health sensor can be used for the generation of hardware “fingerprints”. The obtained fingerprints are used to deliver security services like authentication, confidentiality, secure admission and symmetric key generation. The generated symmetric key is used to securely communicate the health records and data of the patient. Based on experimental results and the security analysis of the proposed scheme, it is apparent that the proposed system enables high levels of security for health monitoring in resource optimized manner...|$|E
30|$|The global {{auto-injector}} {{market is}} expected to grow further in coming years, and the technology is evolving rapidly. Hence, the present analysis should be updated regularly, in order to take the latest trends and developments into account. In this context, the present review is in line with the European Union’s latest adaptations of medical device regulations. One of the new regulations’ most important objectives is to improve transparency and traceability by establishing a European-wide database on medical devices and a system for <b>unique</b> <b>device</b> <b>identification</b> (UDI) (European Commission 2018). A centralized, complete documentation of all known safety-related issues, accessible to all stakeholders, will help to decrease the repeated occurrence of these problems. Accordingly, we are confident that the present review will help to further improve the safety of disposable auto- and pen injectors. In order to enhance the benefits of this work, the detailed data provided here should be extended by performing an in-depth analysis of incident reports to achieve a holistic view of use errors of disposable auto-injection devices (Marcilly et al., 2016). However, the results of this type of reviews will always be just a development aid and cannot replace the knowledge and experience of human factors engineering experts for the conception and development of medical devices.|$|E

In order {{to invest in the}} future of the industry, companies are beginning to focus on new, innovative ideas that come into the market as a low-cost alternative to the sustaining innovations currently in place. Similar business-models {{can be seen in the}} healthcare industry, as physicians look to disruptive innovations to provide methods of diagnosis and treatment that are easier to perform and maintain. Companies, from medical device manufacturers to the hospitals using these devices, are now working to comply with the Federal Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 ’s requirements of Unique Device Identifiers on all equipment – a new, standardized identification system to ensure all necessary information about a device is provided. This honors thesis analyzes the recent history of disruptive innovations, in all industries and specifically healthcare, and the emergence and benefits of <b>Unique</b> <b>Device</b> <b>Identification.</b> Modeling of the implementation of Unique Device Identifiers in an industrial setting resulted in a 16. 55 % time improvement of the affected phases of the recall process, preventing 30 fatalities. When a benefit-cost analysis was performed – comparing the value of a human life to the cost of UDI implementation – the benefit of implementation outweighed the costs by 277 %.

40|$|In {{the medical}} device field, {{there are a}} number of players, having quite {{different}} responsibilities and levels of understanding of the processes, but all with one common interest, that of ensuring the availability of sound medical devices to the general public. To assist in this very important process, there is a need for a common method for describing and identifying these medical devices in an unambiguous manner. The Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) now provides, for the first time, an international tool for identifying all medical devices, at the generic level, in a meaningful manner that can be understood by all users. Prior to the GMDN, many nomenclature systems existed, all built upon different structures, and used locally or nationally for special purposes, with unusual approaches. These diverse systems, although often workable in their own right, have had no impact on improving the overall situation of providing a common platform, whereby, medical devices could be correctly identified and the related data safely exchanged between the involved parties. Work by standard organizations such as, CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization), from 1993 to 1996, resulted in a standard that specified a structure for a new nomenclature, for medical devices. In this article we are trying to explain GMDN as the prime method to reduce medical device errors, and to understand the concept of GMDN, to regulate the medical device throughout the globe. Here we also make an attempt to explain various aspects of the GMDN system, such as, the process of development of the GMDN-CEN report, purpose, benefits, and their structural considerations. In addition, there will be an explanation of the coding system, role of the GMDN agency, and their utilization in the <b>unique</b> <b>device</b> <b>identification</b> (UDI) System.

40|$|Abstract — Sensor pattern noises (SPNs), {{extracted}} from digital images {{to serve as}} the fingerprints of imaging devices, have been proved as an effective way for digital <b>device</b> <b>identification.</b> However, as we demonstrate in this work, the limitation of the current method of extracting the sensor pattern noise is that the SPNs {{extracted from}} images can be severely contaminated by the details from scenes, and as a result, the identification rate is unsatisfactory unless images of a large size are used. In this work, we propose a novel approach for attenuating the influence of the details from scenes on sensor pattern noises so as to improve the <b>device</b> <b>identification</b> rate of the identifier. The hypothesis underlying our SPN enhancement method is that the stronger a signal component in a SPN is, the less trustworthy the component should be, and thus should be attenuated. This hypothesis suggests that an enhanced SPN can be obtained by assigning weighting factors inversely proportional to the magnitude of the SPN components.
