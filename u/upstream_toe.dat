Its height is about 148 m, crest length is 344 m, and the base width from the <b>upstream</b> <b>toe</b> to the downstream toe is 570 m. The reservoir has a storage capacity of 7,090 million m3. This is the largest hydropower project in Mexico which is also expected to reduce the floods in the area.|$|E
50|$|Construction of New Exchequer Dam {{began on}} July 8, 1964, {{directly}} downstream {{from the old}} concrete arch dam. Tudor Engineering Company of San Francisco {{was responsible for the}} design of the new dam. The dam wall was constructed in vertical zones, which consisted of compacted, alternating layers of coarse and fine material ranging in thickness from 1.6 to 66 ft. The old Exchequer Dam was incorporated as an <b>upstream</b> <b>toe</b> to help support the rock-fill embankment, which was then armored with a layer of reinforced concrete. The dam was topped out in early 1967 and the power plant went into commercial operation by July.|$|E
25|$|In a gravity dam, {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on {{the mass of the}} dam. The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes <b>upstream</b> of the <b>toe</b> of the dam.|$|R

These {{measurements}} were made by allowing a maximum vertical distance of 0.25  m between the dam crest and the sensor heads. Lateral displacements and downstream transport of eroded soil particles were measured using a linear displacement transducer (LDT) with a maximum response speed of 0.2  m/s and a measuring range of 1.0  m. The transducer was fixed at the upper end of the flume tank, and a thin metallic wire attached to the sensor head was connected to a plastic ball of similar weight to the materials used in the experiments. The ball was buried at the center of the dam crest, while the outer end of the metallic wire, suspended by a known weight, passed through four stationary pulleys. Transient changes in the upstream water levels were tracked with a pore-water pressure sensor with a rated capacity of 50 kPa. The pore-water pressure sensor was fixed at a stationary position near the <b>upstream</b> dam <b>toe</b> to ensure accurate measurement and recording of data. All these sensors were connected to a standard real-time monitoring and recording unit comprised of a universal recorder (KYOWA EDX- 100 A) and a computer. The experimental setup was designed to simulate (1) the internal erosion process and piping development in relation to the nature of the material forming the impoundment; (2) the failure mechanisms of landslide dams made of materials of varying geotechnical properties; and (3) the rate of development of piping. Two digital video cameras were strategically positioned to record the failure sequence of the dams.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSelf-potential (SP) and {{electrical}} resistivity measurements {{are used to}} investigate seepage at a remote moraine dam in the Sierra Nevada of California. The site is a small terminal moraine impounding roughly 300, 000 m 3 of water at ~ 3400 m a. s. l. Suspicious fine sediment in a small lake at the dam's downstream toe prompted initial concerns that anomalous seepage may be eroding matrix material from the moraine. 235 individual SP measurements covering {{the surface of the}} dam were collected in order to investigate electrokinetic current sources resulting from seepage, while resistivity soundings probed moraine stratigraphy and suggest that the till contains interstitial ice. Contoured SP data reveal a non-uniform voltage distribution over the moraine dam and two distinct negative SP anomalies. The first, located in the central area of the moraine, shows a broad negative SP zone around the crest and increasingly positive SP moving downhill towards both the <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>toes.</b> This anomaly can be explained by shallow gravitational groundwater flow in the near subsurface combined with upward groundwater flux through evapotranspiration; numerical simulation of the combined effect matches field data well. The second SP anomaly has a tightly localized distribution and can be explained by vertically descending flow into a bedrock fault conduit. Our conceptual seepage model suggests that flow travels from Dana Lake first at the boundary of ice-filled moraine and bedrock before converging on a concentrated channel in the subvertical fault zone. Positive SP near the dam abutments results from groundwater inflow from adjacent hillslopes. Combined analyses suggest that seepage erosion is not currently affecting the moraine dam, and that the sediment observed on the bed of the downstream toe lake is likely a remnant of past outflow events...|$|R
40|$|The Al-Fulaij {{recharge}} dam {{is located}} on the Al Batinah coast in Oman and was constructed in 1992. The dam is about 3. 3 km long and 7. 7 m high with a storage capacity of 3. 7 million cubic meters of water. It is an earthfill dam with silty, sandy gravel fill in the embankment. Excessive seepage of between 5, 000 – 12, 500 m 3 /day was observed during floods in 1993, and several sinkholes were noticed close to the <b>upstream</b> <b>toe.</b> Remedial work consisting of an upstream blanket and a cutoff trench wall was performed in 2000. However, these remedial measures failed and almost the same seepage was noticed again during the impoundment. This paper investigates possible causes of the seepage using a finite element model. The input data for the model were collected from site investigations and field records during the construction and monitoring of the dam. The study reveals that the most probable cause of the excessive seepage is the presence of a permeable soil layer underneath the dam due to the dissolution of the gypsum material...|$|E
40|$|Water is at {{the center}} of all efforts to address food security, poverty reduction, {{economic}} growth, energy production and human health. In arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater and water harvesting structures (such as Micro-Dam Reservoirs, MDRs) play a significant role for irrigation and maintaining the sustainability of water resources. Fighting poverty and drought using construction of MDRs is becoming a common practice in Tigray (northern Ethiopia), but their implementation is not without challenges. Reservoir leakage, inter alia, is one of the main problems facing MDRs in the region. This paper presents geological, geophysical, hydrogeological and hydrochemical study results in MDR to better understand and delineate leakage zones and mechanisms. Conventional geological mapping, geo-electrical methods (VES and ERP), hydrogeological and geochemical methods were used to understand the geological and geo-hydrological situation of the MDR. Integrated interpretation and synthesis of the data enable to delineate the leakage zone and path. The limestone-shale-marl intercalation unit that makes up the foundation and reservoir area is found to be the leaky unit due to syngenetic and epigenetic discontinuities, while the dolerite unit is relatively impervious. Installation of a cut-off wall at the <b>upstream</b> <b>toe</b> of the dam could be a possible solution to minimize the leakage problem underneath the dam foundation and left abutment/flank. As an alternative, proper utilization of the water from big diameter shallow hand dug wells from the leakage zone downstream of the MDR may be also conceived as a target without incurring additional costs of maintenance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnsuring {{the safety}} of {{hydraulic}} embankment structures, including embankment dams, levees and dykes, {{is a major concern}} all over the world. Still today, about one to two large dams fail every year in the world and hundreds, probably thousands, of dykes and levees fail every year in the world. Embankment hydraulic structures can be subject to three potential failure modes: instability, internal erosion and external erosion. The physical parameters driving instability are the pore pressures inside the embankment and its foundation. This failure mode covers both general slope sliding and instabilities due to seismic loadings. Statistics show that 6 % of the failure of large embankment dams are due to that process. Internal erosion can be initiated in the embankment and/or in its foundation by four several types of processes: crack erosion, contact erosion, regressive erosion and suffusion. Crack erosion and regressive erosion can lead {{to one of the most}} sudden and dangerous failure mode: piping. Statistics show that 46 % of the failures of large embankment dams are due to that process. External erosion is due to the detachment of the embankment material by the overtopping flow. Erosion of the <b>upstream</b> <b>toe</b> of dykes and levees can also lead to failures. Statistics show that 48 % of the failures of large embankment dams are due to these processes of external erosion. Study of real cases of embankment dam failures and researches performed in the last two decades on hydraulic embankments erosion both show that breach parameters (such as the breach peak outflow, the final breach length or the breach opening duration) can not be correctly predicted only by geometrical parameters of the embankment and the upstream reservoir. Taking into account the behaviour of the embankment and foundation material under the flow stress, that is called the material erodibility, is now considered essential for safety assessments of that type of structures. Different experimental devices, called erodimeters, have been developed for sediment transport or embankment issues. Their use is always based on an assumption of an erosion law, which is the relation between the rate of erosion (i. e. quantity of eroded material per time unit per surface unit) and parameters characterizing the flow and the soil material. Two erodimeters have been selected for the assessment of the erodibility of hydraulic embankment structures, based on the physical processes they are representing and their practical characteristics. These two erodimeters are the Jet Erosion Test and the Hole Erosion Test. After presenting the physical principles of these two tests and the modelling upon which they are based, their engineering application is illustrated as well as the research needs that remain...|$|E
40|$|The Goukou Wetland is a 700 ha unchannelled {{valley bottom}} wetland {{near the town}} of Riversdale in the Western Cape of South Africa. The wetland is {{approximately}} 16 km long and between 200 and 800 m wide, with peat deposits up to 8 m deep that get progressively shallower downstream. The Goukou Wetland {{is one of the last}} remaining intact peatlands of significant size in the Western Cape. However, there is increasing human pressure on these peat wetlands, where the dominant plant is palmiet (Prionium serratum), which is endemic to the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa. Palmiet is viewed as a problem plant by farmers as it is believed to block waterways and promote inundation of arable land and infrastructure. Many landowners therefore actively remove palmiet from peatlands, threatening the integrity of these wetlands. Although the hydrogeomorphic origin of large, non-peat floodplain and valley bottom wetlands has been investigated in South Africa, unchannelled valley-bottom wetlands with deep peat accumulations are rare features and have not been well studied. The hydrogeomorphic factors leading to peat accumulation have been documented elsewhere in Southern Africa, where aggradation due to sedimentation along trunk streams may block a tributary stream, elevating the local base level of the tributary, creating the accommodation space for organic sedimentation. Alternatively, sedimentation along a trunk stream at the toe of a tributary stream may similarly block a trunk stream, promoting organic sedimentation along the trunk stream upstream of the tributary. This pattern of peat accumulation is associated with declining peat thickness upstream of the blocked valley. In the case of the Goukou Wetland, however, peat depth and organic content was found to increase consistently <b>upstream</b> from the <b>toe</b> to the head of the wetland. The Goukou Wetland was graded along its length, with gradient increasing consistently upstream in response to longitudinal variation in discharge. There was no clear relationship between peat formation and tributary streams blocking the wetland. Instead, the distribution of peat and the extent of the wetland appeared to be controlled by the plant palmiet, whose clonal nature and robust root, rhizome and stem system allowed it to grow from channel banks and islands into fast-flowing river channels, slowing river flows and ultimately blocking the channel. The promotion of diffuse flows within the dense, monospecific stands of palmiet creates conditions conducive to water retention and peat accumulation. By growing across the full width of the valley floor, the plant is able to constrict the stream, trapping sediment and slowing flows such that the fluvial environment is changed from a fast flowing stream to one with slow, diffuse flow. These processes appear to lead to the formation of organic sediment, accumulating to form a deep peat basin. The sustained input of water from the folded and fractured quartzite lithologies of the Cape Supergroup that make up the Langeberg Mountains, which provide the bulk of the water supply to the wetland, is also important in promoting permanent flooding in the wetland. A feature that characterized the wetland was the fact that bedrock across the valley beneath the peat deposits exhibited a remarkably uniform elevation. This suggests that over long periods of time (tens to hundreds of thousands of years), bedrock has been laterally planed across the valley floor. It is proposed that valley widening associated with lateral planning of Uitenhage Formation rocks has taken place during periods of episodic very high flows. During these episodes, erosion cuts into the peat wetland and valley sides, cutting to bedrock and planing the valley floor to a uniform elevation for a given distance from the head of the wetland. Periods of episodic degradation are followed by periods of renewed peat accumulation associated with palmiet establishment, such that the wetland valley is shaped by repeated cycles of cutting and filling. Palmiet can be considered an “ecosystem engineer” that is integral to the formation of these deep peat basins. Removal of palmiet from these systems is likely to have negative consequences for the wetland and its functions in that water storage will be reduced, erosion will increase dramatically, and the water-purification function of the wetlands will be lost. Management of these wetlands, which are close to the geomorphic threshold slopes for their size, is therefore essential if they are to be preserved for the benefit of human well-being...|$|R
