Initially, {{the presentation of the}} loud noise (US) would cause the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response</b> (UR) (natural agitation) without prior classical conditioning. However, the continuous pairing of the loud noise (US) with the vibration (CS) converts the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response</b> (UR) into a (CR) as the fetus learns that the presentation of a vibration will be followed by a loud noise. Eventually, the fetus will respond to the vibration (CS) without being exposed to the loud noise (US); this is when conditioning has occurred. Conditioning has been demonstrated in as few as 12-15 pairings of the vibration (CS) with the loud noise (US) in fetuses as early as 32 weeks of gestation.|$|E

In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (<b>unconditioned</b> <b>response)</b> following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not produce a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food because it salivates).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanisms}} underlying {{learning in}} classical condition-ing experiments {{play a key}} role in many learning processes of real organ-isms. This paper presents a novel computational model that incorporates a biologically plausible hypothesis on the functions that the main nuclei of the amygdala might play in first and second order classical condi-tioning tasks. The model proposes that in these experiments the first and second order conditioned stimuli (CS) are associated both (a) with the unconditioned stimuli (US) within the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and (b) directly with the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>responses</b> (UR) through the connections linking the lateral amygdala (LA) to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA). The model, embodied in a simulated robotic rat, is val-idated by reproducing the results of first and second order conditioning experiments of both sham-lesioned and BLA-lesioned real rats. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Classical {{conditioning}} of {{skeletal muscle}} responses {{was accomplished by}} pairing microstimulation of the pontine nuclei as a conditioned stimulus (CS) with microstimulation of the dorsal accessory olive as an unconditioned stimulus (US). A conditioned response identical in form to the behavioral response elicited by the olivary stimulation was established when the CS was forward paired with the US, and behavioral extinction occurred with CS-alone presentations or unpaired CS-US presentations. Conditioned responding could not be established or maintained when the CS and US were simultaneously presented or when the US preceded the CS (i. e., backward paired). Complete lesions of the interpositus nucleus abolished both conditioned and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>responses.</b> These findings {{support the idea that}} plasticity associated with classical conditioning of skeletal muscle responses occurs in regions of the cerebellum that receive convergent CS and US input...|$|R
50|$|Without conditioning, {{there is}} already a {{relationship}} between the unconditioned stimulus and the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response.</b> When a second stimulus is paired with the unconditioned stimulus, the response becomes associated with both stimuli. The secondary stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus and elicits a conditioned response.|$|E

5000|$|As in Pavlovian conditioning, an {{initially}} neutral stimulus, in {{this case}} environmental cues, is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus that naturally produces a response prior to conditioning (the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response).</b> Over time and pairings the neutral stimulus will come to elicit responses similar to the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response.</b> In conditioned place preference the unconditioned stimulus could be {{any number of things}} including food pellets, water, sweet fluid, novel toys, social interaction, drug intoxication, drug withdrawal, foot shock, illness, wheel running or copulation. [...] The initially neutral environmental cues become associated with the motivational properties of the unconditioned stimulus leading to either approach or avoidance of the environment.

This paper contains a description of our approach to develop control algorithms for the Novel Unmanned Ground Vehicle (NUGV) to address this problem. The NUGV is a sixdegree-of-freedom, sensor-rich small mobile robot designed to demonstrate auto-learning capabilities {{for the improvement of}} mobility through variegated terrain. The learning processes we plan to implement are composed of classical and operant conditionings of novel responses built upon pre-defined fixed action patterns. The fixed action patterns will be in turn modulated by pre-defined low-level reactive behaviors that, as <b>unconditioned</b> <b>responses,</b> should continuously serve to maintain the viability of the robot during the activations of the fixed action patterns and of the higher-order (conditioned) behaviors. The sensors of the internal environment that govern the low-level reactive behaviors also serve as the criteria for operant conditioning.

40|$|Latent {{inhibition}} and habituation are behavioural {{phenomena that}} result from the same simple procedure: when an animal receives exposure to a stimulus, the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>responses</b> that were once provoked by that stimulus diminish or habituate, and subsequently {{the rate at which}} conditioned responding can be established to the stimulus is reduced. One parsimonious interpretation of these phenomena is that they reflect the operation of the same attentional process: a novel stimulus attracts attention, provokes responding and is rapidly learnt about; exposure to a stimulus produces a decline in attention and concomitant reductions in responding and learning. Here, we present an integrative review of recent research that provides support for a specific account of habituation and latent inhibition that is grounded in a formal analysis of the mnemonic processes involved in associative learning. This analysis also provides one interpretation {{of the role of the}} hippocampus, a structure traditionally associated with both mnemonic and attentional processes, in habituation and latent inhibition...|$|R

50|$|In {{classical}} or respondent conditioning, {{a relatively}} neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus) comes {{to signal the}} occurrence of a biologically significant stimulus (unconditioned stimulus) such as food or pain. This typically done by repeatedly pairing the two stimuli, as in Pavlov's experiments with dogs, where a bell was followed by food. As a result, the conditioned stimulus yields a conditioned response that is usually similar to the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response</b> elicited by unconditioned stimulus (e.g., salivation in Pavlov's dogs).|$|E
5000|$|Terminology for {{classical}} conditional {{has also}} been developed. In Pavlov's experiments the unconditioned stimulus (US) was the dog food because its effects did not depend on previous experience. Next, the conditioned stimulus (CS) (or conditional stimulus) was the metronome's sound because its effects depend on its association with food. [...] Likewise, {{the responses of the}} dog follow the same conditioned-versus-unconditioned arrangement. The conditioned response (CR) is the response to the conditioned stimulus, whereas the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response</b> (UR) corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} of {{the response to the}} conditioned stimulus increases over the period of learning, as the CS becomes associated with UCS. The {{strength of}} the response can diminish if CS is presented without UCS. In his famous experiment, Pavlov used the <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response</b> of dogs salivating at the sight of food (UCS), and paired the sound of a bell (CS) with receiving food, and later the dog salivated (CR) to the bell alone, indicating that an association had been established between the bell and food.|$|E
40|$|Fear {{acquisition}} and extinction are crucial mechanisms in the etiology {{and maintenance of}} anxiety disorders. Moreover, they might play {{a pivotal role in}} conveying the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of a (more or less) stronger proneness for, or resilience against psychopathology. There are only few insights in the neurobiology of genetically and environmentally based individual differences in fear learning and extinction. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 74 healthy subjects were investigated. These were invited according to 5 -HTTLPR/rs 25531 (S+ vs. L(A) L(A); triallelic classification) and TPH 2 (G(- 703) T) (T+ vs. T-) genotype. The aim was to investigate the influence of genetic factors and traumatic life events on skin conductance responses (SCRs) and neural responses (amygdala, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)) during {{acquisition and}} extinction learning in a differential fear conditioning paradigm. Fear acquisition was characterized by stronger late conditioned and <b>unconditioned</b> <b>responses</b> in the right insula in 5 -HTTLPR S-allele carriers. During extinction traumatic life events were associated with reduced amygdala activation in S-allele carriers vs. non-carriers. Beyond that, T-allele carriers of the TPH 2 (G(- 703) T) polymorphism with a higher number of traumatic life events showed enhanced responsiveness in the amygdala during acquisition and in the vmPFC during extinction learning compared with non-carriers. Finally, a combined effect of the two polymorphisms with higher responses in S- and T-allele carriers was found in the dACC during extinction. The results indicate an increased expression of conditioned, but also <b>unconditioned</b> fear <b>responses</b> in the insula in 5 -HTTLPR S-allele carriers. A combined effect of the two polymorphisms on dACC activation during extinction might be associated with prolonged fear expression. Gene-by-environment interactions in amygdala and vmPFC activation may reflect a neural endophenotype translating genetic and adverse environmental influences into vulnerability for or resilience against developing affective psychopathology...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the role of}} noradrenergic transmission in <b>unconditioned</b> and conditioned <b>responses</b> to predatory threats. First, we {{examined the effects of}} systemically injected beta-blockers on unconditioned and contextual conditioned response to cat odor. The centrally acting beta-blocker (propranolol) was able to impair <b>unconditioned</b> <b>responses,</b> as well as the acquisition of the contextual fear to cat odor; however, the peripherally acting (nadolol) was not effective. Next, we examined the neural substrate underlying the noradrenergic modulation of the defensive response to cat odor and focused on the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd), because it represents the hypothalamic site most responsive to predatory threats and, at the same time, presents a dense plexus of noradrenergic fibers. We were able to see that propranolol significantly reduced PMd-Fos expression in response to cat odor and that beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the PMd, before cat odor exposure, reduced defensive responses to the cat odor and to the cat odor-related environment. We have also shown that beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the PMd, before the exposure to cat odor-related context, impaired the contextual conditioned responses. Overall, the present results provide convincing evidence suggesting that central noradrenergic mediation is critical for the expression of unconditioned and contextual conditioned antipredatory responses. We have further shown that the PMd appears to be an important locus to mediate these beta-adrenoceptor effects.

50|$|The {{maintenance}} of fear {{has been shown}} to include the HPA axis, the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic systems, and the connections between the limbic system and frontal cortex. The HPA axis that coordinates the hormonal response to stress, which activates the LC-noradrenergic system, is implicated in the over-consolidation of memories that occurs in the aftermath of trauma. This over-consolidation increases the likelihood of one's developing PTSD.

50|$|Spontaneous {{recovery}} {{is associated with}} the learning process called classical conditioning, in which an organism learns to associate a neutral stimulus with a stimulus which produces an <b>unconditioned</b> <b>response,</b> such that the previously neutral stimulus comes to produce its own response, which is usually similar to that produced by the unconditioned stimulus.

In the conditioning experiments, the experimental animals received 15 trials in which touch to the lips, the conditioned stimulus (CS), was paired with sucrose, the unconditioned food stimulus (US). Control animals received 15 presentations of either CS or US, or both, applied in a random manner. After training, a strong conditioned response to touch was established in the experimental but not in the control groups. For subsequent electrophysiological analysis of posttraining neuronal responses to the touch CS, semi-intact preparations were set up from the same animals that had been behaviorally conditioned or subjected to control procedures. Intracellular recordings, made from previously identified motoneurons of the feeding system, allowed the fictive feeding response to the CS to be monitored. In experimental preparations, touch applied to the lips evoked significantly more fictive feeding cycles than in controls, and this demonstrated the existence of a neurophysiological correlate of the appetitively conditioned response observed in the whole animals...|$|R

Robert A. Rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking, and its implications, in his 1988 article [...] "Pavlovian conditioning: It's not what you think it is".

40|$|Behavior is a {{sequence}} of actions. Â  Premackian conditioning occurs when one of those actions permits an animal to engage in more biologically potent positive responsesâreinforcementâor forces them to engage in less positive (or negative) responses âpunishment. Â  Signals of the transition from one class of actions to another focus the instrumental responses in the first class and inform the contingent responses in the second class. Â  The signals may be innate (USs) or learned (sign-learning); excitatory (leading to more positive actions) or inhibitory (leading to less positive actions). Â  The potency of an action has phylogenetic origins, but may be conditioned by proximity to more potent responses, such as consummation of a reinforcer. Â  With practice instrumental responses may take on increased strength, {{and in some cases}} become motivationally autonomousâbecome habits. Â  Stimuli or responses that signal the availability of more positive actions may become incentive motivators that animals will approach. Â  Discriminative stimuli do not have intrinsic value as reinforcers, but only the value derived from the responses that they release. Â  These forces bend an animalâs trajectory through its stimulus-action-time context into a path that leads more directly to positive actions. Â  The association of actions (conditioned responses, operants, and observing responses) with actions of different potency (ultimately <b>unconditioned</b> <b>responses</b> or consummatory behavior) is the primary association in Premackian conditioning.

Their attenuation induced by decreasing these intervals in non-associative conditioning and their enhancement induced by associating the unconditioned stimuli (US) to a train of short (0. 1 s) hyperpolarizing electrical substitutive conditioning stimuli (SCS) in the Peri-KÃ¤stchen (PK) neuron were measured in four parameters, i. e., peak numbers (N) and amplitude () averaged from 120 responses, sum of these amplitudes (S AMP) and the highest peak amplitude (V) {{over a period of}} 4 min.
