A remote synchronization circuit produces <b>unit</b> address <b>control</b> <b>words</b> sequentially in data frames of 16 words. Means are provided in each transceiver unit to decode calling signals and to transmit calling and data signals. The transceivers communicate with each other over one data line. The synchronization unit communicates the address control information to the transceiver units over an address line and further provides the timing information over a clock line. A reference voltage level or ground line completes the interconnecting four wire hookup...|$|R

50|$|This is {{achieved}} {{by a combination of}} scrambling and encryption. The data stream is scrambled with a 48-bit secret key, called the <b>control</b> <b>word.</b> Knowing the value of the <b>control</b> <b>word</b> at a given moment is of relatively little value, as under normal conditions, content providers will change the <b>control</b> <b>word</b> several times per minute.

50|$|In {{order for}} the {{receiver}} to unscramble the data stream, it must be permanently informed about the current value of the <b>control</b> <b>word.</b> In practice, it must be informed slightly in advance, so that no viewing interruption occurs. Encryption is used to protect the <b>control</b> <b>word</b> during transmission to the receiver: the <b>control</b> <b>word</b> is encrypted as an entitlement control message (ECM). The CA subsystem in the receiver will decrypt the <b>control</b> <b>word</b> only when authorised to do so; that authority {{is sent to the}} receiver {{in the form of an}} entitlement management message (EMM). The EMMs are specific to each subscriber, as identified by the smart card in his receiver, or to groups of subscribers, and are issued much less frequently than ECMs, usually at monthly intervals. This being apparently not sufficient to prevent unauthorized viewing, TPS has lowered this interval down to about 12 minutes. This can be different for every provider, BSkyB uses a term of 6 weeks. When Nagravision 2 was hacked, Digital+ started sending a new EMM every three days to make unauthorized viewing more cumbersome.|$|R

50|$|One {{technical}} method, {{implemented by}} providers such as Irdeto and NDS, is {{to update the}} software of digital receivers provided by the subscription television service. This software implements a further decryption layer, held within the receiver. Rather than sending a plain text <b>control</b> <b>word</b> from the smart card to the receiver's microprocessor, which can be intercepted, the decrypted ECM will in fact be an encrypted <b>control</b> <b>word,</b> {{which can only be}} decrypted by a legitimate, non card sharing capable, receiver. A simpler method, used by several providers, is to simply increase the frequency of <b>control</b> <b>word</b> changes. With changes occurring as frequently as once every few seconds, extra stress is put onto the smart card sharing system, meaning that clients may be frustrated by short, frequent, missed viewing periods.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to compare lexical decision latencies in visual and auditory modalities to three word types: (a) words that are inconsistent with two information sources, orthography and semantics (i. e., heterographic homophones such as bite/byte), (b) words that are inconsistent with one information source, semantics (i. e., homographic homophones such as bat), and (c) <b>control</b> <b>words</b> that are not inconsistent with any information source. Participants (N = 76) were randomly assigned to either the visual or auditory condition in which they judged the lexical status (word or nonword) of 180 words (60 heterographic homophones, 60 homographic homophones, and 60 <b>control</b> <b>words)</b> and 180 pronounceable nonsense word foils. Results differed significantly in the visual and auditory modalities. In visual lexical decision, homographic homophones were responded to faster than heterographic homophones or <b>control</b> <b>words,</b> which did not differ significantly. In auditory lexical decision, both homographic homophones and heterographic homophones were responded to faster than <b>control</b> <b>words.</b> Results are used to propose potential modifications to the Cooperative Division of Labor Model of Word Recognition (Harm & Seidenberg, 2004) to enable it to encompass both the visual and auditory modalities and account for the present results...|$|R

Any word that is deciphered differently by both OCR programs or that is not in the English dictionary is marked as [...] "suspicious" [...] and converted into a CAPTCHA. The suspicious word is displayed, out of context, sometimes along with a <b>control</b> <b>word</b> already known. If the human types the <b>control</b> <b>word</b> correctly, then the response to the questionable word is accepted as probably valid. If enough users were to correctly type the <b>control</b> <b>word,</b> but incorrectly type the second word which OCR had failed to recognize, then the digital version of documents could end up containing the incorrect word. The identification performed by each OCR program is given a value of 0.5 points, and each interpretation by a human is given a full point. Once a given identification hits 2.5 points, the word is considered valid. Those words that are consistently given a single identity by human judges are later recycled as <b>control</b> <b>words.</b> If the first three guesses match each other but do not match either of the OCRs, they are considered a correct answer, and the <b>word</b> becomes a <b>control</b> <b>word.</b> When six users reject a word before any correct spelling is chosen, the word is discarded as unreadable.|$|R
