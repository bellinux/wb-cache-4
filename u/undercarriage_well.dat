25|$|The basic design, {{common to}} both models, {{was that of}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with side-by-side seating for two in a fully enclosed cabin. The main gear wheels of the undercarriage were retractable, and the tailwheel was steerable. The aircraft structure incorporated a framework built up of welded steel tube which extended lengthwise from the engine firewall {{to the rear of the}} cabin, and spanwise from one <b>undercarriage</b> <b>well</b> to the other. Around this framework was a conventional, monocoque fuselage. The MAC-125 was powered by a single 125-hp engine while the MAC-145 production model had a 145-hp engine instead and a larger tail fin.|$|E
500|$|As Airbus {{worked on}} its A330-200, {{hydraulic}} pump problems {{were reported by}} both A330 and A340 operators. This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340-200 in January 1994. On 4 January of that year, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300, while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport, was consumed by a fire that started in the right-hand main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>well.</b> [...] The incident caused US$30million in damage, and the aircraft took six months to repair. Consequently, operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997.|$|E

50|$|The short {{fuselage}} carried twin Heinkel HeS 011 {{jet engines}} set {{low to the}} rear, with the large cockpit located {{at the front of}} the main wing junction. The pilot and navigator sat side by side, with the radio/radar operator immediately behind them and facing rearward. A single engine air intake at the nose fed a steel duct which formed the structural spine of the craft. It passed beneath the cockpit and between the main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>wells,</b> before running under the main wing box and dividing to feed the two engines. This structural system allowed large removable panels to be cut in the duralumin skinning, allowing easy maintenance. A single nosewheel retracted beneath the front of the duct.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{features}} include a tandem cockpit, starboard tail rotor with a port tailplane, a fixed wheeled <b>undercarriage</b> as <b>well</b> as wire cutters {{above and below}} the cockpit and on the undercarriage. When the Rooivalk first came out, it was the only helicopter in the world that could fly upside down.|$|R
50|$|By 1943, the VVS {{was being}} re-equipped with Lavochkin La-5s and Yakovlev Yak-1s and Yak-9s which were {{extremely}} good low-to-medium-altitude fighters and, with their rugged construction and wide-track <b>undercarriages,</b> were <b>well</b> suited to operating from the frontline airfields. Spitfire IX became irreplaceable in a {{role of a}} high-altitude interceptor of air defence.|$|R
25|$|The Yokosuka MXY-5 was a Japanese {{military}} glider {{produced for}} the Imperial Japanese Navy during the World War II. The glider consisted of fabric-wrapped plywood covering a tubular steel frame. The design also featured a retractable <b>undercarriage</b> as <b>well</b> {{as an emergency}} skid. The design was flight tested in 1942. Only 12 were produced and none were used operationally.|$|R
500|$|The {{exterior}} {{design of}} the train was left to aeronautical engineer Albert Gardner Dean (Walter Dean's younger brother) who designed the sloping nose shape, with architects Paul Philippe Cret and John Harbeson, devising a way to strengthen and beautify the sides with the train's horizontal fluting. [...] On April 15, 1936, Colonel Ragsdale, Walter Dean and Albert Dean, filed patent applications for a [...] "Rail Car Front End Construction". On September 23, 1941 the USPTO granted US patents 2,256,493 and 2,256,494 to the Budd Company. [...] The streamlining extended to the <b>undercarriage</b> as <b>well</b> to reduce drag.|$|R
50|$|The Caproni Ca.311 {{was a light}} bomber-reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{produced in}} Italy prior to and during World War II. It {{was a member of}} the large family of Caproni designs derived from the Ca.306 airliner prototype of 1935, and more directly a modification of the Ca.310 bomber. As with other related types, it was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design. This particular design incorporated the Ca.310's retractable main <b>undercarriage,</b> as <b>well</b> as the heavily glazed nose that had been tested on the Ca.310bis prototype. New features included a relocation of the dorsal turret to a position immediately aft of the cockpit, and additional glazing throughout the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal, metal-covered construction. The crew of three {{consisted of a}} pilot, a bombardier, and a rear gunner. The bombardier's combat station was situated in a gondola underneath the hull, where he could also operate an underbelly machine gun. The fixed <b>undercarriage</b> was <b>well</b> spatted, but despite a massive look, it was not suited for rough airfields. Bombs were carried under the wings: the maximum load was 700 kg (6 x 100 kg and 2 x 50 kg). The aircraft were equipped {{with one of the}} following engines: Bristol Pegasus IIM2 normal: 570 hp (425 kW), maximum: 670 hp (500 kW) - PZL.23A; Pegasus VIII normal: 650 hp (485 kW), maximum: 720 (537 kW) - PZL.23B. Regardless of the engine, the aircraft had a two-blade propeller.|$|R
50|$|The mainwheels of the Caproni's {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} were on independent cranked axles from the lower longerons which positioned them under the engines, 3.52 m apart. Each axle end was supported by three steel struts, two from the forward wing spar and one from the rear; the forward pair were elastically sprung within the wing. The <b>undercarriage</b> struts, as <b>well</b> as those mounting the engines, were designed to be faired-in but the few known photographs of the Ca.66, unlike the three-views, do not show fairings in place.|$|R
5000|$|Three Puffins were built, {{the first}} made its maiden {{flight from the}} Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment at the Isle of Grain {{in the hands of}} Norman Macmillan on 19 November 1920. [...] Flight tests {{revealed}} one problem that was never satisfactorily solved: the Puffin was tail heavy and increasing tail incidence seems not to have helped. [...] Other problems came from the float. The first prototype had a float that was short at the front, which in rough water produced so much spray that it destroyed the propeller and damaged the radiator. It was therefore lengthened, with an upward curving section, and reinforced with an extra pair of struts to the engine mounting. This reduced the problem but did not cure it, so another float, with a re-profiled cross-section was introduced which behaved much better. [...] The third prototype used a float incorporating these features but with a flat top, which further improved water handling. The wheeled <b>undercarriage</b> behaved <b>well,</b> and allowed true amphibious use, in contrast to the troublesome Pintail arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The Fokker D.XXI {{was first}} used in combat by the Finnish Air Force during the 1939-1940 Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. Upon the war's outbreak, a total of 41 {{aircraft}} were in Finnish service, all of which being powered by the Mercury VIII engine. On 1 December 1939, the D.XXI achieved its first victory with the shooting down of a Soviet Tupolev SB. Against the aircraft of the Soviet Air Force, the Fokker was more evenly matched, and its rugged design with a radial engine and fixed <b>undercarriage</b> made it <b>well</b> suited for Finnish conditions. The performance of the Finnish D.XXI allegedly won the admiration of many Soviet pilots.|$|R
5000|$|The Loening C-2 Air Yacht was an amphibious {{airliner}} {{produced in}} the United States {{at the end of}} the 1920s, developed from the OL observation aircraft the firm was producing for the US military. It was a two-bay biplane of unconventional design, with a tall, narrow fuselage that nearly filled the interplane gap. The pilot (and sometimes one passenger) sat in an open cockpit at the top of the fuselage, with the engine mounted in front of them. Underneath the fuselage was a long [...] "shoehorn"-style float, that extended forward underneath the engine and propeller. Four to six passengers could be accommodated in a fully enclosed cabin within the fuselage. The main units of the <b>undercarriage</b> retracted into <b>wells</b> in the sides of the fuselage. Stabilising floats were fitted against the undersides of the lower wing.|$|R
