5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that it is necessary for salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of Nigeria, ethnic groups speak more than one language. The {{official}} language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, owing {{to the influence of}} British colonisation that ended in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> God, <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> religion, and <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|R

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E
5|$|Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57). Pierce was a {{northern}} Democrat {{who saw the}} abolitionist movement as a fundamental threat to the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing to stem conflict between North and South {{setting the stage for}} Southern secession and the American Civil War. Historians and other scholars generally rank Pierce among the worst of U.S. Presidents.|$|E

5|$|Garfield Sobers, {{captain of}} the West Indies cricket team {{and one of the}} most {{prominent}} cricketers in the world, outraged many in the Caribbean in September 1970 when he took part in a friendly double-wicket tournament at Salisbury Sports Club in Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980), a country in southern Africa that was unrecognised internationally because of its mostly white minority government. The resulting furore nearly caused him to lose the captaincy, and threatened the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Indies team itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Abd al-Rahman visited England and Egypt, {{where he}} met with {{high-ranking}} officials and with King Farouk. His purpose was to present Sudanese criticism of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty in person. He was openly critical of the Egyptian plans for <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nile valley, which he considered unrealistic. In May 1937, his eldest son al-Siddiq al-Mahdi visited Egypt and was given a royal reception. These moves concerned the British, who saw them as potentially {{the start of a}} Mahdist alliance with Egypt, despite Abd al-Rahman's avowed Sudanese nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Public {{perception}} of the anthem is mixed among Russians.

A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Movement uses symbols to {{represent}} the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, {{better known as the}} Olympic rings, consists of five intertwined rings and represents the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Australia and Europe). The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had {{at least one of them}} on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.|$|E
5|$|The growing hardships in {{the country}} {{during the early years}} of World War I pushed Quwatli to join the secret society of al-Fatat, which was {{facilitated}} by his childhood friend and co-founder, Nasib al-Bakri. Al-Fatat was an underground organization established in Paris in 1911 by Arab nationalists with the aim of gaining independence and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various Arab territories in the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, the society established its main branch in Damascus, and was successful in attracting the Syrian elite into its ranks.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Representations of SO(5) _{q} are {{constructed}} explicitly on the Chevalley basis for all q, generic and root <b>of</b> <b>unity.</b> Matrix elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generators are obtained for all representations depending on three variable indices, the maximal number being 4. A prescription for contraction is given such that a complete Hopf algebra is immediately {{obtained for the}} non-semisimple contracted case. For q a root <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> <b>the</b> periodic representations for SO(5) _{q} and the contracted algebra are obtained directly in the "fractional part" formalism which unifies the treatments for the generic and root <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> cases. <b>The</b> q-deformed quadratic Casimir operator is explicitly evaluated for the representations presented...|$|R
5|$|The treatises cover a {{wide range}} of topics, {{including}} Symeon's defense against Stephen regarding his own views on the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Trinity. He also presents his doctrine on mysticism, the necessity of faith, the possibility of direct experience of God, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and more. The last four treatises were written during his exile, and discuss living a holy life while on earth, salvation through faith and good works, and the need for solitude if one wants to become a channel of divine grace to others.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church {{had been}} {{restored}} only after eighteen years, when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice (1 August 1177); shortly thereafter the pro-imperial pope Callistus III (successor of Victor IV) abandoned his {{claims to the}} papacy and submitted to Alexander III (29 August 1178). Victor IV and his successors Paschal III (1164–68) and Callistus III (1168–78) are now regarded as antipopes by the Catholic Church, while Alexander III is recognized as legitimate successor of St. Peter the Apostle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospels {{is further}} {{emphasised}} by {{the decoration of}} the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E

5|$|Wessex kings {{carried an}} aura of power and success, which made them {{increasingly}} powerful in the 920s, while most Continental houses were in military trouble and engaged in internecine warfare. While the civil wars and the Viking attacks on the Continent had spelled the end of <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carolingian empire, which had already disintegrated into separate kingdoms, military success had enabled Æthelstan to triumph at home and to attempt {{to go beyond the}} reputation of a great heroic dynasty of warrior kings, in order to develop a Carolingian ideology of kingship.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting {{with family and friends}} at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
