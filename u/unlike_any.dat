5|$|In Uruguay, {{the album}} was {{released}} in 1974 as a single LP (with just the first two sides) on Odeon Records. It used a simplistic sleeve design <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> other release, with a rising sun on the cover.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> other, the Belgian folk metal band Ithilien {{preferred}} {{to focus their}} lyrics on very personal subjects such as loss, perseverance or grief. The album Shaping the Soul is for example constructed based on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross model of the mourning process.|$|E
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E

50|$|M.D. was <b>unlike</b> {{practically}} <b>any</b> other comic published, {{focusing on}} medical stories, surgical practices and the day-to-day work of doctors. Each issue featured four stories, {{plus at least}} one text piece about a real-life major medical figure.|$|R
5|$|The Dwarfie Stane tomb on {{the island}} of Hoy is made from a single huge block of red {{sandstone}} with a hollowed-out central chamber. This style is quite <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> other Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC. It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing, appearing in the 16th century Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum by Joannem Ben who provided the explanation for its existence as having been built and used by giants.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{excavation}} into Borobudur during reconstruction {{suggests that}} adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith {{had already begun}} to erect a large structure on Borobudur's hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists. The foundations are <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> Hindu or Buddhist shrine structures, and therefore, the initial structure is considered more indigenous Javanese than Hindu or Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot {{said for}} the PC version, [...] "Off-road Adventure 2 is <b>unlike</b> {{virtually}} <b>any</b> previous driving game in {{that it does not}} force you to compete against other cars or a constantly ticking clock." [...] GameSpot also rated the game 7.0 (good).|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{has been}} {{observed}} that Hogarth’s pictures are exceedingly <b>unlike</b> [...] <b>any</b> other representations {{of the same kind}} of subjects—that they [...] form a class, and have a character, peculiar to themselves. It may [...] be worth while to consider in what this general distinction [...] consists.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> almost <b>any</b> other {{radio or}} {{television}} personality, silence never scares Fass. Seconds pass as he seemingly ponders {{the thoughts of}} his guests, leaving them or the listener a space {{to fill in the}} blanks. In addition, to being a congenial master of ceremonies, Fass is a good listener.|$|R
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> {{other species}} of Siricidae, the Sirex {{woodwasp}} can damage relatively healthy trees so heavily, they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need healthy wood, the Sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested.|$|E
5|$|Whitwell Station, on the Ventnor West {{branch of}} the Isle of Wight Central Railway, was opened {{along with the other}} {{stations}} on the branch on 20 July 1897. It was equipped with a passing loop, two platforms, a signal box and a substantial station building. Located at the top of Nettlecombe Lane, the station is located close to the village and the community it was intended to serve, <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> other stations on the line.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{isolated}} coastal location, the Isle of Portland has {{an extensive}} range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists {{from around the}} country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach {{is one of only}} two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.|$|E
25|$|With {{the tour}} {{supporting}} Signos, Soda Stereo became international superstars. The band would continue their worldwide success {{well into the}} 1990s, and evolving their musical sounds <b>unlike</b> almost <b>any</b> other Rock en Español band. In fact, they would lead {{the way in the}} changes Argentine rock would experience as the 1990s drew near.|$|R
5000|$|Bake Butler from Allmusic {{described}} the album as [...] "getting {{hit by a}} semi, kicked in the teeth, and thrown down three flights of stairs all at once. ... In a way <b>unlike</b> almost <b>any</b> other, they scream in your face fairly emotional, damaging lyrics, while breaking the musical boundaries, {{as well as your}} eardrums." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> nearly <b>any</b> other console (except for the 3DO and CD-i), the PC-FX {{was also}} {{available}} as an internal PC card for NEC PC-98 and AT/IBM PC compatibles. This PC card came with two CDs of software {{to help the}} user program games for the PC-FX. However, compatibility issues prevented games developed with this software from actually running on the console.|$|R
5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. <b>Unlike</b> <b>any</b> other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Sasha {{leaves a}} pigeon at the ShadowClan border {{to prove to}} Tigerstar that kittypets can hunt. After {{catching}} a rabbit, Sasha is attacked by two foxes. Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling up a tree, Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him, and she jumps down to assist him. After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for the pigeon, and that she is <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> housecat he has ever known.|$|E
5000|$|Personalized {{plates are}} {{optional}} in Slovakia {{for an extra}} fee. The format must include the two letter district code and 5 other characters in either XX-LLLLL, XX-LLLLN or LLLNN format. <b>Unlike</b> in <b>any</b> other type of plates, the use of Q and W is possible. Plates {{are not allowed to}} display any political, religious or offensive message. Smaller plates are available for motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{difference}} in sternal and shoulder girdle anatomy, many enantiornitheans used a flight style <b>unlike</b> that of <b>any</b> modern bird species, though more typical flight styles were present as well.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5|$|Anning's discoveries became key {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} for extinction. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. Of the bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, some, such as the plesiosaur, so <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> known living creature, struck a major blow against this idea.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed to look and behave <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right or wrong, but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
30|$|P. parviflora (Fig.  4 e) had starch {{granules}} {{which were}} <b>unlike</b> those of <b>any</b> other species. The starch granules were compressed with depressions on their lateral sides {{which may have}} resulted from pressure from surrounding starch granules.|$|R
5000|$|The Scaregrounds were {{different}} this episode. Only one family member {{had to make}} it to advance. But <b>unlike</b> the others, <b>any</b> team who got both members across didn't get a $1,000 bonus like the previous team episodes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> with <b>any</b> other defendant, if {{you want}} to sue the federal {{government}} for illegal wiretapping you have to first go through an administrative procedure with the agency that did the wiretapping. That means, essentially, that you have to politely complain to the illegal wiretappers and tip them off to your legal strategy, and then wait for a while as they decide whether {{to do anything about it}} before you can sue them in court.|$|R
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{were first}} {{observed}} in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the Soviet Union might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Charig and Milner found Baryonyx unique {{enough to warrant}} a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found Baryonyx to be <b>unlike</b> <b>any</b> other theropod group (and considered {{the possibility that it}} was a thecodont, due to apparently primitive features), but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in Dilophosaurus. They also noted that two fragmentary snouts from Niger, assigned to the family Spinosauridae by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to those of Baryonyx and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that Spinosaurus, described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt which were destroyed in World War II, and Baryonyx were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. French palaeontologist Eric Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990 Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of Baryonyx, since they did not find their remains similar enough.|$|E
50|$|Dungeon Party {{features}} 3 free {{classes and}} 4 extra classes {{which can be}} unlocked via the game shop. <b>Unlike</b> traditional MMORPG's <b>any</b> experience points or skills learned in each game are reset after all rounds have been played.|$|R
50|$|Any team {{called for}} icing the puck from within their {{defensive}} zone {{will not be}} permitted a line change. <b>Unlike</b> the NHL, <b>any</b> team that ices the puck from their half of the neutral zone will be permitted to change.|$|R
50|$|The ship's {{degree of}} modernity was <b>unlike</b> that of <b>any</b> ship previously. The {{first-class}} dining room's decor was simple. The {{dining room was}} also the largest of any ship, rose three decks high, and had a grand staircase for an entrance.|$|R
