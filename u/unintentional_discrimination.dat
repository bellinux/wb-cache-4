40|$|Purpose ‐ Due to {{demographic}} changes in most industrialized countries, {{the average age}} of working people is continuously increasing, and the workforce is becoming more age-diverse. This review, together with the earlier JMP Special Issue "Facilitating age diversity in organizations ‐ part I: challenging popular misbeliefs", aims to summarize new empirical research on age diversity in organizations, and on potential ways to support beneficial effects of age diversity in teams and organizations. The second part of the Special Issue focusses on managing mutual perceptions and interactions between different age groups. Design/methodology/approach ‐ A literature review is provided summarizing and discussing relevant empirical research on managing mutual perceptions and interactions between different age groups at work. Findings ‐ The summarized research revealed a number of challenges to benefit from age diversity in organizations, such as in-group favoritism, age norms about appropriate behavior of older workers, intentional and <b>unintentional</b> age <b>discrimination,</b> differences in communication styles, and difference in attitudes towards age diversity. At the same time, managerial strategies to address these challenges are developed. Originality/value ‐ Together with {{the first part of this}} Special Issue, this is one of the first reviews on ways to address the increasing age diversity in work organizations based on sound empirical research...|$|R

The European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter referred to as the "European Court"), in its role as a component of this system of protection, acts as an international judicial organ that reviews individual applications concerning an alleged breach of the European Convention by a Member State. In the area of the protection of human rights such prohibition of discrimination is based on the fundamental principle of equality, and constitutes an integral part of all important international instruments for the protection of such rights, and of the modern national legal orders of states. Inevitably, however, the legal systems of modern-day states are built upon distinctions, categorizations and classifications inherent to their societies, creating <b>unintentional</b> opportunities for <b>discrimination.</b> The problem of the prohibition of discrimination consists in delimiting the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{have long}} {{recognized}} employers 2 ̆ 7 ability to construct benefits packages to induce workers to sort themselves {{into and out}} of jobs. For instance, to encourage applications from individuals with a highly valued but largely unobservable characteristic, such as patience, employers might offer benefits that patient individuals are likely to value more than other individuals. By offering a compensation package with highly valued benefits but a relatively low wage, employers will attract workers with the favored characteristic and discourage other individuals from applying for or accepting the job. While economic theory generally views this kind of self-selection in value neutral terms, prejudiced employers could exploit this mechanism to systematically discourage individuals on the basis of observable characteristics that the law prohibits employers from considering in their hiring decisions. As long as groups systematically differ in their preferences for various employment terms and conditions, employers can generate sorting in the application and employment acceptance stages, leading to the desired segregated outcome in a way that regulators will find difficult to prevent without dictating uniformity in benefits packages. We develop a formal model as well as an intuitive discussion of this phenomenon. We provide a number of representative illustrations of how a prejudiced employer could exploit preference heterogeneity for discriminatory ends. These mechanisms include wage and benefit packages such as (1) high pension, low wages; (2) commission-based salaries; (3) Sundays-off policies; and (4) free school tuition. We also note that some employers might end up with a segregated workforce even when they have no intention to sort workers or when they intend to sort for a nondiscriminatory characteristic. Finally, we conclude that current federal antidiscrimination law inadequately addresses either intentional or <b>unintentional</b> passive <b>discrimination.</b> Neither disparate treatment nor disparate impact frameworks are well suited to grappling with this form of structural discrimination. Passive discrimination facilitates rather than impedes employee choice and thus might not be viewed as discrimination per se, even if it results in workplace segregation or means that individuals with protected characteristics who fail to self sort are least likely to value the form of compensation and fringe benefits they receive. We finish with a discussion of some judicial and legislative approaches that may ameliorate passive discrimination...|$|R

This thesis addresses the question: how can an analyst determine the relative significance of the inputs to a black-box predictive model in order to assess the model's fairness (or discriminatory extent) ? We present FairML, an end-to- end toolbox for auditing predictive models by quantifying the relative significance of the model's inputs. FairML leverages model compression and four input ranking algorithms to quantify a model's relative predictive dependence on its inputs. The relative significance of the inputs to a predictive model can then be used to assess the fairness (or discriminatory extent) of such a model. With FairML, analysts can more easily audit cumbersome predictive models that are difficult to interpret. by Julius A. Adebayo. Thesis: S.

30|$|Among these, a {{considerable}} number of papers highlighted the two main forms of discrimination introduced by data mining. In this context, some authors stressed the fact that the aforementioned algorithmic mechanisms might result in involuntary and accidental discrimination [8, 14, 17, 21, 25, 39, 45, 54, 73, 93]. Barocas and Selbst [8], for example, claimed that “when it comes to data mining, <b>unintentional</b> <b>discrimination</b> is the more pressing concern because {{it is likely to be}} far more common and easier to overlook” [8] and expressed concern about the possibility that classifiers in data mining could contain unlawful and harmful discrimination towards protected classes and or vulnerable groups. Holtzhausen, along the same lines, argued that “algorithms can have unintended consequences” [39] and might cause real harm to individuals, ranging from differences in pricing, to employment practices, to police surveillance. Some other studies instead highlighted that data mining technologies could result in direct and voluntary discrimination [32, 39, 46]. Here we follow the aforementioned definition of direct discrimination offered by [32] that describes it as discrimination against minorities or disadvantaged groups on the basis of sensitive discriminatory attributes related to group membership such as race, gender or sexual orientation. Holtzhausen, for instance, warned against the discriminatory use of ethnic profiling in housing and surveillance [1, 39] discussed potentially oppressive and discriminatory outcomes of data mining on migration and profiling that impose an automatic and arbitrary classification and categorization upon supposedly risky travelers.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{evaluation}} of service users’ and carers’ experience of involvement in mental health education, training and research, an extended literature review was undertaken. The purpose of this was to review policy underpinning service user and carer involvement in those areas, identify the extent and range of involvement, the processes involved, {{and the extent to}} which the effectiveness and impact of involvement had been evaluated. The review found that there was a range of different ways in which people were involved. It identified different types and levels of involvement and different motivations for taking part in involvement activities. Government policy and guidance on public and patient involvement (PPI) in health services has clearly been a driver and has resulted in widespread involvement activity but this has developed on an ad hoc and inconsistent basis. There are benefits for service users and carers, the NHS, and educational establishments arising out of involvement activity. These include improvements in the health and well-being of service users, enhancing the student experience, and improvements to service delivery. However, there are still barriers to involvement including organisational factors and <b>unintentional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Payment for involvement activity remains an under researched area. Service users value payments but welfare benefits rules, and inconsistent interpretation of good practice guidance, mean this can be a further barrier to involvement. Currently, the evidence base evaluating the effectiveness of service user involvement in a range of activities including service planning, delivery, education and research is limited...|$|E
40|$|The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act, (Department for Education and Skills (DES) 2001) gave {{education}} {{providers in}} the UK legal responsibility to ensure disabled {{students are not}} disadvantaged in or excluded from education. The more recent Disability Discrimination Act (Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) 2005) stipulates that public bodies, including universities, need to eliminate discrimination and harassment whilst ensuring that their policies {{meet the needs of}} disabled people, promoting equal opportunities. In addition universities are now mandated to embed these regulations in all aspects of their work. Inclusive practice should be anticipatory and should be evident in every aspect of academic life for students (Equality and Human Rights Commission 2009 a). Against this backdrop a three year project was undertaken through the Teaching Quality Enhancement Fund (TQEF) at the University of Huddersfield. The project aims were to evaluate perceived satisfaction with the level of support received by disabled students and to improve provision through staff development and dissemination of best practice. This entailed a review of the literature; the design and administration of a self completion questionnaire and face to face interviews with disabled students; a staff survey of knowledge, skills and attitudes in relation to disability; the development of staff development activities and resources and a national conference ‘Degrees of Independence’ which was jointly hosted with the University of Huddersfield Student Union. Full details of the project can be found at [URL] This report offers a discussion of the analysis of data from student questionnaires and interviews. Difficulties conducting research with this particular student group emerged whilst attempting to reach a sample of disabled students. Disabled students may choose not to declare their disability to the university and students may have a disability that is unknown to them. We therefore concluded that {{it was not possible to}} identify with any certainty the full population of disabled students in the School. Despite these and other challenges three themes emerged as worthy of note and further development: 1. 	The gap between identification of a disability and the provision of support 2. 	The <b>unintentional</b> <b>discrimination</b> that may occur where university staff are unaware of the disabled students’ need 3. 	Preparation for professional practice.

40|$|Advocates of {{algorithmic}} techniques like {{data mining}} {{argue that these}} techniques eliminate human biases from the decision-making process. But an algorithm {{is only as good}} as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm’s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court. This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law—more particularly, through Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining’s victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others’ discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying data. Addressing the sources of this <b>unintentional</b> <b>discrimination</b> and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data’s disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of “discrimination” and “fairness. ...|$|E
40|$|Australia has {{accepted}} several million immigrant and humanitarian entrant people since the large-scale immigration program {{began at the}} end of World War II. Since the White Australia Policy was completely abandoned in the early 1970 s, many more Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people have arrived in Australia. They have disproportionately moved to and settled in the metropolitan centres, and not the regional centres. There is very little literature about the settlement of Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people in Australian regional centres. This research used a dialectic social work lens to analyse critically how settlement was structurally and individually framed by exploring the settlement experience of Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people living in an Australian regional centre, using Coffs Harbour NSW as a case study. Respondents (31) and key informants (16) were interviewed using in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. There were six themes that proved to be significant that exhibited minimal social inclusion of Asian immigrant and humanitarian entrant people, resulting in a position of social inequality: Firstly, compatriots were present in small numbers, but were not deemed important. They did not play much of a role in the settlement of the respondents. Secondly, DIMIA funded hours of English language tuition were quite limited, and this resulted in most respondents only learning survival to functional English. Thirdly, the respondents had to interact with the townspeople, {{because of a lack of}} compatriots. Through this interaction, the respondents were forced to speak and learn more English. They were seen to be reaching out, by the townspeople. Fourthly, the respondents reported experiencing mainly low-level and <b>unintentional</b> <b>discrimination</b> and racism. The townspeople were reported overall as polite but tentative (tolerant but not accepting). Fifthly, the respondents were employed in part-time and casual work ranging from unskilled to semi-skilled. Their level of English kept them out of the occupations they wanted to work in, and this was not likely to change in Coffs Harbour; although, most of the respondents were employed in some capacity. Sixthly, belongingness, acceptance by the dominant group and the respondents’ sense of place, was attributed to Australia and in some cases to Australia and the country of origin. Belongingness was not attributed to Coffs Harbour or to compatriots. This reflects Australia, as the preferred country in which to live because of its standard of life. The respondents’ settlement was found to be one of minimal social inclusion (tolerance) resulting in a position of social inequality. This research has advocated change and reform, by striving to individualise the structural and giving voice to a marginalised group of people and then using this collectivised voice to advocate for change on the structural level. The commencement of this change and reform is the reconceptualisation of regional settlement...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Lønning II {{white paper}} asks for more {{knowledge}} on clinical priorities {{in different areas}} of health care. This in particular goes for resources used in intensive care units. Thanks to improvements in medical and technological knowledge and {{a greater proportion of}} older patients with complex diseases intensive care units face serious challenges regarding bedside priorities. Which patients and what kind of treatment should be prioritised? Aim: The aim of this research has been to shed light on the values and considerations that affect the priority decisions with regard to limitation of intensive care treatment in intensive care. Further it was to illuminate if and how resource restrictions were followed by specific limitations in medical and nursing care. Method: This research is based on qualitative method through field observations and in-depth interviews with intensive care physicians and intensive care nurses in three intensive care units in Norwegian University Hospitals. Emphasis was on eliciting the underlying rationale for prioritisations in clinical intensive care with particular focus on clinicians’ value considerations when limiting intensive care treatment. Findings: Informants perceived that provision of treatment that was not found to be meaningful represented an increasing dilemma in intensive care. One possible explanation could be that the basis for decision-making was uncertain, complex and contradictory. The informants claimed that those who were responsible for making decisions on the admitting ward wished to prolong futile treatment because of feelings of guilt or responsibility for something that had gone wrong during the course of treatment. The assessments of the patient’s situation that were made by physicians from the admitting ward were often more organ-oriented, and their expectations tended to be less realistic than those of the clinicians in the ICU, who frequently had a more balanced perspective on the patient’s total condition. Aspects such as the personality and the specialisation of those involved, the culture of the unit and the degree of interdisciplinary cooperation constituted important issues in the decisionmaking processes. Significant others could cause <b>unintentional</b> <b>discrimination</b> of ICU patients. Family members who were demanding could receive more time and attention to the patient as well as for themselves. The status and position of patients and next of kin and /- or an interesting medical diagnosis appeared to govern the clinicians’ priorities with regard to patients and families – consciously as well as unconsciously. Scarcity of resources in the ICUs regularly gave rise to suboptimal professional standards of medical treatment and nursing care. The clinicians rarely referred to national priority criteria as a rationale for bedside priorities. Because prioritisations were undertaken implicitly and most likely partly without the clinician being aware of it, essential patient rights, such as justice and equality, could be at risk. Conclusion: Under-communicated value considerations jeopardise the principle of justice in intensive care. If intensive care patients are to be ensured equal treatment, strategies for interdisciplinary, transparent and appropriate decision-making processes must be developed, in which open and hidden values are rendered visible, power structures are revealed, employees are respected and the various perspectives on the treatment are awarded legitimate attention...|$|E
