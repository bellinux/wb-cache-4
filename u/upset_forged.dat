Carbide particles at the grain boundaries were equal size, averaging 13. 0 μm in diameter. The low ductility samples contained an average of twelve particles per 250 μm of grain boundary, high ductility samples contained an average of only four particles along the same grain boundary length.

Results showed the alloy increased ductility with forging temperature, which corresponded to decreased particle count. Mechanical properties were altered less prominently with solutionizing temperature, but a small increase in tensile strength and decrease in ductility was associated with higher temperature solutionizing, accompanied by a decreased particle size. Particle count and distribution were found to the key factor in determining ductility of the material. Forging at low temperatures causes plastic deformation at the grain boundaries, providing a low energy nucleation site for migrating carbon in solution, thereby increasing the number of particles in the forged pieces.

In the past, the exhaust valves in large marine diesel engines have been made through free forging by using the stretch forming method.

For the forming method of the valve, the electric upset method is used. Solid bar is raised up to the forming temperature by using electric energy and is continually deformed by upset pressure.

Due to a “low cost titanium” product manufacturing initiative, targeting a reduction in the cost of titanium components, a titanium powder forging technique has gained significant interest. In titanium powder forging, powder consolidation is a key factor that influences successful component manufacture. Consolidation during titanium powder forging is dependent on the densification and deformation mechanisms involved. In this study, a finite element method is used to model the densification and deformation behaviour of titanium powder compacts during powder forging. The research focuses on developing a simulation capability and identifying a suitable constitutive model to simulate the powder forging process that can predict the relative density distribution.

The {{purpose of the present}} study is to determine the mechanical behaviour of the alloy in tension and compression at room temperature (RT) and elevated temperatures, and also to compare the compression behaviour of the material with its tensile behaviour. It has been found that due to the residual pores, lack of full level interparticle bonding and high oxygen content (0. 87 wt%) in the consolidated samples, the UFG TiAl based alloy has a very low room temperature tensile fracture strength of 100 MPa and shows no tensile ductility. However these microstructural defects and high oxygen content have much less significant effect on the room temperature compressive mechanical properties, and the alloy shows a high compressive yield strength of 1410 MPa, and some ductility (plastic strain to fracture 4 %). At elevated temperatures of 800 oC and above, the alloy shows high tensile and compressive ductility as demonstrated by 75 % tensile elongation to fracture and no cracking in <b>upset</b> <b>forging</b> with a height reduction of 50 % at 900 oC. The yield strength of the alloy at 900 oC is 55 MPa in tension and 33 MPa in compression, both of which are lower than those of coarse grained TiAl based alloys with similar compositions at 900 oC. This is due to a higher creep rate of the UFG alloy caused by the small grains. The good formability of the UFG TiAl based alloy as reflected by the lower critical temperature above which the alloy becomes highly formable indicates that the material can be used as a suitable precursor for secondary thermomechanical processing and super-plastic forming...|$|R

Decomposition of the recrystallised β-phase and subsequent dehydrogenation provides substantial grain refinement of the cast structure...|$|R
50|$|Mechanical presses {{function}} {{by using}} cams, cranks or toggles {{to produce a}} preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system difference forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 tons). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press is its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages are that they are slower, larger and more costly to operate.The roll <b>forging,</b> <b>upsetting,</b> and automatic hot forging processes all use specialized machinery.|$|R
50|$|The {{downside}} {{to the process}} is it only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, there large quantities are required to justify this process.The process starts by heating up the bar to 1200 to 1300 °C (2200 to 2350 °F) in less than 60 seconds using high power induction coils. It is then descaled with rollers, sheared into blanks, and transferred several successive forming stages, during which it is <b>upset,</b> preformed, final <b>forged,</b> and pierced (if necessary). This process can also be couple with high speed cold forming operations. Generally, the cold forming operation will do the finishing stage so that the advantages of cold-working can be taken advantage of, while maintaining the high speed of automatic hot forging.|$|R
40|$|Forging {{provides}} an elegant {{solution to the}} problem of producing complicated shapes from heated metal. This study attempts to relate some of the important parameters involved when considering, simple <b>upsetting,</b> closed die <b>forging</b> and extrusion forging. A literature survey showed some of the empirical graphical and statistical methods of load prediction together with analytical methods of estimating load and energy. Investigations of the effects of high strain rate and temperature on the stress-strain properties of materials are also evident. In the present study special equipment including an experimental drop hammer and various die-sets have been designed and manufactured. Instrumentation to measure load/time and displacement/time behaviour, of the deformed metal, has been incorporated and calibrated. A high speed camera was used to record the behaviour mode of test pieces used in the simple upsetting tests. Dynamic and quasi-static material properties for the test materials, lead and aluminium alloy, were measured using the drop hammer and a compression-test machine. Analytically two separate mathematical solutions have been developed: A numerical technique using a lumped-mass model for the analysis of simple <b>upsetting</b> and closed-die <b>forging</b> and, for extrusion forging, an analysis which equates the shear and compression energy requirements to the work done by the forging load. Cylindrical test pieces were used for all the experiments and both dry and lubricated test conditions were investigated. The static and dynamic tests provide data on Load, Energy and the Profile of the deformed billet. In addition for the Extrusion Forging, both single ended and double ended tests were conducted. Material dependency was also examined by a further series of tests on aluminium and copper. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical results was made which shows clearly the effects of friction and high strain rate on load and energy requirements and the deformation mode of the billet. For the axisymmetric shapes considered, it was found that the load, energy requirement and profile could be predicted with reasonable accuracy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The open-die <b>forging</b> (<b>upsetting)</b> of {{sintered}} {{porous materials}} is used widely {{as one of}} the key metal processing operations for fabricating various engineering products, and in some cases, for predicting the mechanical properties of such materials. In the present paper, an analysis of the upsetting of axisymmetric cylindrical billets of porous materials is {{made on the basis of}} plasticity theory. A newly established yield function for porous materials - proposed by the authors - is applied to simulate the consolidation of porous billets, taking into account the current state of porosity at each stage of deformation. The proposed theoretical model, combined with the concepts of the "slab method" and assuming suitable friction conditions at the workpiece/tool interface, provides with a valuable design tool, allowing for a more precise evaluation of the process loading and the shape changes of the porous billets obtained during upsetting.
