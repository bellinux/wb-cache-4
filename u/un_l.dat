40|$|Abstract: Using the {{standard}} auxiliary field method, we {{derive from the}} extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model an effective meson action containing vector and axial-vector mesons in addition to Goldstone bosons. The vector and axial-vector mesons in this effective action transform as gauge fields of hidden local symmetry Glocal = [U(n) L × U(n) R] local. Here, the realization of enlarged hidden local symmetry is accomplished via the introduction of two kinds of “compensating ” fields. For obtaining the intrinsic-parity violating part of the action, we generalize {{the standard}} gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action such that it also contains two kinds of “compensators ” {{in addition to the}} usual Goldstone bosons as well as the vector and axial-vector mesons. This generalized gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action turns out to have Ggloba ×Glocal symmetry, where Gglobal being the usual <b>U(n)</b> <b>L</b> ×U(n) R global chiral symmetry 1 while Glocal being the <b>U(n)</b> <b>L</b> × U(n) R hidden local symmetry. This means that Glocal has no gauge anomaly and its associated vector and axial-vector mesons can be regarded as gauge bosons of Glocal. The introduction of the coupling with the external electroweak fields requires us to gauge some appropriate subgroup of Gglobal. To perform it in consistent with the anomaly structure of QCD is a nontrivial problem. We explain how this can be done, following the recent suggestion by several authors. ...|$|E

40|$|Modern polymer based solid {{electrical}} insulation technologies, whilst highly optimal for their function, {{have been shown}} to have a major aw: suscep- tibility to electrical treeing failure mode. This dissertation investigates the possibility of using Partial Discharge (PD) detection techniques to monitor and characterise electrical trees in nanocomposite epoxy insulation. The ex- perimentation is done by creating highly divergent electric stress in nanocom- posite samples and monitoring PD magnitudes over time until failure. Fur- thermore, a remote monitoring system was designed to allow for constant monitoring from anywhere with an internet connection. The experimen- tal results revealed several interesting ndings. Electrical trees in <b>un</b> <b>lled</b> insulation behave di erently from those in nanocomposite insulation. The electrical trees that form in <b>un</b> <b>lled</b> epoxy are of bush/branch type with the corresponding PDs comprising of both big (greater than 10 pC) and small (less than 10 pC) pulses throughout the lifetime of the tree. In nanodielectrics however, the PD magnitudes are generally smaller than in the <b>un</b> <b>lled</b> dielec- tric. Moreover the PD patterns evolve through distinct phases as the trees propagate from inception to complete failure. These distinct phases show new behaviour not seen in <b>un</b> <b>lled</b> insulation, with phases of complete si- lence and some displaying patterns similar to corona. The resulting patterns are analysed and auto-classi ed, using a program written for this purpose, before being used to develop a model to explain the observed behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Due to the non-Abelian {{character}} of QCD gluons selfinteract and form bound states, so-called glueballs. Such glueballs {{have been seen}} in recent lattice simulations and are actively searched for in experiment. Glueballs {{can be used to}} construct effective models of QCD which respect the symmetries and anomaly structure of the theory. At the classical level and in the limit of vanishing quark masses QCD for n flavors exhibits a global chiral <b>U(n)</b> <b>L</b> × U(n) R symmetry and is in addition invariant under scale transformations. Due to anomalies not all of the associated currents are conserved and the symmetry is broken down to SU(n) L × SU(n) R which, in the case of two flavors, is isomorphic to O(4). This symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU(n) L+R. The divergence of the anomalous scale current is given by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor which, in the limit of massless quarks, is given by 〈θ µ µ 〉 = 〈β(g) 2 g Ga µν(x) Gaµν(x) 〉, (1) where G a µν(x) denotes the gluonic field-strength tensor and β(g) is the usual QCD beta function.

Given (p 1,, pq) ∈ Rq, let b: Z → R be a {{periodic}} function of period T such that b(·) = pj on sj− 1 + 1, sj for each j ∈ 1, q. We study the spectral gaps of the Jacobi operator (Ju) (n) = u(n + 1) + u(n − 1) + b(n) <b>u(n)</b> acting on <b>l</b> 2 (Z). By [λ 2 j, λ 2 j− 1] we denote the jth {{band of the}} spectrum of J counted from above for j ∈ 1, T. Suppose that pm ≠ pn for m ≠ n. We prove that the statements (i) and (ii) below are equivalent for λ ∈ R and i ∈ 1, T − 1...|$|R

40|$|From the {{research}} work of Lemtis (4) and Künzel (3) {{we know that}} uterine blood f low (U B F) decreases fo l lowing vena caval occlusion (VCO) when the mean arterial blood pressure (BP) decreases and/or the venous pressure increases. Fetal heart rate (FHR) wi l l drop when the UBF fal ls below a cer-tain critical level and this decrease in FHR is associated with a. f a l l in Po 2 and oxygen Saturation which in i t ia l ly provokes a pressor response in the fetus. <b>Un</b> t i <b>l</b> recently i t has only been possible to consider such patho-physiological questions in animal models, but wi th {{the development of the}} tcPo 2 -technique (1) one is now able to investigate this phenomenon in human labour.
