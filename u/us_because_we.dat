And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have to learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
500|$|When {{the band}} was first started, their lead vocalist {{introduced}} them to bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More, and the group has since cited them as major influences to their musical style. The group is considered to have launched the careers of {{three members of the}} nu metal band Korn. Drummer David Silveria said that [...] "L.A.P.D. really was good for <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> learned about the industry and how things work." [...] Korn has influenced bands such as Slipknot, Saliva, Breaking Benjamin, Cold, and Flyleaf.|$|E
500|$|For the live-action spacewalk scenes, visual-effects {{supervisor}} Ronald B. Moore {{spent two}} weeks of bluescreen photography at the deflector set. Frakes regarded filming the scene {{to be the most}} tedious in the film because of the amount of preparation it took for each day's shoot. Since the rest of the Enterprise-E, as well as the backdrop of Earth, were to be added later in post-production, it became confusing to coordinate shots. Moore used a laptop with digital reproductions of the set to orient the crew and help Frakes understand what the finished shot would look like. A one-armed actor portrayed the Borg whose arm Worf slices off to accurately portray the effect intended, and the actors' shoes were fitted with lead weights to remind the actors they were to move slowly as if actually wearing gravity boots. McDonough recalled that he joined Stewart and Dorn in asking whether they could do the shots without the [...] weights, as [...] "they hired <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are actors", but the production insisted on using them.|$|E

500|$|The modernist {{revolution}} in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding Shakespeare, eagerly enlisted {{his work in the}} service of the avant-garde. The Expressionists in Germany and the Futurists in Moscow mounted productions of his plays. Marxist playwright and director Bertolt Brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of Shakespeare. The poet and critic T.S. Eliot argued against Shaw that Shakespeare's [...] "primitiveness" [...] in fact made him truly modern. Eliot, along with G. Wilson Knight and the school of New Criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of Shakespeare's imagery. In the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for [...] "post-modern" [...] studies of Shakespeare. By the 1980s, Shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, New Historicism, African-American studies, and queer studies. In a comprehensive reading of Shakespeare's works and comparing Shakespeare literary accomplishments to accomplishments among leading figures in philosophy and theology as well, Harold Bloom has commented that [...] "Shakespeare was larger than Plato and than St. Augustine. He encloses <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> see with his fundamental perceptions." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot as a [...] "first-person {{narrative}} about the horrors {{leading up to}} the final moments of a soldier at war", and was described as [...] "a single, long and tight close-up of the soldier's eye with images clearly reflected within his pupil and iris and perfectly choreographed with the rhythm of the music. Reflected are disconcerting images of para trooping into enemy territory, gunfire, helicopters and tanks, explosions, poignant flashbacks of his wife and child and home, and the images of his death." [...] Two endings were shot; one in which the soldier is killed as the result of sustained combat wounds, and another in which the soldier commits suicide by hanging - the latter one was used. Jeff Hanneman confirmed that the band [...] "loved" [...] the eye concept, and [...] personally felt that the video was [...] "pretty amazing" [...] when he first viewed it. King admitted that the film is [...] "pretty cool — I thought it was neat idea — very different, especially for <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> usually do performance based videos." [...] The video was exclusively posted on mp3.com late in October 2006. In April 2007, it was announced that the video had earned a Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards nomination for Best Video with the winner to be revealed on June 11, 2007, at the Koko Club in London, England.|$|E

500|$|The group {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia by May 1, where Walden was {{establishing}} Capricorn Records. Mike Callahan and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell became the band’s early crew members. [...] "Red Dog" [...] was a disabled Vietnam veteran who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause. In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which {{became known as}} the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad. [...] "There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out," [...] said Trucks. [...] Living meagerly, they found a friend in [...] "Mama Louise" [...] Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds, early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just barely integrated Macon: [...] "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them," [...] said Hudson. The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.|$|E

2500|$|Fripp formed King Crimson {{since his}} {{previous}} group, Giles, Giles and Fripp was not commercially successful, and their record company suggested getting a proper lead singer. He chose Lake for this role, but {{asked him to}} play bass instead of guitar {{to avoid having to}} get a bass player in the group. This marked Lake's first time playing the instrument as he had primarily been a guitarist for the previous eleven years. Though Peter Sinfield was the band's lyricist, Lake had some involvement in the lyrics for their debut album In the Court of the Crimson King. After their contracted producer Tony Clarke walked away from the project, Lake produced the album. Released in October 1969, the album was an immediate commercial and critical success, as Lake recalled: [...] "There was this huge wave of response. The audiences were really into <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were an underground thing – the critics loved <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> offered something fresh".|$|E
