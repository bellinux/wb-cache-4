40|$|Phase <b>unwrapping</b> is {{extensively}} used in optical measurements where phase-shifting {{technique is}} employed. For removing 2 pi-phase jumps resulted from phase computation, path-dependent and path-independent (cellular automata) algorithms for phase-unwrapping are usually employed. The method {{described in this}} paper is the phase <b>unwrapping</b> by blocks which combines the advantages of both the path-dependent and the cellular automata algorithms. It determines <b>unwrapping</b> strategy according to the fringe distributions of wrapped phase map, divides the phase map into phase blocks of different sizes and <b>unwraps</b> them by using either path-dependent or cellular automata algorithms. The <b>unwrapped</b> phase maps blocks are then connected into a complete phase map with one line or column of each neighboring block overlapped. A criterion for block divisions and for marking inconsistent data (bad points) is given. The proposed phase-unwrapping method is of high speed in <b>unwrapping</b> {{as compared with the}} conventional path-dependent and the path -independent <b>unwrapping</b> rnethods.

The processing of INSAR includes many key technologies, such as image matching, phase <b>unwrapping,</b> baseline estimation, etc. The phase <b>unwrapping</b> is difficult, but it can be made easy and simple by an excellent interferogram filtering, as is often ignored by many people. So, in this paper, the interferogram filtering and phase <b>unwrapping</b> are both studied. In the aspect of filtering, some filtering methods such as mean filtering, median filtering, adaptive filtering, multi-look filtering and the vector filtering are analyzed and compared. The filtering results show that the vector filtering is more excellent than others. Then, it is presented that the interferogram filtering is a critical technology for the phase <b>unwrapping,</b> we should filter the interferogram noises before phase <b>unwrapping,</b> and a new scheme for phase <b>unwrapping</b> is put into practice in the paper. Firstly, the interferogram is filtered by vector filtering method. Secondly, The filtered images generated from different filtering methods are <b>unwrapped</b> successfully by selecting a compatible gate value of coherence or of fake coherence with region grow method. Both the vector filtering for interferogram and the region grow phase <b>unwrapping</b> method can be applied in the successful phase <b>unwrapping.</b> They will promote a wider use of INSAR in generating DEMs. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The well-studied Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) {{problem for}} digital {{elevation}} map generation involves the derivation of topography from radar phase. The topography {{is a function}} of the full phase, whereas the measured phase is known modulo 2 ss, necessitating the process of recovering full phase values via phase <b>unwrapping.</b> This mathematical process becomes difficult through the presence of noise and phase discontinuities. This paper is motivated by recent research which models phase <b>unwrapping</b> as a network flow minimization problem. A major limitation is that often a substantial computational effort is required to find solutions. Commonly these phase images are huge (AE 10 million pixels) and obviously the sheer size of the problem itself makes phase <b>unwrapping</b> challenging. This paper addresses the development of a computationally efficient hierarchical algorithm, based on a "divide-and-conquer " approach. We have shown that the phase <b>unwrapping</b> problem can first be partitioned into independent phase <b>unwrapping</b> subproblems, which can further be recombined to produce the <b>unwrapped</b> phase. Interestingly, the recombination step itself can be interpreted as an <b>unwrapping</b> problem, for which a modified network flow solution applies! In short, this paper develops a parallelization of the network-flow algorithm, allowing images of virtually unlimited size to be <b>unwrapped</b> and leading to dramatic decreases in the algorithm execution time...|$|R

All the remaining pixels are then <b>unwrapped</b> by an efficient technique proposed, by which, the computational efficiency can be significantly improved.
