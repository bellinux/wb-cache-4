40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} and demonstrate a Fixed Water Mist Fire Protection System in an <b>underground</b> <b>train</b> carriage. It attempts to examine a full-scale compartment (2 m× 2. 5 m× 11 m) fire test simulated in an <b>underground</b> <b>train</b> carriage. Fire scenarios use large pool fires of a flammable liquid (Heptane pool fires). The fire scales are changed to various sizes (1. 2 MW ~ 4 MW). Finally, this paper describes the effectiveness of water mist fire suppression in an <b>underground</b> <b>train</b> carriage...|$|R
