5|$|Edwin Porch Morrow (November 28, 1877June 15, 1935) was an American politician, {{who served}} as the 40th Governor of Kentucky from 1919 to 1923. He was the only Republican elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for African-Americans and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's {{principles}} by his father, Thomas Z. Morrow, who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, William O. Bradley, who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|At the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly, {{represent}}atives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council {{that it was the}} sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people. In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, {{representatives of}} Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China. By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam’s <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> remove the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E

25|$|Despite this {{inheritance}} of unresolved territorial disputes and numerous periods of muted hostility, the Argentine–Brazilian relationship was not defined by open hostility {{for most of}} the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There was competition on many levels, and their respective defense policies reflected mutual suspicion, but their bilateral relationship was not adversarial. After the mid-1850s, neither country resorted to coercion or the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> resolve territorial disputes, and during the only general war {{that took place in the}} Plata region– the Paraguayan War (1864–1870)– Argentina and Brazil were allied against Paraguay.|$|E

25|$|In July 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{called for}} the People's Republic of China to resolve the {{territorial}} dispute. China responded by demanding the US keep out of the issue. This {{came at a time}} when both countries had been engaging in naval exercises in a show of force to the opposing side, which increased tensions in the region. The US Department of Defense released a statement on August 18 where it opposed the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> resolve the dispute, and accused China of assertive behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville {{argued that}} {{domination}} via violent means, though unpleasant, {{is necessary for}} colonization and justified {{by the laws of}} war. Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with Just war theory's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with Just War Theory's jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, the US delegate, Adlai Stevenson, {{strongly}} criticised India's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> resolve her dispute with Portugal, stressing that such resort to violent means {{was against the}} charter of the UN. He stated that condoning such acts of armed forces would encourage other nations to resort to similar solutions to their own disputes, and would lead to the death of the United Nations. In response, the Soviet delegate, Valerian Zorin, argued that the Goan question was wholly within India's domestic jurisdiction and could not be considered by the Security Council. He also drew attention to Portugal's disregard for UN resolutions calling for the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.|$|E

The same year, {{he was one of}} seven Southern Democrats who voted to confirm the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court in a 52 to 48 vote, the narrowest margin of approval in more than a century. In 1992, he was chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and during his term, the DSCC raised record amounts of funding to elect seven new Democrats to the Senate. The Democratic victory included the election of four new female senators and the re-election of a fifth in what was called The Year of the Woman.|$|E
25|$|The Force bill {{went to the}} Senate Judiciary Committee {{chaired by}} Pennsylvania {{protectionist}} William Wilkins and supported by members Daniel Webster and Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey; it gave Jackson everything he asked. On January 28 the Senate defeated a motion {{by a vote of}} 30 to 15 to postpone debate on the bill. All but two of the votes to delay were from the lower South and only three from this section voted against the motion. This did not signal any increased support for nullification but did signify doubts about enforcement. In order to draw more votes, proposals were made to limit the duration of the coercive powers and restrict the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> suppressing, rather than preventing, civil disorder. In the House the Judiciary Committee, in a 4-3 vote, rejected Jackson’s request to use force. By the time Calhoun made a major speech on February 15 strongly opposing it, the Force Bill was temporarily stalled.|$|E
25|$|As Premier, Li was {{the most}} visible {{representative}} of China's government who backed the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> quell the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. During the protests Li used his authority as premier to declare martial law; and, in cooperation with Deng Xiaoping, who was the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, he ordered the June 1989 military crackdown against student pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. Li advocated a largely conservative approach to Chinese economic reform, which placed him at odds with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who fell out of favour in 1989. After Zhao was removed from office Li promoted a conservative socialist economic agenda, but lost influence to incoming vice-premier Zhu Rongji {{and was unable to}} prevent the increasing free-market liberalization of the Chinese economy. During his time in office he was {{at the helm of the}} controversial Three Gorges Dam project. He and his family managed a large Chinese power monopoly, which the Chinese government broke up after his term as premier expired.|$|E

25|$|The protests {{led to a}} {{strengthened}} {{role for}} the state. In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also {{a blow to the}} 'separation of powers' model established by the 1982 Constitution and by convention, whereby the President was a symbolic position (figurehead), and the real centres of power of the General Secretary of the Communist Party, the Premier of the State Council and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission were intended to be different people, to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule. However, when President Yang Shangkun asserted his reserve powers with his post of Vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and openly split with general secretary Zhao Ziyang over the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> side with Premier Li Peng and Central Military Commission chairman Deng Xiaoping, official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. In 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission Chairman and President were all consolidated into the same office, reverting to the previous Maoist distribution of power that had previously existed since 1972.|$|E
25|$|Mirabeau {{focused his}} efforts on two main issues: {{changing}} the ministry {{and dealing with}} impending civil war. His attempts to form political alliances with Lafayette and Necker failed and resulted in open hostility. Necker disappeared from the French court after September 1790 and no longer posed a threat. Lafayette, however, was very powerful due to his {{control of the military}} and the National Guard. At first, Mirabeau attempted to undermine Lafayette’s power, but decided {{to solve the problem of}} the ministry, and maintain stability, by removing all ministers and placing the ministry entirely under Lafayette. In effect, Mirabeau suggested that the king distance himself from politics and let the revolution run its course, because it would inevitably destroy itself through its contradictory nature. Furthermore, Mirabeau proposed that, if his plan should fail, Paris should no longer be the capital of France, showing a conservative line of thinking: the only way to end the revolution would be to destroy its place of birth. In a meeting with the king and queen, Mirabeau maintained that not only was civil war inevitable, it was necessary for the survival of the monarchy. Mirabeau believed that the decision to go to war, even civil war, must come only from the king. In a letter of confidence to Mirabeau, Louis wrote that, as a Christian king, he could not declare war on his own subjects. However, that would not stop him from reacting in kind if his subjects declared war first. In order to avoid provoking a civil war, the king refrained from confronting the Constituent Assembly, and hoped instead for a constitution that he could agree to. Once the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 destroyed this hope, Louis adopted a strategy of strengthening royal authority and the church’s position, and accepted the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> accomplish this. Mirabeau's involvement with the court is as interesting for the insights it provides into the mind of Louis XVI as it is for the effects it produced in the Revolution.|$|E

In a speech he delivered on November 22, 1860, Morton declared: [...] "If it is worth a bloody struggle to establish this nation, it is worth one to preserve it." [...] He was also a staunch supporter of President Abraham Lincoln's conduct of the war.
