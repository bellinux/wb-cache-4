25|$|The {{remaining}} monks of Cîteaux elected Alberic {{as their}} abbot, under whose leadership the abbey would find its grounding. Robert {{had been the}} idealist of the order, and Alberic was their builder. Upon assuming the role of abbot, Alberic moved {{the site of the}} fledgling community near a brook a short distance away from the original site. Alberic discontinued the use of Benedictine black garments in the abbey and clothed the monks in white habits of <b>undyed</b> <b>wool.</b> He returned the community to the original Benedictine ideal of manual work and prayer, dedicated to the ideal of charity and self sustenance. Alberic also forged an alliance with the Dukes of Burgundy, working out a deal with Duke Odo I of Burgundy concerning the donation of a vineyard (Meursault) as well as stones with which they built their church. The church was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary on November 16, 1106, by the Bishop of Chalon sur Saône.|$|E

60|$|This was a youth {{thirteen}} years old, wearing such a dress as was usual with foresters--namely, a garment of home-spun <b>undyed</b> <b>wool,</b> reaching to the knee, and there met by buskins of deer-skin, with the dappled hair outside; but the belt which crossed one shoulder was clasped with gold, and sustained a dagger, whose hilt and sheath were of exquisite workmanship. The cap {{on his head}} was of gray rabbit- skin, but a heron's plume waved in it; the dark curling locks beneath were carefully arranged; and the port {{of his head and}} shoulders, the mould of his limbs, the cast of his features, and the fairness of his complexion, made his appearance ill accord with the homeliness of his garb. In one hand he carried a bow over his shoulder; in the other he held by the ears a couple of dead rabbits, with which he playfully tantalized the dog, holding them to his nose, and then lifting them high aloft, while the hound, perfectly entering into the sport, leapt high after them with open mouth, and pretended to seize them, then bounded and careered round his young master with gay short barks, till both were out of breath; and the boy, flinging the rabbits on the turf, threw himself down on it, with one arm upon the neck of the panting dog, whose great gasps, like a sobbing of laughter, heaved his whole frame.|$|E

30|$|Meanwhile, Needles et al. (1986) {{examined}} the burial induced degradation of wool and silk dyed with natural dyes by burying the samples in standard soil bed. They {{found that a}} significant darkening and a change of shades were examined in both wool and silk samples and the change was greater in the unmordanted samples. Peacock (1996) {{examined the}} color and physical change of <b>undyed</b> cotton, linen, <b>wool,</b> and silk fabrics by burying the samples in standard soil beds. Cotton and linen turned orange or red-brown and wool and silk turned yellow after 4 to 32  weeks of burial. Lee et al. (2001) examined the color change of cotton and silk dyed with brazilein, berberine, and shikonin after leaving them in air, water, and underground for one year. The results showed that cotton and silk stored underground exhibited the most color change toward achromic color.|$|R
30|$|FTIR spectra was {{collected}} for 180 yarn fibres from historic tapestry fragments that were dyed {{a range of}} colours during original manufacture, for 5 model <b>undyed</b> and unaged <b>wool</b> tapestry yarns and 5 undyed artificially light degraded tapestry yarns (aged at 600  h of 150, 000 lx in a Xenotest light aging chamber) from the MODHT project. FTIR-ATR {{was used to measure}} the peak intensities of the functional groups related to cystine oxidation products (see Fig.  3 a, d, e). Spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alpha FTIR spectrometer (Ettlingen, Germany) with an ATR Platinum Diamond single reflection module. Sixty-four scans were collected with a 4  cm− 1 resolution over the range of 4000 – 375  cm− 1. Results were processed using Opus software (version 7). The spectra were averaged and normalised by dividing by the amide III absorption band resulting from C–N stretching and N–H bending vibrations at 1232  cm− 1 following procedures used in other research [3, 10, 42, 43].|$|R

5000|$|In antiquity and the Middle Ages, grey was {{the color}} of <b>undyed</b> <b>wool,</b> and thus {{was the color}} most {{commonly}} worn by peasants and the poor.

50|$|Chilkat weaving {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex weaving {{techniques}} in the world. It is unique in that the artist can create curvilinear and circular forms within the weave itself. A Chilkat blanket can take a year to weave. Traditionally mountain goat wool, dog fur, and yellow cedar bark are used in Chilkat weaving. Today sheep wool might be used. The designs used Northwest Coast formlines, a traditional aesthetic language made up of ovoid, U-form, and S-form elements to create highly stylized, but representational, clan crests and figures from oral history—often animals and especially their facial features. Yellow and black are dominant colors in the weavings, as is the natural buff color of the <b>undyed</b> <b>wool.</b> Blue can be a secondary color.Looms used in Chilkat weaving only have a top frame and vertical supports, with no bottom frame, so the warp threads hang freely. The weaver works in vertical sections, as opposed to moving horizontally from end to end. Consequently, many designs are broken into vertical columns. As with most Northwest Coast art, these columns are bilaterally symmetrical.|$|E
50|$|Guadalupe Yancuictlalpan, is an {{integrated}} suburb {{of the municipal}} seat on the south side. The community is locally known as Gualupita (contraction of Guadalupita) due to the church dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe. It is famous for this wool knit and woven items, the only craft maintained in the municipality. Woven items are made on colonial style wood looms {{many of which have}} been in families for generations. Textile arts here date back at least to 1472 using fibers from the maguey plant. After the Spanish arrival, these fibers were mixed with wool. Each weekend in this community, hundreds of craftsmen come to offer their wares such as sweaters, vests, scarves, hats and coats with prices ranging from 20 pesos to 4,500, made from wool, cotton and some synthetic fibers but the most representative pieces are made with <b>undyed</b> <b>wool.</b> The most expensive items are custom-made, with a fine coat costing as much as 6,000 pesos. Traditional designs found on many items are generally from the Mazahua, Otomi and Nahua ethnic groups. The community holds an Atole Festival on 2 May. On this day, residents of Gualupita head to neighboring Ocuilán to bring back 30 kilos of laurel branches one by one to the town church. When the first participant arrives back to Gualupita, the church bells sound out. The annual event has had as many 1,500 participants.|$|E
5000|$|Anne Maudslay {{described}} the local wardrobe as follows in A glimpse at Guatemala: The dress {{of the men}} is rather Eastern in effect, and consists of a long loose sleeveless garment woven from the <b>undyed</b> <b>wool</b> of the black sheep. It is open at the sides, is longer in the back than in front, and is usually drawn in round the waist with a belt. Loose trousers of the same material reach to the knee, and below them appear the embroidered edges of the loose white cotton drawers. The huipils (English: blouse) of the women are woven in stripes and brightly colored with native dyes, and the home-made [...] "enagua" [...] (English: skirt) of blue and white striped cotton is fastened round the waist over the huipil by a beautifully embroidered belt with hanging ends. Every woman carries over her arm a small striped cotton shawl to throw over her bare neck and arms in {{the cool of the}} evening, and both men and women wear colored handkerchiefs knotted round their heads. We made many efforts to buy some of the good huipils, but without success, and the women quite frightened Gorgonio by the vehemence of their indignation at being asked to sell their garments. This is hardly to be wondered at, for we learnt that their stock of clothes usually included only one huipil in the wearing and one in the loom, and it must {{take a long time to}} work the elaborate patterns in cross-stitch with which they are embroidered." ...|$|E
40|$|Weak photo-induced {{chemiluminescence}} (PICL) emission {{is observed}} when polymers {{are exposed to}} UVA or visible light. The presence of dyes can either increase PICL intensity via Type I photosensitisation which generates polymer free radicals, or reduce it via photo-protection. PICL studies on the eight Blue Wool Standards (BWSs) that are used commercially as lightfastness standards show higher PICL intensity from the least photostable BWSs that use triphenylmethane dyes and lower intensity from more photostable BWSs using UVA and visible wavelengths. The relative PICL intensities do not correlate in a stepwise manner with lightfastness ratings of the BWSs. However dye/polymer combinations that emit high levels of PICL relative to the undyed material are unlikely to have acceptable lightfastness. The xanthene dyes fluorescein and eosin Y are more strongly photosensitising than triphenylmethane dyes on wool and both produce higher PICL emission than <b>undyed</b> <b>wool</b> when irradiated with visible light. <br /...|$|E
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the p.r. shoe has {{two layers}} of orange felt glued to its sole, while the p.l. shoe has a single layer. No significant visual differences in the felts were apparent otherwise. PLM samples of the orange outer felt from both shoes were observed to be composed of a mixture of fiber that contains orange-dyed wool as it major component. Minor amounts of other fibers, mostly colorless, were also observed by PLM. The felt from the p.l. shoe also contained some <b>undyed</b> <b>wool,</b> which was not seen in the felt from the p.r. shoe. This finding suggests the felts for the two shoes may be different, but {{the small size of}} the felt samples prevented conclusive determination. The wool fibers have the surface structure of overlapping scales typical of wool. Average fiber widths are 24  µm for the p.r. shoe and 30  µm for the p.l. shoe, well within the reported range for wool, which varies from 10 to 70  µm depending on the fiber type and species [2].|$|E
