40|$|The short {{description}} of the agro-ameliorative situation of the Republic of Armenia, particularly, that of Ararat valley shows that the unpredictable and unmanageable process of regime procedures at this area can cause serious consequences, pushing out the agricultural golden fund of the republic from the agricultural turnover, namely the land of Ararat valley. Numerous investigations on the soil reclaimed state in Ararat valley at the Republic of Armenia reveal that they are currently in an extremely threatening condition. The result analyses show that more than 35 % of Ararat valley lands of agricultural importance are in insufficiently reclaimed state, moreover the 54 % of them are weakly salinized, 11, 8 % are averagely and strongly salinized and 34. 2 % are strongly salinized. The analyses of the conducted theoretical and experimental research {{results show that the}} above mentioned negative processes are promoted by the depth of the ground water allocation, which in Ararat valley fluctuates within the depth of 1 Â m, 1 - 3 Â m and more than 3 Â m. According to the distribution area the ground waters on 6, 6 % land areas of Ararat valley irrigated soils are allocated at the depth of 1 Â m, in 27, 8 % land areas the ground waters are allocated at the depth of 1 â 3 Â m, and in the rest of 65, 6 % land area waters are allocated at the depth of more than 3 Â m. For the prevention of the soils salinization process at Ararat valley and for the development of measures for struggling against it, the impact of ground waters installation depth, their mineralization, calculated evapo-transpiration from the soil and plants, irrigation norm, watering regime and technique, pressure nutrition caused from <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> and the impact of evaporation raising from the ground water surfaces on the ground waters level change in the vegetation period is evaluated in the current work. For the evaluation of the above mentioned individual factors the integral equation of the ground water level changes has been formed in the result of the solution of which it becomes possible to forecast the elements of the water balance during the vegetation period and thereby to make the regime procedure of âground water-soil-plantâ system predictable and manageable.

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt of a {{presentation}} concerning the springs of {{the upper part of}} the Bystrzyca Dusznicka drainage basin against a background of the tectonic structure and geology. All the measurements and mapping of the surface hydrolographical objects were carried out in July 1993. The most important tectonic element of the researched area, which determines the spatial layout and the features of the springs, seems to be the Zieleniec overthrust consisting of the folded Proterozoik mica slates. The lower edge of its overthrust is at a height of 800 m. The rest of the drainage basin is formed of upper Cretaceous sediments dipping in the inner-Sudeten syncline. Later alpine deformations modified the geological structure of this area. The faults formed in such a way as to form 2 systems of crackings: the parallelone and slanted one running NW to SE. The Bystrzyca Dusznicka valley which runs alongside the axis of the drainage basin shows the water-gap character. In the researched area the authors observed either subsurface water in the mantle rocks, or fissure water circulating in the deeper metamorphic rocks. The upper Cretaceous porous sandstones form the most capacious <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> <b>basin.</b> Each water-bearing underground water horizon is separated with marly rocks. From among springs of the researched area three basic types of them were distinguished: fissure, fissure-mantle and mantle springs. Five big fissure springs ranged between 18 and 36 dm 3 • S-l form the source of the Bystrzyca Dusznicka river. In the drainage basin area over 100 outflows were recorded of which more than 20 were classified as spring sappings. The springs with the biggest average yield equal 2, 5 dm 3 • S-I found in the escarpment zone of the mentioned above overthrust; whereas alongside the eastern undercut there are many small springs and spring sappings of the valley and channel character. Value of the correlation coefficient between spring water temperature and its altitude is equal to r =- 0, 62. It testifies to the evident inversely proportional relationship between these factors. In the upper parts of the basin fissure springs dominate whereas in the lower parts - hotter mantle ones do. At the height-interval of 700 - 900 m there are either mantle springs or fissure ones. The conclusions which flow from this article prove the thesis that in the mountainous areas the following factors determine the regime and localization of springs: tectonics, geology and relief of the researched area.

40|$|Some {{historians and}} {{commentators}} have advanced {{the hypothesis that}} the development of the citrus industry- which also took place in the XIX century- also {{played an important role in}} favoring the emergence of the Sicilian mafia, especially in the area around Palermo. 1 Indeed, the evolution of international demand for citrus fruits resembles that of sulfur, although the time pattern for citrus is less clear than for sulfur and Sicily was never a quasi-monopolist in the market for citrus fruits as it was in the sulfur market. Although citrus fruits cultivations were especially concentrated in the areas areas around Palermo and the surrounding Conca d’Oro where early mafia’s presence was considerable, as reported in the 1885 parliamentary enquiry (Damiani, 1885), the cultivation of citrus was similarly widespread in the eastern part of Sicily, where the mafia remained virtually absent until the second part of the XX century. One possibly insightful way to empirically investigate this rather puzzling issue is to look at the distribution of the inputs employed in citrus cultivation: land and water. While Sicily’s climatic conditions and soil composition are generally favorable to the cultivation of citrus fruits- particularly in coastal areas- such cultivation requires abundant and regular availability of water which, instead, tends to vary substantially across different areas of Sicily.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the spring regime lets us characterize some hydrogeological features of the researched area and {{determine the influence of}} the so called point drainage on a layout and quantity of water which supplies the river network. It refers especially to the mountaineous areas. A good example is the metamorphic Śnieżnik Massif, where {{due to the lack of}} representative hydrogeological bore-holes a number of springs are the only sign of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> circulation. The hydrographical mapping of the researched area was carried out in July 1994. This period was characterized by an evident shortage of precipitations and by high temperatures of air. They researched the Wilczka drainage basin down to the Wilkanów profile and all the upper parts of the Nowinka, Domaszkowski Potok, Szklarka and Czarna Woda drainage basins (fig. 1). There were observed 212 natural <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> outflows there, of which 162 were real springs, 38 sapping springs and 12 bog-springs. The analysis of the observed spatial diversity of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> outflows was carried out basing on the elementary measures referred to the areas of the autochthonous and defTerenliated drainage basins. Those basic measures are: springability coefficient, spring water runofT modulus and the participation of the spring water in the combined runoff (fig. 2, 3, 4, 5). They noticed evident connections with relief, geology Le. characteristics of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> <b>basins,</b> drained by springs. The vertical diversity of the researched springs was examined either in the zonal height-intervals or actual altitude (precise fixing of an altitude) (fig. 6, 7, 8, 9). The quantity of the outflows and their features (temperature, yield) were estimated on the statistical characteristics of the studied series. There were not observed any very evident connections of the analyzed characteristics with an altitude. The authors observed a tendency to constitute height-intervals in which the character and the regime of the springs are similar. The causes for such a state should be searched in orographic and geological features, which are combined with the occurence of definite groups of outflows on the proper altitude.

The first part is focused on the {{properties}} of phosphorous and nitrogen that are most important in the eutrophication process, while {{the second part of the}} thesis presents the specifics of the <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> Jezero in Smarjeske Toplice. The first part of the thesis describes the problem of pollution with nutrients in the aquatic environment - eutrophication. Eutrophication is caused by excessive nutrient concentrations in the aquatic environment, which is limited by the lack of one of the two presented nutrients in this thesis. The thesis is focused on two nutrients, namely phosphorus and nitrogen. The thesis presents the basic properties for phosphorus and nitrogen and the circulation of these two nutrients in the environment. It also lists and describes the main anthropogenic activities, which contribute the largest share of these nutrients into the environment. In its next chapters the thesis presents the chemical and biological processes, removal of phosphorus and nitrogen, and some common technologies developed for the purpose of disposing these two nutrients from water. Then it presents some assumptions and actions for reducing the impact of these two nutrients on the environment in the future. The first part of the thesis is concluded with the use of nutrients in Slovenian agriculture in order to improve the productivity of its agricultural land.

40|$|Infiltration of {{rainfall}} into hillslopes {{is often an}} important factor in triggering landslides. Using <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> drainage works together with anti-slide piles has been an effective method of landslide control, yet their effectiveness is inadequately discussed in the literature. This paper studies the influence {{of rainfall}} on the change in the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level beneath a slope by real-time and synchronic monitoring of the rainfall, the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level in the boreholes, and the flow rate of the underground drainage tunnel. The effectiveness of the underground drainage tunnel in preventing the rise of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level of the slope is discussed. The researchers also study the deformation behavior of the anti-slide piles by monitoring the lateral displacement of the piles and analyzing the thrust that the anti-slide piles bear by numerical inversion techniques. The results indicate that there is an apparent relationship between the lag in the rising of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level caused by a rainfall and that caused by the immediately previous rainfall. When there is a rainfall accumulation before the occurrence of a heavy rain, this particular heavy rainfall will cause a rapid rise of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level beneath the slope. The monitoring data analysis shows that the flow rate of the underground drainage tunnel increases first, and then the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level of the slope rises after a rainfall. In other words, the flow rate of the underground drainage tunnel increases at a rate faster than that of the rise of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level. Hence, the underground drainage tunnel can effectively lower the rise of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level induced by a rainfall. Besides, based on the monitoring data of the lateral displacement of the anti-slide piles and subsequent analysis, the working state of the anti-slide piles is justified. It thus indirectly validates the benefits of using underground drainage tunnel in landslide control. © Springer-Verlag 2010. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{paucity of}} sub surface water {{resources}} in Bhopal {{has led to}} tapping the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> resources viz., tube wells and hand pumps. On account of the fast development of the human population and industrialization even the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> resources are affected to a large extent. Keeping in view the welfare of human population dependent mostly on <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> resources an attempt {{has been made to}} evaluate their potable status. It has been found that most of the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> resources are near alkaline in nature. However, some of the under ground water resources recorded very high conductivity and magnesium values. On comparing the present values with that of the various standards, the water collected from some of the tube wells is comparatively much better in comparison to the water collected from hand pumps...|$|R
40|$|To {{provide more}} {{reasonable}} references for remedying <b>underground</b> <b>water,</b> fuel leak was simulated by establishing an experimental {{model of a}} porous-aquifer sand tank with {{the same size as}} that of the actual tank and by monitoring the <b>underground</b> <b>water.</b> In the tank, traditional gasoline and ethyl alcohol gasoline were poured. This study was conducted to achieve better understanding of the migration and distribution of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX), which are major pollutants in the <b>underground</b> <b>water.</b> Experimental results showed that, compared with conventional gasoline, the content peak of BTEX in the mixture of ethyl alcohol gasoline appeared later; BTEX migrated along the water flow direction horizontally and presented different pollution halos; BTEX also exhibited the highest content level at 45 [*]cm depth; however, its content declined at the 30 and 15 [*]cm depths vertically because of the vertical dispersion effect; the rise of <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> level increased the BTEX content, and the attenuation of BTEX content in <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> was related to the biodegradation in the sand tank, which mainly included biodegradation with oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate...|$|R
40|$|The Kyoto {{city has}} various {{traditional}} cultures and industries. One {{of these is}} the production of Japanese sake, for which Fushimi-Ward is famous. The purpose of my study is to establish a 3 D management model for <b>underground</b> <b>water.</b> This area has a lot of ground water of good water quality suited to making Japanese sake, and consequently. The <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> of the Fushimi area has been protected by the Fushimi sake brewing union. They are famous for preventing the construction of the Nara subway suggested in the 3 rd year of Showa. They protect <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> from various potentially harmful construction projects. However the construction of a sewer was started last year in Fushimi Ward. They worry about the effects of the construction. I believe that this management model will be useful in predicting the effects of the underground construction. This 3 D model will be needed to save the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> in the Fushimi area. We have to protect the <b>underground</b> <b>water</b> in the Fushimi area and in order to protect traditional Japanese sake...|$|R
