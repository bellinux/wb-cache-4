40|$|Without exaggeration, Egypt Post (EP) is {{the oldest}} and most honored {{governmental}} institute in Egypt. Its headquarters, located in Ataba Square in downtown Cairo, is considered a central and prominent place in Cairo and Egypt. Khedive Ismail unveiled the inauguration of the headquarters officially. However, sometime within its lifespan until 2005, Egypt Post (EP) was considered one of the worst governmental institutes in Egypt from a quality of service point of view. In addition, EP had not {{been a member of the}} Pan African Postal Union (PAPU) for almost 20 years simply because EP had not been paying its yearly membership. On the global level, EP was a modest Universal Postal Union (UPU) member with no strong value. This decline and poor image was because of several reasons that added up to the then Egypt Post status. Only three years later, EP was ranked third worldwide in the <b>UPU</b> <b>congress</b> elections. In addition, EP became a member of the two most important committees in the UPU: The Investment Committee, and the Executive Committee. This marks the transformation of the Egypt Post from a modest member in the UPU to a prominent and distinctive one. EP was also unanimously voted by the African Postal Organization to chair the PAPU in 2008 and 2009 after years of absence. It was a classic case of turnaround in terms of organizational improvement, efficiency and quality service. The business world is always changing and developing, causing the development and increase of relatively new concepts. These concepts include international trade, outsourcing and offshoring, virtual offices and organizations and cyber crimes, increasing the need for national and global security. One particular pillar of business is developing the most at an extremely rapid pace. This pillar is ICT where CEOs, CTOs, Managers and even researchers are constantly trying to stay updated with this ICT advancement. Companies and even governmental organizations need to be constantly in par with this advancement, as change especially in ICT can be the main determinant of success. Egypt Post is an example where applying business and ICT concepts have effectively reshaped the organization and ensured success. To achieve this success and level of competence, there were many challenges to tackle along the road. First of all, EP’s workforce was huge but rather idle, bureaucratic and technologically inept. Furthermore, the existing technology used at EP was outdated and unsecure. The ICT infrastructure was insufficient in terms of quantity and quality; many services were not even automated and the software applications were diverse and incompatible. Additionally, the environment of the offices and the corporate buildings was unwelcoming and unproductive. The strategic plan laid out for EP sought out the ICT department as the engine that would pull the giant organization to the future. A short few months later, with its up-to-date telecommunication and information systems and technically adept staff, its ICT arm was able to lead EP’s other divisions and the company as a whole to a path of sustainable growth. The transformation that took place was nothing short of miraculous, and this paper attempts to discuss how EP had come so far in such a short time, not only in Africa but also worldwide...|$|E
