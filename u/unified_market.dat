50|$|A {{complete}}d, <b>unified</b> <b>market</b> usually {{refers to}} the complete removal of barriers and integration of the remaining national markets. Complete economic integration can be seen within many countries, whether in a single unitary state with a single set of economic rules, or {{among the members of}} a strong national federation. For example, the sovereign states of the United States do to some degree have different local economic regulations (e.g. licensing requirements for professionals, rules and pricing for utilities and insurance, consumer safety laws, environmental laws, minimum wage) and taxes, but are subordinate to the federal government on any matter of interstate commerce the national government chooses to assert itself. Movement of people and goods among the states is unrestricted and without tariffs.|$|E
50|$|The {{theory of}} labor market {{segmentation}} {{contrasts with the}} view of neo-classical economic theory, which posits {{the existence of a}} <b>unified</b> <b>market</b> for labor, consisting of buyers and sellers in open competition with each other. The labor market is seen as functioning {{in the same way as}} other markets. In this model, the only difference between different workers' wages and conditions arise from individual differences in their human capital (skills, experience, or formal education) or tastes. On the latter, as part of the theory of compensating wage differentials those who prefer risky or dirty jobs receive higher wages or salaries than those who take safe or clean ones. Put another way, differences in compensation for labor arise only on the supply side.|$|E
5000|$|France raised {{most of its}} {{tax revenue}} internally, with a notable deficit {{regarding}} external customs tariffs. Taxes on commerce consisted of internal tariffs among the regions of France. This set up an arbitrary tax-barrier (sometimes, as in Paris, in physical form) at every regional boundary, and these barriers prevented France from developing as a <b>unified</b> <b>market.</b> Collections of taxes, such as the extremely unpopular salt tax, the gabelle, were contracted to private collectors ("tax farmers"), who, like all farmers, preoccupied themselves with making their holdings grow. So, they collected, quite legitimately, far more than required, remitted the tax to the State, and pocketed the remainder. These unwieldy systems led to arbitrary and unequal collection of France's consumption taxes. (See also Wall of the Farmers-General, Jean Chouan, Octroi, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, and the Indian salt tax.) ...|$|E
50|$|SDL {{offers the}} promise of a <b>unified</b> <b>{{marketing}}</b> theory: To date, marketing research and practice have failed to integrate the traditional goods/services dichotomy. Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful. Service-dominant logic, however, promises a truly unified framework. For many academics, this is the most exciting implication. It is highly likely that the 4 Ps, as the central marketing framework, is about to come to a close.|$|R
50|$|VWS sells {{furniture}} from several independent Vermont woodworking businesses, {{as well as}} from larger wholesale companies. The company seeks to promote Vermont's custom furniture industry by <b>unifying</b> <b>marketing</b> efforts for its producers. In a 2014 Vermont Life article, Steve Holman, a furniture maker from Dorset, Vermont, noted that Vermont's isolation from large markets represents a major business challenge, and that small producers rarely have time to manage their online presence adequately. The company sells products under two models: it connects custom furniture makers with customers in exchange for a referral fee, and it directly retails {{furniture from}} wholesale producers.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of the Rochdale Pioneers, {{co-operative}} shops were established across the UK and took customers away from private traders who responded by making it difficult for co-operatives to source quality goods to sell to their members. The solution was for co-operative retailers to come together in 1863 and form the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) (now the Co-operative Group) responsible for sourcing and producing goods for sale in its members' shops, and for <b>unified</b> <b>marketing</b> and branding for the societies. The CWS carried out this role for members for nearly 100 years, and in 1968 launched [...] "Operation Facelift", which resulted in the first national Co-op logo.|$|R
40|$|Integrating the European {{market has}} {{represented}} {{a challenge for}} both technical and legal participants. Economic proponents of the single market combine a misunderstanding of the USA experience with a sometimes incorrect belief that technical tests are always adequate to ensure safety. The Kaprun disaster shows the problem of a mismatch between the desires of products and the capability of regulators. The <b>unified</b> <b>market</b> can create the problem that a product assembled from components that are underspecified may create new problems that are not captured by the regulatory system. This problem is especially aggravated when products come from producers with different technical cultures who may not understand {{the limitations of the}} regulatory test and assume that all products that pass the test are safe. Unless all parties in the regulatory process understand the limitations of the <b>unified</b> <b>market</b> and regulators retain their legal power and administrative role in safety it is possible to create disaster despite compliance with CE standards. One possibility is to refocus local regulators on the integrated safety of the completed building. Analogies to other EC directives suggest what may be a useful approach...|$|E

40|$|There are no robust {{insurance}} {{markets for}} climate change insurance. While these markets would provide valuable loss-mitigation incentives, {{at the same}} time giving financial certainty to individuals and businesses that face staggering future liabilities, existing efforts have produced a fragmented set of private and public products that provide only piecemeal coverage. This Article examines the government’s role in providing <b>unified</b> <b>markets</b> for insuring climate change risk. Although innovations in reinsurance markets suggest that private insurers could cover discrete risks associated with climate change, such as flood or wind loss, climate change’s broader systemic risks present problems of scale and scope that public insurance is better positioned to handle. This Article draws lessons from existing insurance programs to show both why purely private insurance would be inappropriate for a robust climate change insurance market, as well as how a nationally provided insurance program could be designed to avoid past problems...|$|R
