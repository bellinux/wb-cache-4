50|$|Located in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Village of Boston Mills {{reflects}} the early 19th-century canal era {{and the early}} 20th-century industrial era. With {{the opening of the}} Ohio and Erie Canal from Cleveland to Akron in 1827, the settlement along the Cuyahoga River began to grow. By 1842, Boston Mills had a population of approximately 300. A water powered mill, a large warehouse, two stores and a hotel were some of the businesses in the village. Canal boat building was also an important industry with several dry docks in this inland port. Although the canal is not watered through the village now, one of the systemâ€™s locks is still extant and several Greek Revival frame buildings date from the early 19th century. The <b>Upwright</b> and Wing house type {{reflects the}} extended New England settlement culture. This style is exemplified by the main gable-front two-story section containing a parlor and bedchambers, while the kitchen is located in a perpendicular one-story eave oriented section. The 1836 Boston Company Store, with its Federal and Greek Revival influences, now serves as a Cuyahoga Valley National Park visitor center and canal boat building museum.|$|E
