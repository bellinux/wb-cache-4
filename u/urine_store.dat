Urine normally contains low counts of pathogenic microorganisms. There is, however, a risk of contamination of the urine by faecal material. The hygenic quality of <b>stored</b> <b>urine</b> was investigated by collecting urine samples from seven urine-separating constructions in October- 94 and in May- 95. Faecal indicator bacteria in the samples were enumerated. The content of Escherichia coli was low in all the samples, while faecal streptococci were present in amounts between 7 and 13000 cfu/ml. No coliphages could be detected. The pH in the <b>stored</b> <b>urine</b> ranged from 7. 7 to 9. 2. The die-off of E. coli faecal streptococci, Salmonella typhimurium SH 4809, Campylobacter jejuni S 201 / 94 and bacteriophage S. typhimurium 28 B was tested by adding these strains to urine in amounts of ca 10 ^ 6 cells/ml. Samples were incubated at 4 and 20 °C. The die-off of E. coli, S. typhimurium and C. jejuni in urine was rapid. C. jejuni could not be recovered at all.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Typically, {{urine and}} other {{biological}} tissues have been analyzed for cocaine (COC) and/or metabolites to detect COC usage. COC undergoes numerous biotransformation and degradation reactions. Crack smokers {{are exposed to}} anhydroecgonine methyl ester (AME), {{which can be used}} as an analytical marker for crack smoking. The stability of this analyte in human urine has not been studied. In the body, COC is rapidly converted to metabolites by enzymatic and chemical processes, the major urinary metabolite being benzoylecgonine (BE). OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out {{in order to determine the}} effects of time and temperature on the stability of cocaine/crack metabolites in human urine. METHODS : The stability of AME, BE and COC in urine was investigated using samples of <b>urine</b> <b>stored</b> in freezers and refrigerators. The analytes were extracted from urine using a solid-phase extraction technique and analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection method.

30|$|Hydromorphone and {{oxymorphone}} {{were detected}} in patients I, III, and IV who were prescribed medications containing morphine and/or oxycodone. Evidence for morphine metabolism to hydromorphone in pain patients chronically treated with morphine has extensively been confirmed (Cone et al. 2006; Hughes et al. 2012). Likewise, the metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone in pain patients {{has also been}} demonstrated (Yee et al. 2012). However, the occurrence of this transformation in <b>stored</b> <b>urine</b> samples has not been previously demonstrated. After ingestion, morphine is metabolized in the liver into morphine- 3 -glucuronide and morphine- 6 -glucuronide (Kilpatrick and Smith 2005). It may also be metabolized into normorphine, codeine, and hydromorphone, but the metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state, {{and the use of}} other medications. In humans, oxycodone is primarily metabolized in the liver to α and β oxycodol and oxymorphone (Moore et al. 2003). Some patients are fast metabolizers of oxycodone, resulting in reduced analgesic effect but increased adverse effects, while others are slow metabolizers resulting in increased toxicity without improved analgesia (Gasche et al. 2004). The concentrations of the metabolites hydromorphone and oxymorphone in urine samples after 30  days of storage were very high compared to the initial concentration at day 1 and independently to patients. This trend once more supports the evidence that parent compounds may be converted into corresponding metabolites in <b>urine</b> samples <b>stored</b> at 4 °C. The metabolite concentration levels depend on the concentration of the parent compounds. These two metabolites can still be analyzed in patient <b>urine</b> samples <b>stored</b> at 4 °C for 30  days, when patients have been prescribed medications containing the main compounds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Urine is {{residual}} fluid excreted by kidneys through {{urinary tract}} to {{outside of the}} human body, to maintain homeostasis of fluid in the body. Normally urine still contains high amount of nitrogen, which is 87 %, phosphor 50 %, potassium 54 % and low bacterial content. With these contents urine potentially becomes organic fertilizer rich with nitrogen, phosphor and potassium contents and is beneficial to plants. However, until today the utilization or urine in Indonesia is very low. The urine produced is dispose with feces in toilets. This study aimed to utilize urine as solid organic fertilizer using magnesium oxide (MgO), zeolite, and actived carbon as absorbents of ammonium and phosphor.

40|$|Calcium {{is present}} in {{amphibian}} blood at a concentration {{similar to that in}} other vertebrates, about 1 – 2 mmoll 21. The fraction of free calcium in amphibians is lower than that in other tetrapod vertebrates because about 50 % of the plasma Ca 2 + is bound to plasma proteins and perhaps other molecules. Plasma [Ca 2 +] varies seasonally, increasing in spring and summer and decreasing in winter. Changes in plasma [Ca 2 +] a so occur during larval development, as the concentration of this ion increases in larval forms as they approach metamorphosis. Calcium is exchanged at a variety of sites in animals. There is evidence for Ca 2 +uptake across the skin and gills of larval anurans. It is also transported into the blood from the small intestine (especially the duodenum) and reabsorbed in renal tubules from the glomerular filtrate. The possibility of Ca 2 + absorption from <b>urine</b> <b>stored</b> in the urinary bladder has not been confirmed, however. Calcium is stored in bone and in specialized endolymphatic sacs. This Ca 2 +can be mobilized when the need arises. There are a number of endocrine and other humoral factors that appear to be involved in amphibian calcium metabolism. These include parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, vitamin D and prolactin...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{and urine}} {{concentrations}} of endogenous proteins are frequently {{used in the}} diagnosis of kidney diseases and in studies of glomerular filter function. The main issues addressed in these studies were: storage of urine samples for subsequent protein analysis, use of protein concentrations in urine and in plasma in health and as markers of glomerular diseases, {{and the application of}} renal plasma-to-urine clearance of endogenous proteins in estimating the size-selectivity properties of the glomerular capillary wall. Studies of the stability of endogenous proteins in <b>urine</b> <b>stored</b> under different conditions showed certain proteins (immunoglobulin G, protein HC, and a 1 -antitrypsin) to deteriorate in native <b>urine</b> <b>stored</b> at - 20 °C, and a 1 -antitrypsin to be also unstable in native urine kept at room temperature or at 4 °C. The addition of the preservative solution employed in these studies was shown to allow reliable measurements to be made of all the proteins investigated, and under all conditions tested, {{with the exception of a}} 1 -antitrypsin in frozen urine. Measurements of urine concentrations of endogenous proteins in healthy adults, using rapid, generally available methods, showed that the same upper reference limits for urinary protein excretion may be used for both genders and regardless of age or the type of urine collection. Moreover, the protein content in normal urine does not correlate to the presence of haematuria or granular casts in urinary sediment. Increased plasma concentrations of acute phase proteins, a 1 -antitrypsin, haptoglobin and orosomucoid, but not C-reactive protein, were detected in patients with primary chronic glomerulonephritides. The findings imply that, despite the indolent clinical picture, persistent inflammatory processes occur in chronic glomerulonephritides and that, the three first-mentioned acute phase proteins may be used as markers of these diseases. Moreover, the C-reactive protein level may be used to diagnose infections or other inflammatory conditions affecting patients with chronic glomerulonephritides. Urine excretion of glycosaminoglycans was decreased in patients with primary glomerulonephritis or renal amyloidosis. Significant differences in this variable were also observed between various kinds of glomerular diseases, urine concentrations being lower in acute glomerulonephritis compared to the chronic forms of the disease, and in amyloidosis compared to other glomerular diseases. These findings indicate that urinary glycosaminoglycans excretion can not only be used as a marker of glomerulonephritis or renal amyloidosis, but it can also be used in the differential diagnosis of the acute and chronic forms of the former disease, and in screening for amyloidosis in patients with glomerular diseases or with chronic inflammatory diseases, with or without clinical signs of renal involvement. Finally, based on findings in the study of fractional protein clearance in rats with inhibited tubular protein reabsorption, the large pore radius of the glomerular basement mem-brane could be estimated to be 110 - 115 Å.

The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in faecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma aldosterone, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of hyperosmotic urine; cloacal urine {{has been found to be}} 800 mosmol/L. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the common ostrich is therefore greater than one.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Levels of urinary biomarkers, such as kidney injury {{molecule}} 1 (KIM- 1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), {{can determine}} the risk of renal damage and predict the outcome of multiple kidney diseases, including transplant rejection. Studies of urinary biomarkers frequently use urine that has been stored frozen before analysis without {{taking into account the}} potential of biomarker degradation during storage. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 39 kidney transplant patients visiting an outpatient clinic. PREDICTOR: Urine storage conditions (4 degrees C and - 80 degrees C with or without protease inhibitors) and centrifugation after thawing of samples. OUTCOMES: Urinary concentrations of NGAL and KIM- 1. MEASUREMENTS: NGAL and KIM- 1 were measured with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS: Urinary NGAL and KIM- 1 concentrations were stable in urine up to 48 hours when stored at 4 degrees C and up to 6 months when stored at - 80 degrees C, independent of the addition of protease inhibitors. A centrifugation step prior to biomarker measurement did not change urinary biomarker concentrations of <b>urine</b> <b>stored</b> at - 80 degrees C. LIMITATIONS: Only KIM- 1 and NGAL were measured, which possibly limits the relevance of the findings when making determinations about other urinary biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: This study recommends that urine samples collected for the assessment of KIM- 1 or NGAL are immediately cooled to 4 degrees C and subsequently frozen at - 80 degrees C within 2 days. At - 80 degrees C, both KIM- 1 and NGAL concentrations are stable for at least 6 months...|$|R
40|$|Human genomic DNA {{extracted}} from urine {{could be an}} interesting tool for large-scale public health studies involving characterization of genetic variations or DNA biomarkers {{as a result of}} the simple and noninvasive collection method. These studies, involving many samples, require a rapid, easy, and standardized extraction protocol. Moreover, for practicability, there is a necessity to collect urine at a moment different from the first void and to store it appropriately until analysis. The present study compared seven commercial kits to select the most appropriate urinary human DNA extraction procedure for epidemiological studies. DNA yield has been determined using different quantification methods: two classical, i. e., NanoDrop and PicoGreen, and two species-specific real-time quantitative (q) PCR assays, as DNA {{extracted from}} urine contains, besides human, microbial DNA also, which largely contributes to the total DNA yield. In addition, the kits giving a good yield were also tested for the presence of PCR inhibitors. Further comparisons were performed regarding the sampling time and the storage conditions. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, an important gene related to smoking has been genotyped using the developed tools. We could select one well-performing kit for the human DNA extraction from urine suitable for molecular diagnostic real-time qPCR-based assays targeting genetic variations, applicable to large-scale studies. In addition, successful genotyping was possible using DNA extracted from <b>urine</b> <b>stored</b> at- 20 °C for several months, and an acceptable yield could also be obtained from urine collected at different moments during the day, which is particularly important for public health studies...|$|R
50|$|The common ostrich is well {{adapted to}} hot, arid environments through {{specialization}} of excretory organs. The common ostrich has an extremely long and developed colon {{the length of}} approximately 11 - 13 m between the coprodeum and the paired caeca, which are around 80 cm long. A well developed caeca is also found and {{in combination with the}} rectum forms the microbial fermentation chambers used for carbohydrate breakdown. The catabolism of carbohydrates produces around 0.56 g of water that can be used internally. The majority of their <b>urine</b> is <b>stored</b> in the coprodeum, and the faeces are separately stored in the terminal colon. The coprodeum is located ventral to the terminal rectum and urodeum (where the ureters open). Found between the terminal rectum and coprodeum is a strong sphincter. The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in faecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma aldosterone, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of hyperosmotic urine; cloacal urine {{has been found to be}} 800 mosmol/L. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the common ostrich is therefore greater than one. Diffusion of water to the coprodeum (where <b>urine</b> is <b>stored)</b> from plasma across the epithelium is voided. This void is believed to be caused by the thick mucosal layering of the coprodeum.|$|R
