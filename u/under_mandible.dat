The cheeks and chin {{as well as a}} thin and often hard-to-see stripe above the eye are white, and a deep black mask extends from the beak through the eye to the ear coverts; the area immediately above the beak is grey. The scapulars (shoulder feathers) are white, and the wings are black with a white bar made up by the bases of the primary remiges, continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions. The tail is black, long, and pointed at the tip; the outer rectrices have white outer vanes. The underparts are white, slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies. In particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner {{than the rest of the}} light underside, and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat. In the subspecies around the North Pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too, there may be faint brownish bars on the breast. The bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black, but pale at the base of the <b>under</b> <b>mandible</b> (though the extent varies seasonally). The legs and feet are blackish.|$|E

60|$|Alimentary Canal.--The {{oesophagus}} is very narrow, and {{of remarkable}} length; from the orifice <b>under</b> the <b>mandibles,</b> it first runs back (in this respect not well represented in Pl.

The rectum is of unparalleled length, and extremely narrow; it can be best detected after the dissolution by caustic potash of the softer parts, when its inner coat of chitine can be seen to be continuous, in the ordinary manner, with the outer integuments of the thorax. The anus, as already stated, is seated on a slight swelling, and consists of a small longitudinal slit (f, fig. 2), placed close outside the two very minute caudal appendages.|$|R
40|$|The left {{mandible}} of termite workers possesses just {{in front}} of the molar plate a characteristic 'premolar tooth' that, in most species, is partly or wholly hidden <b>under</b> the <b>mandible.</b> The position, structure and size of this tooth were observed and compared from a functional point of view in 46 wood-feeder species belonging to all termite families and in 33 soil-feeder species belonging to 4 different clades of Termitidae. In all wood- and other plant matter-feeder species observed the premolar tooth resembles the chisel of a carpenter's plane-like device. It is suited to cut superficial fragments out of the wood before ingestion. In all soil-feeder species observed the premolar tooth has lost one or several functional features that characterise wood feeders. It assists the other teeth in the gathering of soil particles towards the mouth before ingestion. In the left mandible of termite workers, the premolar tooth thus shows clear morphological adaptations to the species' diet. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tumors of the salivary glands, {{although}} not rare, are uncommon.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to better {{understand}} the mechanics of ship-whale collision and to reduce the associated mortality of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, a comprehensive biomechanical study has been conducted by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of New Hampshire. The goal of the study is to develop a numerical modeling tool to predict the forces and stresses during impact and thereby the resulting mortality risk to whales from ship strikes. Based on post-mortem examinations, jaw fracture was chosen as a fatal endpoint for the whales hit by a vessel. In this paper we investigate the overall mechanical behavior of a right whale <b>mandible</b> <b>under</b> transverse loading and develop a finite element analysis model of the bone. The equivalent elastic modulus of the cortical component of right whale mandible is found by comparing full-scale bending tests with the results of numerical modeling. The finite element model of the mandible can be used in conjunction with a vessel-whale collision event model to predict bone fracture for various ship strike scenarios...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} apply {{acoustic}} emission (AE) monitoring to the non-destructive and continuous {{analysis of the}} feeding biology of the bamboo powder-post beetle Dinoderus minutus inside bamboo culms, {{it is essential to}} clarify the relationship between their feeding activity and AE generation. In this study, the behavior of the larva and adult of D. minutus in a madake (Phyllostachys bambusoides) specimen was directly observed by a microscope, while AE measurement of the specimen attached to an AE sensor (150  kHz resonant frequency) was conducted simultaneously. The mandibles of the larva or the adult exhibited “chewing movements” when it was in feeding activity. AE hits were detected as the larva or adult chewed the specimen with its <b>mandibles.</b> <b>Under</b> the measurement conditions employed, chewing movements of the mandibles that produced AE hits accounted for 26 – 42  % of the total chewing movements for larvae, and 27 – 43  % for adults. On the other hand, when the larva or adult was not chewing the specimen, almost no AE hits were detected. Therefore, the generation of AE corresponded to the chewing movements of the mandibles of D. minutus.|$|R

40|$|Auditory {{brainstem}} evoked potentials (ABEP) {{were recorded}} from 16 awake cats to obtain 3 -Channel Lissajous' Trajectories (3 CLTs) using three orthogonal differential electrode configurations (nasion - midline nuchal ridge, left - right mastoids, vertex - midline <b>under</b> the <b>mandible).</b> Potentials, evoked by monaural 80 dBnHL (re. human threshold) clicks, were studied before, {{and up to}} 7 weeks after inducing neuronal lesions localized to the cochlear nucleus (CN) or the superior olivary complex (SOC), or myelin lesions localized to the fibers of the trapezoid body connecting these two structures. Neuronal lesions were induced by injection of kainic acid (KA), while myelin lesions were induced by injection of L-alpha-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). With CN neuronal lesions the major changes in 3 CLT were in the time domain of 'b', 'c' and 'd' (components P 2, P 3 and P 4 of single-channel ABEP). With SOC neuronal lesions the major changes were in 'c' and 'd' of 3 CLT (P 3 and P 4 of ABEP). With trapezoid body lesions the major change was in 'c' (P 3 of ABEP). The results are compatible with the peripheral generation of the first ABEP components (P 1 a and P 1 b). The second component (P 2) is generated by ipsilateral CN neurones and their outputs. The third component (P 3) is generated primarily by ipsilateral SOC neurones and their outputs, with the ipsilateral CN providing input. The fourth component (P 4) is generated bilaterally by the SOC neurones and their outputs, receiving their inputs from ipsilateral CN. The fifth ABEP component (P 5) is generated by structures central to the SOCs and their immediate outputs. Neither focal neuronal nor myelin lesions were sufficient to produce obliteration of any component, consistent {{with a set of}} generators for each of the ABEP components, consisting of both cell bodies and their output fibers, that is distributed spatially in the brainstem. © 1991...|$|R

40|$|Complicated mandibular {{fractures}} were recognised in one foal, one pony {{and four}} horses. The foal was two months old while the adult animals {{ranged in age}} from 12 to 24 years. Three horses had a unilateral horizontal ramus fracture. Two fractures were open and one was closed. Comminution was present in one of these patients while lthe other two horses had marked displacement of the fragments. Two suffered from comminuted fractures of the horizontal and vertical ramus of the mandible. One of these patients had open and infected fractures. One foal had a bilateral horizontal ramus fracture with mrked periosteal "new bone" formation and malalignement which required corrective osteotomy.

40|$|Developmental {{salivary gland}} defect is a bone {{depression}} on the lingual {{side of the}} mandible containing salivary gland or fatty soft tissue. This defect has been widely known as Stafne’s bone defect since it was described by Stafne in 1942. Stafne reported 35 cases of asymptomatic unilateral radiolucent cavities in the posterior region of the mandible. 1 The lesions were located between the man-dibular angle and the third molar, below the inferior dental canal and above the mandibular base. The developmental salivary gland defect has no symptoms and is occasionally observed, in general, as a cyst-like oval radiolucent image with cortical bone thickening around the gonial angle of the <b>mandible</b> <b>under</b> the mandibular canal, on panoramic radiography. 2, 3 Although this defect appearing as a round or ovoid radiolucency is not uncommon, multilocular radio-lucency of this defect is rare. 4 This report presents a cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scan, showing a developmental salivary gland defect with multilocular radiolucency occurring in a male patient.

40|$|Introduction: Velopharyngeal {{inadequacy}} (VPI) {{may result}} in inappropriate oral/nasal coupling during the production of speech sounds, resulting in unwanted nasal resonance and/or nasal air emission. Orthognathic surgeries such as maxillary and/or mandibular advancements are also known to change skeletal and muscular structures resulting in changes affecting velopharyngeal closure (VPC). Although many studies have reported {{on the effect of}} maxillary advancement surgery on VPI for patients with cleft lip and palate, the effect of mandibular advancement on VPI has not been studied at length. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the effect of temporary prosthetic mandibular advancement on velopharyngeal function. Methods: Fourteen subjects (7 males, 7 females) with no history of craniofacial abnormalities or speech disorders were recruited. The mean age was 35 years (range = 26 - 60). Acoustic nasalance measurements were obtained during nasal sentences and during sentences without nasal consonants in two conditions; normally, and while wearing an elastic mandibular advancement (EMA) appliance to advance the mandible by 13 mm. In addition, subjects were asked to produce five repetitions of the sentence 2 ̆ 2 Ten men came in when Jane left 2 ̆ 2 while recordings were obtained with a videoendoscopy/phototransducer system that sensed the amount of light passing through the velopharyngeal orifice. The endoscope and fiber optic light were inserted through the subject 2 ̆ 7 s middle nasal meatus and positioned above the velum. The phototransducer fiber was extended through the velopharyngeal port into the upper oropharynx to detect light passing through the orifice as the velopharyngeal mechanism opened and closed. Individual subject 2 ̆ 7 s outcomes with and without the EMA appliance were analyzed statistically using paired t-test for Nasalance test, and one-way ANOVA/independent samples t-test for phototransducer test. Results: Nasalance did not deteriorate, but significantly decreased for the ‘nasal’ sentences after mandibular advancement, whereas changes in nasalance were not significant for the sentences containing no nasal consonants after mandibular advancement. Mandibular advancement by a 13 mm using an EMA appliance did not significantly affect VPC. Instead, large variability among subjects in response to mandibular advancement. For 7 of the 14 subjects, the extent of VPC decreased significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) <b>under</b> the advanced <b>mandible</b> condition compared to the normal condition (without the EMA appliance). On the other hand, 5 subjects showed significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) increased VPC when their mandibles were advanced. For 2 subjects, VPC was not significantly changed with the advanced mandible. Conclusions: The outcomes of this study suggested that there was no statistical evidence to support that nasality was deteriorated by a 13 mm mandibular advancement, which agreed with recent studies describing velopharyngeal function and nasality after orthognathic surgeries. VPC was not affected by mandibular advancement. Responses of the nasalance and VPC to mandibular advancement were dependent on the individuals. Further investigation such as electromyography method is needed to understand how velopharyngeal function and speech respond to mandibular advancement more definitely...|$|R
