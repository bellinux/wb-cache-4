25|$|Differential {{stresses}} that develop {{as a result}} of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to {{the rate at which the}} solvent can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies, and can yield to crack propagation in the <b>unfired</b> body if not relieved.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, {{members of}} {{a team led by}} Nicolae Vlassa, an {{archaeologist}} at the National Museum of Transylvanian History, Cluj-Napoca in charge of the site excavations, unearthed three inscribed but <b>unfired</b> clay tablets, together with 26 clay and stone figurines and a shell bracelet, accompanied by the burnt, broken, and disarticulated bones of an adult male.|$|E
25|$|Prior to contact, pottery {{was usually}} open-air fired or pit fired; precontact Indigenous peoples of Mexico used kilns extensively. Today many Native American ceramic artists use kilns. In pit-firing, the pot {{is placed in}} a shallow pit dug into the earth along with other <b>unfired</b> pottery, covered with wood and brush, or dung, then set on fire whereupon it can harden at {{temperatures}} of 1400 degrees or more. Finally, the ceramics surface is often polished with smooth stones.|$|E
25|$|Terra sigillata {{is usually}} brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry <b>unfired</b> ware. The ware is then quickly {{burnished}} {{with a soft}} cloth before {{the water in the}} terra sigillata soaks into the porous body. The burnished ware is allowed to dry again to remove the added moisture and biscuit fired, often fired to a lower than normal bisque temperature of approximately 900°C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the burnished effect in the clay surface.|$|E
25|$|Many Mississippian {{ceramics}} {{are decorated}} by incising or engraving. Implements such as sticks, reeds, or bone fragments, were dragged through wet clay to incise it, {{or they were}} scratched into {{the surface of the}} dried but as yet <b>unfired</b> pieces to engrave. Sharpened reeds or fingernails were also used to punch small marks. Ornate designs and motifs are common decorative elements, which archaeologists use to track the spread of influences from one culture onto another culture. Many of the designs have symbolic meanings, usually associated with aspects of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.|$|E
25|$|The {{most modern}} method of loading and {{unloading}} a revolver is {{by means of the}} swing out cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting {{from the front of the}} cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, <b>unfired</b> rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigator}} later {{testified that}} 146 spent shell casings were recovered inside the building. Another 68 casings were collected outside, {{for a total}} of 214 rounds fired by the attacker and responding police officers. A medic who treated Hasan said his pockets were full of pistol magazines. When the shooting ended, he was still carrying 177 rounds of <b>unfired</b> ammunition in his pockets, contained in both 20- and 30-round magazines. The incident, which lasted about 10 minutes, resulted in 13 killed12 soldiers and one civilian; 11 died at the scene, and two died later in a hospital; and 30 people wounded.|$|E
25|$|Geophysical survey can be {{the most}} {{effective}} way to see beneath the ground. Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or <b>unfired</b> clay) tend to have lower resistivity.|$|E
25|$|Conservation and {{restoration}} of ceramic objects {{is a process}} dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from ceramic. Typically this activity of conservation-restoration is undertaken by a conservator-restorer, especially when dealing with object of cultural heritage. Ceramics are created from a production of coatings of inorganic, nonmetallic materials using heating and cooling to create a glaze. Typically the coatings are permanent and sustainable for utilitarian and decorative purposes. The cleaning, handling, storage, and in general treatment of ceramics is consistent with that of glass because they are made of similar oxygen-rich components such as silicates. In conservation ceramics are broken down into three groups: <b>unfired</b> clay, earthenware or terracotta, and stoneware and porcelain.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{national}} ceramics prize called the Concurso Nacional de Alfareria y Ceramica “Arbol de la Vida” presented each year by the municipality but entrants {{are not limited to}} trees of life. Pieces from various places in Mexico, such as Oaxaca, Jalisco and Guanajuato but most pieces are from Mexico State. There are categories for <b>unfired</b> pieces, pieces fired at low temperatures, pieces fired at high temperatures and glazed pieces. Each year representatives from the various indigenous communities of Mexico gather to form a human “Tree of Life.” In 2006, 500 people from 63 different ethnic groups came to make the human pyramid, dress in native wear and calling for peace in the world. Some of the peoples represented include Zapotecs, Huastecs, Purépecha, Maya, Otomi, Tarahumara Huicholes and Yaquis.|$|E
25|$|Red figure is, put simply, {{the reverse}} of the black figure technique. Both were {{achieved}} by using the three-phase firing technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but <b>unfired</b> vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In Attica, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy clay slip. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.|$|E
25|$|Additionally {{the type}} of ceramic will affect how it will break down. <b>Unfired</b> clay, like mud and clay adobe, is clay that is fired under 1000°C or 1832°F. This type of clay is {{water-soluble}} and unstable. Earthenware is clay that has been fired between 1000-1200°C or 1832°-2192°F. The firing makes the clay water insoluble but does not allow {{the formation of an}} extensive glassy or vitreous within the body. Although water-insoluble, the porous body of earthenware allows water to penetrate. A glaze can be applied that will protect the vessel from water. Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200-1400°C or 2192-2552°F. Porcelain clay mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface. However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.|$|E
25|$|The x-ray {{diffraction}} {{of a sample}} from an <b>unfired</b> lump of pottery clay excavated at the Zebree (3MS20) site confirmed that the shell was burned before being added to the raw clay. Burning the shells eliminates the organic binder and the cooled, burnt shells are easily crushed into a shell temper of fine plate-like particles, some nearly powder. The hinges of the shells are discarded. Using burned shells is logical as unburned mussel shells are hard and very durable. In terms of soil technology, the addition of shell (calcium carbonate) {{has the effect of}} neutralizing the ionic charge of the clay particles. During the course of replicative pottery experiments, as the shell was added to the clay in the presence of water, distinct and immediate changes took place in the feel of the clay. With the valence neutral, the clay-temper combination produces a very satisfactory pottery clay. This modification of backswamp clay - particles now clumping instead of constantly slipping - into a well-behaved modeling clay would have been immediately noticed by the experienced prehistoric potter.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists {{working at}} Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture {{settlement}} {{located near the}} modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle {{on one side and}} a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the <b>unfired</b> vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the Ilex vomitoria. The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.|$|E
500|$|Loam construction, {{the subject}} of this article, {{referred}} to as adobe construction when it uses <b>unfired</b> clay bricks, is an ancient building technology. It was used in the early civilizations of the Mediterranean, Egypt and Mesopotamia, in the Indus, Ganges and Yellow river valleys, in Central and South America.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{are divided}} {{as to whether}} pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or {{introduced}} from the south. Specimens of shallow, <b>unfired</b> clay bowls found at Canyon de Chelly indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds. Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water, which might represent the first fired pottery in the region. An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the Mogollon Rim area to the south, where brown-paste bowls were used {{during the first few}} centuries of the common era. Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico, [...] CE. There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region, but archaeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families. Cooking pots made with crushed igneous rock tempers from places like Ute Mountain were more resilient and desirable, and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them.|$|E
500|$|Lépine {{then walked}} up an {{escalator}} {{to the third}} floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to [...] "get out," [...] shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform {{at the front of the}} classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine unsheathed his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, [...] "Ah shit," [...] and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty <b>unfired</b> cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen other people, including four men.|$|E
2500|$|Kaolin is {{the primary}} {{material}} from which porcelain is made, even though clay minerals might account for only {{a small proportion of}} the whole. The word [...] "paste" [...] is an old term for both the <b>unfired</b> and fired material.

2500|$|In this process, green (<b>unfired)</b> ceramic wares are {{heated to}} high {{temperatures}} in a kiln to permanently set their shapes. [...] Porcelain is fired {{at a higher}} temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous.|$|E

2500|$|Amongst the {{earliest}} known examples of any form of vaulting {{is to be found}} in the neolithic village of Khirokitia on Cyprus. Dating from ca. 6000 BCE, the circular buildings supported beehive shaped corbel domed vaults of <b>unfired</b> mud-bricks and also represent the first evidence for settlements with an upper floor. Similar Beehive tombs, called tholoi, exist in Crete and Northern Iraq. Their construction differs from that at Khirokitia in that most appear partially buried and make provision for a [...] entry.|$|E
2500|$|Hooded bottles or vessels were {{globular}} containers, resembling gourds, with {{a rounded}} base {{and a smaller}} [...] "head." [...] One {{side of the head}} was shaped like an animal or human face, while the other side was a black, hollow opening. They were slipped on their exterior surface. A theory is that these were used to store seed grain, and <b>unfired</b> clay plugs, such as Kersey Clay Objects, sealed the opening. Another theory is that the bottles were used for liquids. Owls and opossums are often featured on hooded vessels.|$|E
2500|$|Pottery {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{materials}} for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small preliminary works called maquettes of ephemeral materials such as plaster of Paris, wax, <b>unfired</b> clay, or plasticine. [...] Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small figurines have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture. Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from ancient Rome and Mesopotamia to China.|$|E
2500|$|Tin-glazed pottery is {{earthenware}} {{covered in}} glaze containing tin oxide which is white, shiny and opaque (see tin-glazing for the chemistry); usually this provides a background for brightly-painted decoration. [...] It has been important in Islamic and European pottery, but very little used in East Asia. The pottery body is usually made of red or buff colored earthenware {{and the white}} glaze imitated Chinese porcelain. [...] The decoration on tin-glazed pottery is usually applied to the <b>unfired</b> glaze surface by brush with metallic oxides, commonly cobalt oxide, copper oxide, iron oxide, manganese dioxide and antimony oxide. [...] The makers of Italian tin-glazed pottery from the late Renaissance blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings.|$|E
2500|$|The painters, {{who were}} either slaves or {{craftsmen}} paid as pottery painters, worked on <b>unfired,</b> leather-dry vases. In {{the case of}} black-figure production the subject was painted on the vase with a clay slurry (a glossy slip, in older literature also designated as varnish) which turned black after firing. This was not a [...] "color" [...] in the traditional sense, since this surface slip was of the same material as the vase itself, only differing {{in the size of}} the component particles. The area for the figures was first painted with a brush-like implement. The internal outlines and structural details were incised into the slip so that the underlying clay could be seen through the scratches. Two other earth-based pigments were used to add details—red and white for ornaments, clothing or parts of clothing, hair, animal manes, parts of weapons and other equipment. White was also frequently used to represent women’s skin.|$|E
2500|$|Modern [...] "Terra sig" [...] {{should be}} clearly {{distinguished}} from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods. [...] The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters {{can be made from}} most clay, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to <b>unfired</b> clay surfaces, [...] "terra sig" [...] can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this burnishing or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them. [...] The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.|$|E
2500|$|Pottery {{has been}} used to define phase {{sequences}} for Southern Appalachian Mississippian cultures. Limestone was initially used as a pottery temper before shell became the popular choice. Rounded bowls and spherical jars are the most common forms, sometimes with embellished rims and handles. Salt pans, platters, bottles, and effigies have also been unearthed. Cord-marked, coarse-tempered wares were for cooking, and serving wares were fine-tempered and highly polished. Pottery of the Piedmont and Blue Ridge regions differed dramatically from surrounding traditions; potters there used crushed quartz crystal and grit as tempers. Peoples of the Pisgah Phase in Western North Carolina used sand as a tempering agent. Rim lugs and handles are absent, and vessel surfaces are either plain or decorated the [...] "Complicated Stamped" [...] style. The stamping paddles, made of wood or pottery, were impressed into <b>unfired</b> clay. Many stamps were salvaged from Nacoochee Mound in Georgia. Throughout the southeast, samples of negative pottery can be found, featuring circles, crosses, and rings of dark slip on lighter backgrounds.|$|E
2500|$|Gladding, McBean & Co.’s ware {{would be}} {{produced}} in a new patented earthenware clay body known as Malinite. Dr. Andrew Malinovsky developed the high talc one-fire body using an amorphous flux in 1928 for Gladding, McBean & Co. Malinite was developed {{for use in the}} production of one-fire clay tile; however the company made the decision to use Malinite for their dinnerware production. By using the Malinite and adjusting the kiln temperature for a one fire process, the company solved the crazing problem in their own product. Glaze was applied to the <b>unfired</b> body, and the glaze and body matured together in the kiln, saving the company the time and expense of separate bisque firing for the body. [...] For the new line of pottery, Gladding, McBean & Co. decided to use Prouty tunnel kilns. The Prouty tunnel kiln patents were acquired in the purchase of the West Coast holdings of the American Encaustic Tiling Company in 1933. Prouty tunnel kilns allowed for the continuous flow of ware through the kiln to fire pottery. Thus the plant “combined mills, jiggering units, conveyors, dryers and kilns into a model of straight line output.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Such clay {{has a high}} [...] "shrink-swell" [...] ratio {{depending}} upon {{the amount of water}} present. As it dries from a saturated to a dry state it shrinks greatly – as seen in the cracked clay deposits of drying flooded areas – and this characteristic presents a serious problem to the potter. As the vessel is fired, any water left in the clay will tend to quickly turn to steam and explode the vessel wall in a spawl. It takes care and time to dry these vessels before they can be fired safely. Moreover, as even a well-tempered vessel dries shrinkage rates vary around the contours of the form and will create strains which will crack an air drying vessel if the drying is not slowed and controlled. A high shrinkage rate probably meant lots of effort lost to broken pots in both the drying and firing stages for inexperienced potters and ineffective technologies. Woodland potters attempted to remedy the high shrinkage by using large amounts (up to 33%) of coarse sand and/or grog temper in their efforts to render the clay usable for vessel construction. Moreover, their vessel shapes were necessarily confined to either a flat or conical-bottomed vessel and a thick walled construction were required in order for the vessel to stand, in an <b>unfired</b> state, without collapsing during the air-drying process in preparation for firing. Non-backswamp clays used {{in many parts of the}} world could use grog and/or sand and create a round-bottomed vessel, favored by the cook, but not so with the [...] "gumbo" [...] clays of the Mississippi Valley.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an action}} {{potential}} has {{occurred at a}} patch of membrane, the membrane patch needs time to recover before it can fire again. [...] At the molecular level, this absolute refractory period corresponds to the time required for the voltage-activated sodium channels to recover from inactivation, i.e., {{to return to their}} closed state. There are many types of voltage-activated potassium channels in neurons, some of them inactivate fast (A-type currents) and some of them inactivate slowly or not inactivate at all; this variability guarantees that there will be always an available source of current for repolarization, even if some of the potassium channels are inactivated because of preceding depolarization. On the other hand, all neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels inactivate within several millisecond during strong depolarization, thus making following depolarization impossible until a substantial fraction of sodium channels have returned to their closed state. Although it limits the frequency of firing, the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction along an axon. [...] The currents flowing in due to an action potential spread out in both directions along the axon. However, only the <b>unfired</b> part of the axon can respond with an action potential; the part that has just fired is unresponsive until the action potential is safely out of range and cannot restimulate that part. [...] In the usual orthodromic conduction, the action potential propagates from the axon hillock towards the synaptic knobs (the axonal termini); propagation in the opposite direction—known as antidromic conduction—is very rare. [...] However, if a laboratory axon is stimulated in its middle, both halves of the axon are [...] "fresh", i.e., unfired; then two action potentials will be generated, one traveling towards the axon hillock and the other traveling towards the synaptic knobs.|$|E
