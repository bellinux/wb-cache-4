50|$|The {{original}} {{focus was}} initially rock music and since branched into pop, country, hip-hop, jazz and urban music. In 2001, artists were divided under different divisions <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectra</b> Music Group company to separate genres so the music could better standout. Since 2007, all artists are currently {{considered to be}} signed to <b>the</b> parent company, <b>Spectra.</b> As of 2008, numerous subsidiary labels now fall <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectra</b> Music Group.

50|$|Since 1996 the Spectrum {{name has}} been used for Kember's solo work, {{sometimes}} with Pete Bain from the original Spacemen 3 lineup and recording engineer/musician Alf Hardy. The music made with Bain and Hardy was often in the same vein as E.A.R., reflecting an increased interest in vintage analogue synthesizers, especially those made by EMS. After issuing 1997's Forever Alien album, there were no further releases of new material <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectrum</b> moniker until 2008's Indian Giver collaboration with Jim Dickinson. Kember has also worked with Füxa's Randall Nieman.|$|E
5000|$|Kember {{recruited}} new musicians for {{the group}} Spectrum in 1991. Initial Spectrum releases carried on {{from the sound of}} late-period Spacemen 3, featuring conventional songs and a regular band. First single [...] "How You Satisfy Me" [...] was an original composition reminiscent of 1960s garage bands, based as it was upon the Chip Taylor-penned pop hit [...] "Can't Let Go". 1992's Soul Kiss (Glide Divine) album was split between songs and longer experimental pieces featuring drones and repetition, and Highs, Lows and Heavenly Blows (1994) was also mainly song-oriented. Kember has occasionally collaborated with Jessamine and The Silver Apples <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectrum</b> name.|$|E

30|$|The {{normalized}} absorption line/lines {{corresponding to}} different metabolite were integrated over {{the extension of}} the peak/peaks and each integral was used as one input to the multivariate matrix. In general, the metabolite identification was done using Chenomx (Chenomx NMR Suite, Chenomx Inc.) (Chenomx, 2011). However, some of this regions (or peaks) could not be appropriately identified by Chenomx and therefore other data base were used, such as, BMRB - Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (Ulrich et al. 2008) and some references (Jansen et al. 2006; Romanska et al. 2009; Shi et al. 2008; Triba et al. 2010). <b>The</b> total area <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectra</b> was calculated taking in to account <b>the</b> entire <b>spectra</b> (0.45 – 4.5 [*]ppm), while the area of each absorption line was calculated taking in to account only the extension of each line or interval of lines. Therefore, the total sum of the areas from absorption lines is slightly smaller than <b>the</b> total area <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectra.</b> To make these two areas equal, we had to add an extra absorption line, P, with the area equal to total area minus the sum of the areas of the absorption lines.|$|R

50|$|NBA TV is not {{currently}} available on legacy Charter Communications systems, which carried the network as NBA.com TV prior to 2004, due to unknown carriage conflicts; NBA League Pass {{is also not}} carried by Charter (on May 18, 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for $78.7 billion, which both carry the network). NBA TV is available to Charter households where available as of February 2017, if a customer switches to the new 'Spectrum' billing plan which will unite Charter, Time Warner and Bright House <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectrum</b> branding (this is all likely unrelated to Charter's inherited naming rights of the Charlotte Hornets' home arena, the Spectrum Center).|$|E
50|$|Metro Sports has {{published}} a book, More Than The Score: Kansas City Sports Memories. On March 1, 2010, Metro Sports launched Metro Sports HD, a high definition simulcast feed of Metro Sports, and a secondary channel, Metro Sports 2. In September 2013, the channel was renamed as the Time Warner Cable SportsChannel, with its spin-off channel becoming known as Time Warner Cable SportsChannel 2; at that time, it adopted a logo similar to that implemented by Time Warner Cable SportsNet in Los Angeles when it launched the year prior. Following the provider's acquisition of Time Warner Cable in May 2016, the Time Warner Cable SportsChannel services were rebranded <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectrum</b> Sports banner in September 2016, as part of Charter's phaseout of the TWC brand.|$|E
50|$|Despite the rebranding, some {{electronic}} program guide (EPG) providers identify TeenNick as The N {{and display}} its 2007-2009 logo as that of TeenNick's current logo (Nick Jr. has a similar issue, as the former Noggin logo and name is still used by some EPG providers to identify that channel). In July 2011, TeenNick began carrying programs originally filmed for high definition broadcast in a letterboxed format, due {{to the absence of}} an HD simulcast feed of the channel. After Nicktoons and Nick Jr. launched HD services in 2013, TeenNick was the only Nickelodeon-branded network without an HD simulcast network until September 2016; this remains limited to IPTV providers and some cable company mobile and digital media player apps, such as that of the companies <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectrum</b> branding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Problem Statement: Pattern Based Communication System (PBCS) aims {{to handle}} two {{prominent}} restrictions in communication lines. These are the inefficient {{utilization of the}} bandwidth <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> limitations and sensitivity of the data transmission rate to the variation of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Approach: The key point of PBCS is to construct the optimal communication signals, which consist of patterned data that can be recovered by the cognitive receiver, for a successful data transmission even in low SNR and high data bit rate. Result: In this study, performance of the PBCS is evaluated by the comparison with Matched Filtering (MF). Conclusion: This comparison shows that transmission performance of the PBCS is higher than MF due to its dynamic and flexible operation capability under variation of spectral conditions...|$|E
40|$|We present recent {{improvements}} to the 4 -junction inverted metamorphic solar cell. The device now includes a (Ga) InAsP buffer that transitions to lattice constants greater than InP, which allows access to GaInAs subcells with bandgaps < 0. 74 eV and an additional 2 mA/cm 2 of bottom junction photocurrent at AM 1. 5 D. However, the optimal design depends on <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> and operating temperature.

40|$|Optimal {{transmission}} scheduling in wireless cognitive networks {{is considered}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> leasing model. We propose a cooperative scheme in which secondary nodes share the time slot with primary nodes {{in return for}} cooperation. Cooperation is feasible only if the system’s performance is improved over the non-cooperative one. First, we investigate a scenario where secondary users are interested in immediate rewards. Then, we formulate another problem where the secondary users are guaranteed {{a portion of the}} primary utility, on a long term basis, in return for cooperation. Our proposed schemes are shown to outperform non-cooperative scheduling schemes, in terms of both individual and total expected utility, for a given set of feasible constraints.

Here, we present four-junction four-terminal mechanical stacks composed of GaInP/GaAs tandems grown on GaAs substrates and GaInAsP/GaInAs tandems grown on InP substrates. The component cells were bonded together with a low-index transparent epoxy that acts as an angularly selective reflector to the GaAs bandedge luminescence, while simultaneously transmitting {{nearly all of the}} subbandgap light. As determined by electroluminescence measurements and optical modeling, the GaAs subcell demonstrates a higher internal radiative limit and, thus, higher subcell voltage, compared with GaAs subcells without the epoxy reflector.
