40|$|Decision making often {{involves}} {{the accumulation of}} information over time, but acquiring information typically comes at a cost. Little {{is known about the}} cost incurred by animals and humans for acquiring additional information from sensory variables due, for instance, to attentional efforts. Through a novel integration of diffusion models and dynamic programming, we were able to estimate the cost of making additional observations per unit of time from two monkeys and six humans in a reaction time (RT) random-dot motion discrimination task. Surprisingly, we find that the cost is neither zero nor constant over time, but for the animals and humans features a brief period in which it is constant but increases thereafter. In addition, we show that our theory accurately matches the observed reaction time distributions for each stimulus condition, the time-dependent choice accuracy both conditional on stimulus strength and independent of it, and choice accuracy and mean reaction times as a function of stimulus strength. The theory also correctly predicts that <b>urgency</b> <b>signals</b> in the brain should be independent of the difficulty, or stimulus strength, at each trial...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural and neurophysiological {{studies in}} {{primates}} have increasingly shown {{the involvement of}} <b>urgency</b> <b>signals</b> during the temporal integration of sensory evidence in perceptual decision-making. Neuronal correlates of such signals {{have been found in}} the parietal cortex, and in separate studies, demonstrated attention-induced gain modulation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although previous computational models of decision-making have incorporated gain modulation, their abstract forms do not permit an understanding of the contribution of inhibitory gain modulation. Thus, the effects of co-modulating both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal gains on decision-making dynamics and behavioural performance remain unclear. In this work, we incorporate time-dependent co-modulation of the gains of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons into our previous biologically based decision circuit model. We base our computational study in the context of two classic motion-discrimination tasks performed in animals. Our model shows that by simultaneously increasing the gains of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, a variety of the observed dynamic neuronal firing activities can be replicated. In particular, the model can exhibit winner-take-all decision-making behaviour with higher firing rates and within a significantly more robust model parameter range. It also exhibits short-tailed reaction time distributions even when operating near a dynamical bifurcation point. The model further shows that neuronal gain modulation can compensate for weaker recurrent excitation in a decision neural circuit, and support decision formation and storage. Higher neuronal gain is also suggested in the more cognitively demanding reaction time than in the fixed delay version of the task. Using the exact temporal delays from the animal experiments, fast recruitment of gain co-modulation is shown to maximize reward rate, with a timescale that is surprisingly near the experimentally fitted value. Our work provides insights into the simultaneous and rapid modulation of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal gains, which enables flexible, robust, and optimal decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Several {{acoustic}} pulse parameters {{expected to}} affect the perceived <b>urgency</b> in auditory <b>signals</b> were investigated in a factorial experiment for objective measures of operator performance in a complex occupational environment. 18 experienced subjects, system console operators at Kennedy Space Center, participated in the experiment where the effects of manipulation of inter-pulse interval and pulse format were evaluated for self-reported workload ratings and objective effects in complex, multi-task performance. The results confirmed the prediction of inter-pulse interval effecting reaction times. Subjective workload ratings were equal for all format and interval combinations. Accuracy of primary task measures, in terms of erroneous operator actions, was also equal for all signal combinations. A secondary tracking task was imbedded in the evaluation for workload adjustment and resource allocation measurement. The performance on the secondary task was significantly influenced by signal design, and the objective performance measures countermand the predictions of perceived urgency effects based on previous studies. The study results are interpreted for development and design {{of a system of}} auditory alarms for the Checkout and Launch Control Systems at Kennedy Space Center.

40|$|SummaryNeurophysiological {{studies of}} {{decision}} making have primarily focused on decisions about information that is stable over time. However, during natural behavior, animals make decisions in a constantly changing environment. To investigate the neural mechanisms of such dynamic choices, we recorded activity in dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M 1) while monkeys performed a two-choice reaching task in which sensory information about the correct choice was changing within each trial and the decision could be made at any time. During deliberation, activity in both areas did not integrate sensory information but instead tracked it and combined it with a growing <b>urgency</b> <b>signal.</b> Approximately 280  ms before movement onset, PMd activity tuned to the selected target reached a consistent peak while M 1 activity tuned to the unselected target was suppressed. We propose that this reflects the resolution of a competition between the potential responses and constitutes the volitional commitment to an action choice...|$|E
40|$|In some environments, {{there is}} a serious {{mismatch}} between the perceived (psychoacoustic) urgency of a warning and its situational urgency. This pilot study investigated effect of pulse format, pulse duration, and time between pulses on the perceived <b>urgency</b> of warning <b>signals.</b> The intent was to determine the best combination of variables and levels of variables to use in a formal study on the perceived <b>urgency</b> of warning <b>signals.</b> The results indicated that only pulse format and time between pulses were significant. Subjects rated sequential pulses as being less urgent than any other format. Signals with shorter inter-pulse intervals were rated as significantly more urgent. Pulse format and time between pulses were determined to be variables which should be used in future research. BACKGROUND Auditory warning signals have found their way into many environments. When designed correctly, they can improve performance and reduce accidents. However, in some environments, {{there is a}} serious mismatch between the perceived (psychoacoustic) urgency of a warning (the implicit urgency as a function of its sound parameters), and its situational urgency (the degree of urgency associated with the situation itself) (Edworthy, 1991). This mismatch has been demonstrated in aircraft (Patterson, 1982) and in operating and recovery rooms i...|$|R

High <b>urgency</b> and bimodal <b>signals</b> were responded to faster than their low urgency and unimodal counterparts. Fewer bimodal signals were missed overall. This bimodal advantage was particularly significant relative to unimodal <b>signals</b> of low <b>urgency</b> in the high working memory load condition.

40|$|Participants drove a {{simulated}} vehicle while completing an n-back task of {{high or low}} cognitive demand. Concurrently, they responded via brake press to signals presented in either a single modality (auditory, visual or tactile) or a bimodal combination. Participants {{were asked to indicate}} the perceived <b>urgency</b> of each <b>signal</b> by adjusting the force applied in their brake response. Signals were designed to be of “high ” or “low ” urgency based on previous research for both unimodal and bimodal combinations. Participants were capable of subjectively judging perceived urgency independent of response time and responded to bimodal (relative to unimodal) and high (relative to low) urgency stimuli with significantly greater brake force. However, both factors interacted with cognitive demand indicating that the magnitude of these differential responses was reduced under high demand. Implications for warning evaluation in an in-vehicle driving context are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The speed–accuracy {{trade-off}} (SAT) is {{ubiquitous in}} decision tasks. While the neural mechanisms underlying decisions are generally well characterized, {{the application of}} decision-theoretic methods to the SAT {{has been difficult to}} reconcile with experimental data suggesting that decision thresholds are inflexible. Using a network model of a cortical decision circuit, we demonstrate the SAT {{in a manner consistent with}} neural and behavioral data and with mathematical models that optimize speed and accuracy with respect to one another. In simulations of a reaction time task, we modulate the gain of the network with a signal encoding the urgency to respond. As the <b>urgency</b> <b>signal</b> builds up, the network progresses through a series of processing stages supporting noise filtering, integration of evidence, amplification of integrated evidence, and choice selection. Analysis of the network's dynamics formally characterizes this progression. Slower buildup of urgency increases accuracy by slowing down the progression. Faster buildup has the opposite effect. Because the network always progresses through the same stages, decision-selective firing rates are stereotyped at decision time...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) {{can be described}} as cautious and hesitant, manifesting an excessive indecisiveness that hinders efficient decision making. However, excess caution in decision making may also lead to better performance in specific situations where the cost of extended deliberation is small. We compared 16 juvenile OCD patients with 16 matched healthy controls whilst they performed a sequential information gathering task under different external cost conditions. We found that patients with OCD outperformed healthy controls, winning significantly more points. The groups also differed in the number of draws required prior to committing to a decision, but not in decision accuracy. A novel Bayesian computational model revealed that subjective sampling costs arose as a non-linear function of sampling, closely resembling an escalating <b>urgency</b> <b>signal.</b> Group difference in performance was best explained by a later emergence of these subjective costs in the OCD group, also evident in an increased decision threshold. Our findings present a novel computational model and suggest that enhanced information gathering in OCD can be accounted for by a higher decision threshold arising out of an altered perception of costs that, in some specific contexts, may be advantageous...|$|E
40|$|Stressors motivate {{an array}} of {{adaptive}} responses ranging from 2 ̆ 7 fight or flight 2 ̆ 7 to an internal <b>urgency</b> <b>signal</b> facilitating long-term goals. However, traumatic or chronic uncontrollable stress promotes the onset of major depressive disorder, in which acute stressors lose their motivational properties and are perceived as insurmountable impediments. Consequently, stress-induced depression is a debilitating human condition characterized by an affective shift from engagement of the environment to withdrawal. An emerging neurobiological substrate of depression and associated pathology is the nucleus accumbens, a region with the capacity to mediate a diverse range of stress responses by interfacing limbic, cognitive and motor circuitry. Here we report that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide released in response to acute stressors and other arousing environmental stimuli, acts in the nucleus accumbens of naive mice to increase dopamine release through coactivation of the receptors CRFR 1 and CRFR 2. Remarkably, severe-stress exposure completely abolished this effect without recovery for at least 90 [*]days. This loss of CRF 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to regulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens {{is accompanied by a}} switch in the reaction to CRF from appetitive to aversive, indicating a diametric change in the emotional response to acute stressors. Thus, the current findings offer a biological substrate for the switch in affect which is central to stress-induced depressive disorders...|$|E
40|$|Deciding between {{multiple}} {{courses of}} action often entails an increasing {{need to do something}} as time passes - a sense of urgency. This notion of urgency is not incorporated in standard theories of speeded decision making that assume information is accumulated until a critical fixed threshold is reached. Yet, it is hypothesized in novel theoretical models of decision making. In two experiments, we investigated the behavioral and neural evidence for an “urgency signal” in human perceptual decision making. Experiment 1 found that as the duration of the decision making process increased, participants made a choice based on less evidence for the selected option. Experiment 2 replicated this finding, and additionally found that variability in this effect across participants covaried with activation in the striatum. We conclude that individual differences in susceptibility to urgency are reflected by striatal activation. By dynamically updating a response threshold, the striatum is involved in <b>signaling</b> <b>urgency</b> in humans...|$|R
40|$|Multi-sensory {{warnings}} {{can potentially}} enhance risk communication. Hereto we investigated how temporal signal parameters affect perceived urgency {{within and across}} modalities. In an experiment, 78 observers rated the perceived urgency of uni-, bi-, and/or tri-modal stimuli as function of 25 combinations of pulse duration (range 100 – 1600 ms) and inter pulse interval length (100 – 1600 ms). The results showed that perceived <b>urgency</b> increases with <b>signal</b> rate. Inter pulse interval showed a larger effect than pulse duration and the largest differences in perceived urgency as function of inter pulse interval occurred at the smallest pulse duration (100 ms). The effects of pulse duration and inter pulse interval were universal across modalities. Bi- and tri-modal signals were perceived as more urgent than each of their uni-modal constituents. We conclude that temporal parameters can be deployed to construct integrated, multi-sensory warning signals with a pre-specified degree of perceived urgency. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In North America, {{it is now}} {{required}} that buildings equipped with a fire alarm system sound the Temporal-Three (T- 3) pattern as the evacuation signal. It is intended that the T- 3 pattern will become the standardized alarm signal heard {{around the world that}} will unequivocally mean "evacuate the building immediately". Since new and refurbished buildings are now equipped with this new signal, we need to ascertain if the public recognizes this sound as an evacuation signal. The objectives of the study were to assess the public's recollection, identification and perceived urgency of the T- 3. Data was collected through a field study in public buildings in the Ottawa area with 307 participants. Results showed that participants often reported that they had heard the T- 3 before, although they could rarely correctly identify it as a fire alarm or evacuation signal. In fact, the T- 3 was usually associated with domestic signals such as a busy phone signal or the sound of an alarm clock. Further, the T- 3 was not judged as a <b>signal</b> conveying <b>urgency.</b> The findings suggest that considerable public education is necessary to improve the public's identification of the T- 3 signal. It is also suggested that it is unrealistic to expect that occupants will immediately start evacuation upon hearing such a signal and that further information provided to the occupants will always be necessary to prompt evacuation movement.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Past {{decades of}} {{research}} within the area of decision-making has had a large focus on advancing process models, which are models that contain theoretically meaningful parameters, {{in order to better}} understand the processes that underlie decision-making. One of the most popular types of process models within decision-making research has been evidence accumulation models (EAMs), which propose that decision-making is made up of some process where evidence for the various alternates accumulate {{over the course of a}} decision, until the evidence reaches some threshold value, where the decision is triggered. Importantly, EAMs have enjoyed a great deal of success in being fit to empirical data, being able to successfully account for a wide range of phenomena and helping to answer theoretical questions that would have been near impossible without the use of a process model. This thesis aims to accomplish 3 main goals with EAMs: to extend EAMs to new research areas to help solve novel empirical questions, to test newly proposed components that could potentially be added to existing EAMs, and to propose a new method of how to test between models in the EAM framework to answer empirical research questions. The first goal is addressed in Chapters 2 and 3, which applies the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to personality and genetics research, respectively, which are two areas previously unexplored with EAMs. The second goal is addressed in Chapters 4 and 5, which assesses whether a newly proposed component of EAMs, a threshold that decreases over the course of a trial (collapsing threshold; or a mathematically similar <b>urgency</b> <b>signal),</b> can be justified in empirical data. The final goal is addressed in Chapter 6, which presents a new method of calculating Bayes factors - a method of selecting between competing models - for the LBA using Monte-Carlo integration and general-purpose graphics processing unit computing. Generally speaking, the findings indicate that EAMs are capable of extending to the fields of personality and genetics, that the proposed component of a collapsing threshold is not necessarily justified within the EAM framework, and that the use of Bayes factors through Monte-Carlo integration improves upon previous methods of model selection...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how the {{activity}} of sensory neurons contribute to perceptual decision making {{is one of the}} major questions in neuroscience. In the current standard model, the output of opposing pools of noisy, correlated sensory neurons is integrated by downstream neurons whose activity elicits a decision-dependent behavior [1][2]. The predictions of the standard model for empirical measurements like choice probability (CP), psychophysical kernel (PK) and reaction time distribution crucially depend on the spatial and temporal correlations within the pools of sensory neurons. This dependency has so far only been investigated numerically and for time-invariant correlations and variances. However, it has recently been shown that the noise variance undergoes significant changes over the course of the stimulus presentation [3]. The same is true for inter-neuronal correlations that have been shown to change with task and attentional state [4][5]. In the first part of our work we compute analytically the time course of CPs and PKs in the presence of arbitrary noise correlations and variances for the case of non-leaky integration and Gaussian noise. This allows general insights and is especially needed in the light of the experimental transition from single-cell to multi-cell recordings. Then we simulate the implications of realistic noise in several variants of the standard model (leaky and non-leaky integration, integration over the entire stimulus presentation or until a bound, with and without <b>urgency</b> <b>signal)</b> and compare them to physiological data. We find that in the case of non-leaky integration over the entire stimulus duration, the PK only depends on the overall level of noise variance, not its time course. That means that the PK remains constant regardless of the temporal changes in the noise. This finding supports an earlier conclusion that an observed decreasing PK suggests that the brain is not integrating over the entire stimulus duration but only until it has accumulated sufficient evidence, even in the case of no urgency [6]. The time course of the CP, on the other hand, strongly depends on the time course of the noise variances and on the temporal and interneuronal correlations. If noise variance or interneuronal correlation increases, CPs increase as well. This dissociation of PK and CP allows an alternative solution to the puzzle recently posed by [7] in a bottom-up framework by combining integration to a bound with an increase in noise variance/correlation. In addition, we derive how the distribution of reaction times depends on noise variance and correlation, further constraining the model using empirical observations...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} Audio, Visual and Tactile warnings for drivers, highlighting {{the importance of}} conveying the appropriate level of <b>urgency</b> through the <b>signals.</b> However, these modalities have never been combined exhaustively with different urgency levels and tested while using a driving simulator. This paper describes two experiments investigating all multimodal combinations of such warnings along three different levels of designed urgency. The warnings were first evaluated in terms of perceived urgency and perceived annoyance {{in the context of}} a driving simulator. The results showed that the perceived urgency matched the designed urgency of the warnings. More urgent warnings were also rated as more annoying but the effect of annoyance was lower compared to urgency. The warnings were then tested for recognition time when presented during a simulated driving task. It was found that warnings of high urgency induced quicker and more accurate responses than warnings of medium and of low urgency. In both studies, the number of modalities used in warnings (one, two or three) affected both subjective and objective responses. More modalities led to higher ratings of urgency and annoyance, with annoyance having a lower effect compared to urgency. More modalities also led to quicker responses. These results provide implications for multimodal warning design and reveal how modalities and modality combinations can influence participant responses during a simulated driving task...|$|R
