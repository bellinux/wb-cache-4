5|$|Fantastic Light and Galileo {{did meet}} at Ascot in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, {{for which the}} Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old was sent off the 1/2 {{favourite}} ahead of Fantastic Light at 7/2. The race {{was the subject of}} considerable advance publicity, and was portrayed as a clash between the two most powerful forces in European racing; Godolphin, represented by Fantastic Light, and Ballydoyle/Coolmore represented by Galileo. As in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, Dettori settled Fantastic Light in the early stages before moving him out to challenge in the straight. Galileo had already taken the lead but Fantastic Light moved <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> level a furlong out. The two horses raced side-by-side for several strides, but Galileo then pulled ahead to win by two lengths.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E

The timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test measures basic mobility skills including a sequence of functional manoeuvres used in everyday life. OBJECTIVES: to create a practical cut-off value to indicate normal versus below normal timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test performance by comparing test performance of community-dwelling and institutionalised elderly women. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 413 community-dwelling and 78 institutionalised mobile elderly women (age range 65 - 85 years) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. MEASUREMENTS: timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test duration, residential and mobility status, age, height, weight and body mass index were documented. RESULTS: 92 % of community-dwelling elderly women performed the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test in less than 12 seconds and all community-dwelling women had times below 20 seconds. In contrast only 9 % of institutionalised elderly women performed the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test in less than 12 seconds, 42 % were below 20 seconds, 32 % had results between 20 and 30 seconds and 26 % were above 30 seconds. The 10 (th) - 90 (th) percentiles for timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test performance were 6. 0 - 11. 2 seconds for community-dwelling and 12. 7 - 50. 1 seconds for institutionalised elderly women. When stratifying participants according to mobility status, the timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> test duration increased significantly with decreasing mobility (Kruskall-Wallis-test: p> 0. 0001). Linear regression modelling identified residential status (p> 0. 0001) and {{physical mobility}} status (p> 0. 0001) as significant predictors of timed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> performance.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} chair seat height and turning direction on the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores of patients after stroke. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A geriatric day hospital in Hong Kong. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five patients with sub-acute stroke. METHODS: The time taken to complete the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test with various chair seat heights (65 %, 90 % and 115 % of each subject’s leg length – distance from lateral knee joint line to ground in sitting) and turning directions (toward the affected and unaffected side) was recorded using a stopwatch with randomized test order. RESULTS: There were significant differences in Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores between the 3 levels of chair seat height (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), with the lowest Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores recorded when the seat height was 115 % of the subject’s leg length and the highest at a seat height of 65 % of the subject’s leg length. Turning toward the affected side {{was found to be}} significantly quicker than turning toward the unaffected side (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Chair seat height and turning direction significantly influence the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> scores of patients after sub-acute stroke. Optimizing chair seat height with reference to subject’s leg length and turning direction is essential when using the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test as an outcome measure in stroke rehabilitation.

With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to the gravel.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{ability of}} the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test to predict {{sarcopenia}} has not been evaluated previously. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test for predicting sarcopenia in elderly hospitalized patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed 68 elderly patients (&# 8805; 60 years of age) in a private hospital in the city of Salvador-BA, Brazil, between the 1 st and 5 th day of hospitalization. The predictive variable was the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test score, <b>and</b> the outcome of interest was the presence of sarcopenia (reduced muscle mass associated with a reduction in handgrip strength and/or weak physical performance in a 6 -m gait-speed test). After the descriptive data analyses, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of a test using the predictive variable to predict the presence of sarcopenia were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 68 elderly individuals, with a mean age 70. 4 &# 177; 7. 7 years, were evaluated. The subjects had a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 5. 35 &# 177; 1. 97. Most (64. 7 %) of the subjects had a clinical admission profile; the main reasons for hospitalization were cardiovascular disorders (22. 1 %), pneumonia (19. 1 %) and abdominal disorders (10. 2 %). The frequency of sarcopenia in the sample was 22. 1 %, and the mean length of time spent performing the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test was 10. 02 &# 177; 5. 38 s. A time longer than or equal to a cutoff of 10. 85 s on the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test predicted sarcopenia with a sensitivity of 67 % and a specificity of 88. 7 %. The accuracy of this cutoff for the Timed <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> test was good (0. 80; IC= 0. 66 - 0. 94; p= 0. 002).
