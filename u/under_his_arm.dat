5|$|When he {{examined}} Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds {{from a single}} shotgun blast {{on the right side}} <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about four inches across. The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.|$|E
5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{man came}} in before I left, who I {{found out later}} was Baby Face Nelson. He {{came in with a}} drum of machine gun bullets <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went back into the kitchen.|$|E

25|$|Wayland {{asked his}} brother to collect feathers, with which he made himself wings. He flew to Niðung and {{revealed}} {{to him that he}} had killed his sons and made his daughter pregnant. He then flew away. Egill was ordered by the king to shoot him down. But Wayland had tied a bladder filled with blood <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Egill hit it, thus deceiving the king, and Wayland returned to Zealand.|$|E
25|$|As he {{got close}} enough, he {{suddenly}} made a leap and captured the king single-handedly, holding the king <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> meanwhile threatening {{to kill the}} king {{if there was any}} attempt of rescue. A little snap of the neck would cause fatality to the King, considering Pu Tong Seal's size, ferocity, and strength. The Burman soldiers wisely retreated at the command of Pu Tong Seal, because of fear of losing their beloved king.|$|E
25|$|Ever a student, Biederwolf was a {{firm believer}} in serious reading and {{regularly}} carried a book <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> to make use of otherwise wasted moments. His sermons were written out word-for-word and memorized, but his delivery was so fluent that listeners were unaware of his preparation. Biederwolf enjoyed athletics (in later life, tennis and golf), and he was a collector of small gemstones, which he prized for their color and light rather than for their intrinsic value. Biederwolf died at his home in Monticello in 1939.|$|E

25|$|On her sixth voyage, {{the most}} {{important}} stop of Suomen Joutsen was New York City, where the ship arrived on 3 March 1937. Prior to this, the ship had visited Portugal, Senegal {{and a number of}} ports in the Caribbean after leaving Helsinki on 2 November 1936. However, the ship's first and only visit to the United States under the Finnish flag was an important milestone and a major media event. When the ship was sailing up the Hudson River, an American film crew came on board to capture her arrival, and Suomen Joutsen remained the center of attention for the six days she was moored at the western end of the 35th Street. When the ship left New York, a member of the crew was accidentally left on the shore. However, he managed to talk a local tugboat captain to take him back to the school ship and, for solving the problem on his own initiative, was left without punishment. After stopping at Oslo, Suomen Joutsen arrived in Helsinki on the May Day of 1936. Among the first people to leave the ship was a man carrying a living crocodile <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> captured for the Helsinki Zoo.|$|E
500|$|Maulbetsch {{was said}} to run [...] "so low that he could dash under an {{ordinary}} table without losing his feet." [...] At a coaching conference in the 1920s, a coach doubted the table-ducking story and challenged Maulbetsch. [...] The doubter later recalled: [...] "I began ribbing him about this table-ducking stuff and finally offered to bet him he couldn’t do it. [...] Well, we got a table up in a room, Johnny tucked a water pitcher <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> and backed against the wall. [...] Darned if he didn’t do it, the only thing, that water pitcher broke in a million pieces." [...] Asked about the incident, Maulbetsch said it was true, except one part. [...] Maulbetsch insisted there wasn’t a nick on the pitcher.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Singh starred as a Bengali {{criminal}} in Ali Abbas Zafar's Gunday, alongside Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan. David Chute of Variety praised Singh's screen {{presence and}} {{wrote that he}} [...] "tucks the movie's center of interest <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> and takes it with him — {{even though he has}} the could-be-thankless [...] "good brother" [...] role". Also, Singh's chemistry with Kapoor was considered by critic Rohit Khilnani to the prime asset of the film. Gunday proved to be Singh's biggest box office opener, and eventually emerged a box-office success with a revenue of [...] worldwide. After a cameo appearance in Finding Fanny, Singh starred as a gangster in Shaad Ali's unsuccessful crime drama Kill Dil opposite Parineeti Chopra and Ali Zafar and received negative reviews.|$|E

500|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} {{features}} William Bradford. He wears a hat and carries a Bible <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> Bradford, noted for piety, {{is intended to be}} seen in a moment of meditation. Dallin's plaster models had the words [...] "HOLY BIBLE" [...] on the volume; these, together with Dallin's initials [...] "CED", were removed. Instead, the initial D was placed under Bradford's elbow, likely impressed upon the hub as an afterthought by a punch normally used to create the mint mark D for the Denver Mint. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen deemed Bradford's broad collar near enough to Puritan wear of the day to pass, though they questioned the authenticity of the ruffled cravat. Bradford's portrait is in any case an invention; no genuine likeness of him is known. The crudeness of the lettering complained of by Fraser is not apparent due to the relatively small size {{of the coin}}s.|$|E
500|$|Although {{his mother}} was a Jehovah's Witness, Fleury was raised as a Roman Catholic. He {{attended}} mass from age 6 to 12, serving as an altar boy until the church's priest died of a heart attack, depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences. Always lacking money and a stable home, Fleury received support from the community, in particular the Peltz family in Russell, who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required. In January 1982, Fleury's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when, during a game, he suffered a deep cut <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> that severed his brachial artery. He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result. Five months after the incident, the community raised money to send him to the Andy Murray Hockey School in Brandon, Manitoba. It was there that Fleury met Graham James, who was working as a scout for the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League (WHL). [...] James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size, and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{rushed for}} 1,314yards and scored 20 rushing touchdowns over his LSU career, {{and led the}} Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring in 1956 and 1957. [...] "With the ball <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> Jimmy Taylor was the best running back I've ever coached," [...] said Dietzel. [...] "He was just so versatile." [...] After {{spending}} {{the first half of}} his junior season learning the offense, Taylor scored 51 points in the team's final five games of 1956. As a senior in 1957, he shared the backfield with future Heisman Trophy winner Billy Cannon, a combination that accounted for over 1,500yards from scrimmage and 17 touchdowns that season. Against Texas Tech, due to the Red Raiders' focus on containing Taylor, Cannon had one of the most productive games of his career. The following week, Taylor scored three touchdowns in LSU's 20–13 upset of a [...] Georgia Tech team whose focus was on stopping Cannon. In his final college game, Taylor carried 17 times for 171yards and two touchdowns in a 35–6 victory over in-state rival Tulane. He was selected as a first-team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America, and earned first-team All-SEC honors from the Associated Press (AP) and United Press (UPI). After the season, he played in the Senior Bowl and was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E

2500|$|In London, Green {{chose to}} play for West Kent Football Club {{alongside}} A. G. Guillemard.

2500|$|Nyren {{described}} Harris' {{style and}} technique in some detail.
