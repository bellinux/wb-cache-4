5|$|Daisy Jugadai {{was born}} circa 1955 at Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory, {{daughter}} of artists Narputta Nangala and Timmy Jugadai Tjungurrayi. The ambiguity {{around the year}} of birth is in part because Indigenous people operate <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> conception of time from non-Indigenous Australians, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events.|$|E
5|$|Daughter of Angoona Nangala and Jim Tjungurrayi, Ngoia Pollard {{was born}} circa 1948 in Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory, west of Alice Springs.

Before looking for a mate, a male spider spins a small, flat web on a surface and ejaculates into it. He then loads the semen into syringe-like receptacles in both palps, and then searches for a female.|$|E

5|$|Originally The Tales of Beedle the Bard {{had only}} been {{produced}} in {{a limited number of}} seven handmade copies, all handwritten and illustrated by the author herself. The books were bound in brown morocco leather, and decorated with hand-chased silver ornaments and mounted semiprecious stones by silversmith and jeweller Hamilton & Inches of Edinburgh. Each of the silver pieces represents one of the five stories in the book. Rowling also asked that each of the seven copies be embellished <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> semiprecious stone.|$|E

5|$|Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} the year of Linda Syddick's birth. The Art Gallery of South Australia {{suggests}} 1941; Birnberg and Kreczmanski's biographical survey suggests circa 1937. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. She was born near Western Australia's Wilkinkarra, or Lake Mackay, northeast of Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia and northwest of Kintore, Northern Territory.|$|E
5|$|Susie Bootja Bootja {{was born}} circa 1935 near Kurtal, or Helena Spring, {{south-west}} of Balgo, Western Australia; {{the country is}} called Kaningarra in her own language, a name that appears {{as the title of}} one of her art works. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. While sources vary as to Susie's skin name (some indicating Napangarti, others Napaltjarri), the similar birth dates, locations, and work history indicate that all are referring to the one individual.|$|E

5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic. This group's structures were built <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> method {{from those in the}} Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing. The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow the contours of the natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling. In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{doubling}} of lane rate and increasing of data lanes from 3 to 4, raises the effective bandwidth to 48 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3). On using DSC, it {{has got a}} maximum compression of 3:1 and this effectively increases the bandwidth to 144 Gbit/s (i.e. 18 Gbit/s * 2 * 4/3 * 3). This much bandwidth {{can be used for}} sending up to 10K/60 Hz video in 4:4:4 format with 24-bit color (i.e. 4K/60Hz * 4 * 16/9). <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> chroma sub-sampling format (4:2:2 or 4:2:0) enables to use even higher refresh rates (e.g. 10K/120 Hz in 4:2:0 format) or higher color depths (e.g. 30/36/48-bit).|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E

5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; the wings can beat no {{faster than the}} rate at which nerves can send impulses to command the muscles to beat. All other living winged insects fly <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles which cause the thorax to vibrate; the wings can beat faster than {{the rate at which}} the muscles receive nerve impulses. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17â€“45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, together with the nation's first geological map, which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclureâ€™s geological map to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a geological map of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of the U.S., where Ami BouÃ© produced a geological structure map of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a geological map of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. There was a short description of the geologic map of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale geological maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic map of the U.S. in R.W. Raymondâ€™s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a geological map of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the Geological Magazine in 1873. Grayâ€™s geological map of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A geological map of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several geological maps of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a geological map of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the geological map of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S.|$|E

5|$|With {{help from}} its l'Cie {{soldiers}} and Class Zero, Rubrum destroys {{the forces of}} Concordia and Milites, uniting Orience under its flag. This triggers the arrival of Tempus Finis, with the Rursus Army emerging from the magical fortress Pandaemonium to wipe out Orience's population. Cid and Class Zero each travel to Pandaemonium: Cid attempts to become Agito and is transformed into the Rursus Arbiter by Gala, while Class Zero resolve to halt Tempus Finis. As Class Zero face the trials of the Arbiter, the Vermillion Bird Crystals offers them the chance to become l'Cie. Class Zero refuse the Crystal's offer and Rem is made a l'Cie in their place. Machina and Rem end up fighting each other in Pandaemonium: Rem is mortally wounded, and she and Machina turn to crystal. Severely weakened by the trials and demoralized at seeing Machina and Rem's condition, Class Zero are initially unable to defeat the Arbiter. Machina and Rem's spirits give them the strength they need to defeat the Arbiter and halt Tempus Finis. Fatally injured, Class Zero spend their final minutes imagining their possible post-war lives. They are found by Machina and Rem, who have returned to human form and, {{along with the rest}} of Orience, are allowed to remember the dead. In a post-credits sequence, it is said that the Crystal States fall into turmoil as the Crystals lose their powers. Machina and Rem unite Orience and rebuild the world, and Machina records Class Zero's history before dying with Rem at his side. A second playthrough reveals that Orience is trapped in a stable timeloop created by Arecia and Gala, the respective servants of the deities Pulse and Lindzei, as part of an experiment to find the gateway to the Unseen Realm. Competing with each other to open the gateway <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> method, both failed and reset the world for another attempt. By the events of Type-0, the experiment had been performed over six hundred million times.|$|E
