25|$|Inevitably, I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> {{read the}} scripts {{of a foreign}} country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I {{was at the time}} {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?" [...] In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.|$|E

500|$|Fossett {{said he did}} not {{participate}} in any of the [...] "interesting things" [...] he had done in college during his time in exchange-related activities: [...] "There was a period of time where I wasn't doing anything except working for a living. I became very frustrated with that and finally made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> start getting back into things." [...] He began to take six weeks a year off to spend time on sports and moved to Beaver Creek, Colorado in 1990. Fossett later sold most of his business interests, although he maintained an office in Chicago until 2006.|$|E
500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f I had made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina." [...] Historian James M. McPherson has concluded that: ...|$|E
500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan {{did not look up}} Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E

His salary was cut from $55,000 ($ today) a year to $21 ($ today) a month. He was not bitter and stated, [...] "I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> go when I was called. My country comes first." [...] In November, while serving as an anti-tank gunner, he was promoted to sergeant, but was honorably discharged on December 5 (the United States Congress released men aged 28 years and older from service), two days before Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.|$|E

2500|$|Crosby {{had lived}} for decades in such areas of Manhattan as Hell's Kitchen, the Bowery, and the Tenderloin. She {{was aware of the}} great needs of {{immigrants}} and the urban poor, and was passionate to help those around her through urban rescue missions and other compassionate ministry organizations. [...] "From the time I received my first check for my poems, I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> open my hand wide to those who needed assistance". Throughout her life, she was described as having [...] "a horror of wealth", never set prices for her speaking engagements, often refused honoraria, and [...] "what little she did accept she gave away almost as soon as she got it". She and her husband also organized concerts, with half the proceeds given to aid the poor. Throughout New York City, Crosby's sympathies for the poor were well-known, but consisted primarily of indirect involvement by giving contributions from the sale of her poems, and by writing and sending poems for special occasions for these missions to the dispossessed, as well as sporadic visits to those missions.|$|E
2500|$|Hirono's {{father was}} a {{compulsive}} gambler and alcoholic who would pawn his wife's possessions for gambling money. Treated [...] "like a slave," [...] by her in-laws, Hirono said, in 1951 Laura left her abusive marriage. The deciding moment for her had come after Akira, who had returned to Hawaii after the war, had sent some money for a school uniform for Laura's youngest son Wayne, but her husband had taken it to buy an overcoat. As Laura later recounted, [...] "My brother sent {{money to buy a}} school uniform for my son. My husband took the money, went to town and never came back home. It was getting closer to the start of school, so I went to look for him. I found out he had ordered an overcoat for himself with the money. He didn't need an overcoat in the spring. That's when I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> leave." [...] After telling her in-laws she would be taking her elder son and Hirono to school in her hometown, Laura left the house, never to return. Selling her clothes for the rail fare, she returned to her parents' house. Laura said, [...] "My husband never came around once; my parents were supportive and took all of us in. My mother gave us money. I guess it all boils down to love." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{crash was}} a {{significant}} turning point, as he explained to Billboard in 2006: [...] "...when I had that wreck I made up my mind, it put the fear of God in me. [...] No more smoking, no more drinking. [...] I didn't have to have no help, I made <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> quit. [...] I don't crave it." [...] After the accident, Jones went on to release The Gospel Collection in 2003, which Billy Sherrill came out of retirement to produce. [...] He appeared at a televised Johnny Cash Memorial Concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas in 2003, singing [...] "Big River" [...] with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. [...] In 2008, Jones received the Kennedy Center Honor along with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who, Barbra Streisand, Morgan Freeman and Twyla Tharp. [...] President George W.
