The phases synthesized {{in the films}} changed from τ phase to κ phase through the mixture phase of them with increase of x. Saturation magnetization of the films for each single phase increased with increase of x <b>until</b> <b>mixture</b> phase influenced and that of κ phase depends strongly on the lattice constant...|$|E
40|$|The aimed of this {{research}} was to know the effectiveness of mixing herbicides with active ingredient atrazin and mesotrion in controlling weeds and know the mixture characteristic. This research conducted in the plastic garden house private in Natar, South Lampung and in the Weeds laboratory of Agriculture faculty, Lampung University from June until July 2013. This Research arranged in a Randomized Completely Design (RCD). Treatment consists of three types of herbicides with six level of dosage active ingredient, namely of single herbicides is atrazin 500 g l- 1 (0, 76, 152, 304, 608, and 1. 215 ha g- 1), mesotrion 50 g l- 1 (0, 11, 22, 43, 86, and 172 g ha- 1), and mixed herbicides from atrazin 500 g l- 1 + mesotrion 50 g l- 1 (0, 28, 56, 112, 225, and 450 g ha- 1). The target weed were a type of broadleaves (Asystasia gangetica), a type of grasses (Paspalum conjugatum), and a type of sedges (Cyperus kyllingia). Homogenity tested using Bartlet and aditivity tested using Tukey, data analyzed by Analisis of Variance and different median values tested with Least Significant Difference (LSD) level 5 %. Results showed that an active ingredient mixture of atrazin 500 g L- 1 + mesotrion 50 g L- 1 has LD 50 expectation value of 51, 48 g ha- 1 and LD 50 treatment of 257, 48 g ha- 1 with the co-toxicity value was 0. 2 (co-toxicity < 1) <b>until</b> <b>mixture</b> was antagonist...|$|E

This garnish is served with meat such as veal, poultry and sometimes eggs.|$|R
5000|$|Wheat paste (also {{known as}} flour paste, or simply paste) is a gel or liquid {{adhesive}} made from wheat flour or starch and water. It {{has been used}} since antiquity for various arts and crafts such as book binding, découpage, collage, papier-mâché, and adhering paper posters and notices to walls. Closely resembling wallpaper paste, a crude wheat flour paste {{can be made by}} mixing roughly equal portions of flour and water and heating <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> thickens.|$|R
50|$|Pottage was {{typically}} boiled {{for several hours}} <b>until</b> the entire <b>mixture</b> took on a homogeneous texture and flavour; this was intended to break down complex starches and to ensure the food was safe for consumption. It was often served, when possible, with bread.|$|R
50|$|Cornish {{fairings}} are {{sweet and}} spicy ginger biscuits, made with standard biscuit ingredients such as flour, caster sugar and butter, together with mixed spice, ginger, cinnamon and golden syrup. They are roughly circular and brittle similar to gingerbread. They {{are created by}} mixing the dry ingredients with butter, <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> resembles bread crumbs, then adding the sugar and syrup before forming the biscuits and baking high in the oven, followed by a period {{at the bottom of}} the oven.|$|R
5000|$|George Berkeley {{suggested}} that tar from pine or fir be stirred {{for three or}} four minutes with an equal quantity of water and the mixture allowed to stand for 48 hours. At this time, the separated water is drawn off to be drunk, at the rate of one half-pint night and morning [...] "on an empty stomach". Fresh water is added to the unused portion and again stirred to provide more of the preparation, <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> becomes too weak.|$|R
50|$|Batch gas {{blending}} {{requires the}} appropriate {{amounts of the}} constituent gases to be measured and mixed together <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> is homogenous. The amounts {{are based on the}} mole (or molar) fractions, but measured either by volume or by mass. Volume measurement may be done indirectly by partial pressure, as the gases are often sequentially decanted into the same container for mixing, and therefore occupy the same volume. Weight measurement is generally used as a proxy for mass measurement as acceleration can usually be considered constant.|$|R
50|$|The {{chlorine}} in the perchlorate anion is {{a closed}} shell atom and is well {{protected by the}} four oxygens. Hence, perchlorate reacts sluggishly. Most perchlorate compounds, especially salts of electropositive metals such as sodium perchlorate or potassium perchlorate do not oxidize organic compounds <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> is heated. This property is useful in many applications, such as flares, where ignition is required to initiate a reaction. Ammonium perchlorate is however different, being unstable even at room temperature. The PEPCON disaster destroyed a production plant for ammonium perchlorate.|$|R
30|$|EuD 4 TEA was {{synthesized}} {{using the}} method described in [16]. The synthesis began by dissolving 4 [*]mmol of europium nitrate hydrate in 25 [*]mL of heated pure anhydrous ethanol. To this hot solution, 13 [*]mmol of 1, 3 -diphenyl- 1, 3 -propanedione also known as dibenzoylmethane (DBM) was added, followed {{by the addition of}} 14 [*]mmol of triethylamine (TEA). The solution was heated <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> was clear, and then kept aside to cool slowly overnight at ambient temperature. The EuD 4 TEA crystals that formed were collected under suction [16].|$|R
50|$|Barfi, barfee, or burfi is a dense milk based sweet {{confectionery}} {{from the}} Indian subcontinent, {{a type of}} mithai. Originally from India, the name is a derivative of the word barf, which means snow. A few of the famous varieties of barfi include besan barfi (made with gram flour), kaaju barfi (made with cashews), pista barfi (made with ground pistachios), and sing barfi (made with peanuts). The main ingredients of plain barfis include condensed milk and sugar. The ingredients are cooked in a vessel <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> solidifies.|$|R
50|$|The antiquity of this {{speciality}} is unknown, {{although it}} was probably well-established {{before the beginning of}} the nineteenth century when Vittorio di Sant’Albino described it in his Piedmontese-Italian dictionary. The original motivation was the avoidance of waste: pieces of stale, hard and/or mouldy cheese were mixed with homemade grappa (the distillate of the pomace remaining from winemaking) plus, perhaps, butter and spices, and left to ferment in an earthenware container <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> acquired a creamy texture. At this point it was covered and could be treated as a preserve.|$|R
50|$|On a {{high heat}} a pot is placed and then boiling water is added. Slowly, handfuls of wholemeal wheat are added and then are mixed quickly {{with a large}} wooden spoon so that clumps do not form. The process is {{repeated}} <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> is very thick. Traditionally the cook lowers the pot to the floor where they wrap their flip-flops around the hot pot and start vigorously mixing the dough. Finally, using bare oiled hands the hot, steaming dough is shaped by the cook and usually placed in a wide, wooden bowl.|$|R
50|$|Made of Patna Rice (soaked overnight, {{washed and}} blended to a smooth paste), coconut - semi-firm (grated), coconut palm syrup, caster sugar, banana leaf by cooking over a {{moderate}} heat the grated coconut, palm sugar and caster sugar <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> has thickened. Removed {{from heat and}} allowed cooling and added in the blended rice and kneaded thoroughly and combined all the ingredients well. Divided the mixture into eight portions and placed each portion on a banana leaf and wrapped entirely to seal and wrapped a second banana leaf around it and secured well.|$|R
5000|$|Andalusian gachas, gachas andaluzas, are {{traditionally}} made of wheat flour. The {{traditional way of}} cooking them consists in frying garlic slices in olive oil until they are golden. Then the flour is added by sprinkling it over the hot oil {{with one hand and}} mixing well with the spoon <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> is slightly roasted. Water is added then, pouring it very slowly, while stirring the mixture all the while without interrupting the bubbling. Salt and water are added to taste and desired consistency, the gachas being ready when they [...] "smell cooked".|$|R
50|$|Monocalcium {{aluminate}} {{is formed}} when the appropriate proportions of calcium carbonate and aluminium oxide are heated together <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> melts. It melts incongruently at 1390 °C. The crystal is monoclinic and pseudohexagonal, and has density 2945 kg.m−3. In calcium aluminate cements, it exists as a solid solution {{in which the}} amount of minor elements depends upon the bulk composition of the cement. A typical composition is Ca0.93Al1.94Fe0.11Si0.02O4. It reacts rapidly with water, forming the metastable hydrate CaO·Al2O3·10H2O, or a mixture of 2CaO·Al2O3·8H2O, 3CaO·Al2O3·6H2O and Al(OH)3 gel. These reactions form {{the first stage of}} strength development in calcium aluminate cements.|$|R
50|$|Shortcake is {{typically}} made with flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, salt, butter, milk or cream, and sometimes eggs. The dry ingredients are blended, {{and then the}} butter is cut in <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> resembles cornmeal. The liquid ingredients are then mixed in just until moistened, resulting in a shortened dough. The dough is then dropped in spoonfuls onto a baking sheet, rolled and cut like baking powder biscuits, or poured into a cake pan, depending on how wet the dough is and the baker's preferences. Then it is baked at a relatively high temperature until set.|$|R
5000|$|... "San Stè" [...] is a {{traditional}} cheese made in this town. This cheese {{is a far cry}} from the mass-produced confections found in the grocery store. It is produced by a small collection of families, and made in the identical fashion for centuries. [...] The cheese itself is produced from unpasteurized bovine whole milk principally from the Bruno-alpina or Cabannina cattle races, coagulated with veal rennet, either in paste or powder form, at about 35 C, mixing for 35 minutes, breaking apart large curds <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> is curdled to the size of rice. Salt is also added to the curd.|$|R
5000|$|Eggs are sieved, and whisked {{with water}} <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> are {{completely}} blended in a cream-like consistency. Sometimes, kelp and/or anchovy broth {{is used in}} place of water for a richer flavor. Optional ingredients include mushrooms, peas, onions, Korean zucchini, carrots, and other vegetables for their own twist on the dish. The dish is then seasoned with saeu-jeot (salted shrimp), myeongnan-jeot (salted pollock roe), or salt, and optionally ground black pepper. Before served, it is topped with chopped scallions or crown daisy greens, gochutgaru (chili flakes) or sil-gochu (shredded dry red chili), and toasted sesame seeds.|$|R
