5|$|Route 139 is {{essentially}} three distinct, but connected highways: the <b>upper</b> <b>level,</b> the lower level, and the Holland Tunnel approach (the Interstate78 concurrency). NJDOT officially charts the lower and upper levels as independent highways, {{with the lower}} level considered Route139 with a notation that the highway then coincides with I-78, and the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> considered Route139U.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} of the relay tracks is evidence of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> was to be extended eastward while the lower level tracks were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> are longer than the lower level tracks and the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks.|$|E

5|$|At {{the north}} (Manhattan- and Queens-bound) {{end of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>level,</b> the Culver Line local tracks diverge, {{splitting}} into four tracks. The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to the lower level, merges with the innermost, express tracks located on the lower level, and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, stays on the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. The lower level tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{initially}} predicted {{wind shear}} from an <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days. However, the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear, {{and the system}} intensified into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing. The convection gradually consolidated over the system, and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60mph (95km/h) while passing 50miles (80km) north of the northern Leeward Islands. The structure of Chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical, and an <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> eye feature developed early on August 2. Outflow improved in all quadrants, as well, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) shortly thereafter while located 120miles (195km) east of St. Thomas. Despite initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west-northwestward, <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> shear dissipated the well-defined inner core of the storm, and Chris started to weaken.|$|E

5|$|Squall lines, or solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> divergence, leading to hail and high winds. When significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front {{in the presence of a}} strong <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> jet stream, tornado formation is possible. Although tornadoes can form anywhere on Earth, the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the United States, because downsloped winds off the north-south oriented Rocky Mountains, which can form a dryline, aid their development at any strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{adventure}} takes place in two locations: the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> fortress of the hill giants' lair, and the dungeon level beneath it. In the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> there are halls, barracks and common rooms. These rooms house Chief Nosnra and other hill giants, ogres, and servants. The dungeon level consists of slave quarters, torture chambers, and caverns. These house troglodytes, bugbears, and carrion crawlers. The majority of the treasure can be found by searching the dungeons. The chief's treasure room contains {{a map of the}} glacial rift from Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and a magic chain that automatically transports the party there.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the northwest, and intensified into Tropical Storm Grace six hours after forming. Despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained very broad, with Reconnaissance Aircraft having difficulty pinpointing the center. In addition, an <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> low located over Brownsville, Texas produced shear over the western portion of the system, which limited outflow to the east side. Forecasters predicted the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> low to weaken, allowing {{for the possibility of}} Grace to intensify to a 65mph (100km/h) tropical storm over warm waters. However, the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system. A new center of circulation reformed 115miles (185km) north of the original center, and made landfall near San Luis Pass on the southwestern portion of Galveston Island on August 31 as a minimal tropical storm. Grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land, and after turning northeastward into Oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front.|$|E

5|$|East of {{this station}} on the IND side are {{turnouts}} for a connection to Phase 3 of the Second Avenue Subway, clearly visible from a moving train, which would allow future service from Queens towards Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. Also to the east, the eastbound track of the IND line rises to the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> of the tunnel, as both IND tracks are located on the <b>upper</b> <b>level</b> of 63rd Street Tunnel for the trip under the East River. The two tracks on the lower level of that tunnel are being connected to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) via the East Side Access project. The project will bring trains from the LIRR's Main Line to Grand Central Terminal, but, as of December 2016, the lower level is currently unused.|$|E

40|$|The term quantum beats {{refers to}} a superposed oscillatory {{behavior}} in the light intensity emitted by some suddenly excited atomic systems in their subsequent decay. In this paper we reinvestigate quantum beats for systems where two <b>upper</b> <b>levels</b> may decay to a common ground state by using the recently developed approach of quantum jumps. The treatment {{turns out to be}} very simple and intuitive. It gives explicit expressions for the time-dependent intensity of the radiating system and allows us to exhibit several phenomena which so far seem to have been overlooked. We show that quantum beats may also occur if only one of the <b>upper</b> <b>levels</b> is initially excited, a superposition is not needed. A possible experimental setup for the verification of this effect is proposed. It is also shown that in some cases the beat frequency may differ considerably from the separation ffi ! of the <b>upper</b> <b>levels.</b> For equal Einstein coefficients of the <b>upper</b> <b>levels</b> the beats are shown to be unexpectedly absent f [...] ...|$|R
