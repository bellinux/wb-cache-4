40|$|A new {{neural network}} {{approach}} is described {{for the task}} of pole-balancing, considered a benchmark learning control problem. This approach combines Barto, Sutton, and Anderson's [1] Associative Search Element (ASE) with a Neuro-Resistive Grid (NRG) [2] acting as Adaptive Critic Element (ACE). The novel feature in NRG is that it provides evaluation of a state based on propagation of the failure information to the neighbours in the grid. NRG is updated only on a failure and provides ASE with a continuous internal reinforcement signal by comparing {{the value of the}} present state to the previous state. The resulting system learns more rapidly and with fewer computations than that of Barto et al [1]. To establish a <b>uniform</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> comparison of algorithms for pole balancing, both the systems are simulated using benchmark parameters and tests specified in [3].
