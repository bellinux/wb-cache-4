50|$|Seisin is now {{confined}} to {{possession of the}} freehold, though at one time {{it appears to have}} been used for simple possession without regard to the estate of the possessor. Its importance is considerably less than it was at one time, owing to the old form of conveyance by feoffment with livery <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> having been superseded by a deed of grant, and the old rule of descent from the person last seised having been abolished in favour of descent from the purchaser. Lord Denning controversially supported the abolition of the concept <b>of</b> <b>seisin,</b> however the common law has since decided to maintain the concept <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b> At one time the right of the wife to dower and of the husband to an estate by curtesy depended upon the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b> The Dower Act (1833-1834), however, rendered the fact <b>of</b> the <b>seisin</b> <b>of</b> the husband of no importance, and the Married Women's Property Act 1882 practically abolished the old law of curtesy.|$|R

5000|$|The lease {{and release}} was:"developed as another {{strategy}} to avoid public transfer <b>of</b> <b>seisin,</b> {{in response to the}} limitations imposed by the Statute of Enrolments. Since uses (future leases in land) had been limited by the Statute of Uses (and remain subject to disincentives in many jurisdictions), another instrument had to be found. That instrument was the lease for a year (lease for possession) followed on the following day by a release of the property, thus avoiding livery <b>of</b> <b>seisin.</b> The instrument thus consists of two parts: (i) a lease for one year on one day; (ii) a release on the following day. In the lease for a year, the consideration was nominal (usually 5s.) and the term of the lease one year. The release was executed the day after the lease, releasing the property to the 'lessee' in perpetuity; the full purchase price (consideration) is recited in the release; the release recites mentions the lease of the previous day; the release is executed 'according to the statute for converting uses into possession' (the Statute of Uses)." ...|$|R

However, if the heir was underage (under 21 for a male heir, under 14 for an heiress) they would be subject to a feudal wardship where the custody of their lands and the right to arrange their marriage passed to the monarch, until they came of age. The wardship and marriage was not usually kept in Crown hands, but was sold, often simply to the highest bidder, unless outbid by the next of kin.|$|R

5000|$|Livery <b>of</b> <b>seisin</b> is an archaic legal {{conveyancing}} ceremony, formerly {{practiced in}} feudal England {{and in other}} countries following English common law, used to convey holdings in property. The term [...] "livery" [...] is related to, if not synonymous with, the word [...] "delivery" [...] as used in modern contract law. The common law in those jurisdictions once provided that a valid conveyance of a feudal tenure in land required the physical transfer by the transferor to the transferee, {{in the presence of}} witnesses, of a piece of the ground itself, in the literal sense of a hand-to-hand passing of an amount of soil, a twig, key, or other symbol.|$|R
