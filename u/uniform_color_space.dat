This work {{became the basis for}} the CIE u,v color difference diagram in 1960, slightly modified into the 1976 CIELUV color difference space. In 1939 he was instrumental in developing the NBS color difference formula. When in 1947 at the suggestion of the U.S. National Research Council the Optical Society of America (OSA) undertook to develop a perceptually <b>uniform</b> <b>color</b> <b>space</b> Judd became its chairman and remained in that position until 1968, when D.

50|$|However, {{there are}} some {{limitations}} to the Munsell Color System. While it is handy to have a system with visual uniformly <b>spaced</b> <b>colors,</b> the <b>space</b> is not continuous, meaning {{that it has a}} discrete number of samples. Also, the <b>spacing</b> between the <b>colors</b> are very large, and because of this it is difficult to measure thresholds using the system, such as the just noticeable difference. These limitations inspired the CIE to develop a <b>uniform,</b> continuous <b>color</b> <b>space</b> for characterizing <b>color</b> differences.

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} visual coding have been {{successfully}} predicted by starting from the statistics of natural scenes and then asking how the stimulus could be efficiently represented. We started from the representation of <b>color</b> char-acterized by <b>uniform</b> <b>color</b> <b>spaces,</b> and then asked what type of color environment they implied. These spaces are designed to represent equal perceptual differences in color discrimination or appearance by equal distances in the space. The relative sensitivity to different axes within the space might therefore reflect the gamut of colors in natural scenes. To examine this, we projected perceptually uniform distributions within the Munsell, CIE Luv or CIE Lab spaces into cone-opponent space. All were elongated along a bluish-yellowish axis reflecting covarying signals along the L–M and S–LM cardinal axes, a pattern typical (though not identical) to many natural environments. In turn, color distributions from environments were more uniform when projected into the CIE Lab perceptual space than when represented in a normalized cone-opponent space. These analyses suggest the bluish-yellowish bias in environmental colors might {{be an important factor}} shaping chromatic sensi-tivity, and also suggest that perceptually <b>uniform</b> <b>color</b> metrics could be derived from natural scene statistics and potentially tailored to specific environments. © 2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 330. 1690, 330. 1720, 330. 5020, 330. 7310. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Starting with {{a sample}} of 59 colored tiles of {{non-uniform}} color differences, the OSA asked 72 observers to judge color differences between the different sample tiles.

50|$|Instead {{of using}} RGB, LogLuv uses the {{logarithm}} of the luminance and the CIELUV (u’, v’) chromaticity coordinates {{in order to}} provide a perceptually <b>uniform</b> <b>color</b> <b>space.</b> LogLuv allocates 8 bits for each of the u’ and v’ coordinates, which allows to encode the full visible gamut with imperceptible step sizes. In order to provide the required high dynamic range with imperceptible luminance steps, LogLuv uses 16 bits to encode a fixed-point base 2 logarithm of the luminance, which allows an EV range of nearly 128 stops. The space occupied by one pixel is thus 32 bits (L16 + U8 + V8), marginally bigger than a standard 8 bit RGB-image.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, the CIE set out {{to replace}} the many existing, {{incompatible}} color difference models by a new, universal model for color difference.

Though they succeeded only partially, they thereby created the CIELAB (“L*a*b*”) color space which had all the necessary features to become the first color appearance model. While CIELAB is a very rudimentary color appearance model, {{it is one of the}} most widely used because it has become one of the building blocks of color management with ICC profiles.

40|$|Color can {{increase}} the information provided by an image in addition to enhancing its aesthetic value. As a result, many products and services have evolved from a monochrome to a color environment {{during the past several}} decades. Examples include photography and motion pictures, television and video display devices, copying systems, facsimile, and printed products such as newspapers, magazines, and brochures. The areas of quantization, halftoning, gamut mismatch compensation, and data compression have been investigated extensively for monochrome imagery. The ongoing evolution from monochrome to color of many products and services has focused new interest on these research areas as applied to a multidimensional or color environment. Often these algorithms consider the color image as a separable collection of monochrome images processing each in an independent and identical manner. This approach disregards the color sensitivity of the human viewer as well as the characteristics of the color gamut for real images. In this thesis, we investigate the areas of quantization, halftoning, gamut mismatch compensation, and data compression for color imagery processed to near original image quality. Our techniques incorporate a colorimetric approach and <b>uniform</b> <b>color</b> <b>spaces</b> to account for the human viewers color sensitivity. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Automatic {{blood vessel}} {{segmentation}} {{is an important}} issue for assessing retinal abnormality and diagnosis of many diseases. A new supervised method for blood vessel detection and segmentation in digital retinal images is based on Neural networks. Neural network (NN) scheme is meant for pixel classification and computes a 7 -D vector composed of gray-level and moment invariants-based features for pixel representation. The method was evaluated on the publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases, widely used for this purpose, since they contain retinal images where the vascular structure has been precisely marked by experts. Blood vessel segmentation is performed through various stages: Preprocessing, Feature extraction, Classification and Post processing. The segmentation of vessels is difficult by huge variations in local contrast, particularly in case of the minor vessels. In this paper, we propose a new method of texture based vessel segmentation to overcome this problem. We use Gaussian and L*a*b * perceptually <b>uniform</b> <b>color</b> <b>spaces</b> with original RGB for texture feature extraction on retinal images. A bank of Gabor energy filters are used to analyze the texture features from which a feature vector is constructed for each pixel. The fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is used to classify the feature vectors into vessel or non-vessel based on the texture properties. From the FCM clustering output we attain the final output segmented image after a post processing step.
