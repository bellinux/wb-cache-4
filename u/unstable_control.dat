500|$|Analysis of the {{construction}} of tower houses has focused on two key driving forces. The first is that {{the construction}} of these castles appears to have been linked to periods of instability and insecurity in the areas concerned. In Scotland James IV's forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1494 led to an immediate burst of castle building across the region and, over the longer term, an increased degree of clan warfare, while the subsequent wars with England in the 1540s added to the level of insecurity over the rest of the century. Irish tower houses were built {{from the end of the}} 14th century onward as the countryside disintegrated into the <b>unstable</b> <b>control</b> of a large number of small lordships and Henry VI promoted their construction with financial rewards in a bid to improve security. English tower houses were built along the frontier with Scotland in a dangerous and insecure period. Secondly, and paradoxically, appears to have been the periods of relative prosperity. Contemporary historian William Camden observed of the northern English and the Scots, [...] "there is not a man amongst them of a better sort that hath not his little tower or pile", and many tower houses seem to have been built as much as status symbols as defensive structures. Along the English-Scottish borders the construction pattern follows the relative prosperity of the different side: the English lords built tower houses primarily in the early 15th century, when northern England was particularly prosperous, while their Scottish equivalents built them in late 15th and early 16th centuries, boom periods in the economy of Scotland. In Ireland the growth of tower houses during the 15th century mirrors the rise of cattle herding and the resulting wealth that this brought to many of the lesser lords in Ireland.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} the possible effects of an unstable ventilation system and its influence on energy use and thermal comfort. The report also explores how qualified personal working with HVAC view and handles system control. In order to meet the requirements in energy efficiency and a comfortable indoor climate control regulation is a prerequisite. With optimized increased complexity of the climate systems, it becomes more challenging to control the system and the risk of <b>unstable</b> <b>control</b> increases. No previous studies about what affect an unstable system can have on energy use and thermal comfort have been found. The report is based on several tests were the controlling variable has been increased until the system becomes unstable. Two different types of unstable systems have been investigated. During the first trials the flow was unstable while the temperature where constant and during the second trials the temperature was unstable but the flow constant. The results indicate that the energy use, both for the fans and the air heater, is drastically increased when the system is unstable. The results on the affects in thermal comfort showed no noticeable differences during the stable and unstable condition under the tests. This indicates that a system can be unstable without anybody noticing it but will most likely increase the energy. Qualified people believe that <b>unstable</b> <b>control</b> is quite common in buildings. One possible consequence of <b>unstable</b> <b>control</b> is shortened lifespan for components in the system. The knowledge about control theory among HVAC workers in Sweden is generally assessed as low. The lack of willingness among the property owners to invest in improvements in ventilation system varies and often depends on the length they intend to keep the building. Cost aspects and lack of knowledge among the property owners results in that many buildings HVAC system is not up to date...|$|E

Bunse-GerstnerModel order reduction for discrete <b>unstable</b> <b>control</b> systems using a balanced truncation approach C. Boess ∗, N. K. Nichols ∗ and A. Bunse-Gerstner † Mathematical modeling of problems occurring in natural and engineering sciences {{often results in}} a very large dynamical system. Efficient techniques for model order reduction are required, therefore, to reduce {{the complexity of the}} system. Almost all such techniques require the dynamical system to be asymptotically stable. Balanced truncation is a well-known and approved model reduction method. There already exists a simple approach for applying this technique to unstable systems, but it does not capture the full behavior of the system successfully. In this paper, we propose a new model reduction method based on α-bounded balanced truncation, which can be applied to unstable systems independently of the number of unstable poles. We establish that this new method computes a low order approximation to the full order system such that the corresponding error system is close to being optimal with respect to a well-defined norm for unstable systems. Moreover, we prove a global error bound for the error system. In numerical experiments with unstable test models we compare the new α-bounded balanced truncation method with the standard extension of balanced truncation for unstable systems. The results show the superior performance of the α-bounded method...|$|E

Assessment of human operator control ability is determined by a statistically based decision strategy. The operator is allowed several chances to exceed a preset pass criterion. Procedures are described for setting the pass criterion based on individual ability and a desired unimpaired failure rate.

The chart is in good accord with almost all of the existing results of pilot ratings.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the robustness properties of existing adaptive control algorithms to unmodeled plant high-frequency dynamics and unmeasurable output disturbances. It is demonstrated that there exist two infinite-gain operators in the nonlinear dynamic system which determines the time-evolution of output and parameter errors. The pragmatic {{implications of the}} existence of such infinite-gain operators is that: (1) sinusoidal reference inputs at specific frequencies and/or (2) sinusoidal output disturbances at any frequency (including dc), can cause the loop gain to increase without bound, thereby exciting the unmodeled high-frequency dynamics, and yielding an <b>unstable</b> <b>control</b> system. Hence, it is concluded that existing adaptive control algorithms as they are presented in the literature referenced in this paper, cannot be used with confidence in practical designs where the plant contains unmodeled dynamics because instability is likely to result.
