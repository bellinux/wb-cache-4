40|$|Ultra {{narrow-band}} {{filters and}} the use of two loops in a cascade configuration dominate current clock conditioners based on phase-locked-loop (PLL) schemes. Since a PLL exhibits a low-pass transfer function with respect to the reference clock, the noise performance at very close-to-carrier offset frequencies is still determined by the input signal. Although better cleaning can be achieved with extremely narrow loops, an ultra low cut-off frequency could not be selected since the stability of the configuration deteriorates as the filter bandwidth is reduced. This fact suggests that a full-spectrum clock conditioning is not possible using traditional PLL architectures, and an alternative scheme is necessary to attenuate the very-close-to-carrier phase noise (PN). In addition, ultra-narrow loop filters can compromise on-chip integration because of the large size capacitors needed when chosen as passive. Input signal attenuation with relaxed bandwidth requirements becomes the main aspect that a comprehensive clock cleaner must address to effectively regenerate a reference signal. This dissertation describes the Band-Reject Nested-PLL (BRN-PLL) scheme, a modified PLL-based architecture that provides an effective signal cleaning procedure by introducing a notch in the input transfer function through inner and outer loops and a high-pass filter (HPF). This modified response attenuates the reference-signal PN and reduces the size of the loop-filter capacitors substantially. Ultra narrow loops are no longer required because the notch size is related to the system bandwidth. The associated transfer function for the constitutive blocks (phase detectors and local oscillators) show that the output close-to-carrier and far-from-carrier PN sections are mainly dominated by the noise from the inner-PLL phase detector (PD) and local oscillator (LO) located in the outer loop, respectively. The inner-PLL PD transfer function maintains a low-pass characteristic with a passband gain inversely proportional to the PD gain becoming the main contribution around the carrier signal. On the other hand, the PN around the transition frequency is determined mainly by the reference and the inner-PLL LO. Their noise contributions to the output will depend on the associated passband local maxima, which is located at the BRN-PLL transition frequency. Hence, in this region, the inner-PLL LO is selected so that its effect can be held below that of the outer-PLL PD. The BRN-PLL can use a high-Q MEMS-based VCO to further improve the transition region of the output PN profile and an LC-VCO as outer-PLL LO to reduce the noise floor of the output signal. In particular, two tuning mechanisms are explored for the MEMS-VCO: series tuning <b>using</b> <b>varactors</b> <b>and</b> phase shifting of a resonator operating in nonlinear regime. Both schemes are implemented to generate a tunable oscillator with no PN-performance degradation.

Radiation cancer therapy {{is one of}} the most important methods of cancer treatment. The goal of radiation therapy is to apply maximum amount of dose to the tumor region while applying minimum amount of dose to the normal tissues. Being able to measure radiation dose accurately is critical for radiation therapy because it will make sure the radiation is properly delivered to the tumor region as planned. In this dissertation, the development of a passive wireless radiation dosimeter for radiation cancer therapy based on fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology was presented through the following steps. In Chapter 1, the radiation cancer therapy and existing dosimetry technology was introduced. Because of the high demand of modern radiation therapy and the deficiency of existing dosimetry. An ultra-small, passive radiation dosimeter will greatly help the dose verification in today’s radiation therapy. In Chapter 2, the building block of proposed dosimeter technology, FDSOI technology, was introduced and cutting edge development of FDSOI dosimeter was summarized. In Chapter 3, the radiation response of FDSOI metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) over a wide range of therapeutic X-ray beam energies, angles, dose ranges and applied substrate voltages were characterized. The charge collection efficiency was calculated from both technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulation and an analytical model to evaluate the radiation effect quantitatively. Based upon the experimental results, the design of passive wireless sensors <b>using</b> FDSOI <b>varactors</b> was proposed. In Chapter 4, the fabrication process of FDSOI varactors was developed at University of Minnesota. Capacitance vs. voltage (CV), current vs. voltage (IV), and TCAD modeling were used to fully understand the device characterization. The capacitance based sensing of Cobalt- 60 (Co- 60) gamma radiation was demonstrated <b>using</b> FDSOI <b>varactors.</b> An analytical model was developed to further understand the device response under irradiation. Based on the analytical model, the optimal working condition at different frequencies was discussed and a guide line of improving the device sensitivity was provided. TCAD simulation was also conducted to optimize the design space of FDSOI varactors for wireless sensing. In Chapter 5. 120 -finger varactors with 0 V threshold voltage were fabricated using electron beam lithography with small device variability. An impedance measurement setup was built in clinical environment. Completely passive wireless radiation sensing was demonstrated <b>using</b> FDSOI <b>varactor</b> <b>and</b> the device showed good linearity of resonant frequency change under radiation.

The dissertation first presents millimeter-wave and THz double bow-tie slot antennas on a synthesized elliptical silicon lens. Two different antennas {{are designed to}} cover 0. 1 − 0. 3 THz and 0. 2 − 0. 6 THz, respectively. The double bow-tie slot antenna results in a wide impedance bandwidth and 78 - 97 % Gaussian coupling efficiency over a 3 : 1 frequency range. A wideband CPW low-pass filter is designed using slow-wave techniques, and the measured filter response shows an S 21 60 dB at 200 GHz in a 100 Hz bandwidth for a transmit and receive system based on 12 mm lenses and spaced 60 cm from each other. Frequency-selective surfaces at 150 and 200 GHz are tested by the proposed design and their measured results agree with the simulations. Application areas are low-cost scalar network analyzers for wideband quasi-optical 100 GHz to 1 THz measurements. In chapter 4, the dissertation presents a tunable dual-feed, dual-band, quadruple-pole antenna for carrier aggregation and mobile communication systems. The dual-feed PIFA (planar inverted F-antenna) has four operating frequencies which are independently tunable within the long-term evolution frequency range (LTE) from 0. 7 to 2. 7 GHz.

The antenna is well matched at both feeds (S 11, S 22 50 % using high Q devices such as RF-MEMS (Q > 200). A new concept to achieve tunable wideband performance is demonstrated using an extra shunt variable capacitor. In chapter 5, 0. 7 − 1 GHz and 1. 7 − 2. 4 GHz tunable 4 -pole bandpass filters with bandwidth control and improved stopband rejection <b>using</b> RF-MEMS capacitors <b>and</b> <b>varactor</b> diodes have been demonstrated. The MEMS capacitors are fabricated and fully packaged using a 0. 18 μm CMOS standard process with integrated high voltage drivers and SPI/RFFE control logic and with reliability in the billions of cycles.

There are also recent interests in extending the applications to other RF/microwave front-end building blocks including LNAs, VCOs, and mixers. In order to develope complete GaN-based RFIC and MMIC, HEMTs as well as passive components are needed to integrate together with fully compatible fabrication process. In addition, high performance RFIC and MMIC can only be realized with high performance HEMTs and passive components with high Quality-factor (Q-factor). Passive components including <b>varactors</b> (voltage-controlled capacitor) <b>and</b> air-bridged spiral inductors were fabricated on AlGaN/GaN system with HEMT compatible fabrication process. Varactor, with its tunable capacitance, is essential for tunable circuits such as VCOs and multipliers. It is important to maintain high Q-factor within a wide voltage-controlled tuning range for varactors to be useful in RF/microwave circuits. For example, a high efficiency VCO with low phase noise requires a high quality LC-tank, in which, both the <b>varactor</b> <b>and</b> inductor need to possess high Q-factor. Several methods were utilized to boost up the Q-factor of varactor include Optimization made in Device Structure (Single and Double Channel HEMT structures), Physical Design and Fabrication Process. Different types of varactors were fabricated on AlGaN/GaN system for the comparison of Q-factors. Spiral inductor is a common type inductance component used in RFIC and MMIC. Air-bridged spiral inductors were fabricated on AlGaN/GaN system and bare sapphire with high Q-factors achieved. There were totally four types of pillar structures made to support the air suspended spiral inductors. With different types of pillar structures, trade-offs are made in Q-factors, reliabilities and mechanical supports. The fabrication of <b>varactor</b> <b>and</b> air-bridged spiral inductor were fully compatible with AlGaN/GaN HEMT process, allowing easy integration with HEMT circuits without additional fabrication steps. The fabricated <b>varactors</b> <b>and</b> air-bridged spiral inductors {{can be used for}} RFIC and MMIC applications...|$|R
