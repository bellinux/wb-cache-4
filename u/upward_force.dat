5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E

To restore the insect to its original vertical position, the average <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> during the downward stroke, Fav, must be equal to twice the weight of the insect.

25|$|The above example {{can be used}} {{to explain}} why the Eötvös effect starts {{diminishing}} when an object is travelling westward as its tangential speed increases above Earth's rotation (465m/s). If the westward train in the above example increases speed, part of the force of gravity that pushes against the track accounts for the centripetal force needed to keep it in circular motion on the inertial frame. Once the train doubles its westward speed at 930m/s that centripetal force becomes equal to the force the train experiences when it stops. From the inertial frame, in both cases it rotates at the same speed but in the opposite directions. Thus, the force is the same cancelling completely the Eötvös effect. Any object that moves westward at a speed above 930m/s experiences an <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> instead. In the figure, the Eötvös effect is illustrated for a 10 kilogram object on the train at different speeds. The parabolic shape is because the centripetal force is proportional to the square of the tangential speed. On the inertial frame, the bottom of the parabola is centered at the origin. The offset is because this argument uses the Earth's rotating frame of reference. The graph shows that the Eötvös effect is not symmetrical, and that the resulting downward force experienced by an object that travels west at high velocity is less than the resulting <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> when it travels east at the same speed.|$|E
25|$|In many {{real world}} {{situations}} {{the act of}} weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used. This is usually {{referred to as the}} apparent weight of the object. A common example of this is the effect of buoyancy, when an object is immersed in a fluid the displacement of the fluid will cause an <b>upward</b> <b>force</b> on the object, making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale. The apparent weight may be similarly affected by levitation and mechanical suspension. When the gravitational definition of weight is used, the operational weight measured by an accelerating scale is often also referred to as the apparent weight.|$|E

The Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS) avail-able on the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing Sys-tem (A WIPS) prototype workstation at the Denver National Weather Service Forecast Office was employed to provide better temporal and spatial resolution in depicting mesoscale features not handled well by the larger grid lengths displayed on the Automated Observing and Forecasting System (AFOS). Specifically, MAPS analyses showed that a cyclonically curved upper level jet streak <b>forced</b> <b>upward</b> vertical motion through enhanced divergence in the left exit region. This <b>upward</b> <b>forcing</b> was pinpointed over southern Colorado by MAPS analyses of converging Q-vectors and isentropic lift.

40|$|Summary: Mechanobiology is an {{emerging}} {{field of science}} {{that focuses on the}} way physical forces and changes in cell or tissue mechanics contribute to development, physiology, and disease. As nails are always exposed to physical stimulation, mechanical forces may have a particularly pronounced effect on nail configuration and could be involved in the development of nail deformities. However, the role of mechanobiology in nail configuration and deformities has rarely been assessed. This review describes what is currently understood regarding the effect of mechanical force on nail configuration and deformities. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that nails have an automatic curvature function that allows them to adapt to the daily <b>upward</b> mechanical <b>forces.</b> Under normal conditions, the <b>upward</b> daily mechanical <b>force</b> and the automatic curvature force are well balanced. However, an imbalance between these 2 forces may cause nail deformation. For example, pincer nails may be caused by the absence of <b>upward</b> mechanical <b>forces</b> or a genetic propensity increase in the automatic curvature force, whereas koilonychias may occur when the <b>upward</b> mechanical <b>force</b> exceeds the automatic curvature force, thereby causing the nail to curve outward. This hypothesis is a new concept that could aid the development of innovative methods to prevent and treat nail deformities...|$|R

40|$|The current OECD Code 2 {{detailing}} the {{procedures for the}} hydraulic lift test of agricultural tractors, section 4. 3, published lift values that were sometimes unattainable. The static weight of 2 WD, two wheel drive, and MFWD, mechanical front wheel drive, tractors {{and the amount of}} lifting force have increased at a greater rate than the amount of static weight on the front axle. This increase in lifting force has led to a decrease in the percent of weight as the <b>upward</b> support <b>force</b> on the front axle of a tractor. Many of the 2 WD and MFWD unballasted tractors tested at the Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory (NTTL) since 1995 were discovered to have lift forces sufficient to raise the front axle off of the ground given the current maximum achievable lifting capacity measured during testing. Equations for calculating the maximum realistic achievable lifting capacity of tractors were developed based on maintaining a minimum amount of <b>upward</b> support <b>force</b> on the front axle. A test to determine how much <b>upward</b> support <b>force</b> at the front axle was sufficient to maintain adequate steering control of tractors was developed. Operator feedback from this test determined that 20 % of the total tractor weight as the <b>upward</b> support <b>force</b> on the front axle had significantly greater steering control when compared to 15 %. A sample proposal was drafted to be sent to OECD to update the hydraulic lift test in Code 2 requiring limiting the maximum lifting force published such that a minimum of 0 % of the total unballasted tractor weight as the <b>upward</b> support <b>force</b> on the front axle for 2 -track tractors, and 20 % for 2 WD and MFWD, and 4 WD tractors. This proposal utilized a series of equations based on several different tractor characteristics to determine the maximum realistic achievable lifting capacity of agricultural tractors that were tested at OECD accredited test facilities. Ballasted weight configurations were also incorporated for maximum realistic achievable lifting capacity of tractors under this new proposal.
