40|$|In this paper, the {{dynamics}} of migration and commuting into the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of Slovenia in 2000 – 2011 is presented. The influence of the attractiveness of <b>urban</b> <b>centres,</b> {{the influence of the}} emissiveness of migration and commuting flows in the origin and the influence of the distance between origins and destinations on migration and commuting flows into the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> in Slovenia were analysed in a spatial interaction model. The dynamics of the parameters were analysed for the period before (2000 - 2007) and in the economic crisis (2008 - 2011). According the Spatial Development Strategy of Slovenia, the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of Slovenia were considered at four levels: national <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of international importance, <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of national significance, <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of inter-regional significance and <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of inter-municipal significance...|$|R

Their features are Turkic and have a distinct language and culture aloof from the main town.|$|E
5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements in the area are thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{the second}} son of Rebecca Turner Johnson and John Johnson, a Baptist yeoman who lived in Everton, Liverpool.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how distance to <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> influences necessity and opportunity-based firm start-ups. The results show that closeness to <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> is not necessarily beneficial for firm start-ups. On the contrary, regions further away from <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of any size experience more firm start-ups. One explanation of this result is that regions experience spatial protection from urban competition. However, regions located further away from larger-sized <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> experience less firm start-ups due to such remoteness. One explanation of this finding is that remote regions cannot access the agglomeration benefits that larger cities offer. This supports the view that rural regions draw on urban resources but only on those from larger agglomerations...|$|R

5|$|Cassel (from Flemish; Kassel {{in modern}} Dutch spelling) is a commune in the Nord départment in {{northern}} France. Built on a prominent hill overlooking French Flanders, {{the town has}} existed since Roman times. It {{was developed by the}} Romans into an important <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> and was the focus of a network of roads, which are still in use today, that converge on the hill. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the scene of a fierce three-day battle between British and German forces which resulted in much of the town being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century the {{population}} and physical extent of London grew greatly. The increasing resident population and the development of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to a high level of traffic congestion with huge numbers of carts, cabs, and omnibuses filling the roads and up to 200,000 people entering the City of London, the commercial heart, each day on foot. By 1850 there were seven railway termini around the <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> of London: London Bridge and Waterloo to the south, Shoreditch and Fenchurch Street to the east, Euston and King's Cross to the north, and Paddington to the west. Only Fenchurch Street station was within the City.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166, when the Lord of the Manor Peter de Bermingham obtained a charter {{to hold a}} market at his castle, and followed this {{with the creation of}} a planned market town and seigneurial borough within his demesne or manorial estate, around the site that became the Bull Ring. This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau {{at a time when the}} area's economy was expanding rapidly, with population growth nationally leading to the clearance, cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land. Within a century of the charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> of merchants and craftsmen. By 1327 it was the third-largest town in Warwickshire, a position it would retain for the next 200 years.|$|E

5|$|The hill of Mont Cassel was {{occupied}} {{during the late}} Iron Age by the Menapii, a Belgic tribe, who made it the capital of a large territory extending from modern Calais to {{as far as the}} Rhine. The hilltop was probably used as an oppidum or hill fort. The Menapii fought against Julius Caesar but were forced to submit to Rome in 53 BC. They rebelled along with their neighbours, the Morini, in 30 or 29 BC. The Roman governor of Gaul, Carrinas, successfully quelled the rebellion and the territory of the Menapii was subsequently absorbed into the Roman province of Gallia Belgica. Cassel was redeveloped as Castellum Menapiorum, the <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> or civitas of the Menapii; the modern town takes its name from the Roman settlement.|$|E
5|$|There is no state-prescribed {{religion}} in the country. The religious groups in the <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> of Bangui, {{in the order of}} their population representation, are the Christians which form the majority, Animists following ancient beliefs, and Muslims. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception under the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Bangui is located in Bangui, as is the Church of Fatima. The archdiocese was established as the Apostolic Prefecture of Oubangui Chari on 8 May 1909. Pope John Paul II visited Bangui in August 1985. The seat of the archbishop is Notre-Dame Cathedral in Bangui. Islam is the last in the order of religious beliefs with about 20,000 Muslims in Bangui. However, prior to sectarian violence in the country, more than 100,000 Muslims lived in the capital. The late president Bokassa converted to Islam as a political compulsion under the guidance of the then Libyan President Gaddafi. He also assumed the Muslim name of Sala Eddine Ahmed Bou Kassa, but it was short-lived as he wanted a cathedral to be built in Bangui. The Church of Fatima and Notre Dame D'Afrique are located in KM 5.|$|E
