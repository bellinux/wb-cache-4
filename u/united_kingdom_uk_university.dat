40|$|This paper evaluates a peer {{observation}} of teaching scheme {{one year after}} its introduction in a <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>university.</b> In order {{to understand why the}} case study institution chose to implement peer observation, there is discussion of the national policies that have encouraged its use in the UK and the lessons learned from universities in the United States and Australia. A series of themes are identified which provide an analytical framework for the consideration of the responses of individual academics from some of the departments involved to the underlying principles, processes and practices of the scheme. The research demonstrates the importance of implementing peer observation sensitively, taking account of the organizational culture of the different departments and being fully aware of the anxieties and concerns of academic staff. This paper evaluates the peer {{observation of}} teaching process one year after its introduction in a <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>university.</b> The decision to implement peer observation was taken centrally, but the execution was decentralized to departmental level. The departments started at varying points in the journey towards acceptance of the value of peer observation. These different starting points, and other factors related to the variety of academic tribes involved (Becher & Trowler, 2001), resulted in departments making different choices about how to implement the model that was presented to them. Reactions of individual academics to these choices are described through interviews with members of academic staff from some of the departments involved. To understand the decisions taken by the university management to implement a programme of peer observation, a brief discussion is provided of the national policies that have driven this agenda forward...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a study of the}} {{international}} postgraduate student experience in a <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>university,</b> using a case study approach. Looking at both the academic and non academic experience of students in the university, the paper attempts to identify differences in perceptions of staff and students on key issues related to the international student experience. The limited sample of this study is compensated for by the quality and depth of data obtained from in-depth interviews with students and staff in one UK university. Results indicate significant convergence of perceptions in relation to the quality of education in the UK though the issues of cultural integration, English language and inadequate student support and the serious threat these issues pose to the quality of experience for students. The paper identifies five key gaps in the way staff and students conceptualise the postgraduate student experience and concludes with suggestions for how management might narrow these gaps in the higher education context. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Effective and {{efficient}} medication reporting processes are essential in promoting patient safety. Few qualitative studies have explored reporting of medication errors by health professionals and none have {{made reference to}} behavioural theories. The objective was to describe and understand the behavioural determinants of health professional reporting of medication errors in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: This was a qualitative study comprising face-to-face, semi-structured interviews within three major medical/ surgical hospitals of Abu Dhabi, the UAE. Health professionals were sampled purposively in strata of profession and years of experience. The semi-structured interview schedule focused on behavioural determinants around medication error reporting, facilitators, barriers and experiences. The theoretical domains framework (TDF, a framework of theories of behaviour change) {{was used as a}} coding framework. Ethical approval was obtained from a <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>university</b> and all participating hospital ethics committees. Results: Data saturation was achieved after interviewing ten nurses, ten pharmacists and nine physicians. While it appeared that patient safety and organisational improvement goals and intentions were behavioural determinants which facilitated reporting, there were key determinants which deterred reporting. These included: the beliefs of the consequences of reporting (lack of any feedback following reporting, and impacting professional reputation, relationships and career progression); emotions (fear and worry) and issues related to the environmental context (time taken to report). Conclusion: These key behavioural determinants which negatively impact error reporting can facilitate the development of an intervention, centring on organisational safety and reporting culture, to enhance reporting effectiveness and efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{managerial}} perspective {{to examine the}} internationalisation of higher education (HE). Using four case studies of <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>universities,</b> the research identifies the differences between organisations that are making good progress toward implementing their internationalisation strategy {{and those that are}} finding it more difficult. The literature review combines three sets of literature on: the internationalisation of HE, management of HE institutions and strategic management. Based on the literature three main challenges to <b>UK</b> <b>universities</b> implementing organisation wide internationalisation are identified and a set of organisational pre-requisite qualities are suggested, which if put in place will provide should produce sound basis on which to implement an internationalisation strategy. The literature suggests that contemporary universities are international businesses and as such should give more serious consideration to how their internationalisation strategy is managed. The research indicates that some <b>UK</b> <b>universities</b> are struggling {{to come to terms with}} their new operating environment and whilst they nearly all have international strategies, they need to pay more attention to the implementation of those strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: The recent scandals {{involving}} poor healthcare put nurses {{under the}} spotlight {{in an attempt}} to understand how compassionate they are towards their patients. The aim {{of this article is to}} investigate how compassion is embedded in the textbooks of the undergraduate mental health nursing degree. Methods: A snapshot review of key textbooks used, was conducted through the distribution of a list of textbooks and search terms to a panel of mental health teachers in four <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>universities.</b> They were asked to comment on the list’s completeness, and the terms’ suitability, comprehensiveness and sensitivity regarding culturally competent and compassionate care. Relevant data were extracted independently by each author followed by meetings to compare and discuss their findings and engage in deeper levels of analysis. Results: The review found that despite the fact that few textbooks touched on a number of the search terms none of them directly addressed the issue of compassion or culturally competent compassion. This means that mental health undergraduate nurses may not be adequately prepared to provide culturally competent compassion. Conclusions: Culturally competent compassion is not something we are born with. Imaginative teaching methods, good textbooks, good role models and opportunities to practice what one learns under supervision is required to nurture compassion in order to re-establish itself as the essence of nursing. Key textbooks need to be revised to reflect the virtue of culturally competent compassion...|$|R
40|$|Reframing Emotional Intelligence as Emotional Wisdom This {{research}} has investigated {{the motif of}} emotional wisdom (EW) within a group of female nursing students in one <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>University,</b> through my perspective as a nurse educator. The provision of effective quality nursing care according to the DOH, (2012) Compassion in Practice policy document identified six fundamental values of nursing: care, compassion, competence, communication, courage and commitment. Nursing practice is predicated {{on the presence of}} nurse education that is directed towards developing a safe and competent practitioner. Henderson (2001) and De Lambert (1998) have stated that nursing practice cannot be separated from the affective state of the nurse carrying out nursing care. The nursing literature suggests that EI has a role to play in nurse education, (Cadman & Brewer, 2001, McQueen, 2004, Freshwater & Stickley 2004), a role that is possibly underplayed. Using a qualitative research methodology grounded on a partnership based heuristic, [which is an adaptation of Moutakas’s (1990) methodology]; the study seeks to understand the lived experience of emotional intelligence (EI) of both myself as a nurse educator and those of nursing students. It suggests that a more meaningful way to apply EI within the context of learning and developing as nurses is as emotional wisdom (EW). Aim: to explore the lived experience of EI amongst a group of student nurses Method: a qualitative exploration drawing on Moustakas (1990), which holds the experiences of myself as the researcher, alongside the experiences of a group of nursing students as central to understanding {{what it is like to}} be an emotionally intelligent nurse. Findings: the data analysis uncovered four main themes relating to the lived experience of EI among us as a research group: Confronting the Nemesis of Kinsfolk Legacy. This focused on the impact of past emotional events in the development of the study participant in shaping her current emotionally intelligent identity Apprehending the Affective Learning Spaces. This theme explored the learning of emotions and emotional management of self and patients within the ‘classroom’ and the clinical setting pointing to a learning gap between those domains, which was rooted in a lack of emotional preparedness in the university. Authenticity of Being: Occupying Two Worlds. This explored the two domains in which the neophyte nurse found herself coming to an understanding and negotiated role clarity as to whom she was whilst learning as a nurse student and who she was as a daughter, mother, partner. Being Fully Present. This theme explored the data around the experience of learning to be emotionally attuned, or attentive to the patient. These findings are discussed within a creative synthesis and a summary of learning from the study. This seeks to proffer a potential model through which emotionally wise learning might be mediated within nurse education to future nursing students. In presenting such however, I am also offering up these findings with an invitation to you as the reader to determine if your own experiences find resonance with these accounts. Possible implications of the study within the field of nurse education:  Discussion concerning the use of EI measures as an additional recruitment marker to nurse education programmes  A pedagogical approach to nurse education predicated on an EW curricula  Recognition of an ontological oriented curricula in nurse education as a means to enhancing self-awarenes...|$|E

40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{evolved from}} an extensive literature review and a consultancy project {{conducted in a}} <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> based <b>university</b> business school/commercial sector collaboration. The paper explores how the digital age is presenting challenges for destination and place marketing agencies. Key trends in consumer behavior are identified and their significance is examined. The context is largely the European tourism sector with a particular focus on the UK. The paper argues that many place and destination marketing agencies are not responding {{to the challenges of}} the digital era. With this as the backdrop a novel conceptualisation of the customer journey model is offered which can be tested empirically. A vignette supports the model and this illustrates the complexities in consumer behavior that are involved in a decision over where to take a city break.

40|$|Exploitation of the {{knowledge}} generated by university research can bring social and economic benefits; thus, knowledge transfer between universities and industry is {{an important aspect of}} public policy. In many countries, including the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK),</b> <b>universities</b> have been developing the capacity to support the commercialisation of publicly funded research, typically by setting up centralised Knowledge Transfer Offices (KTOs). Previous studies have revealed that KTOs need a wide range of abilities to support the commercialisation of academic research, but our understanding of how these abilities are developed and have evolved over time remains limited. In order to address this identified gap in the literature, this thesis examines the questions: What do KTOs learn? How do KTOs learn? and Why do KTOs learn? To address these questions, the thesis adopts a practice-based view of organisational knowledge and learning. The conceptual framework developed to investigate learning by KTOs assumes that their commercialisation practice is learnt through the interactions of their staff within communities of practice, within networks of practice and across communities of practice, and that this learning can be initiated by KTO staff or by targeted strategies devised by the KTO and the university’s management. This conceptual framework guides the case studies of six purposefully selected KTOs in the UK. The selection of KTOs is aimed at identifying cases with different learning patterns in order to maximise insights gained from cross-case comparisons as well as at literal replication of the findings. The analysis is based on data collected from semi-structured interviews with key staff in selected KTOs and on information from relevant documents, and follows the ‘explanation building’ technique (Yin, 2009). The findings reveal that KTOs tend to develop one of two types of commercialisation practice – each of which is based on different implicit assumptions about generating science-based innovation, and associated with a different set of abilities. Moreover, the findings demonstrate the processes by which changes in practice come about, highlighting the interplay between situated learning and strategic practices of management. The results presented address the aforementioned gap in the literature on university-industry knowledge transfer and contribute to the developing situated learning theory by shedding light on how incremental and more radical changes in practice emerge. The findings should be useful to policy-makers who seek to support universities to build capability for knowledge transfer...|$|R
40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} (UI) is a {{major health}} care problem which has significant implications for quality of life within an ageing population. Urinary continence can however, be restored by simple rehabilitative strategies and therefore nurses need to be knowledgeable and proficient in providing quality care for patients with UI. However, {{there is evidence that}} there is very limited content related to continence promotion within the current pre-registration nursing curricula and there are no specific modules dedicated to this area of clinical practice. Student nurses are also still expected to learn through doing i. e. delivering hands on care for patients with UI and are supported in practice by a qualified mentor. There is evidence however, that suggests that qualified staff have negative attitudes towards UI but what is not known is if these negative attitudes influence student nurses’ experiences of dealing with UI in clinical practice in their first year of study. In order to generate {{a deeper understanding of the}} lived experiences of adult branch student nurses a longitudinal phenomenological study was adopted to explore their experiences in their first year of study. Thirteen students volunteered to participate and were recruited from 2 <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK)</b> <b>Universities.</b> The students were interviewed on two occasions; once at the beginning of their first year and again at the end of their first year. Data was analysed using phenomenological and hermeneutical approaches including iterative reading and interpretation to identify the themes that emerged from the data. The findings revealed 3 major themes; Being There, Being Understood and the Influence of Others. Being There, showed that student nurses are perplexed and confused about why loss of bladder function, is not viewed as something that requires assessment and investigation and is predominantly the remit of Healthcare Assistants (HCAs). Being Understood, captured the students’ problems in ‘finding a voice’ to express these concerns regarding this approach to UI care delivery in their desire not to ‘rock the boat’ and to ‘fit in’ with their nursing colleagues who were predominantly the HCAs in this study. The Influence of Others, encapsulates the role of the HCA in influencing the student nurses’ experiences of UI in their first year of study. Student nurses should spend up to 40 % of their time in clinical placement supported by a qualified member of staff however, there is considerable evidence in this study that this support is infrequent. Student nurses’ experiences of UI therefore do not appear to be negatively influenced by qualified staff as they are infrequently their role models for this aspect of care in their first year of study. They are however, influenced by HCAs who have no formal training in this area of clinical practice or in supporting students in practice. The findings from this study have implications both for the education of student nurses and for HCAs...|$|R
40|$|In {{universities}} where {{significant numbers}} of nursing students come from non-traditional backgrounds, and where an equally significant proportion of students have English as a second language, provision of learning support is essential to ensure success and progression, and to prevent attrition. This paper presents an evaluative study of the support services provided to undergraduate nursing students in two <b>universities</b> in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (<b>UK).</b> Both <b>universities</b> have {{significant numbers of}} students from non-traditional backgrounds and who have English as a second language, and both institutions have in place a large array of student support mechanisms.

Survey method evaluative research was the chosen research approach. Findings showed that the support services that appear to have the greatest impact on student success in their nursing programme are the programme leaders/module teachers, small study skills groups (known as APPL and L 2 L) and, for the 50 % of students who required it, academic literacy and numeracy support sessions. For students who have English as a second language and with non-traditional entry qualifications, numeracy and academic literacy support is particularly valued...|$|R

40|$|The {{trends in}} student {{experience}} {{in higher education}} have significantly {{changed in the last}} decade. The changing pattern of student participation with large proportion of students in full time or part time employment while also studying, growing student diversity, the use of ICT and flexible modes of learning and the demand for work integrated learning which allows students to undertake practicum’s while studying is playing {{a key role in the}} changing trend in student experience. Research in student experience and satisfaction has mostly looked at individual institutions and national results on student satisfaction. There is limited research on what students see as most important in various institutions with different cohort of students which may improve student engagement, retention and improvement in student satisfaction.

The study is based on two Australian and one <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>University</b> (<b>UK).</b> The paper reports that student experience and high satisfaction is based on five interrelated factors including: adequate and reliable learning infrastructure and resources, quality of teaching staff, course design which enables student attainment of generic skills, quality management of student assessments and issues around administrative matters such as timetabling, admissions and enrolments.
