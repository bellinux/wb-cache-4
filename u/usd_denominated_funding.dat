40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{analyzes}} the pass-through of exchange rate and <b>US</b> Dollar <b>denominated</b> import prices into consumer and producer prices in Turkey. To this end, pricing along a distribution chain framework is utilized {{and it is}} estimated by Vector Auto Regression (VAR) for the pre-inflation targeting and the inflation targeting periods. Results show that the pass-through of both external factors into producer prices is higher {{than it is for}} consumer prices. In addition, the degree of pass-through is significantly lower in the inflation targeting period compared to the previous period. The cumulative exchange rate and import price pass-through coefficients into consumer prices for the recent period are found similar to each other while import price shocks are reflected much faster. For the producer prices, import price shocks are found to be reflected more than the exchange rate shocks. An exercise based on these estimation results shows that during 2007 - 2009 external factors were influential on consumer prices. Furthermore simultaneous counter movements of exchange rate and import prices at that period limited and sometimes offset the impact of each other on consumer prices. JEL E 3...|$|R

Based on their measure of original sin the authors show that original sin was present in most of the developing economies and independent from histories of high inflation and currency depreciation.

40|$|Are {{there any}} long {{standing}} benefits in international equity investing? Did {{the acceleration of}} global financial integration bring clearly measurable benefits to international equity investors? Is there a convergence of equity market profitability around the world? These are the main questions of this paper. All of these questions got an affirmative answer, but, {{as it may be}} immediately suspected, many durable qualifiers and caveats apply. Section 1 reviews some key propositions of modern investment theory and some recent evidence on the benefits of international asset allocation on equity markets. It is argued that the desired benefits — as predicted by theory — can be and have been captured in terms of better risk/return trade-offs due to international diversification of equity portfolios. Manifest benefits aside, however, many dampening factors come into play when considering long term capacities of realising these benefits. Mainly the changing correlation structure of global markets and the increased currency risk, which still remained very difficult to hedge, were identified as permanent factors to limit the power of international diversification in pushing out the efficient frontier of the equity set. Section 2 presents comparative evidence on global equity markets’ performance and gives an account of the wide variations in the <b>US</b> dollar <b>denominated</b> returns of major markets, developed and emerging. There is some support to the view that a certain convergence can be depicted in the profitability levels of different markets.

If dollarization is a credible commitment to maintain a fixed exchange rate, then it is an irreversible decision. This is the first paper, as far as I know, to explicitly model the unique feature [...] irreversibility [...] of a dollarization policy. In addition, it is the first paper to recognize that if a dollarization is a potential exchange rate regime choice, then the equilibrium is a mixed strategy equilibrium. Argentina might dollarize. I compute Nash equilibria and the transition probabilities that a country will move from a currency board regime to dollarizing, or floating, in one year, or two years, out to seven years. I model shocks to the exchange rate as a jump-diffusion process. The jumps represent large “asymmetric ” shocks to the exchange rate — such as Brazil’s 1999 devaluation. The probability of dollarization is inversely related to the jump probability. When the jump probability is small, the probability of dollarization is large and the probability of floating is small. When the jump probability is large, the probability of floating is large and the probability of dollarization is small. I thank my friend and colleague Steve Goldman for many valuable suggestions and corrections, and I thank Richard Saouma for help with the data. ...|$|R
40|$|In chapter 1 we {{put forward}} a simple method of {{estimating}} individual G 10 currency returns from observed exchange rates via a Bayesian approach. As an application of this technique, we replace <b>US</b> dollar <b>denominated</b> portfolios in Lustig, Roussanov and Verdelhan (2011) and Menkhoff et al (2012) with US dollar-independent portfolios that are valued {{in terms of a}} ``neutral'' numeraire. This renders unnecessary the US dollar factor introduced by the papers and permits the US dollar to be included as a portfolio currency. We find that the S&P 500 index returns are positively associated with carry trade returns, with a higher significance compared to currency volatility. This supports the view that global market risk sentiment drives carry trade returns, rather than volatility per se. In chapter 2, we investigate deviations from covered interest rate parity (CIP), which is used to price forward exchange rates. CIP held until mid- 2007, when the U. S. sub-prime crisis and subsequent global financial crisis led to U. S. dollar funding constraints that significantly impacted forward prices. We find that factors related to credit risk, funding costs and liquidity influence deviations in the forward exchange rate from CIP of AUD/USD, EUR/USD and GBP/USD in the post-Lehman period from July 2009 to June 2012, for tenors of 1, 2, 3, 6 months and 1 year. In chapter 3 we gather 34 macroeconomic data series over 8 years from the US and Eurozone and split them into 4 groups: US inflation, US growth, Eurozone inflation and Eurozone growth. We summarise the data for each group using the first principal component of the series from each group. Additionally, we produce mutually orthogonal components using a variation on principal component analysis. We find that before mid- 2008, US inflation and growth factors are positively related to US and Eurozone yield level and yield slope, although this relationship vanishes in the post- 2008 period. This points to other factors directly driving yields, such as fiscal and monetary policy announcements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the welfare {{implications of a}} depreciation of the US dollar against the euro using a dynamic equilibrium model. I calibrate a simple two country stochastic endowment economy with trade in goods and financial assets and exogenous variations in the exchange rate. The model displays both a trade channel effect and an asset channel effect after {{a change in the}} value of the exchange rate. The welfare loss coming from the trade channel translates into the relatively higher price that consumers have to pay for imports. The asset channel effect arises from three sources. One is the traditional valuation effect associated with <b>US</b> debt being <b>denominated</b> mostly in dollars. The other two novel effects are: (1) the dollar value of investors net worth, mostly denominated in local currency, increases more in Europe than in the US; (2) asset prices change, causing a portfolio rebalancing effect which results in a fall in the share of world assets owned by the US. I show that a dollar depreciation has potentially large negative welfare effects as measured by the net present value of future consumption. After a temporary 10 % depreciation of the dollar, with a half-life of one year, I calculate a 0. 25 % decrease in lifetime aggregate consumption for the US consumer. ...|$|R
40|$|SAPPI Limited ("SAPPI") is {{a company}} that was {{established}} in South Africa in the 1930 's and has grown into a global player in the paper and pulp industry, as well as the chemical cellulose industry. Historical financing decisions made in the growth phases of the company's life cycle left it with the need to refinance debt obligations payable in the early 2010 's. In order to meet these obligations, four callable bonds with high coupon rates denominated in Euro and US Dollar were issued in 2011 and 2012 below investment grade. This study examines the cost at which these high yield bonds were issued by SAPPI and discusses the potential reasoning behind the decisions made by SAPPI in the process to obtain further financing. Financing solutions within the South African market are discussed with the conclusion that the South African listed high yield corporate bond market was not adequate for SAPPI, given its credit rating being below investment grade and the value of funding required. In addition, SAPPI's exposure to foreign currencies through global operations made the Euro and <b>US</b> Dollar <b>denominated</b> bond issues favourable to the business. To illustrate the cost of the bonds issued in both Euro and US Dollar, the second part of this study consists of an analysis of the option‐adjusted spreads at which these bonds were issued. Our analysis involved taking into account the probability of the call provisions being exercised by SAPPI at the date of issue through a detailed application of the option‐adjusted spread methodology and the use of a recombining binomial lattice. Through a quantitative example of the process followed and a discussion of the spreads determined, we indicate the true cost at which finance was obtained by SAPPI for each bond issued. A brief discussion on the hedging decisions taken by SAPPI management on the issuance of the debt has also been included. Furthermore, the retrospective performance of the foreign exchange hedging decisions made have been assessed through movements in global financial markets from the time hedging decisions were enacted up until 30 September 2015...|$|R
