The castle has one hundred rooms to enter through. If any characters enters a room, their group color will light <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Each of the princes starts with nine men-at-arms. Reinforcements will join the side of whoever last visit Gate Rooms. If no one entered a Gate Room before the man-at-arms appears, they will join the King's Guard.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, Clark {{was cited}} and {{released}} on a misdemeanor battery charge after {{getting into a}} food fight during breakfast {{in a hotel room}} with his record company manager, Laura Kathleen Troy, and their entourage, which escalated into food and dishes being thrown. According to Sacramento Police Sergeant Justin Risley, both parties suffered scratches on their arms, but Troy did not press charges, and both Clark and Troy left in a vehicle together. Clark later apologized for the incident, explaining that his dancers, management team and record label representatives were also involved in the food fight, but that after they had left to get cleaned up, he and his manager, who stayed to clean <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> were the ones present when the police arrived.|$|E
25|$|While Don Quixote is {{unconscious}} in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, {{the parish}} curate {{and the local}} barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of high comedy: If the books are so bad for morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel La Galatea is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance Felixmarte de Hyrcania is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> which contained the library, later telling Don Quixote {{that it was the}} action of a wizard (encantador).|$|E
60|$|Before {{scaling up}} his {{drawings}} Somerset wished {{to spend a}} short time in London, and dismissing his assistants till further notice, he locked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> which had been appropriated as office and studio and prepared for the journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because Mary Jane 'll be in {{mourning}} from this out; and first {{you know the}} nigger that does <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dominey {{folded it}} {{carefully}} <b>up,</b> crossed <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> unlocked a little safe and deposited it therein.|$|R
25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|E
2500|$|In late September 2015, Hopkins {{spoke at}} a fringe event {{organised}} by the Electoral Reform Society at the UK Independence Party (UKIP)'s annual conference. After derogatory comments about the appointment of Michelle Mone to the House of Lords, she said: [...] "Frankly, I don't really mind if we seal <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and gas the lot of them".|$|E
2500|$|With a friend, {{the couple}} cleaned <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where the killings had taken place, {{removing}} {{blood from the}} carpet, walls, and furniture. They confided in the friend who helped clean and in several other friends that they had killed the Olives, with Riley physically carrying out the killings. Riley told friends, [...] "We had to do it. They wouldn't let me see her." [...] Marlene Olive and Riley continued to live together at the Olives' house for several days, attending a Yes concert, shopping, eating at restaurants, and paying their expenses using cash, checks, and credit cards taken from her dead parents. They allegedly planned to wait for Jim and Naomi to be declared dead, collect the life insurance money, and move to Ecuador.|$|E
60|$|Pan {{stepped to}} the red-shaded lamp on a small table beside the bed, and turned <b>up</b> <b>the</b> light. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> had more comfort and color than any Pan had seen for many a day.|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed the}} stone flags {{in front of}} the Opera together, and turned <b>up</b> towards <b>the</b> <b>Rooms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Germans' {{main concern}} for the {{management}} of the shelter was the high amount of humidity stagnating the tunnels. They used braziers burning coke coal in order to dry <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> However, burnt gas was conveyed through an expelling fan to the [...] "municipal" [...] tunnel, causing serious problems of asphyxia for the people sheltered there.|$|R
60|$|WILLIS: 'I don't {{know what}} you're up to.' He shrugs his {{shoulders}} and walks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|LAWTON: 'If {{you suppose}} I'm {{going to take}} you at your own figure--' They walk <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> together, and return as before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, ladies," [...] said Miss Todd, walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with well-assured {{foot and}} full {{comfortable}} presence, [...] "I've news to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} it is an {{excellent}} plan," [...] broke in Lady Honoria, who feared lest difficulties should arise as to her appropriation of Anne's services; [...] "how lucky that I happened to mention it. There will be no trouble about our giving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> at Mrs. Jones's, because I know she has another application for them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Holly: (to Val) You have an eye. One tiny {{move and}} you open <b>up</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>room!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|At {{about nine}} she {{was seated in}} the {{appointed}} place, and Madame Voss brought her lover <b>up</b> into <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|As Beth and Patsy turned, panting, {{and from}} their {{elevation}} looked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> the cowboys gave a bellow of rage and rushed forward.|$|E
60|$|She took {{a couple}} more, {{and put them on}} the bench also. Then she turned in {{confusion}} to her work. He went on <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|LAWTON, shrugging his {{shoulders}} and walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> abreast of Campbell: 'I don't know what your little game is.' They return together, and stop, confronting each other.|$|E
60|$|Then Mrs Tom led <b>the</b> way <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{in which}} Margaret had watched by her dying brother's bed-side.|$|R
60|$|The last {{member at}} length departed, the {{attendant}} {{at the museum}} lowered the fire, <b>the</b> curator locked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> and soon {{there was only a}} single pirouetting flame {{on the top of a}} single coal to make the bones of the ichthyosaurus seem to leap, the stuffed birds to wink, and to draw a smile from the varnished skulls of Vespasian's soldiery.|$|R
6000|$|Bob's {{mother went}} <b>up</b> into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where {{several of the}} {{children}} were sleeping, and after looking around, she said to the old colored nurse: ...|$|R
60|$|The crossness of {{the mother}} was soon finished. Ursula locked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> again, and {{considered}} all was over. Then her father came in with the notched tools, his forehead knotted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't {{you read}} to me?" [...] pleaded Albert, one afternoon, when Maud {{came in with}} her mother to brush <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "It's getting rather slow {{business}} layin' here like this." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{shades of}} the two windows of the {{apartment}} were tightly drawn and a lamp on the table lit <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> but dimly, for it was now night. No one was present but the sufferer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, Pythagoras, Socrates! {{lift the}} mevrouw {{out of the}} sleigh and carry her <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> which <b>the</b> {{landlord}} hath prepared for the ladies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--yes; in {{one sense}} I had; but you don't {{understand}} about business. You had better not interrupt me now as I have got a good deal to say {{before we get to}} the Square. It will suit me to give <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> I don't like them, and they are very dear. As you yourself said, it will be a capital thing for us to go and stay with your father." ...|$|R
60|$|But in the night, {{when the}} great house is silent, he steals <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where <b>the</b> child still lies, and pushes back the white, uneven sheet.|$|R
60|$|The waiter {{had come}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> bearing {{the pride of}} the hotel, the grand green Stilton with the {{beautiful}} autumn leaf heart shading away to rich plum-coloured cavities. He placed it on the table with a solemn air.|$|E
60|$|A girl, undeniably pretty, with dark, red-gold hair, {{wearing a}} long ermine coat and {{followed}} by a fashionably dressed young man, was making her way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> She suddenly recognised Philip's companion and came towards her with outstretched hand.|$|E
60|$|So {{they fell}} to work, and soon a bright fire was {{lighting}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with its cheerful shine, {{and the children}} gathered about it, quite careless of the storm raging without, and sure that Pat would come in time.|$|E
60|$|We {{passed along}} the {{corridor}} and he opened the door, which led into a small hall and on into a sitting-room. <b>The</b> clerk opened <b>up</b> all <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|For a {{while the}} fair beauty was coy, and would give no decisive answer; but at length under the united {{pressure}} of her father and lover, a day was named. A day was named, and Mr. Brown's consent to that day was obtained; but this arrangement was not made till he had undertaken to give <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in which he at present lived, and to go into lodgings in the neighbourhood.|$|R
60|$|He woke, with a dim {{impression}} of some near presence. In the pale glimmer from innumerable stars, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{was full of}} shadowy shapes. He lit his lantern. The flame darted forth, bickered, then slowly lit <b>up</b> <b>the</b> great <b>room.</b>|$|R
