5|$|Cases of {{epilepsy}} may {{be organized}} into epilepsy syndromes by the specific {{features that are}} present. These features include the age that seizure begin, the seizure types, EEG findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> {{as well as what}} anti-seizure medication should be tried.|$|E
5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation generally resolves {{when the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> are treated, but supportive measures are often required. For instance, if the platelet count drops significantly {{and there is}} resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specific}} <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> {{are treated}} as normally. For example, hemochromatosis is treated by venesection, the regular removal of a fixed amount of blood. Eventually, this decreases the iron levels {{in the body and}} improves the function of the organs in which iron has accumulated.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{report on}} trends in {{mortality}} for asthma using all certified {{causes of death}} mentioned on death certificates (conventionally termed 'mentions'), not just the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b> Study design: Retrospective analysis using death certificate information and population data. Method: Analysis of mortality records in the Oxford region (mentions available from 1979 to 2007) and English national data (mentions available from 1995 to 2007). The data were considered in periods defined by different national rules for selecting <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death (1979 - 1983, 1984 - 1992, 1993 - 2000, 2001 - 2007), and were also analysed as single calendar years. Results: In Oxford, <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> mortality rates per million population in the four periods were 25, 32, 22 and 15, respectively. Rates for mentions were 44, 47, 41 and 29, respectively. Rule changes exaggerated the increase in <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> mortality in 1984 - 1992 (when 67 % of asthma deaths were coded as <b>underlying</b> <b>cause).</b> Conversely, the decrease in <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> mortality for asthma by 2001 - 2007 is less than it seems (because just under 50 % of asthma deaths in 2001 - 2007 were coded as <b>underlying</b> <b>cause).</b> Comparisons of trends in asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD) for individuals aged ≥ 55 years showed a decrease for both asthma and COPD in men; in women, a decrease in asthma {{and an increase in}} COPD was seen from the early 1990 s. Conclusions: Approximately half of all deaths certified for asthma are missed when asthma mortality is analysed using <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> alone. The long-term decreasing trend in asthma mortality is real, and is not attributable to a trend in transferring certification from <b>underlying</b> to contributing <b>cause.</b> Nonetheless, caution is needed when comparing asthma deaths using <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> alone across periods that include changes to rules for the selection of <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b> © 2012 The Royal Society for Public Health...|$|R
25|$|Once a {{diagnosis}} of dysmenorrhea is made, further workup is required to search for any secondary <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of it, {{in order to be}} able to treat it specifically and to avoid the aggravation of a perhaps serious <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|R
50|$|Treatment is {{targeted}} to the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b> However, most vasculitis {{in general are}} treated with steroids (e.g. methylprednisolone) because the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the vasculitis is due to hyperactive immunological damage. Immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine may also be given.|$|R
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials {{in the areas of}} sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|This {{classification}} {{was widely}} accepted but {{has also been}} criticized mainly because the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of epilepsy (which are {{a major determinant of}} clinical course and prognosis) were not covered in detail. In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the Epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories (genetic, structural/metabolic, unknown cause) that were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technologic and scientific advances.|$|E
40|$|Injury {{related to}} a death may be {{recorded}} on the death certificate as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death or as a condition associated with death but not causing it The present study uses the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death data for 1978 to determine the percentage of injury-related deaths for which injury was identified as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death and the variation of this percentage with age at death. Injury was identified as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death in 86 % of all cases with injury recorded on the death certificate. The percentage with injury identified as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> varied with age: 93 % {{for those in the}} first year of life, 97 % for those aged 1 - 44 years, 87 % for those aged 55 - 64, and 50 % for those aged 75 or older. The percentage with injury identified as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> also varied by cause of injury. In all age groups, assault, suicide, and motor vehicle accidents were identified as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death in more than 90 % of the cases in which they were mentioned. Causes other than motor vehicle accidents, assaults, and suicides, especially when occurring in the elderly, were less likely to be identified as the underlyin...|$|R

5|$|Tinnitus is not {{a disease}} but a symptom that can result {{from a number of}} <b>underlying</b> <b>causes.</b> One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss.

It is more common in those with depression.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes.</b> When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of <b>underlying</b> <b>causes.</b> If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Until recently, {{national}} coding {{and analysis}} of routine mortality statistics in most countries included only <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death. There were changes in the rules for selection and coding of <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> in England in 1984 and 1993. We report on trends in mortality rates in an English region from 1979 to 1998, comparing multiple-cause and underlying-cause coded rates, for individual diseases that were affected by coding changes. Among many others, these include pneumonia, venous thromboembolism, heart failure, respiratory distress syndrome, tuberculosis, diabetes, dementia, alcohol and drug abuse, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, asthma, peptic ulcer, appendicitis, and cancers of the breast, colon and prostate. Comparisons over time of mortality rates based on <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> alone will be misleading when the time-period crosses years in which rules changed for selecting <b>underlying</b> <b>cause...</b>|$|R
5|$|Both Wessex's sudden rise {{to power}} in the late 820s, and the {{subsequent}} failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for <b>underlying</b> <b>causes.</b> One plausible explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is plausible that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems {{to be part of}} southern English politics {{during the first half of}} the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|In 1907 {{the family}} split up; {{there was no}} divorce or formal separation, but the two elder boys, Christopher and Ambrose, {{remained}} with their father and Lydia left them, taking Ralph with her. The ostensible cause of the couple's separation was a row over Lydia's choice of wallpaper for her husband's study. According to John Miller's biography, whatever <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> {{there may have been}} are unknown. An earlier biographer, Garry O'Connor, speculates that Arthur Richardson might have been having an extramarital affair. There {{does not seem to have}} been a religious element, although Arthur was a dedicated Quaker, whose first two sons were brought up in that faith, whereas Lydia was a devout convert to Roman Catholicism, in which she raised Ralph. Mother and son had a variety of homes, the first of which was a bungalow converted from two railway carriages in Shoreham-by-Sea on the south coast of England.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to report trends in mortality, as certified on death certificates, from multiple sclerosis (MS), motor neuron disease (MND), primary Parkinson's disease (PD), and epilepsy, analysing not only the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death but also all certified causes for each disease. Death records in the Oxford region, 1979 - 2006, and England, 1996 - 2006, were analysed for ascertaining the trends in mortality. The percentage of deaths coded as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> changed over time, coinciding with changes to the rules for selecting the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death. Changes over time to coding rules had a large impact on apparent trends in death rates for PD when studied by <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> alone. They also had significant, though smaller, effects on trends in death rates for MS, MND and epilepsy. Nationally, in the last period of the study, <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> mortality identified 64 % of deaths with a mention of MS, 88 % of MND, 56 % of PD, and 48 % of epilepsy. In the longstanding Oxford data from 1979 to 2006, death rates based on all certified causes of death showed no significant change for MS; an upward trend for MND (notably in women over 75), though only in the last few years of the study; a significant but small decline for PD; and no significant change for epilepsy. When mortality statistics are analysed by <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> only, their value is reduced. A substantial percentage of neurological deaths are missed. Time trends may be misleading. All certified causes for each disease, as well as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause,</b> should be analysed...|$|R
