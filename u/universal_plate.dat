50|$|The Spademan system {{retained}} {{one major}} {{advantage over the}} toe-and-heel binding, due to the <b>universal</b> <b>plate.</b> When changing boots, normally {{one would have to}} adjust the bindings fore-and-aft to accommodate a change in boot length, but with the Spademan this was not an issue because the plate was always the same size and shape. This made them popular in rental shops, where they lived on into the mid-1980s. The company also sold clip-on full-length plates for people who wanted to use rental skis with Spademan bindings with their own boots, lacking the butterfly. The plate had metal loops that clipped over the toe and heel, with a small lever on the back to allow it to be tensioned onto the boot, and a well-fastened butterfly on the bottom.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Ibn Bāṣo, an {{astronomer}} {{who lived in}} Granada in the 13 th century, wrote a treatise {{on the use of}} a <b>universal</b> <b>plate</b> devised to be used in conjunction with an astrolabe. This plate was widely diffused in the Islamic World until the 18 th century and also was the inspiration of some astronomical instruments made in Europe between the 14 th and the 17 th centuries. The paper describes the characteristics of Ibn Bāṣo's <b>universal</b> <b>plate,</b> the most remarkable surviving examples of it and its influence on later astronomers both in the Islamic World and in Europe. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} new {{end effector}} developments incorporating microscope vision and gripping mechanisms for {{pick and place}} assembly of small components in a minifactory environment. Instead of performing microassembly under a microscope, in minifactory each assembly agent is equipped with its own microscope. This arrangement facilitates flow-through manufacturing as opposed to work cell approaches. To this end, we have developed a series of new manipulator end effectors, each of which incorporates a long-range objective lens, coaxial illumination, folded optics, and a camera. Modular gripping and other mechanisms are mounted on a <b>universal</b> <b>plate</b> beneath the end effector. A first type uses vacuum and pressure to pick and place components of a lens assembly. A second type incorporates an off-the-shelf tweezer with electromagnetic actuation. The third type incorporates a novel rotation mechanism and MEMS-based gripper which can pick a part from a wafer, rotate it through an angle, and snap the part into a receptacle on a second wafer...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{shows an}} {{innovative}} multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which {{is able to}} easily and quickly change its configuration. In order to satisfy this feature, the principal structure is made of an <b>universal</b> <b>plate,</b> combined with a circular ring, to create a rail guide able to host the arms, in a variable number from 3 to 8, and the legs. The arms are adjustable and contain all the avionic and motor drivers to connect the main structure with each electric motor. The unique arm design, defined as all-in-one, allows classical single rotor configurations, double rotor configurations and amphibious configurations including inflatable elements positioned {{at the bottom of}} the arms. The proposed multi-rotor system is inexpensive because of the few universal pieces needed to compose the platform which allows the creation of a kit. This modular kit allows to have a modular drone with different configurations. Such configurations are distinguished among them for the number of arms, number of legs, number of rotors and motors, and landing capability. Another innovation feature is the introduction of the 3 D printing technology to produce all the structural elements. In this manner, all the pieces are designed to be produced via the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology using desktop 3 D printers. Therefore, an universal, dynamic and economic multi-rotor UAV has been developed...|$|E

50|$|Lego trains {{were first}} {{introduced}} in 1966 with Lego set number 080. The train sets used blue rails, {{and the first}} train sets were simply push-along. Set number 115 introduced 4.5 volt battery-operated trains (initially the battery box was handheld, but train sets soon contained a railcar that carried the battery box), and train sets numbered 720 (1969) and up operated on 12-volt electrified rails, introduced in 1969. In 1972, 4.5-volt trains gained a monolithic railcar that carried the batteries and contained both a bottom-mounted stop button to be actuated by signals, {{as well as a}} side-mounted lever for manual go/stop/back control and tripping by a track-side pivot. All three kinds (push trains, 4.5-volt battery-operated trains and 12-volt electric trains) existed next to each other and even allowed for upgrade. The motors were the same size, the push trains used a motor-shaped dummy block of bricks, and all used the same wheel style. These wheels had the same press-fit metal axles as used in the two larger sizes of rubber-tire Lego wheels, which also meant that both 4.5-volt and 12-volt motors were not restricted to use in trains. A push train could be updated to a battery-operated train, and a battery-operated train could be updated to an electric train. Since 1969 the motor housings for 4.5-volt and 12-volt are equal and can be equipped with either a 4.5-volt or 12-volt Bühler motor unit. These motor units were sold separately as a replacement part until around 1990. In or before 1976, the 4.5-volt motor gained a hole for driving the then white cross-axles of the size that would later be known as Technic. Railcars began as spartan constructions of train-specific wheels and couplers attached to car bases made from <b>universal</b> <b>plates</b> and bricks, but these were quickly replaced by black single-piece bases in two lengths that included captive wheels and couplings.|$|R
50|$|In {{injection}} moulding, hand moulds {{refer to}} simple moulds {{that have no}} provision for heat, cooling, or ejection. This means when a hand mould is cycled <b>universal</b> heating <b>plates</b> are required to warm the moulds and the moulds must be removed after each cycle to remove the mouldings. This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the mould. They are usually single cavity moulds, but may be multi-cavity if the moulding is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of {{the simplicity of the}} parts. If only a short run is required then the moulds may be made from aluminum or brass, but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional steels.|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} the Arca-Swiss system is that the {{mounting}} plates are designed to prevent accidental rotation of the plate relative to the device. When used with a camera or camera body the plates incorporate an anti-rotation flange or lip. When mounted to a lens with a foot, the plate will often be secured with two screws to prevent rotation. When this type of system is used, the camera cannot become accidentally detached from the tripod, which is possible when using a quick-release system that doesn't prevent rotation, or when no camera mount is used. Nearly all makes and models of modern SLRs, medium format cameras, and large lenses have specific plates available with anti-rotation flanges. There are plates available for certain models of other formats of cameras, such as point and shoots, as well. <b>Universal</b> mounting <b>plates</b> are also available, {{which can be used}} with nearly any camera with a tripod mount, though they provide little or no anti-rotation protection.|$|R
40|$|Performance of an {{aircraft}} wing {{depends on the}} smoothness of the air flow over it. Any accumulation of frost, snow or ice on the wings or other horizontal surfaces will substantially alter the lifting characteristics of the airfoil and also changes the values of aerodynamic forces exerted on the airfoil. So any small change in flow parameters could affect its performance in a larger scale. This can sometimes be disastrous too. The wings of the airplane are also susceptible to corrosion also due to the excess humidity level. When it comes to large airfoils like aircraft wings, these parameters have to be maintained perfect so that the probability of failure is minimized. The basic test surface for investigating the effects of various parameters to the underlying boundary layer is the <b>universal</b> flat <b>plate.</b> Therefore a flat plate is used for this study. The present paper concentrates on analyzing various flow parameters of cold air while it flows over a flat plate. Modeling {{and analysis of the}} flow were performed using FLUENT, version 6. 3. The results obtained are purely the simulation software based calculations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine bone healing after Le Fort I {{osteotomy}} in Class III patients. Patients and methods: The study group consisted of 18 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism with and without asymmetry, maxillary retrognathism or open bite. A total of 36 sides were examined. Le Fort I osteotomy was performed without a pterygoid osteotome, with an ultrasonic curette used to remove interference at the pterygomaxillary region. Titanium <b>plates</b> (<b>Universal</b> Mid-face fixation module, Stryker, Freiburg, German) were used for four patients, absorbable plates (poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) : NEOFIX®, Gunze, kyoto, Japan) were used for four patients and other absorbable plates (uncalcined and unsintered hydroxyapatite and poly-L-lactic acid (uHA/PLLA) : super FIXSORB®MX, Takiron Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) were used for 10 patients, in the same manner. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) was analyzed for all patients pre-operatively and 1 year postoperative. The anterior and lateral areas between the maxillary segments were measured with 3 -dimensional (3 D) CT. Bone healing at the pterygomaxillary region was also assessed. Results: There were no significant differences in the area of bone defect healing among the plate types. The areas of bone defect after 1 year were significantly smaller than that immediately after surgery on the right side (p = 0. 0145) and left side (p = 0. 0010) in the frontal view and right side in the lateral view (p = 0. 0118). Bone healing at the pterygomaxillary junction was found in all cases without artificial pterygoid plate fracture. Fourteen of 22 sides with artificial pterygoid plate fracture by an ultrasonic curette showed bone continuity between the pterygoid plate and posterior part of maxilla. Conclusion: This study suggested that bony healing could occur in spaces between the segments of maxilla and pterygomaxillary regions as well as the region of the anterior and lateral walls in the maxilla, but it is not always complete within 1 year after Le Fort I osteotomy. © 2010 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery...|$|R
