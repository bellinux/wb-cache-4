The mesh of the {{multilayer}} gauze {{stage was}} simplified from the crossing arrangement to the <b>unilateral</b> <b>arrangement,</b> and the simplification from three-dimensional to the two-dimensional came true. The calculation capacity was effectively controlled {{by means of}} the periodic boundary. The numerical simulation of the multilayer gauze stage with different layers has been done. After the several calculation with different operating conditions, the resistance characteristic curves of the corresponding models was gave out. The relationship between the layers of the multilayer gauze stage and the resistance characteristic has been worked out. The experiments on resistance specialty of the multilayer gauze stage have been done on the special wind-tunnel. The experiment result was compared with the numerical simulation result, in order to provide the effective information for the further research...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{scholarly}} literature {{is replete with}} discussion of {{the pros and cons}} of mandatory arbitration and civil litigation, relative to one another, there has been no examination of one-way binding arbitration as a potential bridge between these procedural poles. The goal of this article is to fill that void. One-way binding arbitration requires an employee to use arbitration to resolve workplace disputes, but also gives the employee, but not the employer, the option of rejecting the arbitrator’s decision. In the event the employee is not satisfied with the outcome of arbitration, she can still pursue her claim in court. This collaborative alternative may help to alleviate workplace conflict. Employees today are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, they are increasingly forced to sign pre-dispute arbitration agreements as a condition of employment. Employees are bound by arbitration – an alternative to civil litigation that often does not offer the full panoply of procedural protections. On the other hand, workers seeking relief from the federal court system for employment claims are increasingly finding the system inhospitable to their claims. While the federal courts offer more robust procedural protections than arbitration, they pose obstacles of their own, such as administrative agency backlog, more rigorous pleading requirements, and high dismissal rates. This has put employees in a bind, requiring the consideration of fresh alternatives. A promising and unique alternative is one-way binding arbitration. This <b>unilateral</b> <b>arrangement</b> – voluntarily adopted by The Coca-Cola Company, is a groundbreaking and novel approach to promoting arbitration, while also protecting employee choice and access to the court system. Companies can enjoy all of the benefits of arbitration – such as efficiency, privacy, costs savings and litigation avoidance – while supporting the due process rights of workers and bolstering workplace relations that may enhance profitability. The legal system also profits from arbitration arrangements that relieve administrative and judicial caseloads, promote settlement and reconcile competing dispute resolution systems. One-way binding arbitration has its own limitations, which requires that important safeguards be used. However, given its transformative potential, employers and employee advocates should consider it as an alternative to compulsory binding pre-dispute arbitration. One-way binding arbitration offers society another option along the continuum between mandatory, pre-dispute arbitration and civil litigation – providing society with a compromise that seeks to balance the benefits of both worlds and reconcile their differences...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigate}} channel incentives as extra-contractual governance {{processes that}} maintain and extend marketing channel relationships. More specifically, instrumental incentives are monetary-based payments {{made by a}} manufacturer in a <b>unilateral</b> channel <b>arrangement</b> to motivate distributor compliance, while equity incentives are bilateral expectations of fair treatment that motivate both parties to continue to cooperate with one another. A model of the antecedents and performance consequences of channel incentives is conceptualized and tested on 314 marketing channel relationships using a structural equation modeling methodology. The findings support the conceptual model and suggest that unique facets of the channel relationship explain the type of incentive mechanism in use...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the 2011 Supreme Court decision in United States v. Freeman. At issue was whether defendants, such as Freeman, who enter a guilty plea pursuant to a binding plea agreement, are entitled to seek a modification of their sentence when the guideline range applicable to their offense has subsequently been lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission. By a five-to-four vote, the Court found that Freeman was eligible to seek a sentence reduction. However, as the article explains, the concurring and controlling opinion of Justice Sotomayor may ultimately prove to be problematic for criminal defendants generally and for the Commission {{for many years to}} come. In her opinion, Sotomayor suggests, in dicta, that the government can preempt future sentencing reduction claims through the insertion in plea agreements of waiver clauses. Should the Department of Justice adopt such a policy, the article warns of (and describes) the long-term adverse consequences that such a decision would have for criminal defendants and for ability of the Commission to achieve equity through guideline sentencing. As part of its critique of Freeman, the article also explains why the Freeman Court erred in its analytical approach. In so doing, it illuminates the real world of plea bargaining in the Freeman context, and explains why this plea negotiation truism provides a sounder, firmer, and clearer foundation to decide not only Freeman-type cases but any such case involving a sentence reduction claim. The article also uses Freeman to highlight and correct a common misunderstanding about the nature of plea agreement contracts. It explains why plea agreements have been erroneously construed as <b>unilateral</b> <b>arrangements</b> between the prosecution and the defendant, and why they should properly be interpreted as bilateral contracts involving three parties — the prosecution, the defendant and the court...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gauge the {{performance}} of <b>unilateral</b> target zones <b>arrangements</b> in two Latin American countries, Mexico and Chile. In doing so we look at the institutional and historical evolution of these exchange rate regimes. We then deal with performance in a more formal fashion by looking at the stochastic behavior of the exchange rates and the credibility of the target zones using techniques developed by Svensson (1991) and Chen and Giovannini (1992 a, 1992 b, and 1993). The results indicate both the Chilean and Mexican arrangements have been credible. ...|$|R

It {{looks at the}} foreign exchange market, different balance of payment situations in which countries find themselves and the necessary exchange rate adjustments. It studies the options {{that are available to}} countries in choosing their exchange rate system (type of nominal anchor, nominal anchor versus real target and the degree of sovereignty to be given up) and reviews the historical experience for multilateral options. The actual system is a fragile low-inflation central bank dominated arrangement. Options for the future rest on quite a few idealistic ideas. In addition to choosing the exchange rate system, adopting the right exchange rate is also addressed.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{the result of}} research undertaken at the School of Economics of the University of New South Wales between July 2010 and March 2013. It {{is a collection of}} four theoretical papers. Chapter 1 discusses the optimal public policy towards two-part tariff licensing under the assumption that the government intervenes in licensing by setting an upper limit on the royalty level. Compared to the traditional constraint on licensing, the new derived licensing policy brings two kinds of welfare improvements. First, when licensing is welfare-reducing the new policy can prevent it from happening. Second, when licensing is potentially welfare-improving the new policy can take full advantage of its benefits. Chapter 2 compares two commonly observed licensing forms, profit-sharing licensing and per-unit royalty licensing. In a duopoly with symmetric product differentiation, it proves that profit-sharing licensing and per-unit royalty licensing are equivalent to each other regarding both the profitability and the welfare influences. Chapter 3 analyzes <b>unilateral</b> partial ownership <b>arrangement</b> and technology licensing between asymmetric competitors. It is found that the equilibrium output allocation under licensing is inefficient, the introduction of partial ownership arrangement can improve it and under some conditions the improvement in allocation efficiency can raise both industry profit and social welfare. This conclusion explains the concurrence of licensing and equity purchases in business practice and gives a policy-wise justification for partial integration conducted for the purpose of future technology transfer. By introducing two-part tariff licensing, Chapter 4 reconsiders the relative dominance of the price-setting strategy and the quantity-setting strategy in an asymmetric duopoly setting. It shows that if the initial cost difference is small or the goods are close substitutes firms will both prefer the quantity strategy, whereas for the other cases a heterogeneous strategy equilibrium will appear, under which the advanced firm chooses the price strategy and the backward firm chooses the quantity strategy. With endogenous mode of market competition, licensing is always welfare-improving. Some of the material is adapted from previously published or accepted articles in the following journals, The Manchester School (2013) for Chapter 1 and Economic Modelling (2013) for Chapter 2...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} quantitative {{estimates of}} the impact of the European trade agreements on trade flows. It applies both static and dynamic panel estimation techniques. The results are useful to policymakers because new intra-European trade agreements are being negotiated. In the absence of a further expansion of the European Union, estimates of alternative policies may help to clarify the policy debate. The paper also illustrates that the performance of individual countries under the trade agreements can be explained in terms of their macroeconomic environment. The conclusions are likely to be relevant to the western Balkan countries and Ukraine.

40|$|Preferential trade {{agreements}} (PTAs) in the Asia-Pacific region have proliferated rapidly {{over the past}} five years and are creating a complex web of intersecting bilateral and regional {{trade agreements}}. This paper describes the proliferation of these PTAs, discusses their characteristics and implementation, and assesses their potential effects. Realizing the potential gains from Asia-Pacific PTAs requires a commitment to liberalize sensitive sectors, to maintain consistent provisions, and to enforce agreements. Other factors, including administrative complications, also could undermine any potential gains.
