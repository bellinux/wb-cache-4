5|$|Risk is a {{combination}} of hazard, vulnerability and likelihood of occurrence, which can be the probability of a specific <b>undesirable</b> consequence of a hazard, or the combined probability of <b>undesirable</b> consequences of all the hazards of an activity.|$|E
5|$|Aversive {{conditioning}} deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise {{makers and}} rubber bullets are used {{each time the}} bear performs an <b>undesirable</b> action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will {{be less likely to}} continue the <b>undesirable</b> behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the camps}} housed {{political}} opponents; over time, <b>undesirable</b> members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were {{placed in the}} camps as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an <b>undesirable</b> member of society. This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, the Reichsarbeitsdienst {{took over}} the camp and used it later as a Nazi {{internment}} camp for <b>undesirables.</b>|$|R
50|$|More {{effective}} {{techniques for}} controlling <b>undesirables</b> without inconveniences to legitimate DEA users might include: recognizing legitimate DEAs {{for what they}} are (they usually have a proper domain and a fixed prefix or suffix), distinguishing them from short-lived, random throwaway address patterns or domains used by <b>undesirables,</b> wildcard banning (e.g., if a real person John Smith, using DEA, needs to be banned, he can be banned as john.smith*@(domain) or even *@(domain), based on their DEA pattern).|$|R

5|$|Most of the Sinhalese {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely {{absent from the}} alphabet. This is because Sinhala used to be written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was <b>undesirable,</b> and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E
5|$|Regions {{with low}} seismic risk {{are safe for}} most earth buildings, but {{historic}} construction techniques often cannot resist even medium earthquake levels effectively because of earthen buildings' three highly <b>undesirable</b> qualities as a seismic building material: being relatively 'weak, heavy and brittle'. However, earthen buildings can be built to resist seismic loads.|$|E
5|$|The {{elimination}} step is not regioselective; if multiple β-hydrogens {{are available}} for elimination, various products are often observed as mixtures. This is highly <b>undesirable</b> from an efficiency standpoint as arduous separation is typically required.|$|E

5|$|The most {{noticeable}} difference in behaviour between a distributed element filter and its lumped-element approximation {{is that the}} former will have multiple passband replicas of the lumped-element prototype passband, because transmission line transfer characteristics repeat at harmonic intervals.

5000|$|In August 1948, singer Nat King Cole {{purchased}} a house from Col. Harry Gantz, the former husband of silent film actress Lois Weber, in the all-white Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Ku Klux Klan, still active in Los Angeles {{well into the}} 1950s, responded by placing a burning cross on his front lawn. Members of the property-owners association told Cole {{they did not want}} any <b>undesirables</b> moving into the neighborhood. Cole famously retorted, [...] "Neither do I. And if I see any <b>undesirables</b> coming in here, I'll be the first to complain." ...|$|R
5|$|ACC teams viewed a {{berth in}} the Humanitarian Bowl as <b>undesirable</b> due to its location. Aside from {{being one of the}} lower {{priority}} tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively expensive and historically caused low turnout among ACC fans. In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were nominally {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him. Nevertheless, from 1936 the Japanese Army and Navy held, effectively, a legal right to nominate (or refuse to nominate) their respective ministers. Thus, they could prevent the formation of <b>undesirable</b> governments, or by resignation bring about the collapse of an existing government.|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many <b>undesirable</b> side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5000|$|The Bavarians practiced a form {{of local}} justice where the village folk would run <b>undesirables</b> out of town. This was called haberfeldtreiben (driven to the oat field). <b>Undesirables</b> ranged from fallen women to usurers and con artists. [...] In Vagen the most {{recently}} recorded haberfeldtreiben was in 1716. Information about this haberfeldtreiben was preserved because {{the father of the}} defendant sued seventeen of the village folk for assault. The case was thrown out with the court ruling that the haberfeldtreiben had been a proper use of local customary law.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an <b>undesirable</b> revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E
5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically <b>undesirable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Copper is used {{to create}} stills for distilling spirits, for example to make whisky.
