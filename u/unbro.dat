25|$|The {{organization}} was initially run with WFP; in 1988 UNDP {{took over the}} administration of <b>UNBRO</b> from WFP. In 1991 the UN Secretary General decided that UNHCR would replace UNDP as the administrative agency. The UNHCR Representative in Thailand had the title of Director of <b>UNBRO,</b> but the <b>UNBRO</b> Deputy Director, whose sole responsibility was <b>UNBRO,</b> administered the day-to-day operations. <b>UNBRO</b> was phased out in December 2001.|$|E
25|$|Fourth, <b>UNBRO</b> {{assisted}} civilians only. This {{meant that}} <b>UNBRO</b> expected the camps {{to be free}} of military influence of any kind, and that no military activity was to take place in or through <b>UNBRO</b> camps at any time.|$|E
25|$|Between 1994 and 2001, <b>UNBRO</b> sent 252 {{cartons of}} records to the {{off-site}} storage center used by UN organizations in Bangkok. On three occasions, in 1998, 1999, and 2001, the Deputy Director of <b>UNBRO</b> authorized {{the destruction of}} these records.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{principle}} concerned <b>UNBRO's</b> equal {{commitment to}} upholding operational efficiency {{as well as}} humanitarian principles.|$|R
25|$|<b>UNBRO</b> also {{supervised}} {{the provision of}} water in the border camps, few of which had access to natural sources of potable water. Each week trucks supplied by the Thai government transported 650,000 liters of chlorinated water to storage tanks in the camps. In addition, <b>UNBRO</b> supplied building materials to refugees and implemented an agricultural program to produce fresh vegetables in the camps.|$|E
25|$|<b>UNBRO</b> was a {{temporary}} agency, {{created by the}} UN General Assembly to address a specific crisis. It had a mandate but no charter or independent governing council. Nor did it have an independent budget; it {{had to rely on}} the support of donor countries from the General Assembly, solicited through pledges at donor meetings twice a year. <b>UNBRO</b> received its monetary and in-kind donations primarily from the United States, the European Commission, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.|$|E
25|$|This ration was {{designed}} to meet a minimum daily average of 2457 calories per person, the emergency caloric requirement set by the UN according to a 1985 WHO report on protein and energy requirements. When the direct distribution system was initiated in 1987, the energy supplied by a basic <b>UNBRO</b> ration was 2237 calories per person per day. In 1991 budgetary constraints forced <b>UNBRO</b> to reduce this basic ration to 2027 calories per person per day. Food distributions included 120grams a month of soap.|$|E
25|$|<b>UNBRO</b> {{delegated}} {{responsibility for}} basic medical services, sanitation, public {{and environmental health}} programs, supplementary feeding and other services to numerous nongovernmental aid agencies operating on the border at that time.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Border Relief Operation (<b>UNBRO)</b> was a donor-nation funded {{relief effort}} for Cambodian {{refugees}} and others affected {{by years of}} warfare along the Thai-Cambodian border. It functioned from 1982 until 2001.|$|E
25|$|Food {{and some}} water were {{provided}} by the World Food Program {{under the supervision of}} the United Nations Border Relief Operation (<b>UNBRO).</b> Deep wells also provided potable water for much of the camp.|$|E
25|$|First, <b>UNBRO</b> was a {{humanitarian}} operation which remained neutral {{in areas of}} religion, politics and nationalistic alignment. This meant that assistance was to be provided equally to all full-time residents of UNBRO-assisted camps, regardless of their political affiliation.|$|E
25|$|<b>UNBRO</b> {{oversaw the}} {{internal}} {{security of the}} camps, although theft and violence plagued camps that were not {{under the control of}} the Khmer Rouge. <b>UNBRO</b> coordinated the different organizations providing protection on the border: ICRC was specifically concerned with war crimes, political crimes, and human rights violations, and the Khmer Police took care of traditional police functions within the camps. Between 1980 and 1987 security in the camps was the responsibility of a special Thai Rangers unit known as Task Force 80, however this unit violated human rights so extensively that it was disbanded and replaced by the DPPU (the Displaced Persons Protection Unit, a specially trained paramilitary unit created in 1987 expressly to provide security for the border camps). It was responsible for protecting camp boundaries and preventing bandits from entering the camps.|$|E
25|$|Other {{services}} fluctuated {{over the}} years, but in September 1983 supplementary feeding was being handled by Catholic Relief Services (CRS), sanitation and maternal-child health by World Concern, physical rehabilitation by Handicap International, and security by <b>UNBRO.</b> CRS also operated a mobile dental {{team and the}} Japan International Volunteer Center (JVC) provided a weekly X-ray service.|$|E
25|$|Most United Nations {{member states}} and nongovernmental {{agencies}} still consider <b>UNBRO</b> {{to have been}} a model UN operation that efficiently and cost-effectively provided essential support to more than 350,000 Cambodian civilians and {{played a major role in}} saving the lives of thousands living under the harsh control of the Khmer Rouge or who were subject to shelling by Vietnamese forces.|$|E
25|$|Third, the Articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights {{were to be}} used as much as {{possible}} as a guideline for all aspects of camp life. This meant that no one was to be removed by force from an <b>UNBRO</b> camp for any reason; free thought, free speech and free access to education and information should be guaranteed for all; the camps should be free of political or any other kind of coercion; and protection and justice for camp residents should be provided by the Khmer Police and an internal justice system.|$|E
25|$|Khao-I-Dang Holding Center was a Cambodian {{refugee camp}} located 20km north of Aranyaprathet in Prachinburi (now Sa Kaeo) Province of Thailand. The most {{enduring}} refugee {{camp on the}} Thai-Cambodian border, it was established in late 1979 and administered by the Thai Ministry of the Interior and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- unlike other camps on the border, which were administered by a coalition made up of UNICEF, the World Food Program, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) (briefly) and, after 1982, the United Nations Border Relief Operation (<b>UNBRO).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{with the}} {{agreement}} of the Royal Thai Government, <b>UNBRO</b> launched a major new educational assistance program, focusing at the primary level and providing support for curriculum development, the printing of educational materials, primary education, special education, adult literacy, and teacher training and the training of teacher trainers, the provision of supplies and the construction and equipment of classrooms. It also greatly expanded its support for social service programs targeting vulnerable and neglected groups and initiated new programs aimed at the development of life skills that would be useful in Cambodia upon repatriation. In all of these programs it strove to exclude political content and ensure that services would be provided equitably to all camp residents regardless of their political orientation. It promoted an ethic of egalitarianism and a system of reward based on merit.|$|E
2500|$|Second, <b>UNBRO</b> camps were to {{be managed}} by the Khmers as much as {{circumstances}} on the border allowed. <b>UNBRO</b> recognized a civilian administration consisting of a chief administrator and his deputies, the Khmer Women's Association, section leaders, and various administrative ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>UNBRO</b> also {{maintained}} a small team of Protection Officers, {{whose job it}} was to monitor the human rights situation in the camps, follow up cases in which people were victimized either deliberately or through poverty, neglect, or [...] "system failure", and encourage {{people to come to}} them when they felt their human rights had been abused. <b>UNBRO</b> assumed responsibility for field communications and security coordination for UN and voluntary agency personnel officially working at the border (i.e. working on programs under agreement with <b>UNBRO).</b>|$|E
2500|$|As of January 1982, <b>UNBRO</b> {{provided}} {{services to}} 290,000 beneficiaries in three groups: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Khmer {{civilian}} {{administration and}} leadership...has rapidly {{given way to}} military or paramilitary leadership, whose visible and active presence has transformed most major settlements into armed camps. Weapons and military equipment are in plain evidence and are brandished amongst the <b>UNBRO</b> and voluntary agency personnel {{as they attempt to}} provide relief assistance. As a consequence, the control and direction of food distribution and provision of medical services has become less efficient, more precarious and often dangerous. <b>UNBRO</b> officials have been abused and held at gun-point. During the offensive, <b>UNBRO</b> and voluntary agency personnel have been subject to grave personal risk as a consequence of artillery bombardment and other military action..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{concluded}} that <b>UNBRO</b> served a purpose beyond humanitarianism—namely {{as a vehicle}} to deliver support to anti-Vietnamese factions operating out of the refugee camps located in UNBRO's area of operations, thereby complicating Vietnam's efforts to play a decisive role in Cambodia's internal politics. <b>UNBRO</b> was also extensively criticized for failing to provide adequate protection for refugee camp residents from theft and violence.|$|E
2500|$|... • 65,000 Thai border {{residents}} {{living in}} villages affected by conflict also received <b>UNBRO</b> food aid through the Affected Thai Village Program.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1982, <b>UNBRO</b> was {{established}} to coordinate border relief operations {{under the direction of}} the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations for Coordination of Cambodian Humanitarian Assistance Programs (OSRSG), then headed by Sir Robert Jackson. Known originally as [...] "WFP-UNBRO", its first director was the UNDP's Resident Coordinator in Bangkok, Winston R. Prattley, who also served as WFP representative. Because the operation had no staff at the beginning, UNICEF agreed to a six-month loan of its Kampuchean Emergency Unit until <b>UNBRO</b> could hire its own people.|$|E

2500|$|... • 155,000 Cambodians in nine {{camps in}} the border's Central sector {{stretching}} from Ban Sangae to Tap Prik. In five {{camps in the}} Central (or Northwestern) sector (Ban Sangae, Kok Tahan, Phnom Chat, Nong Samet and Nong Chan) <b>UNBRO</b> was permitted to carry out frequent headcounts and direct distribution of food. <b>UNBRO</b> also distributed food {{in two of the}} Khmer Rouge camps to the south of Aranyaprathet (Nong Prue and Tap Prik) although initially it was not permitted to carry out headcounts. The Central sector also included NW82, a subcamp located at Nong Samet housing 800 [...] assisted by ICRC.|$|E
2500|$|<b>UNBRO</b> {{took charge}} of food {{distribution}} to refugees along the border, where previously there had been widespread diversion of supplies to the Thai military and to Khmer resistance units. By the late 1980s <b>UNBRO</b> had standardized its basic weekly food ration so as to provide adequate daily caloric intake established by the World Health Organization. On a per person basis rice, canned or dried fish, one egg and a vegetable were distributed weekly; dried beans, oil, salt, and wheat flour were given once a month. Exact amounts for the weekly and monthly rations in 1990 were as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1984-1985 Vietnamese dry-season {{offensive}} {{the number}} of refugee camps administered by <b>UNBRO</b> was reduced from [...] to [...] as the refugee population was consolidated into larger camps such as Site Two.|$|E
2500|$|<b>UNBRO</b> {{operated}} {{on the basis}} of five working principles, laid out in an internal memo on policy guidelines dated July 1982. These principles were revised and updated in an internal memo on policy guidelines dated 2 August 1989 [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{protection}} {{was central to}} UNBRO's purpose in Thailand, {{as it was the}} victimization by war of Cambodian civilians that motivated the establishment of the border relief operation in the first place. While acknowledging that [...] "physical safety is impossible to ensure and constantly at risk" [...] in the border camps, <b>UNBRO</b> nevertheless outlined a broad definition of protection as a goal toward which all its activities would be oriented. This included protection from persecution by any military source, physical or political coercion, criminal victimization, extortion and/or the threat of violent revenge, as well as protection from the negative effects of severe overcrowding, unemployment, limited educational opportunities, etc.|$|E
