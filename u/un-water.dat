40|$|Five {{complete}} caverns {{were discovered}} in Longyou in 1992. They were manually caved in argillaceous siltstone at shallow depths more than 2000 years ago. When they were <b>un-watered,</b> their integrity was maintained completely, and their interior rock surfaces were free of old cracks. Since then, however, the rock's interior faces have initiated and propagated more and more cracks. This paper attempts {{to address the question}} of why the rock interior faces were free of old cracks once they were unearthed. To address this question, this paper proposes a hypothesis that the argillaceous siltstone has the ability of self-healing its cracks over {{a short period of time}} under weak acid water environment. Data and evidence are presented herewith to prove the hypothesis. They include observations and measurements in the field and test results in the laboratory. Specifically, a three-point bending test is used to form a tensile crack in a rectangular rock specimen and a dead load test for the specimen immersed in initially weak acid water is used for self-healing its crack. The results have shown that the argillaceous siltstone is in a state of weak alkalinity and the rain water at the site is in a state of weak acidity. Therefore, when it is immersed in weak acid water for some time, the argillaceous siltstone would be able to make chemical reactions to generate new minerals such as calcite. The new minerals would be able to infill the cracks and then heal the crack within a few years. Once the crack is self-healed, the rock can regain its strength and integrity. Consequently, the rock interior surfaces could be free of old cracks when the water was pumped out of the caverns. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2006–2007, the NWSC tariff for {{domestic}} use was US$0.64 per cubic metre. Taken {{from a public}} standpipe, the tariff was US$0.42 per cubic metre or less than US$0.01 per jerrycan. The average commercial tariff was US$1.00 per cubic metre. For commercial users, a rising block tariff structure was used. A customer who {{was connected to the}} sewerage system would pay an additional charge of 75-100 percent. Although water is cheapest at standpipes, <b>UN-Water</b> reports that in this case users usually have to pay the costs of operating a stand tap and thus in the end pay more. A cross subsidy arrangement enables NWSC to keep in operation systems that do not cover operation and maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|Although Uganda's {{official}} {{policy is to}} promote tariffs that cover all costs, the NWSC tariff actually covers only operation and maintenance costs. According to a 2003 published report, the second performance contract between the government of Uganda and NWSC provided for a tariff policy {{that in the long}} term covered operation, maintenance, and a part of the future investments. Although the current tariff structure does recover operation and maintenance costs, the tariffs are not high enough to finance system expansion, leaving system improvement and extension investments to the national government and international donors. According to <b>UN-Water,</b> full cost recovery tariffs including investments would require a significant rise of tariffs. William T. Muhairwe in 2006 asserted that full cost recovery in least developed countries is a myth. According to him, tariffs would have to increase by 90 percent to provide full cost recovery.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Water {{treatments}} {{were applied}} to young ponderosa pine trees in the Eastern Cascades, Oregon during the 2003 growing season, and shade treatments were applied during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons to understand how photosynthesis and soil respiration, particularly the root/rhizosphere fraction (R[subscript rrh]), would respond to increased moisture availability through watering and possibly decreased belowground supply of current photosynthate due to shading. This forest typically experiences high soil water deficits in July and August that limit photosynthesis and respiration. Watered trees were did not achieve a greater photosynthetic capacity than control (<b>un-watered)</b> trees, despite sustained sap flux. Soil respiration was [approximately] 140 % greater in watered/un-shaded trees in 2003, but the R[subscript rrh] fraction did not show an increase until 2004. This was explained by a 30 % increase in fine root biomass by 2004 and almost doubled root specific respiration rates (respiration per gram of fine root) by then end of the 2003 growing season. After an entire year of shading, carboxylation (V[subscript cmax]) of shade-developed needles was higher than un-shaded needles in early spring (May), but decreased compared to un-shaded trees by late June; Amax was consistently lower for shaded compared to un-shaded trees. Soil respiration was coupled to canopy processes, decreasing gradually through the growing season, but no effect was found on R[subscript rrh] fraction of that respiration. The ratio of foliage mass developed during treatments to fine root mass indicated that carbon allocation may have shifted belowground in shaded trees. The interaction of shade and water reduced moisture stress by decreasing moisture stress experienced in the canopy and increasing soil water availability, which allowed for minimal maintenance of photosynthesis and drastically increased soil respiration 250 % compared to control trees. The long-term implications are that photosynthesis and soil respiration are strongly driven by current and previous years' photosynthetic potential and moisture availability. Predicting the response of R[subscript rrh] and its contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange to future climate change may be underestimated without accounting for environmental conditions {{of the previous year}} and carry over effects on carbon allocation and root biomass accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal drying of {{expansive}} clay soils in {{the inner}} metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia, leads to building damage due to differential shrinkage of the soil under footings. Trees are often the cause of soil drying, with 53 % of damage reports associated with trees occurring on average during the driest months of February to May inclusive. Two experiments were conducted on established trees located {{in the streets of}} inner Melbourne in 1992 and 1993 - the first to investigate water relations of different species of trees and the second to investigate soil movement in relation to pre-dawn water potential of the leaf of an adjacent tree. The first experiment included 5 species - Ulmus glabra 'lutescens", Fraxinus oxycarpa, Platanus acerifolia which are exotic, deciduous species and Lophostemon confertus and Eucalyptus maculata which are native evergreen species. There were 10 replicates of each, half of which were regularly watered, with the other half exposed to natural weather conditions. Measurements of pre-dawn (?d) and mid-day (?noon) leaf water potentials, stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (Et) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were taken at more or less regular monthly intervals during the active growing season i. e. from September to May. Corresponding vapour pressure deficit (D) was derived from saturation vapour pressure tables and relative humidity. Mild weather conditions during the experiment (lower than average D and higher than average rainfall) limited the range over which readings could be taken. All species except Platanus showed seasonal soil water depletion, as indicated by ?d, and while ?d in Ulmus and Eucalyptus rose slightly towards the end, in Lophostemon and Fraxinus ?d continued to decline or remain low. Platanus had high soil water availability throughout the experiment for unexplained reasons. Ulmus and Eucalyptus demonstrated stomatal control in response to declining ?d, or possibly ?noon, but there were differences in the level of ?d at which the responses occurred, with Ulmus closing stomata earlier than Eucalyptus, although differences due to site, tree size or prior soil water storage could not be accounted for. Lophostemon and Fraxinus showed poor stomata) control and gs {{did not seem to be}} influenced by any particular combination of biotic or abiotic parameters. Lophostemon was the only species observed to wilt during the duration of the experiment. All species showed a significant effect of sample-date on all four biotic parameters, with the exception of Fraxinus, in which gs was not affected. These findings suggest that Ulmus and Eucalyptus may be suitable for planting in expansive clay soils near buildings but Lophostemon and Fraxinus may not be. Watering was generally inadequate to cause large responses in physiological behaviour and differences where they did occur tended to be due to long term, cumulative effects of small differences rather than short term large effects. However, watering did result in significantly higher ?d and ?noon overall in Ulmus, higher ?noon in Fraxinus, lower ?noon in Platanus and higher ?d,?noon, gs and Et in Eucalyptus. The role of watering as a management tool for damage prevention needs further investigation. The second experiment investigated the possible link between d and vertical movement of soil using a floating brick technique to record soil levels. Only Eucalyptus was investigated, due to site conditions and practical limitations, with 4 trees used - 2 watered and 2 <b>un-watered.</b> The results showed that there was a strong linear relationship between ?d and vertical soil movement, z, over the normal volume range of soil shrinkage, and ?d continued to decrease over the range of constant volume condition - representing maximum soil shrinkage. There are obvious advantages to be gained for management of trees near buildings from further research on this relationship. The results also showed a logarithmic relationship between ?d and volumetric soil water content, ?, which supports the widely accepted convention that ?d is a measure of equilibrium water potential between tree and soil.

40|$|Globally, {{almost every}} nation is facing {{some form of}} water crisis (World Commission on Water 2000). In Australia, the sport and {{recreation}} industry {{is one of the}} highest consumers of water. Other high water consuming industries (such as agriculture and farming) have been forced to adhere to strict managerial and governance reform due to the water crisis, yet in the sport and recreation industry, such changes are yet to be implemented and fully realised across the sector. This research examines the impacts of drought and sustainable water management for sport and recreation. Specifically, it provides a case study of sport and recreation provision in a municipality that has already undergone considerable reform due to long-term drought. Sport and recreation use water for purposes such as irrigation of playing fields/pitches, filling swimming pools, stadium amenities and facilities, kitchens, maintenance and cleaning, and clubhouse amenities. For sports that are heavy users of water for the maintenance of playing fields (such as soccer, Australian Rules football, rugby league, rugby union, grass and clay tennis courts to name a few) the impacts of drought and water restrictions have been severe. Some sports have reported an increase in the risk of injury to participants because of the condition of <b>un-watered</b> playing fields (Sport and Recreation Victoria 2007). Others have been forced to delay or shorten their seasons (Sleeman 2007), or worse still, cancel training and organised competition completely (Connolly and Bell 2007). While the impact of water restrictions has been profound on most sports, there are some sports that are not heavy water users and the impact of drought and water restrictions has been minimal. This problem creates issues and apparent inequities raising the need to further examine water consumption in sport and recreation. The potential outcome that arises is that the future of those sports that cannot conduct their competitions may be disadvantaged, while other sports that do not have such problems may be able to flourish. Water, and those who control the supply of it, then defines which sports are able to flourish and sustain sport development pathways, compared to those whose survival may be in jeopardy. This research explores the stakeholder management and governance issues that have resulted for sport and recreation in the City of Greater Geelong (CoGG) located in Victoria, Australia [...] a region in long-term water crisis. The supply of sport and recreation facilities in the CoGG (like most municipalities in Australia) is largely the responsibility of the municipal council. The corporation responsible for the supply of water to the municipality is Barwon Water. Although other sport and recreation facilities exist in the CoGG, the municipal council of CoGG owns and maintains over 120 sporting ovals (including the stadium used by its professional Australian Football League (AFL) team, the Cats), six swimming pools, and three golf courses. The CoGG host their professional AFL team, a range of local, national and international sport events, and provide a wide range of sport and recreation facilities for the community residents. Eight interviews were conducted in total. Interviews were conducted with representatives from CoGG municipal council (who are responsible for the delivery of sport and recreation services and facilities in Geelong), and representatives from Barwon Water (who are responsible for the ongoing provision and maintenance of sport and recreation services and facilities) through the provision of water. Results show that the ten highest users of water in the municipality are sport and recreation facilitieswhich between them use almost one-third of the city 2 ̆ 7 s total water consumption (City of Greater Geelong 2006). The municipal council is under considerable pressure to find ways to continue to provide sport and recreation opportunities for community members, as well as professional athletes and teams who use these facilities despite water restrictions. After all, these facilities provide benefit to spectators and participants, as well as businesses that rely on visitors to Geelong for sport and recreation events. Due to such pressures, from 2007, the CoGG and Barwon Water agreed to provide the sport and recreation sector with water allocations rather than to be denied of all water under the water restriction regimes in place in the municipality. During 2007 summer sport season, this allowed the CoGG to keep 16 of its 120 sporting ovals open for participation through allocating all available water to these fields in order to keep them safe and playable. However, CoGG and Barwon Water were required to devise a rating scale to determine which sports (and sport facilities) were to share the allocated water, and which were not. These decisions also had knock on effects through sports. In order {{to ensure the safety of}} the playing surfaces, the CoGG and Barwon Water also restricted use of fields to competition only, therefore sport participants were forced to train on local beaches and other parkland areas-transferring issues of safety and public liability to other locations and facilities in the community. Further, it was reported that scheduling of competition seasons and individual matches; as well as the allocation of "home ground" gate receipts and concessions profits were required to be governed by the CoGG and Barwon Water as the competing sports were unable to agree. Perhaps more importantly, the rating scale developed for water allocation also resulted in some sports being rated as ineligible for water and as a result were unable to stage their entire competitions. Clearly, the water allocation rating scale, and approach taken in this municipality to the continued delivery of sport and recreation has provided a workable solution. However, this study also signals that new stakeholders have entered the arena for the governance of sport. Governance structures in sport and recreation are being impacted as a result of the water crisis. Those making decisions about which sport and recreation activities and/or facilities will be assisted with water resources are being made by local councils and water corporations. Sport managers are being required to understand existing areas of knowledge (such as turf management) in different ways, to gain knowledge in new areas (such as sustainable water management), and to lobby new stakeholder groups (such as water corporations) in order to secure their futures. The continued existence of some sports is no longer in the hands of governing bodies, but in the hands of local councils, and water corporations. Clearly, any of the solutions implemented as discussed above, require multiple stakeholders to interact, and to reach agreement in order to assist in sustainable management of water in sport and recreation. In this sense, the management of water in sport (and all other industries) is more than a rational decision about policy, legislation, restrictions and resource allocations. It is a social and political process requiring scholarly attention for practical solutions. <br /...|$|R
