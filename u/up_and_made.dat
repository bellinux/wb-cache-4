5|$|The {{first two}} single-car trains were {{delivered}} in 1959 {{and given the}} designation T. They were delivered by Strømmens Værksted and NEBB as prototypes, without compensation from the planning office. They were tested on the Østensjø and Lambertseter Lines until 1 December 1960, when they were transferred to Bærumsbanen, who used them on the Kolsås Line. During their service they were prone to technical problems, and were more in the depot than in service. However, they gave valuable knowledge for the serial production. The trains were originally painted silver with a dark-blue cheatline and numbered 1 and 2. About 1970, they were repainted dark blue with a silver cheatline, and in 1971 given the numbers 451 and 452. The latter remained in service until 1977, when it was put aside, and scrapped in 1987. The former remained in service until it was put aside as defect, although it had rarely been used since 1982. It was fixed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>made</b> operational again 1993, but was withdrawn the same year and scrapped the following year.|$|E

25|$|The PREP is a {{mechanism}} to make public {{the results of the}} election. As soon as the polls closed and the votes were tallied in each polling place, a copy of the acta de escrutinio (the official tallies from the polling place) was sealed in a special envelope with a transparent window. It was then sent to a Center for Information Collation and Transmission (Centro de Acopio y Transmisión de Datos or CEDAT) that was located in the corresponding electoral district. There, the information was captured and transmitted to the central offices of the IFE for public dissemination. The information was then backed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>made</b> public on the IFE website and a number of mirrors. The PREP is not an estimate or a statistical exercise, but rather the full unofficial returns from each polling place, as they were computed at the polls {{on the day of the}} election. They are not official returns, since the tallies must be certified by the District's Electoral Council before they become official. The PREP would continue to collate data until all polling places reported or until the early morning hours of Monday July 3. If the tally sheets contained certain inconsistencies (e.g., blank entries rather than zeros, illegible totals, etc.), then they were reported separately, under the heading of Irregular, as per prior agreement between the parties, and were not added to the totals as they were received. Where possible, their results were added when the final report was made on Monday morning.|$|E

The pair were similar players in that they held the ball <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>made</b> frequent runs into the box, allowing midfielder Bryan Robson to join in the attack. Whiteside scored four goals in the first five games of the campaign, before entering a seventeen-game drought. He scored six goals in 16 games in domestic cup competitions that season, helping Manchester United to the finals of both the League Cup and FA Cup, notably by scoring past Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-finals. At the age of 17 years and 323 days, he beat Liverpool centre-half Alan Hansen to score in the League Cup final defeat at Wembley, making him the youngest player to score in a League Cup final; his consistent performances against Liverpool during the 1980s earned him the moniker of the [...] "Scourge of the Scousers" [...] from United supporters. He gave an assist to Stapleton in the FA Cup Final, which finished as a 2–2 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion. At the age of 18 years and 18 days, he then scored a headed goal in the replay, which United won 4–0, to become the youngest player score in an FA Cup Final. He also became the first player to score in both domestic cup finals in the same season. He played 57 times in all competitions that season and missed just three league games, scoring a total of 14 goals.|$|E
500|$|At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present {{inflated}} their expenses; in {{the opinion}} of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles. [...] Harris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it. [...] The burning in 1789 of Catherine Murphy, a counterfeiter, was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett. [...] He called it one of [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] and amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the Treason Act 1790, which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning. [...] It was followed by the Treason Act 1814, introduced by Samuel Romilly, a legal reformer. [...] Influenced by his friend, Jeremy Bentham, Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the severity of England's laws was responsible for an increase in crime. [...] When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as [...] "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood". He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy, and in 1814 proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal. [...] However, when it was pointed out {{that this would be a}} less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decollated, [...] "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma." [...] This is what happened to Jeremiah Brandreth, leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the Pentrich rising and one of three men executed in 1817 at Derby Gaol. [...] As with Edward Despard and his confederates the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the Prince Regent were beheaded with an axe. [...] The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. [...] As he held the first head <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>made</b> the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. [...] A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the Cato Street Conspiracy were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. [...] Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls.
