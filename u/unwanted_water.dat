50|$|Many times, {{it happens}} that power {{generation}} from the 150 MW canal based units is not optimised when the Nagarjunasagar reservoir is overflowing on its spillway and very less water {{is required for}} irrigation from the canals during the monsoon floods. Power generation from canal based hydro units can be optimised by running these units during the flooding period by releasing the water fully into the canals. The <b>unwanted</b> canal <b>water</b> can be released into the natural stream when it is crossing the major stream.

5000|$|Sugar candies spoil {{more quickly}} {{if they have}} {{different}} amounts of water {{in different parts of}} the candy (for example, a candy that combines marshmallow and nougat), or if they are stored in high-moisture environments. [...] This process is due to the effects of water activity, which results in the transfer of <b>unwanted</b> <b>water</b> from a high-moisture environment into a low-moisture candy, rendering it rubbery, or the loss of desirable water from a high-moisture candy into a dry environment, rendering the candy dry and brittle.|$|E

50|$|A gravity sewer is {{a conduit}} {{utilizing}} the energy {{resulting from a}} difference in elevation to remove <b>unwanted</b> <b>water.</b> The term sewer implies removal of sewage or surface runoff rather than water intended for use; and the term gravity excludes water movement induced through force mains or vacuum sewers. Most sewers are gravity sewers; because gravity offers reliable water movement with no energy costs wherever grades are favorable. Gravity sewers may drain to sumps where pumping is required to either force sewage to a distant location or lift sewage to a higher elevation for entry into another gravity sewer, and lift stations are often required to lift sewage into sewage treatment plants.|$|E

40|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of separate}} sewer systems is {{the occurrence of}} illicit connections: unintended sewer cross-connections that connect foul water outlets from residential or industrial premises to the storm water system and/or storm water outlets to the foul sewer system. The amount of <b>unwanted</b> storm <b>water</b> in foul sewer systems can be significant resulting {{in a number of}} detrimental effects on the performance of the wastewater system. Efficient removal of storm water inflows into foul sewers requires knowledge on the exact locations of the inflows. This paper presents a monitoring technique {{that can be used to}} localize illicit storm water inflows into foul sewer systems: Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS). Data results from two monitoring campaigns in foul sewer systems in the Netherlands and Germany show the level of detail with which in-sewer processes can be studied. Storm water inflow can be detected as long as the temperature of this inflow differs from the in-sewer temperatures prior to the event. Also, the insewer propagation of storm water can be monitored, enabling a detailed view on advection-dispersion and mixing processes. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the rest}} of June, LST-389 {{shuttled}} supplies and men between Southampton and various beaches along the northern coast of France. Her cargoes included food, medical supplies, and vehicles. After the port's capture by the Allies in July, she added Cherbourg to her itinerary and, railroad tracks having been installed in her tank deck, began carrying rolling stock in early September. In the course of these train-ferrying operations, LST-389 struck an underwater obstruction at Grand Rade, Cherbourg, on 12 November. Major leaks in her main engine room resulted. Unable to make any headway against the rising water, the tank landing ship, aided by two tugboats, was beached. Seven hours of shoring, patching, and pumping freed the engine room of <b>unwanted</b> <b>water.</b> With the aid of British tugs, LST-389 then completed her ferry mission before LST-355 towed her back to Devonport, England. Following major repairs in drydock, the ship received an overhaul alongside [...] before resuming active service in mid-January 1945. She again shuttled railroad cars and passengers between England and France. While returning from Le Havre to Portland, Dorset, early on the fog-shrouded morning of 5 February, LST-389 was rammed by the civilian merchantman SS Chapel Hill Victory. The collision ripped a hole 18 ft wide in the tank landing ship from main deck to bottom and killed one member of her crew. LST-389 then proceeded to Portland under her own power. After a week at anchor off Portland, LST-389 put into Plymouth for another drydocking which lasted into late March. LST-389 next made one trip carrying vehicles to Cherbourg and two more to Le Havre before she had LCT skids installed on her main deck at Falmouth.|$|E
30|$|As {{reservoirs}} mature, {{oil production}} declines while water production rises.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the different rules applied {{by the courts}} in common law jurisdictions {{to the problem of}} disposing of <b>unwanted</b> surface <b>waters</b> and also examines the Victorian Drainage of Land Bill 1975 and earlier legislation. It commences with a study of English decisions and then examines, in detail, the three rules generally applied, describes their weaknesses and advantages and compares them with the rules applied to other categories of water. In the course of this examination the legal rights of private individuals pertaining to the use, control and. disposal of surface waters in respect of each rule is ascertained. This study points out weaknesses in the three rules and suggests modifications to them and to the rule applied in Victoria. In the final chapter, a comparison is made between the present law and the Drainage of Land Bill 1975 and the effect this Bill is likely to have. It also suggests amendments to the Bill as presented to the Victorian Parliament. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

30|$|One {{fundamental}} {{reason for}} a decline in oil production with time is the existence of fractures and permeability variations that exist between the different layers of the reservoir. Fractures present a water-thief zone through which injected flood water channels through, from the injector to the producer, thereby leaving hydrocarbons in the low permeability (non-fractured) zones untouched. The injected flood water follows {{the path of least}} resistance (high permeability zones), bypassing large amount of oil in low permeability matrix. This leads to increased, <b>unwanted</b> <b>water</b> production and poor oil recovery. Therefore, plugging reservoir fractures and thus correcting reservoir heterogeneity (that is conformance control) are key to an increased oil production, and hence the reason for this work.|$|E
30|$|There {{has been}} dealing with {{hydrogen}} at many places in industry, medicine, and research and recently also for driving automotive vehicles. Hydrogen sensors in such places are needed for safety reasons because hydrogen, which cannot be detected with human senses, has a wide flammable range (4 % to 75 %) and its easy leakage into the environment forms a dangerous explosive of high power. Another good usage is in a device for detecting leaks in a high-vacuum apparatus. In addition, hydrogen sensors are used inside of various machineries to measure hydrogen concentration, like in various engines using hydrogen fuel. Of course, the last case requires hydrogen sensors which are stable also at high temperatures. Hydrogen monitoring is essential also in various industrial processes where hydrogen can appear via <b>unwanted</b> reactions with <b>water</b> [1].|$|R
50|$|Most {{species are}} filter feeders that sieve small particles, mainly {{phytoplankton}} (microscopic floating plants), {{out of the}} water. The freshwater species Plumatella emarginata feeds on diatoms, green algae, cyanobacteria, non-photosynthetic bacteria, dinoflagellates, rotifers, protozoa, small nematodes, and microscopic crustaceans. While the currents that bryozoans generate to draw food towards the mouth are well understood, the exact method of capture is still debated. All species also flick larger particles towards the mouth with a tentacle, and a few capture zooplankton (planktonic animals) by using their tentacles as cages. In addition the tentacles, whose surface area is increased by microvilli (small hairs and pleats), absorb organic compounds dissolved in the <b>water.</b> <b>Unwanted</b> particles may be flicked away by tentacles or shut out by closing the mouth. A study in 2008 showed that both encrusting and erect colonies fed more quickly and grew faster in gentle than in strong currents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quality of}} {{irrigation}} water {{is very important}} to maintain soil fertility and tilth, and for using more soil depth by the plants. When soil is irrigated with high alkaline <b>water,</b> <b>unwanted</b> sodium salts build up in the soil which would make soil draining capacity very poor. So plant roots can not penetrate deep into the soil for optimum growth in Alkali soils. When soil is irrigated with low pH / acidic water, the useful salts ( [...] Ca, Mg, K, P, S, etc.) are removed by draining water from the acidic soil and in addition unwanted aluminium and manganese salts to the plants are dissolved from the soil impeding plant growth. [...] When soil is irrigated with high salinity water or sufficient water is not draining out from the irrigated soil, the soil would convert into saline soil or lose its fertility. Saline water enhance the turgor pressure or osmotic pressure requirement which impedes the off take of water and nutrients by the plant roots.|$|R
