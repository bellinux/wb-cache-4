5|$|Consequently, {{when the}} Sisters of Death arrived in Mega-City One, they found Kraken there instead of Dredd. Finding Kraken to be {{vulnerable}} to manipulation by their psychic powers, as he was still torn by latent subconscious loyalty to his late master Judd, {{they were able to}} <b>use</b> <b>him</b> as their agent to free Judge Death from captivity and begin their conquest of the city. Had Dredd not resigned, they might not have found their task so easy. Dredd eventually returned to the city and defeated them.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Ellis {{played for}} the Asheville Tourists of the Class AA Southern League, {{pitching}} to a 10–9 win–loss record, a 2.77 earned run average (ERA), and an All-Star Game appearance. The Pirates called Ellis up to the majors {{near the end of}} the season, but the team did not <b>use</b> <b>him</b> in a game that year.|$|E

60|$|In some way, she was {{not afraid}} of him at all. In some other way she <b>used</b> <b>him</b> as a mere magic implement, <b>used</b> <b>him</b> with the most amazing priestess-craft.

5|$|On July 6, 2010 at Miller Park, in a 6-1 {{win over}} the Milwaukee Brewers, Bumgarner earned his first career victory by going eight innings without {{yielding}} a run. Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer returned from the disabled list in August, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy chose to <b>use</b> <b>him</b> in the bullpen and leave Bumgarner in the rotation.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2010, Rhys Ifans was {{confirmed}} {{to be the}} unnamed villain, and two days later his character was revealed to be Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard. Arad said that Lizard is his favorite Spider-Man villain, and he had long wanted to <b>use</b> <b>him</b> in a film. Well before the choice of villain, Arad had had conceptual drawings prepared for the character.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria {{proved more}} {{dangerous}} to Yamhad than Mari. The Assyrian king was an ambitious conqueror {{with the aim}} to rule Mesopotamia and the Levant, and called himself king of the World. Shamshi-Adad surrounded Yamhad by alliances with Charchemish, Hassum and Urshu {{to the north and}} by conquering Mari to the east forcing Zimri-Lim the heir of Mari to flee. Sumu-Epuh welcomed Zimri-Lim and aimed to <b>use</b> <b>him</b> against Assyria since he was the legitimate heir of Mari.|$|E

50|$|Smith {{agreed to}} a four-year, $15 million {{contract}} with the Buffalo Bills on July 28, 2011. The Bills <b>used</b> <b>him</b> that season mostly out of wildcat formations, and they also <b>used</b> <b>him</b> as a wide receiver. During the 2012 season, Smith returned a 89-yard kick off for a touchdown in a loss vs. the Tennessee Titans.|$|R
5|$|By mid-October, Diệm and Nhu knew of {{the coup}} plans, but {{did not know that}} Đính was firmly among them, {{although}} they were wary of him. Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to <b>use</b> <b>him</b> to trap them, and not sure which side he was really on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5|$|Despite Grey Worm and Missandei's objections, Tyrion Lannister {{arranges}} {{a diplomatic}} {{meeting with the}} masters of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis. He proposes a deal allowing the cities seven years to transition away from slavery, while compensating the masters for any losses. In return, the masters will cease their support of the Sons of the Harpy. As the masters deliberate, Tyrion is confronted by the former slaves of Meereen, who oppose any kind of negotiation with the masters. Grey Worm and Missandei reluctantly support Tyrion, but in private they warn him that the masters, whom they are both familiar with, will <b>use</b> <b>him</b> if he tries to use them.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated, Kertész left Keystone after Prince {{left the}} company in 1937. He was {{commissioned}} by Harper's Bazaar for {{an article on the}} Saks Fifth Avenue department store in their April 1937 issue. The magazine continued to <b>use</b> <b>him</b> in further issues, and he also took commissions from Town and Country to supplement his income. Vogue invited the photographer to work for the magazine, but he declined, believing it was not appropriate work for him. He chose to work for Life magazine, starting with a piece called The Tugboat. Despite orders, he photographed more than just tugboats, including works on the entire harbor and its activities. Life refused to publish the unauthorized photographs. Kertész resented the constraints on his curiosity.|$|E

S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Jeffrey Mace boards the S.H.I.E.L.D. plane Zephyr-One that is commanded by agent Phil Coulson, whom Robbie and former agent Daisy Johnson {{have been working with}} unbeknownst to Mace. Johnson, Robbie, and Gabe hide from Mace in a special containment module {{on the bottom of the}} Zephyr, and Robbie explains the truth to Gabe: the night he was paralyzed, Robbie was killed in the car crash, and was resurrected when a Ghost Rider passed on the Spirit of Vengeance to him.|$|E
5|$|Later, new officer Ruth Evershed, {{transferred}} from Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), informs {{the team that}} Metropolitan Police have arrested Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun, an Algerian secret service agent. After his release Khaldun reveals that {{since the death of}} his family, he desired to leave Algeria to work for British intelligence, so he fooled his agency into believing he was killed while stopping a jihadist group in France, before smuggling himself into England via a Channel Tunnel freight train. The team allow him to work undercover in Parkmount, posing as a labourer at the local university, where he quickly gains Rachid's trust. Beforehand however, Khaldun removes all the surveillance equipment on him. Furthermore, news of Khaldun's arrival also gains the interest of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who also wish to <b>use</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lord Walder Frey {{receives}} {{word that}} Riverrun has been retaken by Brynden Tully, {{commonly known as}} the Blackfish, Catelyn Stark's uncle and a staunchly loyal officer in Robb Stark's army. Walder chastises his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers, who had been ordered to hold the castle. They defend their loss, as several Riverlords, including House Mallister and House Blackwood, have risen in rebellion against the Freys, and the Brotherhood Without Banners are raiding their supply lines and camps. Walder demands that the Tully stronghold be taken back, refusing to be humiliated by not being able to hold a single castle. He orders his men to bring in Edmure Tully, held as a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding, and declares that they will <b>use</b> <b>him</b> to retake Riverrun.|$|E

5|$|Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth {{to pitch}} two {{exhibition}} games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, {{he was not}} restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in The Babe Ruth Story (1948)—that the young pitcher {{had a habit of}} signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not <b>use</b> <b>him</b> at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not <b>use</b> <b>him</b> for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E
5|$|Massino testified {{again in}} the 2012 {{extortion}} trial of Genovese capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide background as {{an expert on the}} American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to <b>use</b> <b>him</b> after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal. Massino had also been considered as a witness in the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace, but was dropped after he was unable to fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement in the murder of NYPD officer Ralph Dols.|$|E

50|$|Hal Roach <b>used</b> <b>him</b> in his third-billed {{character}} role in One Million B.C. (1940) as Victor Mature's caveman father, Chaney {{began to}} be viewed as a character actor in the mold of his father. He had in fact designed a swarthy, ape-like Neanderthal make-up on himself for the film, but production decisions and union rules prevented his following through on emulating his father in that fashion. Cecil B. de Mille <b>used</b> <b>him</b> in a support role in North West Mounted Police (1940) and MGM <b>used</b> <b>him</b> in Billy the Kid (1941 film) (1941). That studio considered putting Chaney Jr in a remake of his father's hit He Who Gets Slapped but decided not to make it.|$|R
50|$|When {{he was a}} {{three year}} old, McNab broke {{him to be a}} saddle horse by <b>using</b> <b>him</b> for a cow horse. He <b>used</b> <b>him</b> this way for two years. Midnight's spirit was so erratic that he was ready to buck anyone off even after a one or two day ride. According to an article by a writer in the Oklahoman, Midnight is a legend. And legends lend {{themselves}} to erratic recounting, especially when they are from early days. The writer, who is a rodeo historian, has heard the tale told in two ways. Midnight was a bucker right from the start. Or, Midnight was broken and NcNab <b>used</b> <b>him</b> on the ranch.|$|R
5|$|Odan (Franc Luz), a mediator, boards the Enterprise to {{negotiate}} a peace treaty between two hostile races. Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) is charmed by the man, and the two share a love affair during the trip. Odan refuses to use the transporter and requests that a shuttle and pilot be provided for him; Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) honors this request. During the mission, the shuttle is attacked by a dissident faction and Odan is mortally injured. While {{trying to save the}} alien in sickbay, Dr. Crusher comes to learn that Odan is a Trill, a species which symbiotically lives within its host's body. It is a further revealed by Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) that the transporter would have harmed the symbiotic lifeform. Following the death of Odan's host body, Commander Riker volunteers to allow Odan <b>use</b> <b>him</b> as a host to conduct the necessary negotiations until a new host arrives.|$|E
5|$|Pettibone methodically progressed {{through the}} Phillies' farm system, {{generally}} spending about one season {{at each level}} until 2012, when he advanced to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs after spending {{a majority of the}} season with the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils. Early in 2013, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club, and he made 18 starts with the Phillies before inflaming his rotator cuff, for which the Phillies precautionarily did not <b>use</b> <b>him</b> {{for the remainder of the}} season. He began the 2014 season competing for a spot in the back of the Phillies starting rotation, and he did make two starts, but was ineffective, and was sent back to the minor leagues, where he sustained a SLAP tear, and was placed on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Pitching in {{minor league}} baseball, Pennock began to regain confidence. However, Boston manager Jack Barry used Pennock {{sparingly}} in the 1917 season, and Pennock {{enlisted in the}} United States Navy in 1918. Pennock pitched for a team fielded by the Navy, defeating a team composed {{of members of the}} United States Army in an exhibition for George VI, the King of England, in Stamford Bridge. After the game, Ed Barrow, the new manager of the Red Sox, signed Pennock to a new contract after promising to <b>use</b> <b>him</b> regularly during the 1919 season.|$|E
