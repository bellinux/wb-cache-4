5|$|Miller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in {{the first}} innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest {{he came to a}} catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the half-volley. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The run rate picked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball {{in the first}} hour. Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before Dick Pollard trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{last season}} that Saeed played in was the 1989–90 season where he led his team {{through the first}} stage at 1st place until the 18th round on 19 January 1990 where he played his last match and scored his last goal with the club, against Al-Zawra'a, before the Iraq Football Association called him <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> days for the 1990 Gulf Cup of Nations and after he scored 10 goals for his team. This call-up made his team drop to 6th place after being the league leaders. After {{finishing}} the Gulf Cup, he announced his retirement. In the total 15 season that Saeed has played for Al-Talaba he scored 122 goals and was the top goalscorer of the team for 10 seasons. Although he retired, Saeed stayed as {{the vice president of}} Al-Talaba until 1992.|$|E

25|$|In {{both the}} United States and in Israel several groups have sprung <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> {{few years that}} seek to support those who {{identify}} as both Orthodox and homosexual; support Orthodox parents of LGBT children; and promote understanding of homosexuality within Orthodox communities and among Orthodox rabbis. These include an umbrella organization called Eshel, the Gay and Lesbian Yeshiva Day School Alumni Association, the women's group OrthoDykes, the youth group JQYouth, the American-Israeli group headquartered in Jerusalem Bat Kol and the Israeli group Hod ("Majesty"). In 2012, Hod held an advertising campaign against conversion therapies and for self-acceptance of the religious homosexual community in Israel. Online blogs and support groups have enabled many to find other Orthodox LGBT people with whom to share the conflict between Orthodox religious and social norms and LGBT self-identification.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} his 12-minute {{appearance}} against Chelsea, Beckham finally made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United {{in front of the}} sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute. Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.|$|E

25|$|In an {{extremely}} high quality first round match at the Masters, Judd Trump made two centuries and Fu three, with there being nine further breaks above 50 as Fu edged through 6–5. He beat Mark Allen 6–2 and then lost 6–4 to O'Sullivan in the semi-finals. Fu also {{played in the}} semi-finals of the World Grand Prix and was 4–3 up on Ryan Day, who needed four snookers in the eighth frame. He went on {{to get them to}} square the match and then overcame Fu 6–4. At the Players Championship, Fu defeated Anthony McGill 5–1 and Mark Selby 5–2, before coming back from 5–3 down against Ding Junhui to win 6–5 and reach the final. From 5–2 up on Trump, Fu lost six frames in a row and would be beaten 10–8. Fu had a terrible start to his first round match at the World Championship as he was 7–1 down to Luca Brecel, though he did make a century to be 7–2 behind overnight. He won the first two frames upon the resumption of play and eventually levelled at 8–8, before completing the comeback with a 10–9 victory. The second round saw Fu play Neil Robertson and the match was evenly poised throughout with the first session finishing 4–4, the second 8–8 and Robertson moving to 11–10 <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> session. The first to 13 would qualify for the quarter-finals to meet Mark Selby and despite a kick when 59–0 ahead at 12–11 that almost let Robertson level, Fu proceeded to win 13–11. Fu was then defeated 13–3 by defending and eventual champion Selby, losing with a session to spare. However, he was ranked sixth after the event, the highest Fu has ever finished a season in his career.|$|E
500|$|Morris and vice-captain Lindsay Hassett {{rebuilt the}} innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes. They played sedately without trying to take risks. Hassett fell after being beaten in flight by Young. [...] Aiming to break Young's {{restrictive}} leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Washbrook at wide mid-off. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps, with their personal tallies on 23 and 48 respectively. The run rate picked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time.|$|E
500|$|McCay's longest-running strip, Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, first {{appeared}} in the Evening Telegram in September 1904. [...] The strip was aimed at an adult audience, and had no recurring characters. [...] The characters that appeared in the strip would have fantastic, sometimes terrifying dreams, only to wake <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> panel, cursing the Welsh rarebit they had eaten the night before, which they blamed for bringing on the dream. [...] Rarebit Fiend was so popular that a book collection appeared in 1905 from publisher Frederick A. Stokes. [...] It was adapted to film by Edwin S. Porter, and plans were made for a [...] "comic opera or musical extravaganza" [...] for stage that failed to materialize.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave a mostly positive review, {{giving it a}} 7.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was a}} [...] "good" [...] episode. He stated, [...] "Things are still a bit wobbly on Veronica Mars this season, though this episode had some elements that hopefully herald a turn in the right direction." [...] While criticizing the case-of-the-week, he was more laudatory to the subplots, calling Sheriff Lamb arresting Weevil [...] "the most entertaining scene of the episode" [...] and that [...] "the episode definitely picked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> act." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a very mixed review, commenting positively on Veronica and Weevil's relationship while criticizing other aspects of the episode. [...] "While 'President Evil' was not a favorite, and has a few annoying moments, it was generally a perfectly adequate episode of Veronica Mars. That is, until the ending. [...] The implication here is one that I've been dreading for a few episodes: that the radical feminist Lilith House has staged Claire's rape, and possibly others." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B-".|$|E
500|$|With the Blades now in League One {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Evans would {{be sold to}} ease the club's wage bill but an injury picked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> days of the previous campaign meant he was unavailable until early September, preventing him from moving on to another club. Having returned from injury Evans hit a rich vein of form scoring regularly in both league and cup competitions as the Blades contested for promotion. On 28 March 2012 he scored a second-half hat trick within 15 minutes against Chesterfield giving him his thirtieth goal {{of the season in}} a 4–1 win for Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. During this impressive third season, Evans drew attention from Championship and Premier League clubs with his contract scheduled to expire in the summer. However, Blades manager Danny Wilson stated that Evans [...] " [...] even thinking about leaving Bramall Lane", adding [...] "Of course we don't want to lose Ched." [...] Evans was named League One Player of the Month for March 2012, having scored 10 goals in 8 games. He was nominated for 'League One Player of the Season', and in April 2012 Evans was named in the League One PFA Team of the Year.
