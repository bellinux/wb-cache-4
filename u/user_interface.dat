40|$|I am {{exploring}} {{an approach}} to developing services with multiple <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> based on a high level description of the service. The description is made using interaction acts, which are primitives for describing user-service interaction in a device independent way.

As a proof of concept, the approach is implemented in a working prototype that handles graphical <b>user</b> <b>interfaces,</b> web <b>user</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and speech <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> for our sample services.

40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge in}} the development of computer-based health care environments is the design of effective <b>user</b> <b>interfaces.</b> In this paper we consider a number of aspects of interface design related to the study of human-computer interaction from a cognitive perspective. It is argued that <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> must be designed with consideration of the information requirements, cognitive capabilities and limitations of the end users. Greater concern for fundamental research in design of <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> is also needed to complement short-term goals and approaches to improving <b>user</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Towards these objectives, several emerging trends are beginning to have an important impact in the design of health care interfaces. This includes the recognition of the need for iterative design and evaluation of <b>user</b> <b>interfaces,</b> applying theoretical frameworks and methods from cognitive science. An understanding of distributed as well as individual cognition will also become critical {{in the development of}} effective <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> as access to health care systems becomes increasingly widespread...|$|R
