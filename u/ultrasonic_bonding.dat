5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in the mid}} 1960s, Alexander Coucoulas, {{reported the}} first thermosonic wire bonds {{using a combination of}} heat, ultrasonic vibrations and pressure which led to his first invention. He first set up a commercial ultrasonic wire bonder (capable of transmitting vibratory energy and pressure) in order to investigate the attachment of aluminum wires to tantalum thin films deposited on glass substrates which simulated bonding a lead wire to the fragile metallized silicon integrated circuit [...] "chip". He observed that the ultrasonic energy and pressures levels needed to sufficiently deform the wire and form the required contact areas significantly increased the incidences of cracks in the glass or silicon chip substrates. A means of heating the bond region was then added to the ultrasonic bonder. The bond region was then heated during the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bonding</b> cycle which virtually eliminated the glass failure mode since the wire dramatically deformed to form the required contact area while using significantly lower ultrasonic energy and pressure levels. The enhanced wire deformation during the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bonding</b> cycle was attributed to the transition from cold working (or strain hardening of the wire) to near hot working conditions where its softness was enhanced. As the bonding temperature was increased the onset of recrystallization (softening mechanism) occurs where the strain hardening is most extensive. Thus the dual mechanisms of thermal softening and ultrasonic softening which is caused by vibratory energy interacting at the atomic lattice level, facilitated the desired wire deformation. Christian Hagar and George Harman stated that in 1970 Alexander Coucoulas reported additional work in forming thermosonic-type bonds which he initially called hot work <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bonding.</b> In this case, copper wires were bonded to palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide substrates. As a result of these earliest reported thermosonic wire bonds, G.Harman stated [...] "as such, Alexander Coucoulas is the Father of Thermosonic Bonding".At present, the majority of connections to silicon integrated circuits (the chip) are made using thermosonic bonding because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than thermocompression bonding, as well as lower vibratory energy levels than <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bonding,</b> to form the required bond area. As a result of using lower bonding parameters to form the required contact area, Thermosonic Bonding largely eliminates damaging the relatively fragile silicon integrated circuit micro-chip during the bonding cycle. The proven reliability of thermosonic bonding has made it the process of choice, since such potential failure modes could be costly whether they occur during the manufacturing stage or detected later, during an operational field-failure of a micro-chip which had been permanently connected inside a computer or a myriad of other electronic devices.|$|E

Considering that the real bonding area is {{in the state of}} plane strain, a two-dimensional atomic model is presented. Sutton-Chen potential is adopted for the interaction between gold atoms. Computational results indicate that a strong adhesion generates at the interface after intimate contact between the wire and the bond pad, and the adhesive force should be the mechanism of <b>ultrasonic</b> wire <b>bonding.</b> Combining the real contact area from finite element analysis with the adhesive force from molecular dynamics simulation, the <b>bonding</b> strength of <b>ultrasonic</b> wire <b>bonding</b> is estimated. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated the lead wire (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening the lead wire, the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating lead wire and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the lead wire, the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the lead wire where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Bonding</b> by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|E
5000|$|A person upon first {{seeing a}} ball bonder will usually compare its {{operation}} {{to that of}} a sewing machine. In fact there is a needle-like disposable tool called the capillary, through which the wire is fed. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire. This melts the wire {{at the tip of the}} capillary. The tip of the wire forms into a ball because of the surface tension of the molten metal.The ball quickly solidifies, and the capillary is lowered to the surface of the chip, which is typically heated to at least 125°C. The machine then pushes down on the capillary and applies ultrasonic energy with an attached transducer. The combined heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy create a weld between the copper or gold ball and the surface of the chip - which is usually copper or aluminum. This is the so-called ball bond that gives the process its name. (All-aluminum systems in semiconductor fabrication eliminate the [...] "purple plague" [...] - a brittle gold-aluminum intermetallic compound - sometimes associated with pure gold bonding wire. This property makes aluminum ideal for <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>bonding.)</b> Next the wire is passed out through the capillary and the machine moves over a few millimeters to the location that the chip needs to be wired up to (usually called the leadframe). The machine again descends to the surface, this time without making a ball so that the wire is crushed between the leadframe and the tip of the capillary. This time the surface is usually gold, palladium, or silver - but the weld is made in the same way. The resulting weld is quite different in appearance from the ball bond, and is referred to as the wedge bond, tail bond, or simply as the second bond.|$|E

A special,focus {{has been placed on}} monitoring the temperature rise during ultrasonic vibration. An equivalent method is used to simulate the wire and bond pad, where the large volumes of wire and bond pad are effectively reduced to small computational magnitudes. The history of temperature changes in the wire-bond pad-substrate interfaces influenced by varying bond forces and bond pad sizes is specifically studied. It is shown that the maximum bulk temperature obtained upon completion of ultrasonic vibration is far lower than the melting temperatures of the wire and bond pad materials, indicating that the bulk temperature rise due to ultrasonic vibration is not directly responsible for <b>ultrasonic</b> wire <b>bonding.</b> A large bond pad size usually leads to a lower temperature rise, and when the pad size reaches a certain value, the effect of bond pad size on temperature rise becomes insignificant. A higher bond force results in a marginally higher temperature rise than a lower bond force, which does not necessarily affect the wire bondability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Wire-bonding is {{and will}} stay {{one of the}} {{essential}} interconnection methods in electronic packaging. Physics-based modeling of interconnects between the wire material and the substrate metallization has been constantly advanced {{over the last five}} years. Due to the variety and complexity of the mechanisms occurring during bonding it is required to clarify some open issues for a thorough interpretation of the metallurgical processes that take place at the interface of the weld and in the wire. One of these issues relates to the thermo-mechanical processes at or in the vicinity in the interface between the wire and the substrate during an ultrasonic wedge/wedge wire-bonding.

In this paper a thermomechanical analysis of <b>ultrasonic</b> wire <b>bonding</b> is performed by means of 3 D finite element (FE) simulations. On the wire the bonding force is applied as well as ultrasonic vibration, which causes shear stresses in the wire and a frictional movement between the wire and the pad. The change of temperature in the interface between the aluminum wire and the gold metallization of a copper-nickel pad is studied. It is shown that a rise of temperature is obtained due to the plastic deformation of the wire caused by the bonding force, the shear stresses and by the friction with the pad.

The mechanism of the <b>bond</b> formation in <b>ultrasonic</b> wire <b>bonding</b> is not known. Although there have been theories proposed, inconsistencies have been shown to exist in them. One of the main inconsistencies is the contribution of ultrasound to the bonding process. A series of experiments to investigate the mechanism of bond formation are performed on a semi automatic wire bonder at room temperature. 25 µm diameter Au wire is ball bonded and also 25 µm diameter Al wire is wedge-wedge bonded onto polished Cu sheets of thickness 2 mm. It is found that a modified microslip theory can describe the evolution of <b>bonding.</b> With increasing <b>ultrasonic</b> power the <b>bond</b> contact transitions from microslip into gross sliding. The reciprocating tangential relative motion at the bond interface results in wear of surface contaminants which leads to clean metal/metal contact and bonding. The effect of superimposed ultrasound during deformation on the residual hardness of a bonded ball is systematically studied for the first time. An innovative bonding procedure with in-situ ball deformation and hardness measurement is developed using an ESEC WB 3100 automatic ball bonder. 50 µm diameter Au wire is bonded at various ultrasound levels onto Au metallized PCB substrate at room temperature. It is found that sufficient ultrasound which is applied during the deformation leads to a bonded ball which is softer than a ball with a similar amount of deformation without ultrasound. No hardening of the 100 µm diameter Au ball is observed even with the maximum ultrasonic power capable of the equipment of 900 mW.
