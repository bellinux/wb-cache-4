25|$|Foch, {{claiming}} that the Germans were showing signs of demoralisation, demanded (10 August) that Haig push on and capture the Somme crossings. Haig {{would have preferred to}} have First Army attack at Aubers and Third Army towards Bapaume, and after initially agreeing with Foch’s demand, changed his mind after consulting Currie and Lambert (GOC 32nd Division). Edmonds later claimed that Rawlinson was “almost insubordinate” in asking Haig whether he or “Marechal Foch” was in command, but this may not be an exact recollection as there is no record of the two men meeting that day. Haig told Byng (11 August) to be ready to attack with Third Army towards Bapaume and permitted Rawlinson to order a pause. Foch visited Haig’s command train that evening and concurred with the decision. Haig's initial orders to Rawlinson, to be ready to attack again after a short halt, have been criticised but Sheffield suggests that Haig had to defer to Foch this time, to clear the way for Byng’s attack. Haig then cancelled Fourth Army’s attack on Currie’s advice (based on aerial reconnaissance) that it would be “a desperate enterprise” for the BEF to overreach itself and engage new German troops with tired Allied ones who had outrun much of their artillery cover, and he switched to a new line of offensive. Haig wrote that on 15 August he “spoke to Foch quite straightly, and let him <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was responsible for the handling of the British forces”. Foch {{had little choice but to}} agree, and interfered little with Haig’s decisions thereafter, but removed First French Army from Haig’s command.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

I've heard about this, but the Miley Cyrus persona you might have in America I don't have." [...] Her involvement with [...] "Decisions" [...] was originally not publicly acknowledged {{in an attempt to}} [...] "make a tune together that we're super happy about and just see people's real opinion about this." [...] However, Cyrus unexpectedly tweeted [...] "Yo check out Decisions me & @borgore new track" [...] in August 2012, which Borgore commented was [...] "super cool [...] she did it the way she did it". He added that he was impressed with her vocal abilities, elaborating that [...] "I thought she was made up more to be a star, but she was pretty phenomenal behind the booth." ...|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But you must <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so I am interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E

Last {{appearing on the}} credits in February 2014, it was confirmed in October 2014 {{that she would not}} be returning on a more permanent basis, stating: [...] "Unfortunately we weren't on the same page contractually/scheduling etc (...) These things happen in this industry and I hope all my fans can <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> am a huge supporter of [...] Brad Bell and the entire cast and crew." [...] Wood was also removed from the soap opera's opening credits. On December 4, 2014, Soap Opera Digest broke exclusive news that Wood would be returning to the series. At press time, Wood was scheduled for a [...] "handful" [...] of episodes, which began airing on January 30, 2015. Wood revealed that she agreed to return to the show after Bell had personally sent her a text message. Of her status with the series, the actress said [...] "if the timing is right, I'll always come back". In April 2015, Wood confirmed that she signed a contract deal with the series and would return in the role of Steffy. She made her on-screen return on May 26, 2015. Wood said: [...] "When I left the show , it wasn't a real goodbye", and mentioned that [...] "Brad sent me a text with an idea for a storyline. We both got really excited about it and that was it.

500|$|When the {{platform}} debate {{began in the}} Chicago Coliseum {{on the morning of}} July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he [...] "spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience". According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave [...] "by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction". He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, [...] "the audience might just as well <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going to have my say if I stand here until sundown." [...] By the time he had his say, he had [...] "effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate". With Tillman's candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold speech won him the presidential nomination.|$|E

2500|$|I {{find that}} I am [...] "intermediate" [...] between God and nothingness, between the supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the {{creation}} of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was noted}} for his dreadlocks hair style, but he shaved them off {{during a trip}} to Australia. His shyness made Williams appear {{somewhat}} of an odd ball.

No one could <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> don't think guys in the locker room could grasp {{that he wanted to be}} to himself – you know, quiet. If you didn't understand him and didn't know what he was about, it always kept people in suspense." [...] Besides keeping to himself, Williams was known for conducting post-game interviews with his helmet on (complete with tinted visor) and avoiding eye contact. Williams was later diagnosed with clinical depression and social anxiety disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{basketball}} observers, {{in addition}} to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, {{he said he had}} a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I didn't <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> also had affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it." [...] Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, he has managed to obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.|$|E

I was never taught cold reading and I never intended to defraud anyone; I simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis." [...] McLaren has said that since she was always very perceptive, she could easily figure out {{many of the issues}} that people brought into sessions with them. In order to reduce the appearance of unusual expertise that might have created a power differential, she posed her observations as questions rather than facts. This attempt to be polite, she realized, actually invited the other person, as McLaren has said, to [...] "lean into the reading" [...] and give her more pertinent information.|$|E

He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are very suspicious of computers, much like the general public,' he said. 'They fear them as cold and impersonal and inhuman. I couldn't make them <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was still going to make my own decisions, I wasn't going to let the computer make them for me.
