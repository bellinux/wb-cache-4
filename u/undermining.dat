5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, <b>undermining</b> the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam <b>undermining</b> the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E

40|$|This Viewpoint formulates and {{responds}} to three lines of argument concerning human reproductive cloningÕs potential to <b>undermine</b> {{our sense of}} self or identity. First, cloning would <b>undermine</b> our sense of individuality or uniqueness. But it could only <b>undermine</b> our genetic uniqueness, not our full individuality. Second, cloning would <b>undermine</b> the value or worth of human beings. But it would not make individuals replaceable or of any less moral worth. Third, a cloneÕs freedom or autonomy to construct {{his or her own}} life would be <b>undermined</b> by the presence of an earlier twin. But only a mistaken belief in genetic deter-minism supports this feared loss of freedom. Advances in genetic science and technology hold out the possibility of being able to clone human beings, though whether that technology will be safe and effective, as well as legally permitted, is uncertain.

5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British {{were reluctant to}} give up control over Singapore's internal security.

Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E
5|$|John Fine, on {{the other}} hand, {{suggests}} that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was <b>undermining</b> Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean. Kagan believes that Pericles used Callias, a brother-in-law of Cimon, {{as a symbol of}} unity and employed him several times to negotiate important agreements.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill was}} part of a large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery from <b>undermining</b> their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E
5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, <b>undermining</b> the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably {{dismissed}} on 1 April 1959. {{the dismissal}} {{has been reported}} in several sources {{to be related to the}} acquittal of/dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of <b>undermining</b> the government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime.|$|E
40|$|A controlled, {{quantitative}} histochemical {{study was}} performed in five piglets to establish changes in <b>undermined</b> and not <b>undermined</b> stretched skin. The skin was stretched with a stretching device for 30 minutes to close a large skin defect. On each flank of the piglet, at a standard position, 9 x 9 -cm wounds were created under general anesthesia. On one flank, the surrounding skin was <b>undermined</b> cranially and caudally over a 10 -centimeter area. Sections of skin biopsies obtained during stretching were stained with picrosirius red and studied with routine light microscopy and polarized light microscopy in combination with image analysis. The length of collagen fibers was analyzed as a parameter {{of changes in the}} dermis resulting from skin stretching. This newly developed quantitative method appeared to be valid, specific, and reproducible, allowing for objective determination of changes in the length of the fibers in the plain of the sections. Changes in the orientation of collagen fibers in the dermis as a result of skin stretching were thereby determined. Epidermal thickness did not change significantly under the influence of stretching forces in both <b>undermined</b> and not <b>undermined</b> skin. However, the orientation of the collagen fibers changed significantly as a result of skin stretching. In <b>undermined</b> wounds, parallel alignment and elongation of the fibers in the plane of the sections was already observed after 15 minutes of stretching. The fibers became aligned {{in the direction of the}} stretching force, perpendicular to the wound margin. After 30 minutes of stretching, the mean major axes of the collagen fibers were longest in the plane of the sections (p < 0. 001). This meant that elongation and parallel alignment of the collagen fibers had occurred. Stretching of not <b>undermined</b> skin for 15 minutes resulted in significantly stronger parallel alignment in the plane of the sections as compared with <b>undermined</b> skin. This was less well defined after 30 minutes of stretching in not <b>undermined</b> skin. It is concluded that skin stretching with a skin-stretching device for 30 minutes results in significant histomorphological changes of collagen fibers in the dermis of both <b>undermined</b> and not <b>undermined</b> skin. The fibers realign rapidly as a result of stretching forces and become aligned in the direction of the stretching force, perpendicular to the wound margin. These dynamic changes in collagen fibers explain the significantly decreased wound closing tension resulting from skin stretching and explain how skin stretches beyond its inherent extensibilit...|$|R

5|$|After the Second Test, McCabe was {{involved}} in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were <b>undermining</b> Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of <b>undermining</b> Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E
5|$|After the Series, Ruth and {{teammates}} Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy {{participated in a}} barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and <b>undermining</b> its value. Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.|$|E

In the 1920s, trade teams dominated the Tour; cyclists such as Nicolas Frantz won the Tour with the Alcyon team. However, when Alcyon cyclist Maurice De Waele won the Tour in 1929 while ill, the organisers decided to introduce national teams the following year, to stop team tactics from <b>undermining</b> the race.

5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would distort the national character by <b>undermining</b> republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. (See §The evils of war and political parties.) When Congress declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on the measure. Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories. The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times. However, the Senate, where non-slave and slave states had more equal representation, never passed the measure.|$|E

Soeprapto also investigated Head of the Armed Forces Abdul Haris Nasution for his involvement in the affair.

5|$|Edward {{asserted}} that the king of Scotland owed him feudal allegiance, and intended to unite the two nations by marrying his son Edward to Margaret, the sole heir of King Alexander III. When Margaret died in 1290, competition for the Scottish crown ensued.

Edward insisted that he was Scotland's sovereign and possessed the right to hear appeals against Balliol's judgements, <b>undermining</b> Balliol's authority. Balliol allied with France in 1295; Edward invaded Scotland the following year, deposing and exiling Balliol.|$|E
