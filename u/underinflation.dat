50|$|The tire {{contact patch}} is readily changed by both over- and <b>underinflation.</b> Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center contact patch, and <b>underinflation</b> will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.|$|E

There are four technical grades: (1) Good; (2) Acceptable, with no technical defect likely to impair classification; (3) Acceptable, with some technical defect but still adequate; and (4) Unacceptable.

5000|$|In 1973, {{only two}} years after the 500's debut, Thomas A. Robertson, Firestone's {{director}} of development wrote an internal memo stating [...] "We are making an inferior quality radial tire which will subject us to belt-edge separation at high mileage". Firestone introduced strict quality control measures in an attempt to fix the inherent problems, however they were not successful in totally eliminating the basic faults. In 1977 a recall of 400,000 tires produced at the problematic Decatur plant was initiated. Firestone was considered to be less than cooperative with the NHTSA during the agency's investigation into the Firestone 500. Firestone blamed the problems on the consumer, stating <b>underinflation</b> and poor maintenance.|$|E
50|$|NIRA Dynamics' {{core product}} is its Tire Pressure Indicator (TPI), an {{indirect}} tire-pressure monitoring system (TPMS) capable of detecting <b>underinflation</b> simultaneously {{in up to}} four tires. At the moment, TPI is installed in several Audi models (the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, Q3, Q5, Q7, and TT); several Volkswagen models (Polo, Golf, Jetta, Beetle, Scirocco, Passat, Tiguan, Touran, and Sharan); several SEAT and Skoda models; {{as well as the}} Chery Arrizo 7 and the MG 3. It is also fitted to many Volvo, Fiat and Renault vehicles. The system meets the American FMVSS 138 and the European ECE R-64 regulations on tire pressure monitoring systems. TPI is a software component that uses both relative rolling radius information as well as wheel oscillation measurement. It estimates tire pressure mainly from the signals of the wheel speed sensors {{that are part of the}} anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic stability control system (ESC). It gets active shortly after a reset which triggers a self-learning process. A reset needs to be initiated by the driver when the tires have been changed or the pressure adjusted. TPI does not require any in-wheel pressure sensors and RF (radio frequency) components. The Audi TT series was the first to be equipped with TPI, in 2006. The Audi A4 and A5 models followed the next year. TPI can be fit into different electronic stability control hardware hosts, including those of Continental AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, and TRW Automotive.|$|E

The small number of patients included {{in the current study}} (n =  18) could explain this difference. Duration of prior intubation was identified as an independent risk factor for <b>underinflation</b> of tracheal cuff [14]. However, duration of prior intubation was quite similar in the current study (median 4  days) compared with previous studies (2 and 5  days, respectively) [14, 15]. Another explanation could be the different patient characteristics between the current study and previous ones. The {{percentage of}} non-sedated patients was lower in the current study (22  %) compared with the two previous ones (35 and 53  %, respectively).

30|$|Even when well applied, {{discontinuous}} {{control of}} cuff pressure using a manometer is not efficient in keeping cuff pressure within the recommended range (20 to 30 cmH 2 O). In {{a cohort of}} 101 critically ill patients intubated with a PVC-cuffed tube, cuff pressure was continuously recorded for eight hours after manual adjustment of cuff pressure at 25 cmH 2 O [61]. Only 18 % of study patients spent 100 % of recording time with normal (20 to 30 cmH 2 O) cuff pressure. Fifty-four per cent of study patients developed cuff <b>underinflation,</b> 73 % developed cuff overinflation, and 44 % developed both. Thirty-three per cent of study patients developed <b>underinflation</b> or overinflation for[*]>[*] 30  minutes. No modifiable risk factor for <b>underinflation</b> or overinflation of the tracheal cuff was identified in that study. Duration of intubation and absence of sedation were independently associated with <b>underinflation</b> of the tracheal cuff. Percentage of time spent with <b>underinflation</b> of the tracheal cuff significantly increased during the recording period, suggesting that cuff pressure should be checked and regulated more frequently using a manometer. However, previous studies showed that the connection of manometer to external cuff {{is associated with a}} sudden drop in cuff pressure which might result in microaspiration [62, 63]. In another prospective study, our group aimed to determine the impact of cuff shape and material on cuff pressure [56]. Patients were intubated with PVC standard (n[*]=[*] 26), polyurethane cylindrical (n[*]=[*] 22), or polyurethane conical-shaped cuffed (n[*]=[*] 28) tracheal tubes. Cuff pressure was continuously recoded for 24  hours, and adjusted by nurses using a manometer thrice a day. Patients spent 51 % to 62 % of recording time within the normal range. No significant difference was found in percentage of time spent with <b>underinflation,</b> and overinflation between the three groups. However, coefficient of variation of cuff pressure was significantly higher in patients intubated with conical-shaped cuffed tracheal tubes compared with the two other groups.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{monitoring}} of Endotracheal Tube (ETT) cuff pressure in intubated patients on arrival to {{intensive care unit}} is very essential. The cuff pressure must be within an optimal range of 20 - 30 cm H 2 O ensuring ventilation with no complications related to cuff overinflation and <b>underinflation.</b> This can be measured with a cuff pressure manometer. The aim {{of the study is}} to measure the endotracheal tube cuff pressure in patients on arrival to intensive care unit and to identify prevalence of endotracheal cuff <b>underinflation</b> and overinflation. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was done on mechanically-ventilated patients who were intubated in casualty (emergency department) on arrival to intensive care unit in S. S. Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Davangere. About 50 critically-ill patients intubated with a high volume, low pressure endotracheal tube were included in the study. An analogue manometer was used to measure the endotracheal tube cuff pressure. It was compared with the recommended level. The settings of mechanical ventilation, endotracheal tube size and peak airway pressure were recorded.
