50|$|The cable used {{to connect}} the MIL-STD-1553 bus and stub devices has a {{characteristic}} impedance of 78 ohms at 1 MHz. A 2-conductor twisted-pair cable known as Twinax is used {{to connect the}} bus and stub devices. The insulated pairs are balanced and have an overall shielding braid around the pairs. The twisting of the signal-carrying pairs theoretically cancels any random induced noise caused by the pair. The two internal dielectric fillers separate the braid from the pairs to minimize the leakage capacitance to ground. The fillers also assist in <b>uniform</b> <b>twisting</b> of the pairs. The 90% braid coverage protects the pair from external noise. PVC outer jacket cable is suitable for lab use while high-temperature rated outer jacket cable is applicable for vehicle use.|$|R

50|$|The 16-inch Mark 2 was 50 calibers long, with a liner, an A tube, {{jacket and}} seven hoops with four hoop locking rings and a screw box liner. The Mod 0 used an {{increasing}} {{twist in the}} rifling while the Mod 1 used a <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> and a different groove pattern. The Mark 3 {{was the same as}} the Mark 2 but used a one-step conical liner. The Mark 3 Mod 0 had an increasing rifling twist (like the Mark 2 Mod 0) while the Mark 3 Mod 1 utilized had a <b>uniform</b> <b>twist.</b> At the time the program was cancelled, in 1922, 71 guns had been built, including the prototype, while another 44 were in progress.|$|E
50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and locking ring. With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> rifling, and added a tube and liner locking ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> rifling that was secured by a tube and liner locking ring with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner locking ring. The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of twist-pitch nonuniformity on the radiated susceptibility of a twisted-wire pair (TWP) running above ground and illuminated by a plane-wave field is investigated via a transmission-line model. The geometrical {{representation of the}} TWP involves a bifilar helix with a variable pitch function, which readily allows for the description of any unwanted/unknown deviations from the ideal twist geometry. Basic examples are used to show that such a deformation plays {{a fundamental role in}} the pickup of differential-mode (DM) noise, thus substantiating the need for the proposed prediction model. By describing the pitch random variations as a spatial stochastic process, a realistic representation of the twisting features is obtained (both for TWPs with imperfect <b>uniform</b> <b>twists</b> and for TWPs intentionally manufactured with random nonuniform twists). Repeated runs are used to characterize the sensitivity of the induced DM noise to random nonuniform twisting. Especially, it is shown that the twist-pitch nonuniformity, sometimes intentionally used to reduce pair-to-pair crosstalk in TWP cables, may however lead to a severe decrease of the TWP immunity to external fields...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a norm {{on the space}} of test configurations, which we call the minimum norm. We conjecture that uniform K-stability {{with respect to this}} norm is equivalent to the existence of a constant scalar curvature Kähler metric. This notion of uniform K-stability is analogous to coercivity of the Mabuchi functional. We characterise the triviality of test configurations, by showing that a test configuration has zero minimum norm if and only if it has zero L^ 2 -norm, if and only if it is almost trivial. We prove that the existence of a twisted constant scalar curvature Kähler metric implies <b>uniform</b> <b>twisted</b> K-stability with respect to the minimum norm, when the twisting is ample. We give algebro-geometric proofs of uniform K-stability in the general type and Calabi-Yau cases, {{as well as in the}} Fano case under an alpha invariant condition.

40|$|Inspired {{by recent}} {{experiments}} on Bose-Einstein condensates in ring traps, we investigate the topological {{properties of the}} phase of a one-dimensional Bose field {{in the presence of}} both thermal and quantum fluctuations [...] the latter ones being tuned by the depth of an optical lattice applied along the ring. In the regime of large filling of the lattice, quantum Monte Carlo simulations give direct access to the full statistics of fluctuations of the Bose-field phase, and of its winding number $W$ along the ring. At zero temperature the winding-number (or topological-sector) fluctuations are driven by quantum phase slips localized around a Josephson link between two lattice wells, and their { susceptibility} is found to jump at the superfluid-Mott insulator transition. At finite (but low) temperature, on the other hand, the winding number fluctuations are driven by thermal activation of nearly <b>uniform</b> phase <b>twists,</b> whose activation rate is governed by the superfluid fraction. A quantum-to-thermal crossover in winding number fluctuations is therefore exhibited by the system, and it is characterized by a conformational change in the topologically non-trivial configurations, from localized to <b>uniform</b> phase <b>twists,</b> which can be experimentally observed in ultracold Bose gases via matter-wave interference.

Downward-opening Welin breech blocks and Smith-Asbury mechanisms were used on both Mark 4 and Mark 6 types. The Navy encountered dispersion problems at extreme ranges with these guns in the 1920s.

The same mechanisms also contribute to a tertiary Hopf bifurcation that I observe in electroconvection in I 52.

40|$|Funding: UK Science and Technology Facilities CouncilThe {{nature of}} {{three-dimensional}} reconnection when a twisted flux tube erupts during an eruptive flare or coronal mass ejection is considered. The reconnection has two phases: first of all, 3 D “zipper reconnection” propagates along the initial coronal arcade, {{parallel to the}} polarity inversion line (PIL); then subsequent quasi- 2 D “main phase reconnection” in the low corona around a flux rope during its eruption produces coronal loops and chromospheric ribbons that propagate away from the PIL in a direction normal to it. One scenario starts with a sheared arcade: the zipper reconnection creates a twisted flux rope of roughly one turn (2 π radians of twist), and then main phase reconnection builds {{up the bulk of}} the erupting flux rope with a relatively <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> of a few turns. A second scenario starts with a pre-existing flux rope under the arcade. Here the zipper phase can create a core with many turns that depend on the ratio of the magnetic fluxes in the newly formed flare ribbons and the new flux rope. Main phase reconnection then adds a layer of roughly <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> to the twisted central core. Both phases and scenarios are modeled in a simple way that assumes the initial magnetic flux is fragmented along the PIL. The model uses conservation of magnetic helicity and flux, together with equipartition of magnetic helicity, to deduce the twist of the erupting flux rope in terms the geometry of the initial configuration. Interplanetary observations show some flux ropes have a fairly <b>uniform</b> <b>twist,</b> which could be produced when the zipper phase and any pre-existing flux rope possess small or moderate twist (up to one or two turns). Other interplanetary flux ropes have highly twisted cores (up to five turns), which could be produced when there is a pre-existing flux rope and an active zipper phase that creates substantial extra twist.

40|$|Abstract. Magnetic {{fields in}} the solar corona are {{responsible}} {{for a wide range}} of phenomena. However, any direct measurements of the coronal magnetic fields are very difficult due to lack of suitable spectral lines, weak magnetic fields, and high temperatures. Therefore, one extrapolates photospheric field measurements into the corona. Owing to low coronal plasma β, we can apply a force-free model in lowest order to study the slow evolution of active region (AR) magnetic fields. On applying these models to AR 11158 and compared with coronal plasma tracers, we found that (1) the approximation of potential field to coronal structures over large length scales is a reasonable one, 2) linear force-free (LFF) assumption to AR coronal fields may not be applicable model as it assumes <b>uniform</b> <b>twist</b> over the entire AR, and 3) for modeling fields at sheared, stressed locations where energy release in the form of flares are usually observed, non-linear force free fields (NLFFF) seem to provide a good approximation.
