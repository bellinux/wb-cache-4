40|$|Leek is a weak {{competitor}} against weeds. A {{field experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of herbicides and mulching on weed flora, growth and yield of a leek crop. A randomized complete block design was employed with five replicates per treatment (control, mulching with barley straw, post-transplant application of the herbicide oxyfluorfen at 360 g a. i. /ha and pre-transplant application of pendimethalin at 1, 650 g a. i. /ha). The order of weed sensitivity to mulches was black nightshade (72 - 85 %), <b>venice</b> <b>mallow</b> (80 %) > redroot pigweed (70 - 74 %), barnyardgrass (67 - 77 %) > jimsonweed (65 %) > common purslane (42 - 45 %). Oxyfluorfen had the highest control of jimsonweed, <b>venice</b> <b>mallow</b> and common purslane. There were no significant effects of the pendimethalin treatment on weed control ratings of jimsonweed, <b>venice</b> <b>mallow</b> and field bindweed. Injury symptoms (small white spots) appeared on leek leaves exposed to oxyfluorfen. The highest yield of leek was recorded with the oxyfluorfen application. Our results indicate that mulching and oxyfluorfen application provides satisfactory control of weeds. The use of mulching is an option for the weed management in organic leek crop...|$|R

40|$|<b>Venice</b> <b>mallow</b> is an {{emerging}} weed problem {{in many regions}} of the world in various crops. Studies on its hard seed coat were conducted by scanning electron, light, and fluorescence microscopy. The effects of environmental factors on germination and seedling emergence were examined in laboratory experiments. Seeds possessed physical dormancy (90 %) that required immersion for 0. 5 h in concentrated sulfuric acid to break without damaging the seed. After scarification, 29 % of seeds exhibited primary embryo dormancy. Exposure of seeds to even short periods of 15 d of prechilling induced secondary dormancy (10 % germination). The surface of hard seeds had a velvety appearance from numerous papillate structures and deposits (hydrophilic material). The location of the water barrier was very superficial in the outer seed coat. Although, in hard seeds, the hilar area appeared to have vertical ruptures and the hilum fissure appeared to be open, there was no water entry. It was observed that microruptures could be the region of structural weakness of hard seeds in relation to water permeability during prolonged burial (8 mo). The highest (60 %) germination was recorded at a day/night temperature of 30 / 20 C with a 12 -h photoperiod. No germination was measured at either 10 or 45 C constant temperature. Germination was recorded with a broad range of pH (3 - 11) and seeds were rather tolerant to low water potential (20 % germination at - 1. 2 MPa). Seedling emergence was higher for seeds buried at 2 cm than for those placed on the surface (54 vs. 38 %, respectively). These results showed that <b>Venice</b> <b>mallow</b> is a rather unique species that possesses a complex mechanism of dormancy (physical, primary, and secondary). Information gained in this study will be used in developing management strategies for this species...|$|R

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportWeeds {{are a major}} {{constraint}} to {{crop production}} in NY State and can significantly reduce {{the quantity and quality}} of harvested crops. The management of weeds also incurs substantial costs for farmers and may have negative impacts on the environment. Thus, there is an urgent need to better predict the timing of weed emergence in cropping systems and to identify those factors affecting emergence. In this research, we studied the emergence pattern of agricultural weeds in two common central NY soil types and in response to biweekly soil disturbance. Seedling emergence data and weather data (i. e. growing-degree days and precipitation) were collected at two research locations in central NY throughout the 2016 growing season. The Musgrave Research Farm (Aurora, Cayuga County, NY) has moderately drained clay-loam soils (Honeyoe/Lima soils) where grain crops are studied, while the Homer Thompson Research Farm (Freeville, Tompkins County, NY) is on very well-drained sandy loam (Howard/Phelps soils) where both vegetable and grain crops are grown. The 2016 growing season was exceptionally dry; weed emergence rates were low at both sites, but emergence was lowest at the H. Thompson site in the better-drained soils despite similar rainfall and temperatures. Data from ten weed species were analyzed; of these, only pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) was common at both sites. At the Musgrave site, weed emergence for all species peaked in late May/early June, with a smaller flush in late summer; the exception was <b>Venice</b> <b>mallow</b> (Hibiscus trionum), which had its main emergence in mid-summer. At both sites, warm- and cool-season weeds were present, as well as an annual grass; but emergence patterns were more varied. The perennial grass Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) emerged only in the spring, while hairy galinsoga (Galinsoga quadriradiata) and common chickweed (Stellaria media) emerged mainly in the fall with a small preliminary flush in June; common chickweed had similar emergence rates in June and September. At both sites, repeated cultivation stimulated emergence during mid-season with the exception of foxtails (Setaria spp.) at Musgrave, where emergence was higher mid-season in the undisturbed soil treatment...|$|R

60|$|The {{scholastic}} year {{came to an}} end. I took {{a fairly}} good place at the exams, which for me (for certain reasons) {{happened to be a}} more difficult task than for other boys. In that respect I could enter with a good conscience upon that holiday which was like a long visit pour prendre conge of the mainland of old Europe I was to see so little of for the next four-and-twenty years. Such, however, was not the avowed purpose of that tour. It was rather, I suspect, planned in order to distract and occupy my thoughts in other directions. Nothing had been said for months of my going to sea. But my attachment to my young tutor and his influence over me were so well known that he must have received a confidential mission to talk me out of my romantic folly. It was an excellently appropriate arrangement, as neither he nor I had ever had a single glimpse of the sea in our lives. That was to come by and by for both of <b>us</b> in <b>Venice,</b> from the outer shore of Lido. Meantime he had taken his mission to heart so well that I began to feel crushed before we reached Zurich. He argued in railway trains, in lake steamboats, he had argued away for me the obligatory sunrise on the Righi, by Jove! Of his devotion to his unworthy pupil there can be no doubt. He had proved it already by two years of unremitting and arduous care. I could not hate him. But he had been crushing me slowly, and when he started to argue {{on the top of the}} Furca Pass he was perhaps nearer a success than either he or I imagined. I listened to him in despairing silence, feeling that ghostly, unrealized, and desired sea of my dreams escape from the unnerved grip of my will.|$|R
6000|$|For {{there is}} nothing {{particular}} in this cold and conventional temple to gaze at save the great Tintoretto of the sacristy, to which we quickly pay our respects, and which we are glad to have for ten minutes to ourselves. The picture, though full of beauty, is not the finest of the master's; but it serves again as well as another to transport--there is no other word--those of his lovers for whom, in far-away days when Venice was an early rapture, this strange and mystifying painter was almost the supreme revelation. The plastic arts may have less to say to us than in the hungry years of youth, and the celebrated picture in general {{be more of a}} blank; but more than the others any fine Tintoret still carries us back, calling up not only the rich particular vision but the freshness of the old wonder. Many things come and go, but this great artist remains for <b>us</b> in <b>Venice</b> a part of the company of the mind. The others are there in their obvious glory, but he is the only one for whom the imagination, in our expressive modern phrase, sits up. [...] "The Marriage in Cana," [...] at the Salute, has all his characteristic and fascinating unexpectedness--the sacrifice of the figure of our Lord, who is reduced to the mere final point of a clever perspective, and the free, joyous presentation of all the other elements of the feast. Why, in spite of this queer one-sidedness, does the picture give us no impression of a lack of what the critics call reverence? For no other reason that I can think of than because it happens to be the work of its author, in whose very mistakes there is a singular wisdom. Mr. Ruskin has spoken with sufficient eloquence of the serious loveliness of the row of heads of the women on the right, who talk to each other as they sit at the foreshortened banquet. There could be no better example of the roving independence of the painter's vision, a real spirit of adventure for which his subject was always a cluster of accidents; not an obvious order, but a sort of peopled and agitated chapter of life, in which the figures are submissive pictorial notes. These notes are all there in their beauty and heterogeneity, and if the abundance is of a kind to make the principle of selection seem in comparison timid, yet the sense of [...] "composition" [...] in the spectator--if it happen to exist--reaches out to the painter in peculiar sympathy. Dull must be the spirit of the worker tormented in any field of art with that particular question who is not moved to recognise in the eternal problem the high fellowship of Tintoretto.|$|R
60|$|Before I left Venice I {{had made}} my {{sketches}} into a book, which I sent on to Messrs. Trubner & Co., in London. They had consented {{to look at}} it to oblige my friend Conway, who during his sojourn with <b>us</b> in <b>Venice,</b> before his settlement in London, had been forced to listen to some of it. They answered me in due time that they would publish an edition of a thousand, at half profits, if I could get some American house to take five hundred copies. When I stopped in London I had so little hope of being able to do this that I asked the Trubners if I might, without losing their offer, try to get some other London house to publish my book. They said Yes, almost joyously; and I began to take my manuscript about. At most places they would not look at me or it, and they nowhere consented to read it. The house promptest in refusing to consider it afterwards pirated one of my novels, and with some expressions of good intention in that direction, never paid me anything for it; though I believe the English still think that this sort of behavior was peculiar to the American publisher in the old buccaneering times. I was glad {{to go back to the}} Trubners with my book, and on my way across the Atlantic I met a publisher who finally agreed to take those five hundred copies. This was Mr. M. M. Hurd, of Hurd & Houghton, a house then newly established in New York and Cambridge. We played ring-toss and shuffleboard together, and became of a friendship which lasts to this day. But it was not till some months later, when I saw him in New York, that he consented to publish my book. I remember how he said, with an air of vague misgiving, and an effect of trying to justify himself in an imprudence, that it was not a great matter anyway. I perceived that he had no faith in it, and to tell the truth I had not much myself. But the book had an instant success, and it has gone on from edition to edition ever since. There was just then the interest of a not wholly generous surprise at American things among the English. Our success in putting down the great Confederate rebellion had caught the fancy of our cousins, and I think it was to this mood of theirs that I owed largely the kindness they showed my book. There were long and cordial reviews in all the great London journals, which I used to carry about with me like love-letters; when I tried to show them to other people, I could not understand their coldness concerning them.|$|R
