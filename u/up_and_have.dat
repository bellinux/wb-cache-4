Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

25|$|Babe {{breaches}} the pub licence {{when she}} sells {{alcohol in the}} morning, when the licence does not cover this. An undercover police officer becomes a regular customer, and eventually Mick, Babe and Shirley are arrested, charged and fined £20,000 in court. Babe leaves Sylvie near the canal, {{in an attempt to}} let her drown; when Sylvie is found, it is revealed Babe is responsible and Mick evicts her after she starts insulting Linda. The next day, Mick is disgusted to learn that Lee had hit Whitney during a row and confides in Shirley who suggest that Lee and Whitney should be separated for Whitney's safety, which he regretfully tells Lee. Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a note saying he no longer loves her, but Mick persuades him to explain to her his reasons before going. With Babe missing, Mick no is no longer required to pay her share of the fine, however, realising that Mick cannot pay the fine as well as other debts, including bills for the repair of leaks in the pub, Shirley decides to put the blame for the licence break on herself. As the fine is unpaid, Shirley is jailed and subsequently charged with perverting the cause of justice, which increases her sentence from six weeks to three months. A few days later, Ian's wife, Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he has left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to storm out. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument between the two although they later make <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Soon after Linda's departure, Mick receives a phone call from Tamwar saying that Nancy has been critically injured after being hit by a car while backpacking in Bulgaria. He immediately leaves Walford and flies to Bulgaria to be with her.|$|E
500|$|When {{industrial}} metal {{climbed the}} charts {{of the late}} 1990s, its sudden popularity was met with negative reactions from the early innovators of industrial music. Peter Christopherson told The Wire {{that he no longer}} felt any kinship with the industrial scene: [...] "this is not me, this is not what I'm about". Lustmord, a prominent early industrial musician, declared that [...] "Ministry just doesn't interest [...] " [...] and [...] " [...] no time for all this rock and roll shit they're doing now." [...] Skinny Puppy frontman Nivek Ogre dismissed Nine Inch Nails as [...] "cock rock" [...] but have since patched things <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> even performed on stage together.|$|E

What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E

500|$|Doctor Who had {{previously}} aired two related specials for Comic Relief. The {{first was the}} 1999 spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, which was also written by Steven Moffat. The spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures produced its own mini-episode [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] for the 2009 Comic Relief appeal. Unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] {{are considered to be}} canonical. The canonicity of the two mini-episodes was affirmed by Moffat in Doctor Who Magazine. Moffat stated that, unlike Curse of the Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] is not a spoof or a sketch, but rather [...] "a little miniature story" [...] {{in the style of the}} Children in Need mini-episodes. He described it as [...] "A moment of life aboard the TARDIS. But obviously life about the TARDIS instantly gets you into terrible jeopardy, and all of causality is threatened. As I'm sure it is every day when they get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> their coffee..." [...] The concept of a TARDIS inside the TARDIS had been previously explored in The Time Monster (1972) and Logopolis (1980), though both times it was the TARDIS of the Master. Amy also repeats one of her lines from [...] "The Big Bang" [...] at the end of [...] "Space".|$|E
500|$|There {{were only}} 16 presidential primary states in 1920, {{of which the}} most crucial to Harding was Ohio. Harding had to have some loyalists at the {{convention}} to have any chance of nomination, and the Wood campaign hoped to knock Harding {{out of the race}} by taking Ohio. Wood campaigned in the state, and his supporter, Procter, spent large sums; Harding spoke in the nonconfrontational style he had adopted in 1914. Harding and Daugherty were so confident of sweeping Ohio's 48 delegates that the candidate went on to the next state, Indiana, before the April 27 Ohio primary. Harding carried Ohio by only 15,000 votes over Wood, taking less than half the total vote, and won only 39 of 48 delegates. In Indiana, Harding finished fourth, with less than ten percent of the vote, and failed to win a single delegate. He was willing to give <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> Daugherty file his nomination papers for the Senate, but Florence Harding grabbed the phone from his hand, [...] "Warren Harding, what are you doing? Give up? Not until the convention is over. Think of your friends in Ohio!" [...] On learning that Daugherty had left the phone line, the future First Lady retorted, [...] "Well, you tell Harry Daugherty for me that we're in this fight until Hell freezes over." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying {{to get the hell out}} of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to slow <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E

500|$|Adjacent to {{the hall}} are the {{remaining}} structures designed by Waterhouse. [...] To the north is Eaton Chapel; this, with its clock tower, is a GradeI listed building. [...] The decorative scheme of {{the interior of the}} chapel is based on the 'Te Deum'; it involves stained glass and stone mosaic, and was developed by Frederic Shields. Immediately {{to the north of the}} chapel is the Stable Court; this is listed at GradeII*. The buildings in the Stable Court are in brick, red stone, and half-timbering, with red tile roofs. The west range has a half-timbered upper storey with two gables, and a central gatehouse with turrets which are polygonal at the base and circular higher <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> conical roofs. On each side of the gatehouse are two-storey arcades with gables above. In the courtyard is a statue of a horse by Joseph Boehm, which is listed at GradeII. At the southeast corner of the stable yard is a postillion's house, dated 1873 and listed at GradeII*. In a lobby between the stable yard and the chapel is an artificial grotto, listed at GradeII. In the area around the Stable Court are further structures listed at GradeII. To the north is the Coachhouse Court, which consists of a coach-house, a covered court and a riding school. These were designed in the 1870s for the 1stDuke. To the north of this are Eaton Hall Cottages, four attached cottages, which were designed about the same time. In the forecourt between the Coachhouse Court and the cottages is a lodge, with gates, piers and screens. Near to the cottages is the former engine shed of the Eaton Hall Railway. To the east of the stable yard is a chapel-like sandstone game pantry dating from the 1870s.|$|E
500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were {{so much fun to}} play because it was a lighter side. A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> fun in the process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was just great to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters. The Volkswagen campus van — still in operating condition — along with Hurley's Camaro, were later auctioned off with other Lost props and costumes at the Santa Monica Airport in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The {{passage of}} time in Neverland is also ambiguous.

2500|$|Ford's brother Eddie was a {{crew member}} and they fought constantly; on one {{occasion}} Eddie reportedly [...] "went after the {{old man with a}} pick handle". There was only a short synopsis written when filming began and Ford wrote and shot the film day by day. Production fell behind schedule, delayed by constant bad weather and the intense cold, and Fox executives repeatedly demanded results, but Ford would either tear up the telegrams or hold them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> stunt gunman Edward [...] "Pardner" [...] Jones shoot holes through the sender's name. Despite the pressure to halt the production, studio boss William Fox finally backed Ford and allowed him to finish the picture and his gamble paid off handsomely—The Iron Horse became one of the top-grossing films of the decade, taking over US$2million worldwide, against a budget of $280,000.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2001, having dropped {{original}} producer Arnold Lanni, the band met with new producer Bob Rock to start {{work on their}} fifth album. Later the following month, founding guitarist Mike Turner either quit the band or was forced out due to the other members' concerns about his guitar-playing abilities. Said Maida of Turner's departure, [...] "The last two records we've been yearning for a guitar player that can really stand <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a strong voice and Mike (Turner) just wasn't that kind of guitar player." [...] Turner later formed the band Fair Ground with Harem Scarem guitarist Pete Lesperance and later joined the band Crash Karma. Turner's last performance with the band was for Music Without Borders at Toronto's Air Canada Centre on October 21, 2001. In the months following Turner's departure, the band held auditions for a replacement lead guitarist. Steve Mazur, {{a friend of a}} friend of drummer Jeremy Taggart, was announced as the new guitarist in April 2002.

Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look good at all. I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It {{was the first time}} I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the district assembled {{in a city of}} the district and spent the night in the town square. Early in the morning, their leader said: [...] "Let us rise and go up to Zion, to the house of the Lord our God." [...] Those who lived near Jerusalem brought fresh figs and grapes, and those who lived far away brought dried figs and raisins. Leading the pilgrimage procession was an ox with horns overlaid with gold wearing a crown of olive branches. The sounds of the flute announced the pilgrims' coming until they neared Jerusalem when they sent messengers ahead and arranged their first fruits ( [...] , bikkurim) for presentation. A delegation of the Temple's leaders and treasurers came out to meet them, varying in relation to the procession. Jerusalem's artisans would stand and greet them, saying: [...] "People of such and such a place, we welcome you." [...] They played the flute until they reached the Temple Mount. On the Temple Mount, even King Agrippa would carry the basket of first fruits on his shoulder and walk to the Temple Court. As the procession approached the Temple Court, Levites would sing the words of [...] "I will extol You, O Lord, for You have raised me <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> not suffered my enemies to rejoice over me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Faith {{was brought}} {{back for the}} final season of Buffy, because, {{according}} to David Solomon, [...] "she {{had been such a}} crucial character at a very specific junction in the series {{that there would be no}} way to tie it up without her." [...] However, in season seven the dynamic between the two Slayers has changed. As Rebecca Rand Kirshner explains, [...] " [...] is no longer such a complete opposite of Buffy. And there's sort of a subtler and more complicated dynamic between them". As Buffy struggles with her unwanted position of mentor to the Potential Slayers, the writers used Faith to create an outside conflict about Buffy's leadership abilities. Although Faith is questioning Buffy and her choices she is making, she is no longer an enemy to her either. In the episode [...] "Empty Places", the Potentials lose trust in Buffy and appoint Faith as their leader instead, a decision that literally blows up in their faces. As Drew Goddard explains, [...] "Faith is like the cool aunt that everyone loves, because the cool aunt doesn't have the responsibility of raising the children. She just gets to show <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> fun. The problem is, Faith is not ready to lead. She's damaged in her own way. She's just beginning to pull herself together.
