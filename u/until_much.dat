5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later that europium was determined to be the cause.|$|E
5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E

5|$|Bedřich Smetana {{was born}} as Friedrich Smetana on 2March 1824, in Litomyšl, east of Prague near the {{traditional}} border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He {{was the third}} child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of the correct literary Czech <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Expected by {{his family}} {{to work as a}} stockbroker, Kertész pursued {{photography}} independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} the first half of the twentieth century that the first women's fraternities were established. The {{university}} first admitted women to graduate programs in 1920, although undergraduate women were not allowed at the university <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later. With these graduate women came several female Greek organizations, referred to alternately as sororities or women's fraternities. The first sorority to establish a chapter at the university was Chi Omega, whose chapter was founded in 1927. A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932, and a chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha was established twenty years later in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} (also known as Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus or Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus. The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may have survived <b>until</b> <b>much</b> more recently. The taxonomy of these animals is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E
5|$|The battle caused heavy {{casualties}} {{for both}} sides. By {{the end of}} the fight, the NK 4th Division had only 300 or 400 men in each of its regiments. Of its original 7,000 men, the division now had a strength of only 3,500, having suffered over 1,200 killed. Several thousand members of the division deserted during the fight. Most of these men were South Korean civilians forcibly conscripted into the North Korean army. The NK 4th Division would not recover <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later in the war. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade reported 66 Marines dead, 278 wounded, and one missing.

5|$|The early 1900s lacked modern {{forecasting}} and documentation. The hurricane database {{from these}} years is sometimes {{found to be}} incomplete or incorrect, and new storms are continually being added {{as part of the}} ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis. The period from 1911 through 1914 was reanalyzed in 2005. Two previously unknown tropical cyclones were identified using records including historical weather maps and ship reports, and information on the known storms was amended and corrected. These storms are referred to simply by their number in chronological order, since tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were not given official names <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later.|$|E
5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have become increasingly important in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E

5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay and elsewhere in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of angels and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.|$|E
5|$|Born in Dalton-in-Furness, Lancashire, Johnson {{became an}} {{apprentice}} {{at the local}} shipyard. He played football part-time for Dalton Athletic and Dalton Casuals until 1919, when he signed a professional contract with Manchester City following a recommendation from City defender Eli Fletcher; Fletcher had threatened to leave the club if Johnson was not signed. He made a goalscoring debut in a war league match against Blackburn Rovers on 22 February 1919, and scored a hat-trick against Port Vale a fortnight later. League football returned in August 1919, but Johnson did not play for the first team <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later in the season. He made his league debut against Middlesbrough on 18 February 1920 scoring both goals in a 2–0 win, playing in the position previously occupied by Tommy Browell. He kept his place for a further six matches, scoring one more goal. The final match in this run of appearances was a 2–1 win against Liverpool at Hyde Road, which was attended by the reigning monarch, King George V. Johnson made a further three appearances {{in the remainder of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E

5|$|Many other {{languages}} of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area exhibit similar classifier systems, leading to {{speculation about the}} origins of the Chinese system. Ancient classifier-like constructions, which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier, are attested in Old Chinese as early as 1400 BCE, but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later. Originally, classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before, and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE. The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of Old Chinese grammar until around 1100 CE. Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others, the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems. Many words that are classifiers today started out as full nouns; in some cases their meanings have been gradually bleached away so that they are now used only as classifiers.|$|E
5|$|Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189, {{within days}} of taking the throne; the formal {{election}} took place on 10 August. What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, {{as well as the}} exact chronology of events, is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, but another chronicler, Benedict of Peterborough relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates. However the election occurred, Geoffrey's consecration did not take place <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later, and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor. A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, as archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared <b>until</b> <b>much</b> later.|$|E
