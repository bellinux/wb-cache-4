25|$|Only a minor {{facelift}} with revised grille and taillight trim {{marked the}} 1970 Electra 225. The big news was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> where a new 370-horsepower 455 cubic-inch V8 replaced the 430 V8 used from 1967 to 1969. This {{was the final}} year for the Electra convertible, finned aluminum brake drums and high compression engines. New this year was a concealed radio antenna, which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield.|$|E
25|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> the 364 cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based Wildcat coupe.|$|E

25|$|Chromium 18.0 was {{released}} on 7 December 2011, with the initial release version 18.0.964.0. Nightly builds of Chromium 18 showed that this cycle included work on menu organization. In January 2012 the builds reworked the Options menu to eliminate the Basics, Personal Stuff and <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> pages and unite them into one menu named options. The new menu simplifies selections and hides privacy and proxy settings as well as security certificate management. Additional features included omnibox suggestion visualization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> the 300-cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.|$|E
25|$|The {{dry suit}} {{may also have}} an {{integrated}} hood, which seals water out around the wearer's face, and helps keep the wearer's head warm. The integrated hood is often latex rubber that fits tightly around the head, but can also be made from neoprene or membrane to allow an insulating cap to be worn <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood.</b> Care {{must be taken to}} avoid the hood making a waterproof seal around either of the ears, as this could cause an eardrum bursting outwards at depth.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Japanese drift racer Daigo Saito {{entered an}} IS 250 C in the Formula Drift Asia series. The car, {{which was a}} victim of the 2011 Japan {{earthquake}} and tsunami and due to be scrapped, was purchased by Saito and heavily customized for drift racing use. The most notable modification was the swapping of the stock engine to a 2JZ-GTE from a Mark IV Toyota Supra. With 1200 horsepower <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> Daigo obliterated the competition in that season, winning all the rounds and earning the championship in convincing fashion.|$|E
25|$|Maelstrom by San Francisco-based BitTorrent Inc. {{which took}} the Chromium {{framework}} and integrated a BitTorrent engine <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> so that torrent files could be played {{directly from the}} browser and torrent-powered websites {{no longer had to}} rely on central servers. Although no official discontinue notice has been announced as of February 2017, the BitTorrent Inc. website no longer provides the browser for download, the last build has not been updated past Chromium version 44, and the last post by the project lead staff was on 14 September 2015.|$|E
25|$|<b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> the 401-cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 {{designed for the}} upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower {{version of the same}} engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.|$|E

25|$|The Bel Air, {{which had}} been the top line series since 1953, was now the middle range. Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers {{matching}} the car series. Parkwood 6-passenger and Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air's model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> little change took place. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. Bel Air production was 447,100. The new Impala line surpassed Bel Air production by 20,000 units. A parking brake warning light was optional.|$|E

They lost the title match on December 2, at the <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> internet pay-per-view, to defending champions The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson). Waltman, under his real name, {{returned to}} Chikara on March 8, 2013, losing to Hallowicked.

25|$|SQL Native Client is {{the native}} client side data access library for Microsoft SQL Server, version 2005 onwards. It {{natively}} implements {{support for the}} SQL Server features including the Tabular Data Stream implementation, support for mirrored SQL Server databases, full support for all data types supported by SQL Server, asynchronous operations, query notifications, encryption support, as well as receiving multiple result sets in a single database session. SQL Native Client is used <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> by SQL Server plug-ins for other data access technologies, including ADO or OLE DB. The SQL Native Client can also be directly used, bypassing the generic data access layers.|$|E
50|$|The key to {{the debris}} {{protection}} {{in the design and}} prototype units was successive layers of Nextel, a material commonly used as insulation <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoods</b> of many cars, spaced between several-inches-thick layers of open cell foam, similar to foam used for chair cushions on Earth. The Nextel and foam layers cause a particle to shatter as it hits, losing more and more of its energy as it penetrates deeper.|$|R

25|$|In the 1960s, {{competition}} forced diversification and AMT added {{new product}} lines, specifically trucks. For example, its early Dirt Hauler kit {{was merely a}} generic tractor-trailer with dumping trailer. Then, in 1969, AMT released the California Hauler 359 kit. This new kit was a revolution for model building, a realistic model of a Peterbilt 359 tractor-trailer, the design having been copied from the manufacturer's specifications. It also had an authentic 8V71 Detroit Diesel engine <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood.</b> The kit lacked a sleeper cab, {{but there was a}} coupon that could be sent in along with ten cents to get it. The following year, the second version was issued with a sleeper cab.|$|E
25|$|Along with Nash, the new Hudsons had {{the widest}} front {{seats in the}} industry. The Weather Eye heating and {{ventilation}} with an optional air conditioning system were highly rated in terms of efficiency. The integrated placement of major air conditioning systems <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> {{and the price of}} only $395 (about half the cost as on other cars) also won praise. Automotive journalist Floyd Clymer rated the Hudson Hornet as the safest car built in the United States because of (1) the single unit welded body, (2) high quality braking system with added mechanical backup system, (3) roadability, general handling, and maneuverability; as well as (4) excellent acceleration and power for emergency situations.|$|E
25|$|The {{charge port}} area now {{comes with a}} light not {{provided}} on earlier models, {{and the ability to}} open the port door from inside the car or by using the key fob. The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and around view monitor, which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of filming, Richter had a 300-page book called The Essential Buckaroo that {{consisted}} of notes and had every incomplete script Mac Rauch wrote over the years. Principal photography began during {{the second week of}} September 1983 on locations in and around South Gate, an industrial suburb of L.A. Buckaroo's neurosurgery scene with New Jersey was shot at the Lakeview Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley. The jet car sequences were shot in October on a dry lake north of the San Bernardino Mountains. The vehicle was designed and built by Riva, art director Stephen Dane and Thrust Racing owners Jerry Segal and George Haddebeck. Segal started with a Ford F-350 truck, reinforced the frame assembly, added the front end from a Grand National stock car, borrowed air scoops from a DC-3, and a one-man cockpit modeled after a Messerschmitt fighter plane. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> Segal modified the Ford engine with an oversized carburetor and nitrous oxide injectors. The Oscillation Overthruster was created by Riva and visual effects supervisor Michael Fink out of a gyroscope to which a metal frame, wires, circuits, and tiny strobe lights were added. The design was the basis for the Flux Capacitor in the 1985 film Back to the Future. The prop itself would ultimately be reused a number of times on various Star Trek episodes.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, a four-disc set was {{released}} as the [...] "Ultimate Cut". This version included the director's {{cut of the}} film re-edited to contain Tales of the Black Freighter into the story as it is featured in the graphic novel, bringing the run time of the film to 215 minutes. The set also included two additional hours of bonus features including <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> and The Complete Motion Comic. Originally released only on DVD, the set later became available on Blu-ray.|$|E
500|$|The Tales of the Black Freighter DVD also {{includes}} <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood,</b> a fictional in-universe documentary detailing the characters' backstories, which takes its title {{from that of}} Hollis Mason's memoirs in the comic book. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> is rated PG because {{it is meant to}} resemble a behind-the-scenes television news magazine profile of the characters. The actors were allowed to improvise during filming interviews in character. Bolex cameras were even used to film [...] "archive" [...] footage of the Minutemen. The film itself was scheduled to be released on DVD four months after Tales of the Black Freighter, and Warner released a director's cut on July 21, 2009, and the extended version with the animated film edited back into the main picture was scheduled to be released on November 3, 2009, but did not hit the shelves until November 10, 2009. Snyder said if the film did well enough, a theatrical release of the director's cut would be shown at theaters in New York and Los Angeles simultaneously [...] In addition, the , was released in digital video stores and DVD on March 3. It included an exclusive scene from the movie but as of press time (prior to the disc's release) the scene had yet to be added.|$|E
