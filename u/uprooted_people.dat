[...] Oh, yes, if that's all you mean, I don't suppose we shall always be able in {{everything}} to keep up our exclusive position. Our neighbours, who (bar the advantage of insularity, which means a coast and a port always close at hand) seem nearly as well situated as we are {{for access to the}} world-markets, are beginning to wake up and take a slice of the cake from us. Germany is manufacturing; Belgium is smelting; Antwerp is exporting; America is occupying her own markets. But that's a very different thing indeed from national decadence. We may have to compete a little harder with our rivals, that's all. The Boom may be over; but the Thames remains: the geographical facts are still unaltered. And notice that all the time while there's been this vague talk about [...] "bad times"--income-tax has been steadily increasing, London has been steadily growing, every outer and visible sign of commercial prosperity has been steadily spreading. Have our watering-places shrunk? Have our buildings been getting smaller and less luxurious? If Antwerp has grown, how about Hull and Cardiff? [...] "Well, perhaps the past is all right; but consider the future! Eight hours are going to drive capital out of the country!" [...] Rubbish! I'm not a political economist, thank God; I never sank quite so low as that. And I'm not speaking for or against Eight Hours: I'm only discounting some verbose nonsense. But I know enough to see that the capital of a country can no more be exported than the land or the houses. Can you drive away the London and North-Western Railway? Can you drive away the factories of Manchester, the mines of the Black Country, the canals, the buildings, the machinery, the docks, the plant, the apparatus? Impossible, on the very face of it! Most of the capital of a country is fixed in its soil, and can't be <b>uprooted.</b> <b>People</b> fall into this error about driving away capital because they know you can sell particular railway shares or a particular factory and leave the country with the proceeds, provided somebody else is willing to buy; but you can't sell all the railways and all the factories in a lump, and clear out with the capital. No, no; England stands where she does, because God put her there; and until He invents a new order of things (which may, of course, happen any day--as, for example, if aerial navigation came in) she must continue, in spite of minor changes, to maintain in the main her present position.|$|E

40|$|Abstract] Migration and the {{movements}} of people are complex processes that <b>uproot</b> <b>people</b> and transplant them in a new environment, a transition that {{is not easy to}} make in the best of times. People create meaning out of the context in which events occur. Consequently, an experience of migration always involves a strong subjective component of people's lived experiences and their reaction to the new environment. Refugees are people who move involuntarily from their country of residence. A refugee has been defined by the U. N. Convention and Protocol for the Status of Refugee Status as a person "owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. " The state is required to give refuge to those who seek asylum on a durable basis, and if it is unable to do so then it is required to at least give them refuge on a temporary basis. States are not allowed to expel or return any refugee to the territory where he or she is likely to face persecution...|$|R

40|$|Indonesia is an {{excellent}} place to study the complexity of Asian (im) mobilities. The archipelago’s scattered geography has been conducive to intricate systems of circular movements and various forms of migration and cross-cultural mixing. In this paper, I analyse the widespread occurrence of various forms of mobility between and beyond the Indonesian islands. Today, many Indonesians {{are engaged in a}} combination of short and temporary as well as long-term and long-distance travels, driven by both sociocultural and economic motivations. It is important to place these contemporary flows {{in the context of a}} long history of movement that was facilitated by network-creating and network-dependent relationships. Some of these mobilities have been explained as a cultural characteristic. The rich tradition of merantau, or travelling to gain experience (at different levels), serves to illustrate that translocal border-crossings are generally not made with the intention to <b>uproot</b> <b>people</b> but are experienced by both ‘movers’ and ‘stayers’ as incomplete and open-ended. As merantau is culturally institutionalized, it assumes an element of circularity, in that leaving and returning are equally encouraged. Most Indonesians are part of this mobility, whether personally or through the back and forth movements of relatives or significant others. Culturally rooted understandings of geographical mobility such as merantau are as relevant as the physical movements themselves in understanding the meaning of mobility. At the same time, Indonesian patterns of movement have undergone dynamic changes over the past century, linked with various regional political events and circumstances. In many cases, externally generated changes have reinforced traditional forms of mobility, such as merantau, and added new ones. In addition, border-crossing movements among people with limited mobility resources are mediated by ‘modern’ technologies, including increased regulations and broker networks. status: publishe...|$|R

Both the left and right include activists who want the working class to be rooted again, but on the left there is sizeable contingent who merely want everyone to be reduced to the same level of unrootedness as the proletariats, and on the right a section who want the workers to remain unrooted the better to be able to exploit them.
