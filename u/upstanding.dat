5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} has been found of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements in the area, and Chatteris possesses what has been interpreted as the only <b>upstanding</b> Neolithic boundaries in Fenland. Saxon evidence is less well preserved, although in 679, Hunna, the chaplain to Æthelthryth of Ely built a hermitage on Honey Hill. More apocryphically, Chatteris is reputed {{to have been the}} last refuge of Boudica as she fled from the Romans.|$|E
5|$|At {{the police}} station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an <b>upstanding</b> member of the community, would be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank {{reflects}} on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E
5|$|Pete is {{in talks}} with Mohawk Airlines for their return to the agency. The {{arrangement}} calls for Roger to handle the day-to-day business. Roger puts Peggy in charge of hiring a new male copywriter for Mohawk. Stan advises her to hire a mediocre employee to make her competition lighter. Peggy, however, chooses to interview a talented young Jewish man named Michael Ginsberg whose work impresses her. When Peggy interviews Michael, he is over-the-top in his disposition. However, Roger forces her to bring Michael to Don. During his interview with Don, Michael is more <b>upstanding</b> and professional, which puzzles Peggy. Michael is hired. He returns home to find his domineering father reading the paper. Michael's personality changes yet again, this time more shy and reserved. When he learns of his son's success, Michael's father blesses his son with a Jewish prayer.|$|E
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such <b>upstanding</b> ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E

25|$|Shirts of linen or cotton {{featured}} high <b>upstanding</b> or turnover collars, and neckties grew {{wider and}} were {{tied in a}} bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin. Heavy padded and fitted frock coats (in French redingotes), now usually single-breasted and knee length, were worn for business occasions, over waistcoats or vests with lapels and notched collars. Waistcoats were generally cut straight across the front and had lapels.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{smuggling}} {{was one of}} Christchurch's most lucrative 'industries' {{and many of the}} townspeople were involved. Local legends are rife and include such <b>upstanding</b> characters as doctors, parsons, bankers and local merchants. Even the mayor was involved, both John Cook and Samuel Hookey were known smugglers who became mayors. John Cook was mayor of Christchurch five times (1777, 1779, 1781, 1783, 1786). One notorious smuggler, Sophie Dawes later became a French Baroness.|$|E
25|$|After the {{criminal}} disaster of the First Audiencia of Mexico City, Emperor Charles V carefully chose five <b>upstanding</b> men to replace them, as the Second Audiencia. The Second Audiencia was named in a royal decree dated January 12, 1530. It {{was made up}} of Bishop Sebastián Ramírez de Fuenleal as president, and Juan de Salmerón, Francisco Ceinos, Maldonado and Vasco de Quiroga as oidores (judges). All of these men were honest, honorable and capable. All were licentiates.|$|E
25|$|Following Henry Morgan’s {{appointment}} as lieutenant governor, Port Royal began to change. Pirates {{were no longer}} needed to defend the city. The selling of slaves took on greater importance. <b>Upstanding</b> citizens disliked the reputation the city had acquired. In 1687, Jamaica passed anti-piracy laws. Consequently, {{instead of being a}} safe haven for pirates, Port Royal became noted as their place of execution. Gallows Point welcomed many to their death, including Charles Vane and Calico Jack, who were hanged in 1720. About five months later, the famous woman pirate Mary Read died in the Jamaican prison in Port Royal. Two years later, 41 pirates met their death in one month.|$|E
25|$|Before the Harry Potter series starts – {{when the}} {{character}} Lord Voldemort {{declared war on}} the wizarding world – Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and a highly <b>upstanding</b> and powerful citizen of the wizarding world, attempted {{to take control of}} the situation by founding the Order of the Phoenix. Several characters joined the organisation, seeking to prevent Voldemort from taking over the wizarding world and establishing a tyrannical new world order. During this period, before the events of the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the Order sustained heavy losses, including the murders of minor characters such as the Prewetts, the Bones and the McKinnons. The Longbottoms were also tortured to insanity at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange.|$|E
25|$|Knowing the {{location}} of an archaeological site is fundamental {{to being able to}} study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so position fixing is generally achieved using GPS. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using transects. A site may also be located by visually surveying some form of marker (such as a buoy) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding sonar equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an <b>upstanding</b> structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{others were}} accused of witchcraft: Martha Corey, child Dorothy Good, and Rebecca Nurse in Salem Village, and Rachel Clinton in nearby Ipswich. Martha Corey had {{expressed}} skepticism about {{the credibility of the}} girls' accusations and thus drawn attention. The charges against her and Rebecca Nurse deeply troubled the community because Martha Corey was a full covenanted member of the Church in Salem Village, as was Rebecca Nurse in the Church in Salem Town. If such <b>upstanding</b> people could be witches, the townspeople thought, then anybody could be a witch, and church membership was no protection from accusation. Dorothy Good, the daughter of Sarah Good, was only four years old, but not exempted from questioning by the magistrates; her answers were construed as a confession that implicated her mother. In Ipswich, Rachel Clinton was arrested for witchcraft at the end of March on independent charges unrelated to the afflictions of the girls in Salem Village.|$|E
25|$|Status has {{far more}} {{relevance}} {{than in previous}} games. Now, many kinds of weapon, ship, and factory are not purchasable until the player has earned sufficient reputation with the vendor race. With some races, reputation can be earned through trade; with others, the player must earn respect by killing unwanted visitors in the race's space - such as pirates, Khaak, or Xenon. Some races appreciate both. By choosing to be an <b>upstanding</b> citizen, the player can earn {{the right to buy}} powerful new weapons, ships and technologies. By engaging in piracy, destruction, smuggling or other crime the player may lose reputation, and so may lose the privilege to buy things. The persistent wrongdoer may lose the right to land at stations, or even to enter sectors, being attacked on sight. Eventually, the player may find it impossible to buy many of the game's most powerful ships, weapons and technologies (although such things may still be possible to acquire through less orthodox means).|$|E
25|$|Nicholas' {{determination}} {{to defend his}} sister's honor leads his uncle to vow he will destroy the young man. What ensues {{is a series of}} adventures in which the <b>upstanding</b> Nicholas manages to survive the schemes of his evil uncle, including an attempt to return Smike to Squeers by kidnapping him and an effort to abort Nicholas' growing relationship with Madeline by promising her father he will excuse his debts if the girl weds Hawk. Ralph's designs on Madeline are thwarted when her father dies unexpectedly. Unfortunately, Smike falls ill and soon dies. Soon after, a sinister secret Ralph has harbored for years surfaces, and it is revealed Smike was Ralph's son, whom he had thought dead. Realizing that his son had died the best friend of his most hated enemy, Ralph hangs himself. Nicholas marries Madeline and settles with her in Devon at his father's house and grounds, where Smike is buried.|$|E
25|$|Aughanduff was {{probably}} first {{settled in the}} Bronze Age. No prehistoric remains of note appear {{to survive in the}} area, however, bar an undated site listed on the Northern Ireland Environment Agency's Monuments and Buildings Record. This is thought to have been an enclosure 60m in diameter, set on a localised height within the townland at Irish Grid Reference H9736023370. Photographic records show a series of earthworks and although a field inspection in 2004 failed to locate <b>upstanding</b> remains, it is noted that the site would have been an excellent position for a settlement. The townland lies just over a mile (2km) from An Aughnaclough mullion, where in 1815 the first, and reportedly most remarkable, megalith tomb in Ireland (subsequently destroyed) was discovered by Mr. John Bell of Newry. Several prehistoric stone structures have been found and documented in the area but many have been lost over the years. An example of such a structure was a ring fort named 'the Lis' which appears on the map of 1827 as being in the field adjacent to where the Church now stands, however this structure is no longer visible and must be presumed to have been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, US Congress {{passed a}} {{prohibition}} law outlawing the manufacturing and transporting of drinking alcohol. When drinking became illegal, it became popular in underground nightclubs. The {{type of music}} that was played at these underground establishments that were selling alcohol was jazz. It was not seen as <b>upstanding</b> to listen to or perform jazz music, {{because it was an}} African American style and at that time the United States was segregated and racism was an overtly prevalent issue. Because jazz music was seen as great dance music, big band jazz became popular in nightclubs. In the 1920s, freelance drummers emerged. They were hired to play shows, concerts, theaters, clubs and back dancers and artists of various genres. Just as modern drummers have many different roles, so did the drummers of the 1920s. One important role for drummers in the 1920s is what is referred to in modern times as a foley artist. During silent films, an orchestra was hired to accompany the silent film and the drummer was responsible for providing all the sound effects. Drummers played instruments to imitate gun shots, planes flying overhead, a train coming into a train station, and galloping horses etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} the most {{completely}} ruined part of the site, with {{little in the way}} of <b>upstanding</b> walls. A single Norman architecture arched doorway, leading from the cloister into the nave of the church shows fine foliage moulding, with the sculptured figures of St Peter and Saint Paul either side of the opening. This is on the south side of the church's western end – an austere choice, apparently unaltered. Lilleshall and most similar abbeys had their processional door near close to the transept and dorter, and many had night stairs for the convenience of the monks or canons. At Haughmond the canons had to cross the cloisters, in all weathers, and all times of day and night. There are traces of an early 12th-century church, found during excavations, close to the south transept. However, the easily discerned cruciform plan of the late 12th-century building provides the main framework. The natural upward slope to the east was used to create a symbolism of spiritual ascent, with steps leading from the nave to the choir, and more from the choir to the sanctuary and high altar – a rise of about four metres. The church was about 60 metres (almost exactly 200 feet) in length – about the same as at Lilleshall, which it seems to have resembled closely – and originally aisleless. However, an aisle and porch were added on the northern side in the 13th century. A chapel was added to the northern side of the presbytery in the 15th: this may have been the chapel of St Anne), where the canons served the Le Strange chantry around 1480. Burials of lay benefactors took place in the church and elsewhere on the site: the graves of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel (died 1302) and his mother, Isabella Mortimer, Countess of Arundel (died c. 1292), both very important benefactors, are marked in the sanctuary area.|$|E
500|$|McNeile's {{stories are}} either {{directly}} about the war, or contain {{people whose lives}} have been shaped by it. His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories, with upper class Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it. Although he was seen {{at the time as}} [...] "simply an <b>upstanding</b> Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen", after the Second World War his work was criticised as having fascist overtones, while also displaying the xenophobia and anti-semitism apparent in some other writers of the period.|$|E
500|$|From the 1950s on, McNeile's work came to {{be viewed}} {{in the light of}} events of the Second World War, and journalists such as Richard Usborne {{highlighted}} aspects of the stories which he considered were [...] "carrying the Führer-principle". DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel—The Black Gang (1922)—is when the fascist element was introduced. Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War, while the academic Ion Trewin considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as [...] "simply an <b>upstanding</b> Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen".|$|E
500|$|The January 1999 {{report said}} {{that more than}} 4,000 gun shows are held in the U.S. annually. Also, between 50 and 75 percent of gun show vendors hold a Federal Firearms License, and the [...] "majority of vendors who attend shows sell firearms, {{associated}} accessories, and other paraphernalia." [...] The report concluded that although most sellers at gun shows are <b>upstanding</b> people, a few corrupt sellers could move a large quantity of firearms into high-risk hands. They stated that there were gaps in current law and recommended [...] "extending the Brady Law to 'close the gun show loophole.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Responses to Leonard's {{performance}} {{were mostly}} positive. In a recap {{of the pilot}} episode, Tom Shales of The Washington Post quoted [...] "Leonard has been playing <b>upstanding</b> young men for what seems like forever, but he's {{still one of the}} most outstanding <b>upstanding</b> young men in the acting racket". However, Sherwin Nurland of Slate stated that Leonard often seems so detached that [...] "he'd be better off in another show". In a recap of the season four episode [...] "Ugly" [...] Nina Smith of TV Guide said that she thinks that the most convincing writing of the show has always been the scenes in which Cuddy and Wilson [...] "spar" [...] with House. In a 2008 press conference, Katie Jacobs, who works as an executive producer for the show, praised Leonard for being equally adept at comedy and drama. TV Gal, of Zap2it, stated that she [...] "truly appreciates" [...] what Leonard brings to the show, being the only character who [...] "truly stands up to House" [...] and [...] "quietly and subtly" [...] giving the show [...] "some of its best moments". In an article about whom to keep if the writers of House decided to minor down the cast, Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune said that Wilson can [...] "never, never, never, never" [...] leave the show. Ryan also listed Wilson on her list of [...] "5 Great Characters", saying that Leonard is the [...] "underrated linchpin of the excellent “House” cast".|$|E
500|$|According to the tale, a {{man called}} Thorolf Stuck-up had a bull which wounded his neighbours' farm animals, damaged haystacks and caused [...] "a great deal of trouble". [...] When an <b>upstanding</b> local farmer named Thord saw the bull {{damaging}} the stacks of peat on his farm at Marbaeli, he lunged at the animal with a spear and struck it dead. [...] In revenge, Thorolf killed Thord's seven- or eight-year-old son Olaf, to the disgust of Thorolf's wife and kinsmen. [...] Thorolf fled and eventually secured the protection of Thorvald Hjaltasson, a prominent leader who lived at Hjaltadal. [...] After Christmas, Thorvald secured for him the safekeeping and support of Starri of Guddalir, who often sheltered outlaws.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the Drummond stories, {{much of the}} {{language}} used by McNeile's characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by the academic Joan DelFattore to be [...] "intensely conservative by modern standards"; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as Agatha Christie, [...] "exhibit the inevitable xenophobia and anti-semitism of the period, McNeile's go far beyond the 'polite' norms". J.D. Bourn considers his language to be [...] "rather distasteful", while the academic Michael Denning observed that [...] "Drummond is a bundle of chauvinisms, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners". The academic Ion Trewin comments that for the readers of the 1920s and '30s, McNeile was seen {{at the time as}} [...] "simply an <b>upstanding</b> Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen".|$|E
500|$|In {{late summer}} 1897 Skagway and Dyea {{fell under the}} control of Jefferson Randolph [...] "Soapy" [...] Smith and his men, who arrived from Seattle shortly after Skagway began to expand. He was an American {{confidence}} man whose gang, 200 to 300 strong, cheated and stole from the prospectors travelling through the region. He maintained the illusion of being an <b>upstanding</b> member of the community, opening three saloons as well as creating fake businesses to assist in his operations. One of his scams was a fake telegraph office charging to send messages all over the US and Canada, often pretending to receive a reply. Opposition to Smith steadily grew and, after weeks of vigilante activity, he was killed in Skagway during the shootout on Juneau Wharf on July 8, 1898.|$|E
500|$|Due to falling crime rates, {{fewer people}} {{felt the need}} to carry a firearm for {{protection}} after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the European migrant crisis and November 2015 Paris attacks. Gun advocacy groups argue that {{there is no point in}} banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is. At the same time, however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing <b>upstanding</b> citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as [...] "being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe", found himself unable to obtain any in the country when preparing for the 2011 Norway attacks. Similarly, a Polish terrorist obtained guns illegally in 1200km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70km from the Czech border. Also, the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.|$|E
500|$|While at Sunpu Castle, Lady Saigō worshipped at a Buddhist temple called Ryūsen-ji (...) [...] [...] She became {{devoted to}} {{the teachings of the}} Pure Land sect and was known for her piety and charity. [...] Because she {{suffered}} a high degree of myopia, she often donated money, clothing, food, and other necessities to blind women and organizations that assisted them. [...] She eventually founded a co-operative school with living quarters near Ryūsen-ji that assisted indigent blind women by teaching them how to play the shamisen (traditional stringed instrument) as a vocation, and helped them to find employment. [...] These women were known as goze, and were akin to traveling minstrels in Edo period Japan. [...] The women were granted membership to the guild-like organization, and musicians with apprentices were dispatched to various destinations. [...] They played pieces from a sanctioned repertoire, and operated under a strict code of rules on behavior and permissible business transactions intended to maintain an <b>upstanding</b> reputation. [...] On her deathbed, Lady Saigō wrote a letter pleading for the continued maintenance of the organization.|$|E
500|$|In {{connection}} with that, a Czech gun owners association asked the parties {{running in the}} elections in the Czech Republic whether they agree (1) that the citizens {{should have the right}} to own and carry firearms, (2) that the competence on deciding firearms issues should lie in the hands of the nation states and not be decided on the EU level, and (3) whether they support Malmström's activity leading to the curbing of the right of <b>upstanding</b> citizens to own and carry firearms. Out of 39 parties running, 22 answered. The answers were almost unanimously positive to the first two questions and negative to the third one. Exceptions were only two fringe parties, the Greens – which, while supporting the right for gun ownership in its current form, also support further unification of rules on the European level and labeled the opposing reaction to [...] Malmström's proposal as premature, and the Pirates which support unification of the rules leading to less restrictions elsewhere, commenting that one may not cross the borders out of the Czech Republic legally even with a pepper spray. Other fringe parties at the same time voiced their intent to introduce American style castle doctrine or to arm the general population following the example of the Swiss militia.|$|E
500|$|Food {{was mostly}} served on plates or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from {{the dishes and}} place it on trenchers of stale bread, wood or pewter with the help of spoons or bare hands. In lower-class {{households}} it was common to eat food straight off the table. Knives were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period, and early on were limited to Italy. Even there {{it was not until the}} 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes. The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century. She was the wife of Domenico Selvo, the Doge of Venice, and caused considerable dismay among <b>upstanding</b> Venetians. The foreign consort's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as [...] "...the Venetian Doge's wife, whose body, after her excessive delicacy, entirely rotted away." [...] However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073, and their marriage (Theodora and Domenico) took place in 1075.|$|E
500|$|The Dark Blues {{had turned}} to Ferguson to play for and manage the team because of his {{reputation}} as the most authoritarian captain in the game. He was an honest and <b>upstanding</b> citizen {{in a time when}} not many ballplayers could say the same. However, he was also a domineering, dictatorial captain with a violent streak. [...] Team discipline did improve in his first season, but his overbearing ways proved divisive, causing the team to bicker amongst themselves. Ferguson's temper would flare up often, even when the team was winning. The Chicago Tribune reported that if anyone on the Hartford nine committed an error, [...] "Ferguson [...] swear until everything looks blue." [...] He was particularly rough on second baseman Jack Burdock, who {{on more than one occasion}} heard his captain publicly threaten [...] "to ram his fist down Burdock's throat." [...] Some players tolerated his behavior; others, however, refused to comply. Shortstop Tom Carey and center fielder Jack Remsen did not hesitate to yell back, while Burdock and pitcher Candy Cummings, on the other hand, often sulked. The situation in Hartford came to a head after a tough loss to the Red Stockings, a game in which Ferguson had committed several errors. Hartford's main pitcher, Tommy Bond, suggested that Ferguson was [...] "crooked". Ferguson denied the charge, and Bond quickly retracted his statement, claiming that he said it in anger. Bond then requested that he be able to leave the team because he could not play for Ferguson, a request that was granted by league president Morgan Bulkeley, a former owner of the Dark Blues.|$|E
