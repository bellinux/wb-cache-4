50|$|Dead letter <b>mail</b> or <b>undeliverable</b> <b>mail</b> is {{mail that}} cannot be {{delivered}} to the addressee or returned to the sender. This is usually {{due to lack of}} compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and return address, or the inability to forward the mail when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing <b>undeliverable</b> <b>mail.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Tracing {{undeliverable}} mailIt {{is a sad}} {{fact that}} during war battlefield casualties invariably produce large quantities of <b>undeliverable</b> <b>mail.</b> In the field, such mail that comes to hand in the units was checked against unit records and disposed of appropriately. [...] Unit mail {{which could not be}} delivered for whatever reason was returned to the Army Post Office (APO) or Field Post Office (FPO), and sent back to postal detachments located at the formation's 2nd Echelon. These detachments checked the mail against the Field Records. Mail that could not be dealt with was returned to the Return Letter Branch (RLB) at HPC RE for further searching and consultation with the Records Office of the appropriate arm. If that proved unsuccessful the letter was eventually returned to the sender.|$|R
