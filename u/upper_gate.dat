5|$|The walls stretch {{along the}} south of the town with eight towers and two gatehouses. The <b>Upper</b> <b>Gate</b> formed the main inland {{entrance}} to the town during the medieval period, and, in addition to its twin towers, was originally protected by a stone barbican, of which some stonework still remains – a rare survival for town barbicans of this period. A gatekeeper would have lived over the entrance during the medieval period. The original defensive ditch and drawbridge have been filled in, however, and replaced by a modern road. The second gatehouse, Mill Gate, was designed to allow access to the royal watermill that lay just outside the main town, and similarly features twin protective towers. In between the two gatehouses are the remains of Llywelyn's Hall, a grand building originally built into the town walls by Edward I before being dismantled and moved to Caernarfon Castle in 1316. Further along the walls is the mock-Gothic archway built in 1846 to accommodate the local railway, possibly drawing on similar designs used in Chester. A unique set of twelve medieval latrines is built into the southern town walls, first constructed for the use of royal staff working in adjacent buildings in the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an <b>upper</b> <b>gate,</b> because the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> plus the lock's rise.|$|E
25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} lock chamber {{through the use}} of culverts in the lock masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the masonry recess where the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings in the lock chamber. Both sides of the lock had these, so there would be a total of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets in the lock masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris to clog the opening.|$|E

25|$|Lock 27 is {{a curious}} {{combination}} of the two specifications, having the culverts inside the masonry, but the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> below the breast wall. This is because of multiple contractors working on the lock after a lapse of time.|$|E

25|$|The 1830 design {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} culverts in the masonry, and the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> is below the breast wall. The advantage {{here is that the}} lock can fill faster with the wickets being in the gate, but will not swamp a boat in the lock chamber. In the 1830 design locks, the upper and lower gates are both the same height. The majority of locks on the C canal are to this specification.|$|E

5000|$|The first lock at Sandford was the {{navigation}} weir or flash lock {{situated on the}} old river channel {{at the site of}} the lasher today. This was described in 1624 as [...] "Great Lockes" [...] and was replaced in about 1632 by one of the first pound locks to be built in England. Iffley, Sandford and Culham locks were built by the Oxford-Burcot Commission following the Parliament Act of 1623. The old lock has since been filled in but its position can still be seen (the position of the <b>upper</b> <b>gates</b> can be seen in the stonework above the present <b>upper</b> <b>gates).</b> A new lock on the present site was opened in 1836 which lasted until the most recent improvements when the present lock was built in 1972.|$|R

25|$|Some narrow locks (e.g. on Birmingham Canal Navigations) go even further. They have single gates at {{the lower}} end also. This speeds up passage, even though single lower gates are heavy (heavier than a single <b>upper</b> <b>gate,</b> because the lower gate is taller) and the lock has to be longer (a lower gate opens INTO the lock, it has to pass the bow or stern of an {{enclosed}} boat, and a single gate has a wider arc than two half-gates).|$|E
500|$|These locks are {{staircase}} locks, whereby inner {{lock gate}} pairs serve {{as both the}} <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> and lower gate. [...] The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the Navigation Trust {{was able}} to buy the bed of the river between Carre Street in Sleaford and Bone Mill, which {{included}} the lock and its island at Cogglesford Mill. Lower Kyme lock was refurbished in the winter of 2008. The <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> is a vertical guillotine gate, and the mechanism required 350 turns of a handle to raise the gate, and another 350 to lower it again. New lock gates were fitted, and a new geared mechanism requiring fewer turns made the lock easier to operate. Around [...] of the waterway from Sleaford to Cogglesford Mill lock were reopened, following the construction of a lifting bridge in the town centre. This was installed in late December 2008, although the hydraulic operating gear was not fitted until January 2010. Work was also carried out to construct a new slipway on Eastgate Green, to allow trailed boats to be launched onto the town section. This involved careful planning to avoid damage to 27 mature trees, and the widening of [...] of the bank to create a mooring point. Funding was provided by Lincolnshire County Council, the Inland Waterways Association, and Waste Recycling Environmental Ltd (WREN), which administers the Landfill Communities Fund. An official opening of the new bridge and facilities took place on 3 July 2010, when three boats were launched from the slipway. Members from canoe clubs at Boston and Sleaford attended.|$|E

2500|$|The Goose Creek locks were 0.2 miles below Edwards Ferry (Lock 25), {{in section}} 51 used for traffic coming from Goose Creek on the Virginia shore. It allowed boats from the Goose Creek and Little River Navigation Company to enter. Only one Goose Creek boat was {{documented}} {{to enter the}} C canal, {{and there is no}} documentation of a C boat entering Goose Creek. The lock was eventually converted into a waste weir. The Goose Creek lock is actually a staircase lock or combine lock [...] (perhaps the only one on the C & O canal), i.e. two locks are put together with no intervening pound or basin between them, the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> of the lower lock being the same gate as the lower gate of the second lock.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "real" [...] {{staircase}} can {{be thought}} of as a [...] "compressed" [...] flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the <b>upper</b> <b>gate</b> of one lock is also the lower gate of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms staircase and flight interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a single lock with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the bottom gate). As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the bottom chamber) before a boat starts to ascend, or empty (except for the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend. By building a pair of such lock sets (one used to climb and the other to descend) these difficulties are avoided, as well as enabling a greater traffic volume and reduced wait times.|$|E
5000|$|There was a mill here {{built by}} the Knights Templar in around 1294. There are also records of a ferry and a fish weir in mediaeval times. In the reign of Edward III there is {{an account of the}} immemorial {{conflict}} between millers and bargemen when [...] "the men of Oxon broke down the locks of Sandford". This was probably at the navigation weir or flash lock on the old river channel behind the second island. This was described in 1624 as ‘Great Lockes’. It was replaced in 1631 when the Oxford-Burcot Commission built one of the first pound locks in England here. The lock was passed on to the Thames Navigation Commission in 1790 and lengthened in 1795, under the direction of Daniel Harris, the Oxford gaoler, at a cost of nearly £1,800. In 1836 a new lock was built on the current site alongside the old one and a lock house was ordered in 1839. The old lock has since been filled in after an incident when a miller opened the sluices and caused damage to the embankments. Its position is still visible (the position of the <b>upper</b> <b>gates</b> {{can be seen in the}} stonework above the present <b>upper</b> <b>gates).</b> An iron bridge above the lock was built between 1866 and 1877. The latest rebuild of the lock was in 1972.|$|R
