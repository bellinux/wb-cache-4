50|$|Customs duties are an {{important}} source of revenue in developing countries. Importers purport to evade customs duty by (a) under-invoicing and (b) misdeclaration of quantity and product-description. When there is ad valorem import duty, the tax base can be reduced through <b>underinvoicing.</b> Misdeclaration of quantity is more relevant for products with specific duty. Production description is changed to match a H. S. Code commensurate with a lower rate of duty.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new approach}} to the evaluation of pre-shipment inspection (PSI) programs as ways of improving tariff-revenue collection and reducing fraud when customs administrations are corrupt. We build a model highlighting the contribution of private surveillance firms to the generation of information and describing how incentives for <b>underinvoicing</b> and collusive behaviour between importers and customs are affected by the introduction of PSI. It is shown theoretically that the introduction of PSI has an ambiguous effect on the level of fraud. Empirically, our econometric results suggest that the introduction of PSI services increased <b>underinvoicing</b> in Argentina and Indonesia, and reduced it in the Philippines. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{takes off}} {{from an earlier}} inquiry {{on the effects of}} HCV (home {{consumption}} value) valuation. This study is intended to assist policymakers as well as the private sector in their task of deciding whether to implement or postpone the adoption of the GATT Valuation Code (GVC) by January 1, 2000. Under the GVC, the dutiable base for imports is defined as the "transaction value" [...] i. e., "the price actually paid or payable for imported goods. " The findings of the study support the argument that trade liberalization in the form of lower tariffs will reduce the incidence of <b>underinvoicing.</b> transaction value...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} extent and the {{direction}} of trade misinvoicing {{in the context of}} the new policy environment that has affected the Turkish economy in the post 1990 period. Utilizing bilateral partner country statistics between Turkey and its major trading partners, we observe persisting export overinvoicing and an oscillating pattern of import misinvoicing at the aggregate level. Country-specific data reveal different patterns. As opposed to the general trend in misinvoicing, exports to China are <b>underinvoiced</b> and imports are overinvoiced. We also analyze how the liberalization policies and the customs union agreement with the European Union countries affect trade misinvoicing. We find that, with trade liberalization policies, import misinvoicing has decreased at the aggregate level. However, contrary to the expectations, customs union agreement did not help decrease the extent of trade misinvoicing in Turkey. ...|$|R
40|$|The Bretton Woods system {{broke down}} in 1971 and since that time the {{developing}} countries have faced serious problems in keeping their exchange rates stable. Since 1975, the situation has become more difficult with acclerating inflation rates in many industrial countries. To meet these problems, the major industrial countries opted for free floating currencies and the developing countries opted for either pegging their currencies to some major currencies or fixing the exchange rate of their currencies vis-a- vis a basket of major currencies. In addition to exchange rate problems, the developing countries also suffered from chronic monetary disequilibrium, which is reflected in domestic inflation. As inflation has eroded the competitive edge of exports, the balance of payments deteriorated, and the fixed exchange rate was overvalued, generating such illegal practices as <b>underinvoicing</b> exports and overinvoicing imports. These phenomena support the monetarist proposition that a domestic monetary disequilibrium will have spillover effects on both the balance of payments and on the exchange rate...|$|E
40|$|Dominant {{economic}} {{theories of}} black market research do not sufficiently explain why East Indian merchants in Belize City are particularly active in Belize's foreign-exchange black market. This article develops a sociological theory depicting black markets as social structures and relates {{the structure of}} ethnic trading networks to the demand for "black money " {{by focusing on the}} crime of <b>underinvoicing.</b> I describe the East Indian network, then discuss the evolution of ethnic black markets more generally. Ask people on the street in Belize City where to sell black-market dollars and, chances are, they will send you to East Indian merchants. This raises an intriguing theoretical question. Why should one ethnic group be more inclined to participate in black-market crime than any other ethnic group? Is there something distinctly cultural explaining an ethnic group's criminal involvement? Does the answer lie in the shared values and norms of the ethnic group? Or can it be found in the group's unique social structure? Perhaps the social and economic ties of ethnic solidarity can give a clue to the inner workings of th...|$|E
40|$|Matching exporters'freight {{on board}} (fob) trade {{statistics}} with the corresponding importers'cost, inventory and freight (cif) data, this paper studies {{the quality of}} official information on trade between 36 African countries. The author found the disparities in data so great as to make the official trade statistics almost useless for most empirical and policy studies. He concluded that: (a) statistics on matching exports and imports vary {{so much that the}} data cannot be used to assess the level of trade between African countries; (b) the data are probably equally useless for assessing the direction of trade since the countries that exporters report as the destination of trade often fail to report corresponding imports; (c) the data are inadequate for determining the composition of trade because countries report on different levels of detail; and (d) large, persistent, apparent differences in trends in intra-African trade may simply reflect different degrees of accuracy in country trade data. Finally, the fact that reported fob exports often exceed the corresponding reported imports suggests either that smuggling is widespread or that importers are intentionally <b>underinvoicing</b> because of high African tariffs or quotas.

40|$|Tariff {{receipts}} {{represent a}} significant share of {{many developing countries}} public finance receipts, {{and they can be}} though of as more easily collected than many other taxes. Still, custom duties can be evaded through a number of ways, from bribery to smuggling and fallacious declarations. Such possible tax evasion is likely to depend both on the institutional framework, on the quality of law enforcement, but also on the level and distribution of tariffs. This raises questions about the effectiveness of custom duties collection, and about its change with tariff liberalisation. Should tariff revenue losses associated with tariff changes be computed "at face value", i. e. based on statutory protection, or may the relationship be more complex? Would specific reforms be likely to improve custom duty collection? The double declaration of trade flows, by both the importer and the exporter, offers an opportunity to gauge the importance of these unlawful practices: while evading custom duties requires the importer to sidestep due registration upon importing, the same does not apply to the exporter. Using the discrepancy between mirror declarations at the product level to reveal custom duties evasion was pioneered by Baghwati (1964, 1967), whose results hinted about <b>underinvoicing</b> of imports in Turkey, in particular for manufactured products.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} volume, nature, direction and determinants of capital flight and FDI in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region {{in relation to}} certain structural and institutional characteristics. The {{results show that the}} resource-based economies of region have experienced large amounts of capital flight in the form of unrecorded foreign exchange outflows and are among the least recipients of FDI relative to market size in comparison to other developing countries. In contrast, the resource-poor countries of the region have experienced large net unrecorded foreign exchange inflows, driven mostly by import <b>underinvoicing,</b> and receive less FDI than their potentiality suggests empirically and in comparison to other developing countries. However, they receive more FDI as a percentage of GDP than the resource-based countries of MENA. In addition, the determinants of each type of capital differ according to whether a MENA country is a resource-based or not. For example, higher level of development increases capital flight but reduces FDI in the resource-rich countries. In contrast, it increases unrecorded foreign exchange inflows but is insignificant to FDI in the resource-poor countries of the region. Interestingly, capital flight is shown to be an outcome of increasing control of domestic authorities in the resource-rich countries, while increasing control of domestic authorities in the resource-poor economies induces unrecorded inflows to foreign exchange. The welfare analysis for the resource-rich countries suggest that both capital flight and FDI reduce economic growth, while for the resource-poor countries neither variable has a significant effect on economic growth. Based on the empirical findings, the dissertation provides brief policy implications regarding capital flight, unrecorded foreign exchange inflows and FDI in the MENA region. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{show how}} the various methods {{commonly}} used to measure capital flight produce vastly different estimates (with a 100 percent difference between the lowest and the highest, in Mexico's case). They {{emphasize the importance of}} the conceptual approach to its measurement. First of all, they did not try to separate normal capital flows from capital flight. A capital shift outward because of expected taxation is as much a response to anticipated developments in rate of return as is a shift out in response to lower interest rates at home. Nor is it satisfactory to directly measure capital flight by taking short-term asset changes and the balance of errors and omissions from the balance of payments. Neither is necessarily related to the unreported private accumulation of foreign assets. They chose the residual approach, which assumes that capital inflows in the form of increases in external indebtedness and foreign direct investment should finance either the current account or reserve accumulation; any shortfall in reported use can be attributed to capital flight. Implementing the residual approach requires careful data selection and several adjustments. The authors contend that: introducing debt stock data into the analysis - instead of the changes in debt recorded directly in the balance of payments - requires many difficult adjustments and should be avoided; foreign asset changes of public corporations must be subtracted; rather than eliminate interest received on foreign assets from the current account, as some have done, earnings on private assets held abroad should be considered part of the flight capital that might have been repatriated, given different incentives and macroeconomic conditions; and the effect on capital flight of the faking of trade invoices should be assessed, since import overinvoicing and export <b>underinvoicing</b> can be used to channel capital abroad. They demonstrate the empirical importance of these choices with a new set of capital flight estimates for Mexico, based on the recommendations they present. They contrast the results of this approach with those of other approaches, to demonstrate the effect of conceptual choices.
