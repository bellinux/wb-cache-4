30|$|Actually, the {{application}} of interleaving and similar ideas have been proposed in order to resolve the <b>uneven</b> <b>page</b> BER problem and improve the reliability[11, 12]. However, the adoption of interleaving will slow down the program and read speed performance because the interleaver should wait to collect at least M pages data before program and read operation in the multipage architecture. Especially, random speed performance would be more degraded than sequential speed performance when employing an interleaver (see Section “Hybrid SSD and strategy for verify level control”).|$|E
30|$|Most MLC flash {{memories}} {{adopt the}} multipage architecture. The important {{property of the}} multipage architecture is that different bits of a single cell are assigned into different pages[10 – 15]. Therefore, BERs of each page can be different. As a page is the unit of data that is programmed and read at one time, the error control coding (ECC) should be applied within the same page. It means that each page is composed of one or several codewords. Therefore, ECC has to be designed for the worst page BER and this leads to wasted redundancy for the other (i.e., better) pages. This <b>uneven</b> <b>page</b> BER problem is an important and practical issue {{and there have been}} several attempts to deal with it[11 – 15].|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of noise and {{parameter}} deviations in a bichromatic Raman type white light cavity, with potential applications in precision measurements such as gravitational wave detection. The {{results show that the}} dispersion variation induced by parameter deviation can be controlled within $ 10 ^{- 4 }$. The laser phase noise decreases the dispersion magnitude while the amplitude noise increases it. Although we can always adjust the parameters to satisfy the white light condition, both noises make the cavity transmission curve <b>uneven.</b> Comment: 5 <b>pages,</b> 3 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewer Groff Conklin {{described}} the Shasta edition as [...] "a classic" [...] {{and the lead}} story as [...] "a smashing tale of revolution in the United States." [...] Boucher and McComas, however, {{described the}} collection as [...] "impressive in its time, and important {{in the development of}} modern science fiction," [...] but found it highly <b>uneven,</b> [...] "with <b>pages</b> worthy of the mature 1954 Heinlein ... followed immediately by passages from the author's literary apprenticeship." [...] P. Schuyler Miller found Revolt in 2100 to be [...] "a distinctly minor Heinlein contribution, ... way below the mark Heinlein has set himself in his recent teen-age books." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of national borders {{has been called}} into question by the corrosive consequence of accelerated globalisation. Many commentators have assumed that intensified worldwide inter-connections and time-space compression entail a decline in state capacities and an increased permeability of their borders. Trans-national flows of capital, commodities, information and people, so the argument runs, have undermined the ability of states to regulate activities within and across their borders. In short, a ‘deterritorialised’, ‘borderless’ world is invoked which, it is claimed, fundamentally transforms economic, political and cultural realities. This paper critically examines this thesis, rejects its strongest version {{and goes on to}} argue for the continued relevance of national borders - as demarcating dejure sovereignty, as regulators of movement, as markers of citizenship rights, and as instruments for the classification of populations and the reproduction of identities. It claims that borders have been reconfigured rather than uniformly eroded, that their permeability is highly differentiated, and that this permeability reflects and reinforces the power relations of <b>uneven</b> globalisation. 18 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R
