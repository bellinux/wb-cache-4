5|$|Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler's {{appointment}} to the order on 1 July 2008 not only {{marked the first time}} the Advisory Council had not been <b>unanimous</b> <b>in</b> its decision, but also proved {{to be one of the}} most controversial appointments in the order's history, drawing both praise from abortion rights groups and the ire of Members of Parliament, groups opposing abortion, and religious leaders. The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be <b>unanimous</b> <b>in</b> their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, {{the group}} had the problem of having spent more money on {{production}} than was covered by returns. The group decided that its gangsta rap style was the cause: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, {{making it difficult for}} Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Referring to local rapper Esham's horrorcore style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also <b>unanimous</b> <b>in</b> deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II, Heimdal {{had been}} {{proposed}} as a {{location for the}} primary airport for Trondheim. Construction had started with drainage and ground works, but this work was interrupted by the war. Because of the large investments made to Værnes by Luftwaffe, a commission was established in 1947 to look into if Værnes or Lade instead should be selected. The commission was <b>unanimous</b> <b>in</b> recommending Værnes, highlighting that the airport was of a sufficient size to handle all civilian and military needs in the foreseeable future, and emphasized the proximity to the railway and highway. However, the commission recommended that Heimdal and Lade be kept as possibilities for future expansion. When the issue was discussed in Parliament, several members of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications focused on the long distance to Trondheim, but the low investment needs (stipulated to NOK 1.3 million for necessary navigation and air control investments) convinced parliament, who passed legislation in favor of Værnes on 10 June 1952.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly <b>unanimous</b> <b>in</b> their support of James Monroe.|$|E
5|$|But the {{identification}} of the poem as Stoic is not <b>unanimous.</b> <b>In</b> 1887, against the common opinion of scholars at the time, Gustave Lanson contested the idea that the poem is Stoic. More recently, in 2005, Alexander MacGregor argued that while contemporary scholars, such as Goold and Volk, read Manilius as a Stoic, the Astronomica actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places. Namely, Manilius exalts Plato, Socrates, and Pythagoras; proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God, denies the ekpyrosis (that is, a belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every Great Year, followed by a cosmic recreation), never discusses the six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero, and ignores the importance of controlling the soul. Manilius also focuses on a number of decidedly Pythagorean tenets: the Pythagorean order of the planets, the importance of geometry and numbers, and the significance of tetraktys (that is, triangular figures made up of ten points arranged in four rows). Finally, in key places, the poet makes use of non-Stoics like Eudoxus of Cnidus and Cicero. Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an idealistic Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} the Claimant was her son, {{the rest of the}} Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost <b>unanimous</b> <b>in</b> declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E
