Du Pont ordered Commander Percival Drayton {{to assist}} the army in taking Otter Island. On a reconnaissance trip in St. Helena Sound, Drayton anchored between Otter Island and Edisto Island in St. Helena Sound. While there, he met {{with a number of}} slaves, who provided information on rebel actions. Over the coming weeks, Drayton would discover that rebels had attacked and burned slave houses, and the refugees moved Drayton to help establish a colony of over 100 former slaves on Otter Island in December 1861, which would be supervised by Lieutenant James W. Nicholson. The contrabands, as the former slaves were called, were active in their own support as well. For instance, on December 10, contrabands assisted Nicholson in obtaining provisions. While Nicholson was aggressive in defending the camp, Union officials were aware of the threat to the former slaves posed by nearby rebel forces. In mid-December, Drayton made a reconnaissance up the Edisto with the Pawnee, Vixen and Seneca and spied fortifications on Edisto Island. He fired upon the fort but received no reply. He then landed at the fort, which was deserted with the guns. Soon after, Drayton led a party to investigate reports of rebels burning cotton houses and outbuildings and encamped near Rockville. When they arrived at the camp, the Confederates had fled, and African Americans were there pillaging. When Drayton returned to his boat, the Pawnee, 150 African Americans had collected on that and the other boats. Drayton decided to send them to the point of Edisto Island, and they set up a camp in a belt of woods along the seacoast of North Edisto Island, where they were protected from Confederate attacks by a marsh. Drayton left Lieutenant Thomas A. Budd of the Penguin in charge. By December 29, 1861, Lieutenant Daniel Ammen of the Seneca reported that between 700 and 900 African Americans had gathered on Botany Bay Island on the Atlantic side of Edisto Island, although they still faced threats from Confederates who had been seen on North Edisto Island. Ammen and the Seneca had shelled a rebel headquarters and woods on White Point. Ammen wrote to Du Pont on January 21, 1862 that the colony then numbered 1,200 and if Union forces did not occupy Edisto Island, may be unable to defend itself from rebels when collecting food over the country. Ammen also suggested hiring contraband to collect <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> on the island for compensation, and reported that the colony's African-American superintendent wanted to land a force of contrabands at Rockville and drive off the Confederates, who had returned to the camp.|$|E

Porter seized three hundred bales of Confederate cotton from various warehouses in Alexandria and stamped it [...] "U.S.N. prize", referring to the United States Navy. Porter sent his sailors into the country to search for <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton.</b> After the crop was located, it was brought to Alexandria to be ginned and baled. The sailors also seized molasses and wool. Winters writes that Porter [...] "took all cotton wherever he found it, cotton belonging to the Confederate government, cotton belonging to the 'rebels,' and cotton belonging to 'loyal' citizens." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} the {{application}} of various amounts of nitrogen fertilizers and Pix 35 % growth regulator on the morphological features of the Sahel cultivar of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and on the <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> yield of this cultivar, an experiment was carried out in the factorial design in the randomized complete block format with three replications at the Bayekola Agronomical Research Station in 2009. The factors studied included the amounts of nitrogen fertilizers and of the cotton growth regulator Pix 35 % used in the experiment. Results obtained showed that the minimum plant height was obtained in the control treatment (72. 93 cm), and that plant height increased with nitrogen application and reached its maximum (77. 59 cm) when 225 Kg. h of nitrogen was used. The analysis of the variance of the data indicated that the effects of applying various levels of Pix were very significantly different, so that the greatest plant height was observed in the Pix control treatment (90. 94 cm), and it significantly decreased by Pix application and reached 65 cm when 300 g. h of Pix was applied (which was an almost 40 % reduction). Furthermore, when nitrogen fertilizers were applied, the <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> yield significantly went up, and this increase in yield continued up to the level of using 150 Kg. h nitrogen; however, when the level of nitrogen application reached 225 Kg. h, the yield started to go down. As a whole, the lowest yield was obtained when nitrogen was not applied (which was the control with a yield of 1469 Kg of <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> per hectare), and the maximum yield (2825 Kg. h of <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> per hectare) was achieved when 150 Kg of nitrogen per hectare was used _ i. e., the <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> yield went up by 14 % when 150 Kg of nitrogen per hectare was applied. In our study, it was observed that Pix did not have much influence on increasing yield: the minimum yield (2529 Kg of <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> per hectare) was observed in the treatment of applying 100 g. h of Pix, and the maximum yield (2669 Kg of <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> per hectare) by using 200 gh of Pix. Comparison of the interaction effects of the level of Pix and nitrogen application indicated that, among all the treatments, the maximum yield of <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> (3010 K. h) was achieved when 150 Kg. h of nitrogen and 200 g. h Pix were applied. These results also showed that in the treatments of using 150 Kg nitrogen per hectare, and applying 150 Kg. nitrogen plus 300 g Pix per hectare also, high yield potentials (close to 3 tons per hectare) were created. The minimum yield of <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> (2230 Kg. h) belonged to the treatment of using 200 grams of Pix per hectare...|$|E
40|$|In {{the regions}} {{vulnerable}} to surface and subsurface waterlogging, {{the stage of}} cotton bud and boll stage set is just in rainy season. Cotton often meets comprehensive stress from surface and subsurface waterlogging. waterlogging during this stage inhibits cotton development and reduces final yield significantly. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the effects of fertilization after waterlogging elimination on the SPAD value, chlorophyll fluorescence parameter and yield under a short-term waterlogging. Test-pit experiments were conducted with two waterlogging level, namely 4 and 9 days and 4 days waterlogging treatment set 3 level of fertilization, 9 days waterloging treatment set 4 level of fertilization. The results showed that: 1) The SPAD value decreased significantly under the waterlogging and decreased to the lowest value 7 days later. Then, the SPAD value increased significantly after fertilization regulation, the treatment of 4 day waterlogging required more than 20 % fertilizer and the treatment of 9 days waterlogging required more than 30 % fertilizer. 2) The minimum fluorescence (Fo) was increased under the waterlogging, while potential photochemical efficiency of PS||(Fv/Fo) and the maximum photochemical efficiency of open photosystem(Fv/Fm) was reduced under the waterlogging, the increased degree of Fo and the reduced degree of Fv/Fo and Fv/Fm were enhanced with the increase of waterlogging degree. 3) The hot summer bolls, autumn bolls and the <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> yield decreased significantly under the waterlogging, fertilizer after the waterlogging elimination could raise the <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> yield, there was a significant correlation between the Relative yield (Ry) and the duration of surface waterlogging (Tw), the duration of subsurface waterlogging ((Tg) and proportion of Fertilizer ((Fb), which could represent by the linear relationship...|$|E
40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a {{production}} aid per tonne of <b>unginned</b> <b>cotton</b> within national guaranteed quantities. Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a guaranteed minimum price of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to final agricultural output in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, Sterea Ellada and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of ginned cotton and is a major net exporter of ginned cotton. The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of ginned cotton per annum. Comment: The guaranteed minimum price system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of ginned cotton). This demonstrates the extent to which production and trade in cotton in the EU is insulated from developments on world markets. The EU support regime is centred on a production aid per tonne of [...] ...|$|E
