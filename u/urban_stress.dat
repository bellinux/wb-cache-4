25|$|Tsuga canadensis {{has long}} been a popular tree in cultivation. The tree's {{preference}} for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow. In addition, its very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth habit and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable ornamental tree. In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil. It is most often used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can also be trained as a dense formal hedge. It should not be used on roadsides where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to salt spray. It is also poorly adapted as a windbreak tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in winter. It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of <b>urban</b> <b>stress,</b> intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable. Its tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as a Christmas tree.|$|E

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} the <b>urban</b> environmental <b>stress</b> on the subjective well-being of the people in Bhopal city of India. The objectives were to assess the perceived urban environmental stressors and to explore the coping strategies adopted by the people to combat the outcomes of <b>Urban</b> Environmental <b>Stress.</b> Perceived <b>Urban</b> Environmental stressors’ Scale (UES) and Urban Hassle Index were administered. The findings indicated that though people described their city as pleasant, a high level of stress was still perceived and its major reasons were found to be noise, waste accumulation, polluted air with smoke, and unhealthy environment in slums. The outcome of research suggests that the city planners should give equal priority to the natural resources and environment by various pollution management interventions and proper city planning. It is crucial for the well-being of the human beings to lower down the effect of stressors, so that the life in the city can be livable and of good quality.

The results of the analysis are preliminary pending fuller analysis of needs positions, but they do demonstrate that local party control has very little relation to grant allocations. This is mostly because of the interrelation with levels of <b>urban</b> <b>stress,</b> which is found to be a very significant correlate with levels of grant received.

Since it is unlikely that these effects can be fully prevented, it is essential that adaptive strategies be identified early so they can be implemented by urban forest managers before these impacts are felt. Managing for tree health will become increasingly important, and selection for tree species and varieties that are drought, heat and insect resistant will become a necessity.

50|$|According to {{proponents of}} {{intelligent}} urbanism, {{there will be}} a variety of problems faced by urbanites and they need a variety of opportunity channels for resolution. If there are ten problem areas where people are facing stresses, like economic engagement, health, shelter, food, education, recreation, transport, etc., there must be a variety of opportunities through which individuals and households can resolve each of these stresses. There must be ten channels to resolve each of ten stresses! If this opportunity matrix is understood and responded to, the city is truly functioning as an opportunity matrix. For example, opportunities for shelter could be through the channels of lodges, rented rooms, studio apartments, bedroom apartments and houses. It could be through the channels of ownership, through a variety of tendencies. It could be through opportunities for self-help, or incremental housing. It could be through the up-gradation of slums. Intelligent urbanism promotes a wide range of solutions, where any stress is felt. It therefore promotes a range of problem statements, options, and variable solutions to <b>urban</b> <b>stresses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Adaptation {{to climate}} change is {{gradually}} becoming accepted {{as one of the}} major challenges in regional and urban planning. However, the scope for options that make our societies less vulnerable to flood risks, disruptive quantities of rainwater in cities, or <b>urban</b> heat <b>stress</b> tends to be narrowed down, often implicitly, by the existing institutional context. Institutions reflect past choices made regarding the legitimate distribution of burdens and benefits between government and society of measures against weather-related calamities. Alternative options, like innovative dyke concepts, green roofs, or urban planning to reduce heat stress, would require political debate on the legitimacy of different arrangements and would take climate adaptation policy out of the technocratic ‘comfort zone’. This article offers a framework of analysis for describing the institutionalized distribution of responsibilities for initiation, implementation, costs and liability for climate adaptation measures, and the shift in these that alternative options would entail.

40|$|Abstract Wildlife-human {{interactions}} are increasing in prevalence as urban sprawl continues to encroach into rural areas. Once {{considered to be}} unsuitable habitat for most wildlife species, urban/suburban areas now host an array of wildlife populations, {{many of which were}} previously restricted to rural or pristine habitats. The presence of some wildlife species in close proximity to dense human populations can create conflict, forcing resource managers to address issues relating to urban wildlife. However, evidence suggests that wildlife residing in urban areas may not exhibit the same life history traits as their rural counterparts because of adaptation to human-induced stresses. This creates difficulty for biologists or managers that must address problems associated with urban wildlife. Population control or mitigation efforts aimed at urban wildlife require detailed knowledge of the habits of wildlife populations in urban areas. This paper describes the history of wildlife in urban areas, provides examples of wildlife populations that have modified their behavior as an adaptation to <b>urban</b> <b>stresses,</b> and discusses the challenges that resource managers face when dealing with urban wildlife...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the study of impact of stress to {{the two types of}} broadleaved trees in urban {{environment}} during the growing season. The studied species were Small-leaved Lime (Tilia cordata) and London Planetree (Platanus acerifolia). Trees are the important part of the urban environment both from an aesthetic standpoint and {{from the standpoint of the}} reduction of negative effects of the urban environment. However, these trees are under the constant influence of stress factors with which they have to deal (air pollution, water, temperature). Some trees deal with stress better but some worse. Because of this fact, two different types of trees were selected, which are able to deal with stress by their own way. As indicators of physiological state of plants under stress, the content of photosynthetic pigments and photochemical efficiency of PS II (QY and QY') were monitored at individual trees. The measurements were carried out always two days consecutively from May to September 2013 in Jiráskovo nábřeží in České Budějovice. Every month, the spectrophotometric measurement to determine the pigments in a leaf was carried out. For the spectrophotometric measurements, twenty-four leaves were measured in total; for the fluorescent measurement, thirty leaves were measured in total. The obtained values of both methods were processed and evaluated by graphs, which together with the average values show the statistic demonstrability of difference between the measured trees in city. According to these measured values, Small-leaved Lime seemed to be more vital at a given location, although London Planetree is marked in the literature as more resistant one towards the <b>urban</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|E

We hypothesized that disadvantaged urban populations experience acute and chronic housing stressors which produce psychological stress and impact health through biological and behavioral pathways. We examined eight outcomes: six child respiratory outcomes as well as parent and child general health, using data from 682 low-income, Chicago parents of diagnosed and undiagnosed asthmatic children. We created a continuous exposure, representing material, social and emotional dimensions of housing stressors, weighted by their parent-reported difficulty. We compared the 75 th to the 25 th quartile of exposure in adjusted binomial and negative binomial regression models. Higher risks and rates of poor health were associated with higher housing stressors for six of eight outcomes. The risk difference (RD) for poor/fair general health was larger for children [RD[*]=[*] 6. 28 (95 % CI 1. 22, 11. 35) ] than for parents [RD[*]=[*] 3. 88 (95 % CI − 1. 87, 9. 63) ].

40|$|Human {{settlement}} and travel patterns are closely interrelated. Given that both have major implications for natural resources (land, soil, energy) and substantial environmental impacts (emissions, noise, threat of accidents, barriers in urban environments), they are factors of major {{significance for the}} sustainability of towns and regions. The continuing expansion of human settlements is attributable not only to growing space demands arising from almost all forms of urban land use. The use of private motor vehicles in particular consumes immense areas of land and fuels urban sprawl. Increasingly disperse settlement patterns, or the suburbanization of the environs of cities, further expand travel demand and dependence on private cars. The result is a self-perpetuating, spiralling growth of settlements and traffic volumes. In the new Laender, this process is concentrated in an unusually short time frame, with all the attendant repercussions such as loss of open landscapes, higher energy consumption and continuing emissions. It is clear, if only for the reasons stated above, that the problem cannot be solved merely by improving traffic management and by switching to greener modes of transport alone, but that the traffic volume needs to be reduced by appropriate regional planning. The universally accepted formula for a traffic policy which is environmentally sound and relieves <b>urban</b> <b>stress</b> is therefore: avoid traffic, shift traffic flows, reduce the impacts of traffic on the environment. The choice of sequence is deliberate and intended to express an order of priorities. However, traffic avoidance in practice {{is still in its}} infancy. (orig.)

40|$|Rapid {{worldwide}} urbanization {{is creating}} novel environments to which animals must adapt, {{a topic of}} growing interest for biologists. Studies of how organisms are affected by cities historically centered on large-scale censusing of populations, but recent investigations have considered finer-scaled, urban-rural differences among individuals and species in their behavior, morphology, and physiology, specifically {{as they relate to}} <b>urban</b> <b>stress.</b> A number of factors (e. g., corticosterone (CORT) -related stress response) may contribute to the degree of stress experienced by animals living under urban versus natural conditions, but several physiological variables have yet to be considered together in a large-scale assessment. Here, in a widespread species of desert passerine (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus), we quantified variation in plasma oxidative stress, plasma concentrations of vitamins and carotenoids, and body-mass of males in three successive seasons (winter, spring, and late summer/early fall) along an urban-rural gradient in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. We found that degree of urbanization was: (1) negatively related to circulating vitamin A concentrations in winter, (2) positively correlated with body-mass during spring, and (3) negatively associated with plasma concentrations of two carotenoids: zeaxanthin (during breeding) and 3 -hydroxy-echinenone (3 HE) (during molting). The striking link between 3 HE levels and urbanization is consistent with previous research showing that urban songbirds have lower carotenoid levels and faded plumage; our finding is the first to implicate specific effects on a metabolically derived carotenoid for coloration. The fact that we observed only season-specific links between urbanization and indicators of quality in finches suggests that (at least for these metrics) there are no strong, lasting urban pressures imposed on finch physiology over the year. Interestingly, we found that a metric of plasma oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) was positively correlated with levels of two carotenoids (lutein during breeding and 3 HE during molting), which is consistent with a prior study of ours showing that finches with redder plumage deposit higher levels of CORT in their feathers; taken together, our studies suggest complex associations between carotenoids and stres...|$|E

Epidemiological surveys made in road tunnel employees and in traffic officers have not demonstrated specific effects and have often been complicated by cigarette smoking as a factor. Long-term animal experiments run mostly on small rodents give evidence of little effect of the pathological actions of dilutions such as those encountered in high polluted cities. However the acute toxicity of gasoline exhaust emission is well known and mostly due to carbon monoxide. Considering {{the different types of}} cycles and operating conditions of vehicles (gasoline and diesel), auto exhaust gases constitute no more a chemical entity than they show, a definite toxicity. A great number of substances that they contain (nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, antiknock additives, heavy metals, possible catalysts are highly toxic as shown by in vivo and in vitro (mutagenic) tests. Interactions of the components are for the moment ignored or poorly understood. Besides, the evolution of the physicochemical properties and natures of the auto exhaust emission in the gaseous biotope of man under determined conditions of ultraviolet irradiation, temperature, and hygrometry provoke the formation of secondary products such as oxidants and ozone. Several experiments show clearly that irradiation increases the toxicity of auto exhaust significantly.

This {{raises the question of}} how to prevent, mitigate or reduce the effects of <b>urban</b> <b>stress</b> on individuals living in cities as the population continues to rise. This question was approached within the context the Credit River Watershed. 107 household surveys were administered in two contrasting urban neighbourhoods to discern the habits of respondents with regards to attending different types of natural spaces, and how relaxing those spaces are. These responses showed that overall, respondents found blue space, i. e. being near water features like rivers, ponds, and lakes, to be the most relaxing of all types of space, followed by looking out of windows at natural spaces, and private green space. Factor analysis was conducted on the responses of how relaxing different natural spaces are. This revealed four different factors within the data, which have been named "Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being," "Wilderness and Personal Spaces," "Designed Spaces," and "Relaxing Activities. " These factors, excluding the "Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being" factor, were used in designing an Environmental Index of Mental Well-being (EIMWB), which could be used as a way of monitoring the impact of environmental management on mental well-being over time. The information from EIMWB monitoring and other data about the effects of natural spaces on mental well-being could be used together within the context of mental health promotion. Due to the more subjective nature of data connecting mental health with the environment, mental health promotion has not been embraced fully by public health agencies, where most health promotion strategies arepositioned. Assuming that the requirement for hard scientific data will not be changed, alternativevenues within which to place mental health promotion should be considered. This paper thus concludes that environmental management and design within urban areas can provide a setting for environmentally-based mental health promotion...|$|E

When Istanbul metropolitan city has been investigated in this concept, some requirements that need functional and spatial connectivity, environmental protection and recreational opportunities for citizens appear in the environmentally insufficient areas. The landscape planning that will respond these negativenesses, present some solutions, provide some opportunities and prevent disappearance of the urban open spaces constitutes the conceptual framework of this study. In the last two decades, the modern landscape planning concept that called "greenway planning" in 21. century, the planners concern this concept with the aims of the nature protection that balances for both conservation and growth, creating livable environment and maintain open spaces. By enriching the existing green spaces and increasing their uses, helping to emphasize the values of the poor resources and linking them with each other. The firstly aim of the study is to define the greenway concept that is useful for urban metropolis. Greenway that is a special kind of linear landscape, represent the potential linking landscape features as historical/cultural, natural and recreational. Greenways has become a tool to reach the natural life by providing linkage to housing and parks, by saving unique elements of the natural and cultural heritage that is important for public recreation in this century.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 261 - 275. This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} story in the Christian proclamation. It focusses upon the dynamic of story which unites praxis and language in a single message. There are four stages of argument. The First Part examines the hermeneutic problem especially as discussed {{in the work of}} Gadamer, Palmer, Robinson, Funk and others writers on the so-called New Hermeneutic. Their views are set against the perspective of liberation and contextual theologies from Cone, Segundo, and Miguez Bonino amongst others. The impact of social praxis and context on communication and interpretation is examined. Its importance as a barrier to the translation of the whole dynamic of the gospel proclamation is stressed. Part Two examines Jesus parables and acted parables. The data comes from two sources: the dominant form-critical approach to parables as exemplified by Jeremias or Crossan, in which the situation behind the text is examined. Second is the recent sociological approach to the practice of Jesus taken by such scholars as Theissen or Echegaray. The approach to this data comes from an analysis of the "history of the transmission of the tradition", a concept developed by Pannenberg from the work of Rentdorf and Von Rad. It provides a series of categories through which the data is examined. The dynamic of story is shown in the unity of actions. Function and structure in the parabolic stories and The Third Part surveys the role of story as a category in contemporary theology. First, the approach of narrative theology is cosidered as in the work of Stroup, McClendon, McFague and others. Then the role of story in Third World theological reflection on liberation struggles is described. Examples are drawn mainly from Asia (China, Korea and the Philippines). The Latin American debate about such cultural forms is briefly reviewed. Lastly the role of story in some British contextual theology is discussed. The dynamic of story is discovered in the function and impact of stories in theological reflection in the struggle against oppressive situations. Part Four briefly notes the perspective of critical theorists, like Habermas, on hermeneutics. Finally an attempt is made to tell stories of theological reflection on domination as a practical exercise illustrating the theoretical themes of the study. The impetus for the study arises from two periods of practical experience. One of some ten years duration, was work in British inner city ministry and theological training, in a context where community groups were struggling against many manifestations of <b>urban</b> <b>stress.</b> The second period, of about half a year, was an exposure to the conditions of life in rural (communal lands) and urban (high density residential area) Zimbabwe, as a visitor to the Methodist Church. In both instances stories were a vital means of communication about the most important things...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{features}} of today's societies is that they are formed as heterogenic structures, not homogeneous. Societies are areas in which certain features that consist of social categories that have generally different ethnic and cult features are loaded. This feature of societies, as a wealth in cultural meaning, is enhancing the culture of tolerance and cohabitation, on the other hand, it may also include potential conflict and cultural tension as well. As a result, in our big cities where different social categories in ethnic and sectarian meaning are placed in, those <b>urban</b> <b>stresses</b> are witnessed from time to time. The cohabitation culture is an extension and result of the democratic culture. In our developing country, it is a well-known sociological reality that the democracy and the culture of democracy have not fully placed in yet. In this context, the reality of being unable to develop the cohabitation culture, acceptance of the entity of socially "other" and the culture of bearing the entity of socially "other" in the practice of daily life sufficiently and the conversion of this situation to conflicts and tensions from time to time remains its freshness in the memories. The relations between Alevism and Sunnite and the conflicts should be evaluated from this perspective. The relations between Alevism and Sunnite have followed a rolling course in the historical process. Although the behest of cohabitation has been transferred in general life practice, the unwanted events which were experienced in Sivas, Maraş and Çorum are the historical indicatives of this process that carries potential conflict of this practice...|$|R
40|$|Among Fugard's post-apartheid plays one escapes {{the sentimental}} nostalgia {{of his recent}} turn inwards - The Train Driver (2010). In it he {{develops}} a challenging sense of the country's dealings with the past {{by focusing on the}} remembering of a 'track suicide' by the white driver, whose tragic story is told by a black gravedigger. The driver's morbidly excessive reaction, the result of identifying with the victim whose grave he seeks, is balanced in performance by the sympathy and acceptance of the gravedigger. The squatter camp cemetery setting provides a liminal <b>urban</b> space <b>stressing</b> the continuity of past wrongs while the selective remembering of the nation's elite masks everyday poverty and violence...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The fiscal {{plight of}} many inner city local {{authorities}} in England {{raises questions about}} similarities in <b>urban</b> fiscal <b>stress</b> processes in England and the United States. This paper focuses on one explanation for urban fiscal strain, the reduced viability of property taxes for local revenue gathering, which has been reported as significant in the United States. Given central government grant reductions a d party political differences over expenditure priorities, {{it is argued that}} Labour controlled councils are (and should be) most prone to fiscal trauma. The results do not find that Labour control is linked to a poorer property tax environment. Labour's fiscal problems are linked to ideological issues, not to local economic conditions...|$|R
