30|$|Our {{findings}} also confirmed that <b>U.S.</b> Americans and <b>Syrians</b> have different communication assumptions and norms at play when they communicate. For example, during intercultural communication situations, inferences about a speakers’ intent {{are affected by}} the participants’ culturally specific use of contextualization cues and background knowledge (Kagawa-Singer and Kassim-Lakha 2003). Like collectivists, Syrians are likely to expect to share contexts (experiences) with people before considering them as their friends or before solidifying agreements. Therefore, such knowledge needs to be applied during communications between those from the United States and Syria. Accordingly, it would be worthwhile to consider actively engaging in activities and sharing social time together during interactions between <b>U.S.</b> Americans and <b>Syrians</b> before diving into the goal at hand.|$|R

[...] Summing up his assessment of Luxenberg's method, he states: The first fundamental premise of his approach, that the Qur'ān is a Syriac text, is the easiest to refute on linguistic evidence. Nothing in the Qur'ān is Syriac, even the Syriac borrowed terms are Arabic, in so far as they now Arabized and used inside an Arabic linguistic medium. Luxenberg is pushing the etymological fallacy to its natural conclusion. The Qur'ān not only is borrowing words according to Luxenberg, it is speaking a gibberish language.

40|$|Background: Psychosocial {{factors such}} as stress, depression, {{feelings}} of hopelessness, and hostility {{are known to be}} associated with physical health. Similar associations have been believed to be true for stress and periodontal diseases as well. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the relationships between perceived stress and periodontal disease in samples of <b>US</b> and <b>Syrian</b> adults and to assess whether coping behaviors modify this relationship. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 321 patients between 35 - 75 years of age in the dental clinics at the University of Michigan-School of Dentistry in Ann Arbor, MI., USA, and 311 patients (between 30 - 70 years of age) in the dental clinics at the University of Damascus, Syria. The subjects completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Brief Cope Scale. Periodontitis was assessed using clinical attachment level (CAL). Total PSS and Brief Cope were included in a logistic model to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis. Age, gender, smoking, and diabetes were used in regression models to control for confounding effects. Results: The reliability coefficients and internal consistencies for all the subscales of the Brief Cope were moderate, with Cronbach s alpha ranging from 0. 67 to 0. 89 for the US sample and from 0. 50 to 0. 94 for the Syrian sample. Cronbach s alpha for the PSS was 0. 86 and 0. 76 for the <b>US</b> and <b>Syrian</b> samples respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that perceived stress was significantly associated with greater attachment levels for the <b>Syrian</b> and <b>US</b> samples (odds ratio, OR = 1. 05; 95 % CI = 1. 01 to 1. 09; OR = 1. 06; 95 % CI = 1. 01 to 1. 11, respectively) after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, and cigarette smoking. Using stress as a categorical variable, only those respondents who used cognitive coping style were found to have greater odds of periodontitis when exposed to stress (OR = 5. 34; p < 0. 05, and OR = 10. 84; p < 0. 01 for the <b>Syrian</b> and <b>US</b> samples respectively). Conclusions: These findings lead to the conclusion that perceived stress is moderately associated with periodontitis in both the <b>Syrian</b> and the <b>US</b> samples and that cognitive coping style moderate the relationship between stress and periodontitis...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} popular music and state-controlled radio broadcasting in the Arabic-speaking world, focusing on Syria and the Syrian radioscape, {{and a set of}} American stations named Radio Sawa. I examine American and Syrian politically directed broadcasts as multi-faceted objects around which broadcasters and listeners often differ not only in goals, operating assumptions, and political beliefs, but also in how they fundamentally conceptualize the practice of listening to the radio. Beginning with the history of international broadcasting in the Middle East, I analyze the institutional theories under which music is employed as a tool of American and Syrian policy, the imagined youths to whom the musical messages are addressed, and the actual sonic content tasked with political persuasion. At the reception side of the broadcaster-listener interaction, this dissertation addresses the auditory practices, histories of radio, and theories of music through which listeners in the sonic environment of Damascus, Syria create locally relevant meaning out of music and radio. Drawing on theories of listening and communication developed in historical musicology and ethnomusicology, science and technology studies, and recent transnational ethnographic and media studies, as well as on theories of listening developed in the Arabic public discourse about popular music, my dissertation outlines the intersection of the hypothetical listeners defined by the <b>US</b> and <b>Syrian</b> governments in their efforts to use music for political ends, and the actual people who turn on the radio to hear the music...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} analyze the Syrian diaspora's {{political}} mobilization emerging in the United States and the United Kingdom after {{the inception of the}} 2011 uprising. Despite extensive mobilization, the diaspora has been unable to exert influence on host state policies. Providing an original look at diaspora politics, this thesis employs social movement impact theory in an effort to answer an often- neglected question in diaspora and social movement research: why movements fail. The thesis attempts to cover this research gap by answering the following research question: Why has the Syrian diaspora failed to influence host state policies in the United States and the United Kingdom? The thesis makes three separate sets of theoretical propositions based on the works of other social movement scholars. One emphasizes internal factors, such as mobilization structures, while the remaining two emphasize external factors, such as national political context and discursive opportunities respectively. To evaluate these propositions, the thesis engages in the strategy of paired comparison and utilizes primary data gathered through fieldwork conducted in both case countries and secondary source material. The findings suggest that there is no magic bullet" when it comes to explaining failure to impact host state policies. Both internal and external factors offer convincing narratives of the diaspora's lack of impact. In terms of internal factors, both cases reflect two different trajectories. In the <b>US,</b> the <b>Syrian</b> diaspora's uncoordinated and fractionalized mobilization limited its influence. In the UK, the diaspora was better coordinated, but lacked a strong lobby needed to achieve influence. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that external factors, such as shifting policy alignment, divided elites, insufficiently influential allies, unfavorable public opinion, and lack of discursive opportunities, had constraining effects on the diaspora's ability to influence policies. The thesis demonstrates the need to consider both internal and external factors when studying movement outcomes. It shows the utility of studying how movements fail and how social movement theory can be incorporated into diaspora politics...|$|R
