It is proposed that an integrated multi-modal transport strategy is developed, that prioritises the development of the railway system for freight cargo and public transport. As freight vehicles cause more than 99 % of roads damage, it is proposed that toll tariffs are only applied to freight vehicles, to lessen the negative social impact of tolling. It is proposed that an independent transport regulator and a consumer council are established, to protect consumer interests, to ensure the independent review of toll tariffs, and to review future public-funded transport investments...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{water scarcity}} and pollution {{problems that are}} affecting {{large areas of the}} globe are provoking a heated debate both among scholars and in the public opinion on two main issues: first, on the very nature of water as a common resource and the related management problems that this generates and, second, on the most appropriate market instrument to apply the polluters' (<b>user's)</b> <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> and thus price water pollution (consumption). This chapter analyzes these two intertwined issues and critically examines the experiences of various countries that have applied a specific kind of market-based instrument, tradable water permits programmes. For this purpose, the author first investigates the recent debate on water as a common resource and its practical implications in terms of water pricing, emphasizing the rationale and limitations underlying the use of market instruments for water. The chapter then focuses on tradable permits as this might become the main market instrument for water management and conservation to be adopted in many countries in the years to come. In this regard, the work critically evaluates the most significant applications of water tradable permit systems all over the world, focusing attention on the crucial role that the government can play for their successful implementation, in order to provide a few suggestions which can be drawn from these programs for their application in other countries in the future...|$|R
40|$|In {{international}} water policy, a trend can {{be observed}} towards more attention for economic approaches in water management. In 1992, at the International Conference on Water and the Environment (ICWE) in Dublin, the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Water Courses and International Lakes was adopted. Guiding Principle 4 of this convention states that ‘water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognised as an economic good’. The argumentation for this principle states that ‘…past failure to recognise the economic value of water has led to wasteful and environmentally damaging uses of the resource. Managing water as an economic good is an important way of achieving efficient and equitable use, and of encouraging conservation and protection of water resources’. In 1993, the World Bank wrote a policy paper in which it advocated a demand management approach to water management, {{including the use of}} economic policy instruments. In 2000, the European water framework directive (WFD) was issued, strongly emphasising sound economic management of water in its Member States. Policy principles, instruments and methods included in the WFD to achieve this are (amongst others) the full cost recovery principle (including environmental and resource costs), the polluter and <b>user</b> <b>pays</b> <b>principles,</b> and economic analyses of human activities with an impact on water systems at the level of river basins and sub-basins. Theoretical benefits of economic approaches 1 towards water management include efficiency in public management, an efficient allocation and use of natural resources, and the possibility of (further) deregulation of water management (leaving a larger part of water management to the market), with an associated flexibility for economic actors in the realisation of public goals...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} {{posed by}} an ageing population are major preoccupations of governments throughout the developed world. There are many dimensions to such challenges, and this paper focuses on {{issues relating to}} long-term care in old age. The debate around such matters has been similar in the UK and in Australia. In both countries, a history of incrementalism and poorly presented policy reform has contributed to widespread public mistrust, {{and a sense of}} injustice at the extension of means-testing or <b>user</b> <b>pays</b> <b>principles.</b> This paper examines the analysis and conclusions of a Royal Commission in the UK, set up to explore options for the finance and structure of long-term care. A fundamental principle advanced by the Commission is that the risk of needing long-term care should be shared by all citizens, rather than borne by those who have the misfortune to need such care. A separation of the personal care costs of long-term care from the living and housing costs components has been proposed as the most equitable way of sharing costs between individuals and the state. Major reforms to the structure community care in the early 1990 s in the UK (and similar developments in Australia) were concerned largely with improving management and accountability of local services and with promoting community rather than residential-based models of care. These failed to address the larger underlying question about the balance of responsibilities between individuals and the state and how to achieve a sustainable model for funding long-term care. The proposals by the Royal Commission in the UK can be seen to offer one such model. It is not without flaws and a cautious initial political response is evident. Nonetheless, the model has an immediate appeal in the simplicity of its argument, and in the prospect of offering improved individual security and enhanced social cohesion. ...|$|R

In searching for a topic I have three issues that dominate my life. One, I am a chartered accountant, two a regional councillor and three a rural ratepayer. All of this points me to the view that <b>user</b> <b>pays</b> then should have the say. Bay of Plenty is an extremely prosperous region, very low per capita regional rate take, but is very dependent on how the district council collect their rates generally on a land value system. The Bay of Plenty region had to review its representation 2003 as prior councils through extensive consulting had determined there should be separate seats for Maori. The Maori census population in the Bay of Plenty is some 25 %, New Zealand 14 % and within district councils in the Bay run from 16 % in Tauranga to 56 % in Kawerau, in all cases above the rational average. Councils throughout New Zealand are also now bulk funded for remuneration and after substantial consultation by the authority with councils formulas were developed to rank councils up with formulas to rate councils and their pay rates. The new Local Government Act 2002 started to talk about commumtIes of interest, community outcomes and clearly with the Ratings Act <b>user</b> <b>pays</b> <b>principles.</b> Clearly I believed t ~ scenc~as set for a constructive analysis and subsequent result for Bay of Plenty representation. The author being an astute politician forgot about politics, forgot that logic and councils current policies would win the day, ended up in the trenches fighting for rural representation {{based on the number of}} Maori seats. Councillors didn't want to go to 14 councillors, their pay would drop from about $ 42, 000 to $ 36, 000. Most Western Bay! Tauranga councillors got elected on the basis Maori should not have separate seats while the law says two, they sure weren't going to get three. All submissions said 3 Maori, 14 total, however Western Bay! Tauranga councillors didn't want 3 Maori or 14 councillors because that would have created a more difficult decision regarding who either Rotorua or Eastern Bay should drop one. Even though Tauranga didn't pay the rates there was no way six councillors would go to five. It has become very clear to the author that to get fair rural representation not only is it councillors we need but the rural community standing up lobbying, having their say, doing their bit but clearly watching out for the majority putting the cost onto the minority. Is representation fair in the Bay of Plenty? Maori say no, District Councils say no the urban dominated Bay of Plenty Council says yes. At this stage fairness does not come into it...|$|R

This third big picture communal focus reveals two things. First, abortion on demand actually was the biggest factor in reducing crimes and associated deaths in the US in the 1990 s. Second, abortion on demand could have curbed the population growth that keeps the third world subject to poverty and early death.

40|$|European {{urban areas}} are marred by the {{problems}} of congestion and environmental degradation due to the prevailing levels of car use. Strong arguments have thus been put forward {{in support of a}} policy based on marginal cost pricing (European Commission 1996). Such policy measures – which would force private consumers to pay for a public service that was previously provided «for free» – are, however, notoriously unpopular with the general public and hence also with their elected representatives – the politicians. There is thus an obvious tension between economic theory, which suggests that marginal cost pricing is the welfare maximising solution to urban transport problems, and practical experience, which suggests that such pricing measures are unwanted by the affected population and hence hard to implement through democratic processes. The AFFORD Project for the European Commission has aimed to investigate this paradox and its possible solutions, through a combination of economic analysis, predictive modelling, attitudinal surveys, and an assessment of fiscal and financial measures within a number of case study cities in Europe. In this paper the methodology and results obtained for the Edinburgh case study are reported in detail. The study analyses alternative road pricing instruments and compares their performance against the theoretical first best situation. It discusses the effect of coverage, location, charging mechanism and interaction with other instruments. The paper shows that limited coverage in one mode may lead to a deviation from the <b>user</b> <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> in other modes, that location is as important as charge levels and that assumptions about the use of revenues are critical in determining the effect on equity and acceptability. Finally the results show that a relatively simple smart card system can come close to providing the economic first best solution, but that this result should be viewed {{in the context of the}} model assumptions...|$|E
