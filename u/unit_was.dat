50|$|But not all {{quantities}} {{require a}} unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of <b>units</b> <b>is</b> required. These <b>units</b> <b>are</b> taken as the base <b>units.</b> Other <b>units</b> <b>are</b> derived <b>units.</b> Derived <b>units</b> <b>are</b> a matter of convenience, {{as they can be}} expressed in terms of basic <b>units.</b> Which <b>units</b> <b>are</b> considered base <b>units</b> <b>is</b> a matter of choice.|$|R
5|$|In August 1941 an {{artillery}} <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> formed to attack Italian forts more effectively. Initially it used a QF 4.5-inch howitzer {{carried on a}} 10-ton Mack NR 4 truck, with an accompanying light tank as an armoured observation post. However, these were {{handed over to the}} Free French at Kufra. The <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> then issued a 25 pounder portee. The LRDG successfully attacked and captured the fort at El Gtafia using the gun, but later the truck had to be abandoned and the experiment ended.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold <b>Unit</b> <b>was</b> {{set up by}} the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the {{rhinovirus}} was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment {{in the history of the}} unit.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 1945, the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> redesignated as the 36th Engineer Combat Group, and {{following}} World War II it reorganized at Fort Lewis, Washington.

At this time, {{the army of the}} Kingdom of Hawaii consisted of five volunteer companies, including the Prince's Own, and the regular troops of the King's Household Guard. Each <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> subject to being called for active service when necessary. On November 29, 1878, Iaukea was also appointed to King Kalākaua's personal military staff, with the rank of colonel.|$|E
5|$|The Brigade Piron was {{deployed}} to France in August 1944 following the Normandy Landings. Although it {{was kept in}} reserve {{for most of the}} campaign, the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> deployed in combat in Normandy alongside the British 6th Airborne Division and, later, the Guards Armoured Division. Among other operations, the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the Liberation of Honfleur on 25 August. It was also involved in the Liberation of Belgium in September 1944 and entered Brussels on 4September, the day after its Liberation.

25|$|These <b>units</b> <b>were</b> {{also built}} in two batches. 'Phase 1' <b>units</b> <b>were</b> built in 1965/66, and were {{numbered}} 7031-48. 'Phase 2' <b>units</b> <b>were</b> built in 1970, and were numbered 7049-7058.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the 1990s {{there was}} high demand for these new, and basic, investigative resources. The strain on central units {{lead to the}} {{creation}} of regional, and even local, level groups to help handle the load. For example, the British National Hi-Tech Crime <b>Unit</b> <b>was</b> set up in 2001 to provide a national infrastructure for computer crime; with personnel located both centrally in London and with the various regional police forces (the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> folded into the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in 2006).|$|E
5|$|Upon re-joining {{the party}} in 1922, Berchtold {{became a member of}} the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA), a {{paramilitary}} wing formed to protect its speakers at rallies, and to police Nazi meetings. Adolf Hitler, leader of the party since 1921, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his protection only instead of a suspected mass of {{the party in}} 1923. Originally the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> composed of only eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Berchtold. It was designated the Stabswache ("Staff Guard"). Later that year, the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> renamed Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler").|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Raw arrived in South Vietnam there were {{tensions}} between the Army and RAAF over the employment of No. 9 Squadron, with the Army perceiving that the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> not providing enough support to 1 ATF. Raw believed that the Task Force headquarters had unrealistic expectations as the Army officers {{did not understand the}} difficulty of maintaining and operating helicopters.|$|E

5|$|During World War II the {{battalion}} {{was sent to}} New Guinea in 1942 {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade to defend the territory against a Japanese attack. Subsequently, between July and August of that year the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> heavily engaged in the defence of Port Moresby, fighting along the Kokoda Track. The 39th fought several desperate actions against the Japanese as they attempted to hold out until further reinforcements could be brought up from Port Moresby. They were also later involved in the fighting around Buna–Gona. Such was their involvement in the battle that {{by the time they were}} withdrawn they could only muster 32 men and following its return to Australia, the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> disbanded in early July 1943.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, Manstein {{served on}} both the German Western and Eastern Fronts. At the {{beginning}} of the war he was promoted to lieutenant and participated in the invasion of Belgium with the 2nd Guard Reserve Infantry Regiment. In August 1914 he took part in the capture of Namur, the site of a massive citadel surrounded by outlying forts. In September, Manstein's <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> one of two transferred to East Prussia and attached to the Eighth Army, commanded by Hindenburg. After seeing action in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, his <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> soon reassigned to the Ninth Army, which was in the process of advancing from Upper Silesia to Warsaw. Overstretched, the Ninth Army was forced to withdraw in the face of a Russian counterattack, and on 16 November Manstein was wounded during the retreat when he was among a detachment that stormed a Russian entrenchment. He was shot in the left shoulder and the left knee; one bullet hit his sciatic nerve, causing the leg to be numb. Recovery took six months in hospital in Beuthen and Wiesbaden.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} for the invasion of South Korea {{in the years before}} the war, the North Korean leadership began to create large numbers of commando and special forces units to send south. These units subverted South Korean authority before and during the war with terror campaigns, sabotage and inducing rebellions in ROK military units. Hundreds of commandos were sent to South Korea in this fashion, {{and by the end of}} the war up to 3,000 of them had been trained and armed. During this time, North Korean leadership also ordered the creation of large conventional units to act as advance forces for the actual invasion. The 766th <b>Unit</b> <b>was</b> formed in April 1949 at the Third Military Academy in Hoeryong, North Korea. The academy was specially designed to train commandos, and the 766th was originally designed to supervise North Korean light infantry ranger units. Over the next year, the 766th Unit received extensive training in unconventional warfare and amphibious warfare. During this time, the <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> expanded in size to 3,000 men in six battalions.|$|E
5|$|Following the Allied {{evacuation}} of Gallipoli, the 25th Battalion returned to Egypt in December 1915, where Towner rejoined its ranks on 10 January 1916.
