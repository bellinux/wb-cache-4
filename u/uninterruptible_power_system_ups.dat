40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{the design of the}} output {{impedance}} of <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> (<b>UPS)</b> inverters with parallel-connection capability. In order to avoid the need for any communication among modules, the power-sharing control loops are based on the droop method. Since in these systems the power-sharing accuracy is highly sensitive to the inverters output impedance, novel control loops to achieve both stable output impedance and proper power balance are proposed. In this sense, a novel wireless controller is designed by using three nested loops: 1) the inner loop is performed by using feedback linearization control techniques, providing a good quality output voltage waveform; 2) the intermediate loop enforces the output impedance of the inverter, achieving good harmonic power sharing while maintaining low output voltage total harmonic distortion; and 3) the outer loop calculates the output active and reactive powers and adjusts the output impedance value and the output voltage frequency during the load transients, obtaining excellent power sharing without deviations in either the frequency or the amplitude of the output voltage. Simulation and experimental results are reported from a parallel-connected UPS system sharing linear and nonlinear loads.

40|$|In 3 -phase systems, the {{reliability}} of 3 -phase Inverter is not good. In such situations Paralleled Inverter Systems are used. Parallel Inverter operation has a major topic in <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> (<b>UPS)</b> applications where the design {{is focused on the}} standalone operation, and output stage is typically an inductor-capacitor filter. Most of the standalone inverter systems use a LC filter and proportional-integral (PI) controller in their control loops. When connecting the paralleled inverters to utility grids, the capacitor becomes redundant and thus either a pure inductor or an LCL filter can be used as inverter output stage. Compared with the L filter, the LCL filter is more attractive because it cannot only provide higher harmonics attenuation with same inductance value, but also allow inverter to operate both in standalone and grid-tie modes, which makes it a universal inverter for distributed generation applications. Output of Inverter should always be checked. In this paper, a full order observer for Inverter System is designed and is used for estimation of State Variables of the Inverter System. Two modes are adopted: a) Grid-tie Mode b) Standalone Mode. MATLAB/Simulink is used to verify and validate the proposed idea...|$|E
40|$|A {{single-stage}} high-voltage gain boost inverter {{is getting}} popularity in applications like solar photovoltaic, fuel cell, <b>uninterruptible</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> (<b>UPS)</b> systems, etc. Recently, single-stage voltage boost multilevel Z-source inverter (ZSI) and quasi-Z-source inverter (QZSI) {{have been proposed}} for dc-ac power conversion with improved power quality. Multilevel ZSI uses more number of high-power passive components in the intermediate network, which increase the system size and weight. Also, its input current is discontinuous in nature which is not desirable {{in some of the}} applications like fuel cell, UPS systems, hybrid electric vehicle, etc. In this paper, a continuous current input three-level LC-switching-based voltage boost neutral-point-clamped inverter is proposed, which uses comparatively less number of high-power passive components at the same time retains all the advantages of multilevel QZSI/ZSI. It is able to boost the input dc voltage and give required three-level ac output voltage in a single stage. Steady-state analysis of the proposed inverter is discussed to formulate the relationship between the input dc voltage and three-level ac output voltage.

The design achieves high voltage ratios for interfacing renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and line interactive <b>Uninterruptible</b> <b>Power</b> <b>System</b> (<b>UPS)</b> systems. The circuit topology provides for high step-up/down dc-dc conversion ratios using an MMC approach operating in resonant mode {{in order to improve}} overall efficiency. This topology operates to step-up the input voltage with 1 : 10 or larger conversion ratio. As a bidirectional converter, it also provides step-down capability at the same voltage ratio (10 : 1 or greater). The MMC circuit system consists of an upper and lower set of cells. The number of the upper cells is N, and the number of the lower cells is M. Phase-shift pulse width modulation (PS-PWM) is used to control voltage and power flow. PS-PWM with high duty cycle is generated to ensure that all the capacitors are connected except for one of them, which is out of the connection.
