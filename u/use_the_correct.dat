5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> punches.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur {{originally}} {{described the}} bluntnose stingray from specimens collected in Little Egg Harbor off the U.S. State of New Jersey. He published his account in an 1817 {{volume of the}} Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and named the new species Raja say in honor of Thomas Say, {{one of the founding}} members of the Academy. The species was moved to the genus Dasyatis by subsequent authors. In 1841, German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle erroneously gave the specific epithet as sayi in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, which thereafter became the typical spelling used in literature. Recently, there has been a push to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> original spelling again, though it has also been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) officially emend the spelling to sayi, for consistency with previous usage.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{recorded}} fake or counterfeit gold sovereigns in circulation, {{although they are}} still relatively scarce {{in comparison to the}} numbers of genuine coins, due to the difficulty of accurately replicating such a small coin economically. With numismatic fakes, the counterfeiter might <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> proportions of gold, but try to replicate an older coin with special rarity value. Such fakes present a potential problem only to the numismatic collector, as they still have standard bullion content.|$|E

25|$|Another type of auto-reset {{mechanism}} uses an oil (hydraulic) and gas accumulator. Shock loads {{cause the}} oil to compress the gas, when the gas expands again the leg returns to its working plowing position after passing over the obstacle. The most simple mechanism is a breaking (shear) bolt that needs replacement. Shear bolts which break when a plough body hits an obstruction are a cheaper overload protection device. It {{is important to}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> replacement bolt.|$|E
25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production <b>use.</b> <b>The</b> <b>correct</b> tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E
25|$|Colour maps {{were sent}} to {{commercial}} printers for printing in five colours, with the overprinting being added after the map had been printed. This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard four-colour process (CMYK). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs {{are now in a}} position to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and overprinting symbols) using that same four-colour process, but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using standard stock sizes of paper e.g. A4 or Letter. It is important to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> type of paper: both the weight and the coating affect the usability of the final map.|$|E

2500|$|... where [...] is a quantifier-free formula {{involving}} equalities and inequalities of real polynomials. The {{decision problem}} for the existential theory of the reals is the algorithmic problem of testing whether a given sentence belongs to this theory; equivalently, for strings that pass the basic syntactical checks (they <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> symbols with the correct syntax, and have no unquantified variables) it {{is the problem of}} testing whether the sentence is a true statement about the real numbers. The set of n-tuples of real numbers [...] for which [...] is true is called a semialgebraic set, so the decision {{problem for the}} existential theory of the reals can equivalently be rephrased as testing whether a given semialgebraic set is nonempty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{helicopters}} used on {{the series}} were model H-13 Sioux (military designation and nickname of the Bell 47 civilian model). As in the film, some care {{seems to have been}} taken to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> model of the long-lived Bell 47 series. In the opening credits and many of the episodes, Korean War-vintage H-13Ds and Es (Bell 47D-1s) were used complete with period-correct external litters. A later (1954–73) 47G occasionally made an appearance. The helicopters are similar in appearance (with the later [...] "G" [...] models having larger two-piece fuel tanks, a slightly revised cabin, and other changes) with differences noticeable only to a serious helicopter fan. In the pilot episode, a later Bell 47J (production began in 1957) was shown flying Henry Blake to Seoul, en route to a meeting with General Hammond in Tokyo. A Sud Aviation Allouette II helicopter was also shown transporting Henry Blake to the 4077th in the episode [...] "Henry, Please Come Home".|$|E
2500|$|It {{can be too}} {{difficult}} to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{information}} in the upper right-hand portion of the cover is designed to show how pictures are to be constructed from the recorded signals. The top drawing shows the typical signal that occurs {{at the start of}} a picture. The picture is made from this signal, which traces the picture as a series of vertical lines, similar to analog television (in which the picture is a series of horizontal lines). Picture lines 1, 2 and 3 are noted in binary numbers, and the duration of one of the [...] "picture lines," [...] about 8 milliseconds, is noted. The drawing immediately below shows how these lines are to be drawn vertically, with staggered [...] "interlace" [...] to give the correct picture rendition. Immediately below this is a drawing of an entire picture raster, showing that there are 512 (29) vertical lines in a complete picture. Immediately below this is a replica of the first picture on the record to permit the recipients to verify that they are decoding the signals correctly.

A color image of the spectrum of the sun was included for calibration purposes.|$|E
