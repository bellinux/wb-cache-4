2500|$|Peterson {{released}} a PC-based virtual strobe tuner in 2008 called [...] "StroboSoft". This computer software package {{has all the}} features of a virtual strobe, such as <b>user-programmable</b> temperaments and tunings. To use this tuner, a musician must have a computer next to the instrument to be tuned. An alternative is the PC-based strobe tuner TB Strobe Tuner with fewer functions.|$|E
2500|$|Television often uses a [...] "square law" [...] curve, {{providing}} finer {{control in}} top {{part of the}} curve, essential to allow accurate trimming of the colour temperature of lighting. Theatrical dimmers tend to use a softer [...] "S" [...] or linear curve. [...] Digital dimmers {{can be made to}} have whatever curve the manufacturer desires; they may have a choice between a linear relationship and selection of different curves, {{so that they can be}} matched with older analogue dimmers. [...] Sophisticated systems provide <b>user-programmable</b> or nonstandard curves, and a common use of a nonstandard curve is to turn a dimmer into a [...] "non-dim", switching on at a user defined control level.|$|E

50|$|WCS offered several {{advantages}} including {{the ease of}} patching the microprogram and, for certain hardware generations, faster access than ROMs could provide. <b>User-programmable</b> WCS allowed the user to optimize the machine for specific purposes.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the LAGR {{vehicles}} were sophisticated machines. Their sensor suite included 2 pairs of stereo cameras, an accelerometer, a bumper sensor, wheel encoders, and a GPS. The vehicle also had three computers that were <b>user-programmable.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However, a {{computer}} {{is not merely}} a time-keeping or calculating device, but rather a <b>user-programmable</b> item for complex algorithms, interfacing, and data management. By this definition, the wearable computer was invented by Steve Mann, in the late 1970s: ...|$|E
50|$|National Instruments have {{developed}} a hybrid embedded computing system called CompactRIO. It consists of reconfigurable chassis housing the <b>user-programmable</b> FPGA, hot swappable I/O modules, real-time controller for deterministic communication and processing, and graphical LabVIEW software for rapid RT and FPGA programming.|$|E
5000|$|Source code editors are text editors with {{additional}} functionality {{to facilitate the}} production of source code. These often feature <b>user-programmable</b> syntax highlighting and code navigation functions as well as coding tools or keyboard macros similar to an HTML editor (see below).|$|E
50|$|The Model 7/32 and Model 8/32 were 32-bit {{minicomputers}} {{introduced by}} Perkin-Elmer after they acquired Interdata, Inc., in 1973. Interdata computers are primarily remembered {{for being the}} first 32-bit minicomputers. The 8/32 was a more powerful machine than the 7/32, with the notable feature of allowing <b>user-programmable</b> microcode to be employed.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{thermostats}} {{may also}} have a <b>user-programmable</b> air filter change reminder; this counts the accumulated run-time of the heating/cooling system and reminds the user {{when it is time}} to change the filter. The feature often displays the accumulated run-time either as an aggregate of both heating and cooling or displaying each time separately.|$|E
50|$|Homebrew {{is a term}} {{frequently}} {{applied to}} video games or other software produced by consumers to target proprietary hardware platforms (usually with hardware restrictions) not typically <b>user-programmable</b> or that use proprietary storage methods. This can include games developed with official development kits, such as Net Yaroze, Linux for PlayStation 2 or Microsoft XNA.|$|E
50|$|Combining a pico {{projector}} with a webcam, a laser pointer, {{and image}} processing software enables {{full control of}} any computing system via the laser pointer. Pointer on/off actions, motion patterns (e.g., dwell, repetitive visit, circles, etc.) and more can all be mapped to events which generate standard mouse or keyboard events, or <b>user-programmable</b> actions.|$|E
50|$|An {{expensive}} (Â£49 in the UK in 1977) Hobby Module {{was available}} which gave 6.5 kb of <b>user-programmable</b> memory {{and had a}} 5 pin DIN socket to allow software to be saved to a cassette tape player. This converted the unit into a halfway house between a home computer and an ordinary gaming console.|$|E
50|$|Many more {{machines}} offer <b>user-programmable</b> writable control stores as an option, {{including the}} HP 2100, DEC PDP-11/60 and Varian Data Machines V-70 series minicomputers. The IBM System/370 includes a facility called Initial-Microprogram Load (IML or IMPL) {{that can be}} invoked from the console, as part of power-on reset (POR) or from another processor in a tightly coupled multiprocessor complex.|$|E
5000|$|The DX11 had 61 keys (with {{velocity}} and aftertouch sensitivity), and its memory included 128 preset patches, 32 <b>user-programmable</b> patches and 32 [...] "Performances". It {{also had a}} slot for an external memory cartridge, and a cable for saving and loading sound data to tape. Like other DX-series instruments, no on-board arpeggiator or sequencer is present.|$|E
50|$|The HP-18C was a Hewlett-Packard {{business}} calculator {{which was}} quickly {{followed by the}} very similar but greatly improved HP-19B. The HP-18C was HP's first RPL-based calculator internally, even though this was not visible on user-level in this non <b>user-programmable</b> model. The user did have a solver (another HP first) available, but only had about 1.5 KB of continuous memory available to store equations.|$|E

50|$|A Computationally {{enhanced}} craft item (CETI) is {{a simple}} mechanical device that is fitted with a small computer or computer interface and a servo system. A larger computer programs or directly controls the CETI according to {{the wishes of the}} user-programmer. CETIs are educational devices, but they can possibly provide guidance towards a future of <b>user-programmable</b> robots and ubiquitous computing. Tom Wrensch was one of the earliest proponents of CETI.|$|E
5000|$|There are 32 in-built patterns, {{and another}} 32 are <b>user-programmable</b> {{and remain in}} memory after power-off, {{preserved}} by a 2032 [...] "coin" [...] backup battery. These patterns can then be joined into a [...] "Song" [...] of up to 128 bars (or 256 if the Song Chain feature is used to join two Songs), with memory space for up to eight Songs. Tempo can be manually adjusted between 40 and 250 bpm.|$|E
5000|$|Some NICs offer {{integrated}} field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for <b>user-programmable</b> {{processing of}} network traffic {{before it reaches}} the host computer, allowing for significantly reduced latencies in time-sensitive workloads. [...] Moreover, some NICs offer complete low-latency TCP/IP stacks running on integrated FPGAs in combination with userspace libraries that intercept networking operations usually performed by the operating system kernel; Solarflare's open-source OpenOnload network stack that runs on Linux is an example. This kind of functionality is usually referred to as user-level networking.|$|E
5000|$|The OB-X was {{the first}} Oberheim {{synthesizer}} based on a single printed circuit board called a [...] "voice card" [...] (still using mostly discrete components) rather than the earlier SEM (Synthesizer Expander Module) used in Oberheim semi-modular systems, which had required multiple modules to achieve polyphony. The OB-X's memory held 32 <b>user-programmable</b> presets. The synthesizer's built-in Z-80 microprocessor also automated the tuning process. This made the OB-X less laborious to program, more functional for live performance, and more portable than its ancestors.|$|E
50|$|In March 1976, Intel {{announced}} a single-board computer product that integrated {{all of the}} support components required for their 8080 microprocessor, along with 1 kilobyte of RAM, 4 kilobytes of <b>user-programmable</b> ROM, and 48 lines of parallel digital I/O with line drivers. The board also offered expansion through a bus connector, but could be used without an expansion card cage when applications did not require additional hardware. Software development for this system was hosted on Intel's Intellec MDS microcomputer development system; this provided assembler and PL/M support, and permitted in-circuit emulation for debugging.|$|E
50|$|The 8-Bit MCUs have an {{embedded}} <b>user-programmable</b> non-volatile Flash {{memory that}} allows for fast and reliable storage of user code and data. It is operated with a single 2.5 V supply from the embedded voltage regulator (EVR) and does not require additional programming or erasing voltage. The sectorization of the Flash memory allows each sector to be erased independently. A Flash error correction (ECC) can detect double-bit errors and correct single-bit errors as well as protect against invalid code execution. Up to 3KB of RAM is featured, part of this memory being XRAM.|$|E
50|$|Newer Transmitters use spread {{spectrum}} {{technology in the}} 2.4 GHz, upper-UHF frequency band for communication. Spread spectrum technology allows many pilots to transmit in the same band (2.4 GHz) in proximity to each other with little fear of conflicts. Receivers in this band are virtually immune to most sources of electrical interference. Amateur radio licensees in the United States also have general use of an overlapping band in this same area, which exists from 2.39 to 2.45 GHz, with newer aftermarket transmitter RF module/receiver combinations on the 70 cm band also offering <b>user-programmable,</b> spread-spectrum versatility of varying degrees for Ham RC modelers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, Simmons {{introduced}} the SDS-9, a hybrid digital/analog brain with three changeable EEPROM channels (kick, snare, and rim) and analog-synthesized toms. It also featured 40 presets (20 factory and 20 <b>user-programmable)</b> and a built-in digital delay. This kit {{was yet another}} well received product for Simmons as it combines realistic sounds in an inexpensive, compact brain. Following customer feedback, Simmons also produced {{a new series of}} drum pads using [...] "floating" [...] drum heads and changeable shells. The snare drum had an extra trigger for the rim. Again, this improved the playability of the kit.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Master Lock {{introduced}} {{a new line of}} combination padlocks called the dialSpeed. The dialSpeed lock is battery-operated, has a lit face, and features multiple <b>user-programmable</b> combinations. It has a master unlocking code that can be accessed through the company web site. The product won a 2011 silver Edison Award. In 2014 Master Lock acquired Sentry Safe for $117.5 million. New products in the 2000s moved beyond locks themselves, including other sealing mechanisms such as industrial space covers.Distribution of Master Lock products occurs through wholesale distributors that then send the locks to individual retailers. Locks are made for a variety of uses, including personal locking, vehicle locking, and others.|$|E
5000|$|Among the {{key players}} in this area, Lucent played a big role and IBM {{acquired}} ROLM Inc, a US pioneer in ACDs, {{in an attempt to}} normalize all major PBX vendor interfaces with its CallPath middleware. This attempt failed when it sold this company to Siemens AG and gradually divested in the area. A pioneer startup that combined the technologies of voice digitization, Token Ring networking, and time-division multiplexing was ZTEL of Wilmington, Massachusetts. ZTEL's computer-based voice and data network combined <b>user-programmable</b> voice call processing features, protocol conversion for automated [...] "data call processing," [...] database-driven directory and telset definitions, and custom LSI chipset technology. ZTEL ceased operation in 1986.|$|E

5000|$|It is an {{electric}} car version of R8 CoupÃ© designed by AUDI AG and Audi Electronics Venture, with Robert Bosch GmbH, Bosch Engineering GmbH and 3 institutes at the RWTH Aachen University (Institute of Automotive Engineering (ika), Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), Institute of Electrical Machines (IEM)). It includes two separate blocks of 200-macrocell battery with total 38 kWh charge, front axle synchronous motor and rear axle asynchronous motors rated [...] and 550 Nm, a DC/DC converter, heat pump, <b>user-programmable</b> instrument cluster. The car's basic drive functions - Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive - are performed by operating {{buttons on the}} center tunnel. All other operations are controlled via a tablet computer that can {{be removed from the}} center console.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{commercial}} {{machines that}} used writable microcode include the Burroughs Small Systems (1970s and 1980s), the Xerox processors in their Lisp machines and Xerox Star workstations, the DEC VAX 8800 ("Nautilus") family, and the Symbolics L- and G-machines (1980s). Some DEC PDP-10 machines stored their microcode in SRAM chips (about 80 bits wide x 2 Kwords), which was typically loaded on power-on through some other front-end CPU. [...] Many more machines offered <b>user-programmable</b> writable control stores {{as an option}} (including the HP 2100, DEC PDP-11/60 and Varian Data Machines V-70 series minicomputers).The Mentec M11 and Mentec M1 stored its microcode in SRAM chips, loaded on power-on through another CPU.The Data General Eclipse MV/8000 ("Eagle") had a SRAM writable control store, loaded on power-on through another CPU.|$|E
5000|$|LambdaMOO, {{which is}} a virtual {{community}} still in existence, allows players to interact using avatars. The avatars are <b>user-programmable</b> and may interact automatically {{with each other and}} with objects and locations in the community. The [...] "cyberrape" [...] itself was performed by a player named Mr. Bungle (a reference to the band, Mr. Bungle). The user behind this avatar ran a [...] "voodoo doll" [...] subprogram that allowed him to make actions that were falsely attributed to other characters in the virtual community. These actions, which included describing sexual acts that characters performed on each other, went far beyond the community norms to that point and continued for several hours. They were interpreted as sexual violation of the avatars who were made to act sexually, and incited outrage among the LambdaMOO users, raising questions about the boundaries between real-life and virtual reality, and how LambdaMOO should be governed.|$|E
50|$|Since {{graphing}} calculators {{are usually}} readily <b>user-programmable,</b> such calculators are also widely used for gaming purposes, with a sizable body of user-created game software on most popular platforms. Some {{of the most}} notable and extensive community-driven graphing calculator archives are ticalc.org and cemetech.net. The ability to create games and other utilities within most graphing calculators has spurred the creation of numerous calculator hobbyist sites, where more advanced programs are created using a calculator's assembly language. It is simple to download games to a graphing calculator, as nearly all calculator program archives are free and open source. Even though handheld gaming devices fall in a similar price range, graphing calculators offer superior math programming capability for math based games. However, for developers and advanced users like researchers, analysts and gamers, 3rd party software development involving firmware mods, whether for powerful gaming or exploiting capabilities beyond the published data sheet and programming language, is a contentious issue with manufacturers and education authorities as it might incite unfair calculator use during standardized {{high school and college}} tests where these devices are targeted. Nowadays graduate (Masters) students and researchers have turned to advanced Computer Aided Math software for learning as well as experimenting.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, the Digital Personal Communicator, or DPC, was {{introduced}} as {{a lower cost}} alternative to the 9800X. Light or dark gray in color, the phone featured a green or orange 7-character segment LED display. It closely resembled the 9800x {{in terms of the}} keypad design and background and the main body. Early DPCs of the 9800X-era featured the elongated antenna base, round-top side grips, and white-on-gray keypad. Later versions (most likely after 1991) lost the 9800X-specific physical features, but kept the same basic form. Bone white models were also available as special editions to cellular providers in the US. An upscale version of the DPC, known as the MicroTAC 950, or the MicroTAC Alpha in later years featured an 8-character green or orange dot-matrix LED display and the return of the alpha-numeric phonebook. The Alpha phones were [...] "upscale" [...] in that they had more <b>user-programmable</b> options. Also, Alpha phones featured the side grip arrow keys. Soon, an [...] "affordable" [...] DPC 550 came to the market. Almost identical to the Digital Personal Communicator, the DPC 550 featured little with the most basic of operations.|$|E
