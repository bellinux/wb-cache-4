I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the {{smallest}} letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Anyone who breaks {{one of the least}} of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that <b>unless</b> <b>your</b> righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prince Oberyn Martell, nicknamed [...] "The Red Viper", {{is played}} by Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal. [...] "This was a tough one", said showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss about the casting. [...] "The Red Viper is sexy and charming, yet believably dangerous; {{intensely}} likable, yet driven by hate. The boys love him, the girls love him, and he loves them all back. <b>Unless</b> <b>your</b> last name is Lannister. We found a fellow who can handle the job description and make it seem effortless. He wasn't easy to find and he won't be easy to stop". Martin commented on the casting by saying: [...] "I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, but I understand that he really killed it with his reading. And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting. So I suspect that he {{will turn out to}} be a wonderful Red Viper". Actress Indira Varma was cast as Ellaria Sand, Prince Oberyn's paramour.|$|E

2500|$|Doctor's Advocate {{contains}} various {{staples of}} West Coast hip hop albums including explicit rhymes about gang violence, {{drug use and}} sex. The album looks into The Game's relationship with his former mentor Dr. Dre on several tracks, most notably Doctor's Advocate which also features former Aftermath Entertainment rapper Busta Rhymes. This album {{is known for its}} heavy West Coast hip hop sound, something that didn't feature much in his debut The Documentary. He worked with a number of west coast artists such as Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Tha Dogg Pound giving more west coast oreientated lyrics. Rapreviews said [...] "He is absolutely quintessentially relentlessly and unapologetically thugging it up on this CD, but <b>unless</b> <b>your</b> name is Joe Lieberman or Tipper Gore you're gonna enjoy {{the hell out of the}} dope beats and lyrical bravado and be begging for more." [...] DJBooth praised his lyrical skills by saying [...] "to briefly touch on the lyrics, only Eminem and Lil’ Wayne are currently equals." [...] However, once again many critics panned The Game's namedropping throughout the album, but Steve Juon of Rapreviews says that [...] "some accused him of being a [...] "name dropper" [...] back then and still will today, the references seem more in keeping with his [...] "soldier of the West" [...] philosophy and less like a filler for lack of content." ...|$|E
