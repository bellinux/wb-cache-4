5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the <b>unburned</b> liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and <b>unburned</b> land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within the Rim Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as <b>unburned</b> sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus <b>unburned</b> sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Daenerys {{stands before}} the {{gathered}} khals {{in the temple}} to hear her fate. There, she recalls her pregnancy ritual in this temple and her husband's vow to conquer Westeros. She accuses the khals of being unsuited to leading the Dothraki due to their lack of ambition, and says she will lead them. When Khal Moro and the other khals threaten to gang-rape her instead of serving her, she tells them they will die instead. She tips two braziers onto the straw floor, quickly setting the entire temple on fire and killing the khals, who have been barred inside by the younger Dosh Khaleen. A Dothraki crowd of thousands witnesses Daenerys emerge from the burning temple, naked but <b>unburned.</b> Amazed, they, Jorah and Daario bow down to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the fires happened, only one was {{believed to have been}} lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than <b>unburned</b> areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the fires. Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose {{are more likely to be}} browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by the fires. All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the fires, but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.|$|E
25|$|However, a motorcycle's exhaust {{emissions}} may contain 10–20 times more {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NOx), carbon monoxide, and <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons than exhaust from a similar-year passenger car or SUV.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 film Jarhead, the oil fires burn {{continuously}} {{throughout the}} 1991 invasion of Iraq, and its effects—an unceasing rain of <b>unburned</b> oil and smoke-filled skies, feature {{prominently in the}} story.|$|E
25|$|Cineromancy/Ceneromancy—Divination {{involving}} {{the ashes of}} a specifically sacrificial or ritual fire. This ritual calls {{for the removal of}} any <b>unburned</b> wood or coals, and interpreting the mounds, ridges, valleys, and other imperfections in the surface. Special attention was paid to intersections of these elements, or where they dead-ended.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the driving}} factors in modern gas turbine design is {{reducing}} emissions, and the combustor is the primary contributor to a gas turbine's emissions. Generally speaking, there are five major types of emissions from gas turbine engines: smoke, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons (UHC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx).|$|E
25|$|MET-L-KYL / PYROKYL is a {{specialty}} variation of sodium bicarbonate for fighting pyrophoric (ignites on contact with air) liquid fires. In addition to sodium bicarbonate, it also contains silica gel particles. The sodium bicarbonate interrupts the chain {{reaction of the}} fuel and the silica soaks up any <b>unburned</b> fuel, preventing contact with air. It is effective on other class B fuels as well. Blue/red in color.|$|E
25|$|Heaters {{are also}} {{available}} for engine oil so that warm oil can immediately circulate throughout the engine during start up. The easier starting results from warmer, less viscous engine oil and less condensation of fuel on cold metal surfaces inside the engine; thus an engine block heater reduces a vehicle's emission of <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide; also heat is available more instantly for the passenger compartment and glass defogging.|$|E
25|$|High {{emissions}}. As {{unburnt fuel}} {{is in the}} exhaust stream, emissions requirements are difficult to meet. This problem may be overcome by implementing direct fuel injection into the combustion chamber. The Freedom Motors Rotapower Wankel engine, which is not yet in production, met the ultra low California emissions standards. The Mazda Renesis engine, with both intake and exhaust side ports, suppressed the loss of <b>unburned</b> mix to exhaust formerly induced by port overlap.|$|E
25|$|Next {{generation}} IGCC {{plants with}} CO2 capture {{technology will be}} expected to have higher thermal efficiency and to hold the cost down because of simplified systems compared to conventional IGCC. The main feature is that instead of using oxygen and nitrogen to gasify coal, they use oxygen and CO2. The main advantage is {{that it is possible to}} improve the performance of cold gas efficiency and to reduce the <b>unburned</b> carbon (char).|$|E
25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the <b>unburned</b> mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unburned</b> {{hydrocarbon}} (UHC) {{and carbon}} monoxide (CO) emissions are highly related. UHCs are essentially fuel {{that was not}} completely combusted, and UHCs are mostly produced at low power levels (where the engine is not burning all the fuel). Much of the UHC content reacts and forms CO within the combustor, {{which is why the}} two types of emissions are heavily related. As a result of this close relation, a combustor that is well optimized for CO emissions is inherently well optimized for UHC emissions, so most design work focuses on CO emissions.|$|E
25|$|Another huge {{advantage}} of the liquid core {{is its ability to}} release xenon gas which normally acts as a neutron absorber and causes structural occlusions in solid fuel elements (leading to early replacement of solid fuel rods with over 98% of the nuclear fuel <b>unburned,</b> including many long lived actinides). In contrast Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) are capable of retaining the fuel mixture for significantly extended periods, which not only increases fuel efficiency dramatically, but also incinerates the vast majority of its own waste as part of the normal operational characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The MGPs {{were built}} on unpaved soil, their waste stream of coal dust, <b>unburned</b> carbon and {{lampblack}} were reused as fuel, {{dumped into the}} bay to the east or sent south by the trainload where it was mixed with soil and quarried stone to fill Islais Creek and build new land on bay mud from Army Street (now Cesar Chavez Street) to Candlestick Point east {{of what is now}} Third Street. Standard practice of the day was for cinders and ash from the furnaces to be given away or sold for road grading.|$|E
25|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) {{involves the use}} of a pre-mixed lean air-fuel mixture being compressed to the point of auto-ignition, so electronic spark ignition is eliminated. Gasoline engines combine homogeneous charge (HC) with spark ignition (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Diesel engines combine stratified charge (SC) with {{compression ignition}} (CI), abbreviated as SCCI. HCCI engines achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with compression ignition engine-like efficiency, and low levels of nitrogen oxide emissions (NO x) without a catalytic converter. However, <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions still require treatment to conform with automotive emission regulations.|$|E
25|$|As FAME {{contains}} {{low levels}} of sulfur, the emissions of sulfur oxides and sulfates, major components of acid rain, are low. Use of biodiesel also results in reductions of <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter. CO emissions using biodiesel are substantially reduced, {{on the order of}} 50% compared to most petrodiesel fuels. The exhaust emissions of particulate matter from biodiesel {{have been found to be}} 30% lower than overall particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel. The exhaust emissions of total hydrocarbons (a contributing factor in the localized formation of smog and ozone) are up to 93% lower for biodiesel than diesel fuel.|$|E
25|$|The store {{burned to}} the ground. However, {{as a result of}} the employees' herculean efforts, so much {{merchandise}} was saved that the store was able to reopen in only a few weeks (the Wholesale Department on Oct. 28th, and the Retail Department on Nov. 6th) in a temporary location (a horse-streetcar barn of the Chicago City Railway Co. at State & 20th Streets). Six months later, in April 1872, Field & Leiter reopened in an <b>unburned</b> building at Madison and Market Streets (today's West Wacker Drive). Salesman Parker stayed on with the Company for 45 more years, rising to the level of General Sales Manager.|$|E
25|$|At Borg in Norrköping Municipality, Östergötland, a small {{building}} was excavated that had two rooms {{on either side}} of a central hallway. There was a stone foundation interpreted as a hörgr {{at the far end of}} the hallway from the entrance. Two amulet rings were found near this and 98 amulet rings and 75 kg of <b>unburned</b> animal bones, including numerous skulls and jawbones, were found in the paved area in front of the entrance, suggesting the building had been used for ritual feasts. In the eleventh century the building and its yard had been covered with a thick layer of gravel and a church erected 100m away.|$|E
25|$|Oxygenate {{blending}} adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as MTBE, ETBE, ethanol, and biobutanol. The {{presence of}} these oxygenates reduces {{the amount of carbon}} monoxide and <b>unburned</b> fuel in the exhaust gas. In many areas throughout the US, oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, {{or in the case of}} California, California reformulated gasoline. The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed VOC-controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Mazda had {{improved}} the fuel {{efficiency of the}} thermal reactor system by 40% when the RX-7 was introduced in 1978. However, Mazda eventually shifted to the catalytic converter system. According to the Curtiss-Wright research, the factor that controls the amount of <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbon in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature, with higher temperatures producing less hydrocarbon. Curtiss-Wright showed also that the rotor can be widened, keeping the rest of engine's architecture unchanged, thus reducing friction losses and increasing displacement and power output. The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical, especially shaft deflection at high rotative speeds. Quenching is the dominant source of hydrocarbon at high speeds, and leakage at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|In {{this form}} {{it is often}} mixed with small amounts of {{hydrogen}} sulfide and mercaptans which will give the <b>unburned</b> gas an offensive smell easily detected by the human nose. In this way, butane leaks can easily be identified. While hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans are toxic, they are present in levels so low that suffocation and fire hazard by the butane becomes a concern far before toxicity. Most commercially available butane also contains {{a certain amount of}} contaminant oil which can be removed through filtration but which will otherwise leave a deposit at the point of ignition and may eventually block the uniform flow of gas. Contaminants are not used in fragrance extraction and butane gasses can cause gas explosions in poorly ventilated areas if leaks go unnoticed and are ignited by spark or flame.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 {{models were}} treated to a modest restyle of the trim, grille, and taillamps. New {{mandates}} by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for all 1968 model passenger cars were incorporated. Safety equipment including separate shoulder harness for the front seat belts, two rear lap belts, lighted side markers, padded seat backs, non-glare finish, safety design handles and armrests, energy absorbing steering column and optional headrests. American Motors did not wait for the requirements to cars delivered to dealers after 31 December 1967, but incorporated the safety features starting with the early 1968 model year cars produced in late 1967. Other requirements caused increases {{to the price of}} all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, including exhaust control systems to help reduce <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.|$|E
25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, <b>unburned</b> gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E
25|$|Advancements in {{combustor}} technology {{focused on}} several distinct areas; emissions, operating range, and durability. Early jet engines produced {{large amounts of}} smoke, so early combustor advances, in the 1950s, were aimed at reducing the smoke produced by the engine. Once smoke was essentially eliminated, efforts turned in the 1970s to reducing other emissions, like <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (for more details, see the Emissions section below). The 1970s also saw improvement in combustor durability, as new manufacturing methods improved liner (see Components below) lifetime by nearly 100 times that of early liners. In the 1980s combustors began to improve their efficiency across the whole operating range; combustors tended to be highly efficient (99%+) at full power, but that efficiency dropped off at lower settings. Development over that decade improved efficiencies at lower levels. The 1990s and 2000s saw a renewed focus on reducing emissions, particularly nitrogen oxides. Combustor technology is still being actively researched and advanced, and much modern research focuses on improving the same aspects.|$|E
25|$|The x-ray {{diffraction}} {{of a sample}} from an unfired lump of pottery clay excavated at the Zebree (3MS20) site confirmed that the shell was burned before being added to the raw clay. Burning the shells eliminates the organic binder and the cooled, burnt shells are easily crushed into a shell temper of fine plate-like particles, some nearly powder. The hinges of the shells are discarded. Using burned shells is logical as <b>unburned</b> mussel shells are hard and very durable. In terms of soil technology, the addition of shell (calcium carbonate) {{has the effect of}} neutralizing the ionic charge of the clay particles. During the course of replicative pottery experiments, as the shell was added to the clay in the presence of water, distinct and immediate changes took place in the feel of the clay. With the valence neutral, the clay-temper combination produces a very satisfactory pottery clay. This modification of backswamp clay - particles now clumping instead of constantly slipping - into a well-behaved modeling clay would have been immediately noticed by the experienced prehistoric potter.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the initial}} run of 36 Scout C airframes, later Scout C {{production}} batches, consisting of 50 aircraft {{built for the}} RNAS and 75 for the RFC, changed the cowl to a flat-fronted shorter-depth version able to house either the Gnome Lambda rotary, or the alternate choice of a nine-cylinder 80hp Le Rhône 9C rotary engine when the Gnome Lambda was not used, and moved the oil tank forward to a position {{in front of the}} pilot for better weight distribution and more reliable engine operation. The later cowl for the remaining Scout C aircraft still had the small opening of the domed unit, with both cowl designs having a circumferential slot-style cutaway made at mid-cowl depth of about one-sixth the circumference, to the lowest perimeter of the cowl to increase the cooling effect, and to allow any <b>unburned</b> fuel/oil mix to drain away. A total of some 161 Scout C airframes were produced for the British military as a whole, with the transition to the Scout D standard taking place in a gradual progression of feature changes.|$|E
500|$|The {{primary use}} of this element is in {{automobiles}} as a catalytic converter, changing harmful <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases. Of 30,000kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in 2012, 81% (24,300kg) went into and 8,060kg was recovered from this application. About 964kg of rhodium {{was used in the}} glass industry, mostly for production of fiberglass and flat-panel glass, and [...] 2,520kg was used in the chemical industry.|$|E
500|$|After {{the passage}} of strict new state and federal air regulations, the city passed its updated Air Pollution Control Code in 1971, {{designed}} in part to address concerns that nitrogen oxides and <b>unburned</b> hydrocarbons had been left insufficiently controlled by the previous changes. By 1972, New York City had cut levels of sulfur dioxide and particulates by half from their peak. According to an article published by the EPA Journal in 1986, those improvements at the city level were [...] "the legacy of concern that emerged after the 1966 Thanksgiving Day smog disaster." ...|$|E
500|$|After a fire {{destroyed}} the hatchery {{and several other}} Hume buildings in 1893, he moved many of his holdings {{to the opposite side}} of the river, where he founded the city of Wedderburn in 1895, naming it [...] "in honor of the ancestral castle of the Humes of Scotland". Floating some of his <b>unburned</b> buildings to Wedderburn from Ellensburg, he added a new hatchery, offices, a new home, many other buildings, and a horse-racing track. He started another newspaper, the Wedderburn Radium, and applied successfully for a post office, which opened in 1898 and was run by a Hume employee in Hume's general store.|$|E
500|$|Auriscalpium vulgare is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms grow solitary or clustered on fallen pine cones, {{especially those}} that are fully or partially buried.

One author noted finding the mushroom on spruce needles on top of squirrel dens where cone bracts {{were present in the}} forest floor. In a study conducted in the Laojun Mountain region of Yunnan Province, China, A.vulgare was found {{to be one of the}} most dominant species collected from mixed forest at an altitude of [...] A study on the effect of slash and burn practices in northeast India showed that the fungus prefers to fruit on burned cones of the Khasi Pine, and that the number of fruit bodies on <b>unburned</b> cones increases with cone girth.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of {{the cockpit}} area found there was bird residue and {{feathers}} on the windshield and center post. The remains of 15cowbirds were found within [...] {{of the end of}} Runway 20L. These birds, the NTSB found, had collided with the aircraft structure. Examination of the two engines found evidence of foreign objects, which consisted of minute fragments of feathers. The objects had blocked cooling ports, and had damaged the rotor assembly inside the engine. It was found the left engine had encountered 14 separate bird strikes and the right engine had encountered five. When the birds entered the engine, they caused the compressors to stall; these were the two loud bangs the witnesses heard as the aircraft took off. As the aircraft passed over the perimeter fence, the left engine flamed out, and the trail of smoke was <b>unburned</b> fuel passing through the hot combustion and turbine sections. Investigators determined it was possible the flight crew had managed to restart the left engine.|$|E
500|$|Mirs deorbit {{was carried}} out in three stages. The first stage {{involved}} waiting for atmospheric drag to reduce the station's orbit to an average of [...] This began with the docking of Progress M1-5, {{a modified version of the}} Progress-M carrying 2.5 times more fuel in place of supplies. The second stage was the transfer of the station into a 165×220km (103×137mi) orbit. This was achieved with two burns of Progress M1-5's control engines at 00:32 UTC and 02:01 UTC on 23 March 2001. After a two-orbit pause, the third and final stage of the deorbit began with the burn of Progress M1-5's control engines and main engine at 05:08 UTC, lasting 22+ minutes. Atmospheric reentry (arbitrarily defined beginning at 100km/60mi AMSL) occurred at 05:44 UTC near Nadi, Fiji. Major destruction of the station began around 05:52 UTC and most of the <b>unburned</b> fragments fell into the South Pacific Ocean around 06:00 UTC.|$|E
