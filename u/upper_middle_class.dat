By 1938 about one-third of the SS leadership were members of the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> The trend reversed after the first Soviet counter-offensive of 1942.|$|E

Professionals and managers who are exclusively labeled as middle class and often as <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> conceptualize, create and consult in their jobs.

5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{this was}} not the case. For most of its history, ain't was {{acceptable}} across many social and regional contexts. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, ain't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers, and was found in the correspondence and fiction of, among others, Jonathan Swift, Lord Byron, Henry Fielding, and George Eliot. For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope, the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ain't freely, but in familiar speech only. Ain't continued to be used without restraint by many <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIndia has {{recently}} witnessed various initiatives that harness {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) to promote electoral reform and political mobilization. These efforts have been initiated mainly by non governmental organizations drawn from India's urban, English-speaking, <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b> These efforts have been focused on non-partisan process improvements or short-lived political mobilization with limited success. We analyze these initiatives against the backdrop of modern India's political evolution which has seen the marginalization of <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in politics. We see technology as central to the re-engagement of ICT-savvy <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> with the political sphere. We suggest that political neutrality may be an effective and appropriate strategy for India's <b>upper</b> and <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in the pursuit of their policy agendas...|$|R

5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and food preservation techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and pickling) made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E
25|$|In sociology, the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> is {{the social}} group {{constituted}} by higher status members of the middle class. This {{is in contrast to}} the term lower middle class, which is used for the group {{at the opposite end of}} the middle-class stratum, and to the broader term middle class. There is considerable debate as to how the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> might be defined. According to sociologist Max Weber the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> consists of well-educated professionals with postgraduate degrees and comfortable incomes.|$|E

Inside the loop generally encompasses the central business district, and has come to define an urban lifestyle and state of mind. The appellation “innerlooper” carries with it the expectation of someone who appreciates cosmopolitan-style city life. Elizabeth Long, {{the author of the}} 2003 book Book Clubs: Women and the Uses of Reading in Everyday Life, wrote that most of the <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in the 610 Loop live in the southwestern part of the inner city in the areas near Hermann Park, the Houston Museum District, Rice University, and the Texas Medical Center, while some portions of northern Houston and Eastern Houston have been gentrified and also have <b>upper</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R

25|$|These {{professionals}} typically conceptualize, create, consult, and supervise.

In terms of financial wealth income, the professional middle class fits in the top third, but seldom reach the top 5% of American society.
