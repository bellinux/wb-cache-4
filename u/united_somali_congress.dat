5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by <b>United</b> <b>Somali</b> <b>Congress</b> commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E
25|$|The {{regime was}} {{weakened}} {{further in the}} 1980s as the Cold War {{drew to a close}} and Somalia's strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly authoritarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia, sprang up across the country, eventually leading to the Somali Civil War. Among the militia groups were the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), <b>United</b> <b>Somali</b> <b>Congress</b> (USC), Somali National Movement (SNM) and the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the Somali Democratic Movement (SDM), the Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG).|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the civil war in 1991 and the collapse of the Barre regime, Samatar moved to the United States in order to escape persecution {{as a member of the}} former government. According to Mario Sica, then Italian ambassador to Mogadishu, although the <b>United</b> <b>Somali</b> <b>Congress</b> (USC) professed that it was fighting against the Barre regime as a whole and not engaged in a clan-based struggle, public officials who belonged to the same clan as the USC's core constituents were not targeted. Instead, they were embraced as heroes and welcomed into the rebel group's senior leadership positions.|$|E

In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place. By that time, {{the moral authority}} of Barre's ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council had begun to weaken. Many Somalis were becoming disillusioned with life under military dictatorship.
