50|$|While a 4-stroke engine {{uses the}} piston as a {{positive}} displacement pump to accomplish scavenging taking 2 of the 4 strokes, a 2-stroke engine uses {{the last part of}} the power stroke and the first part of the compression stroke for combined intake and exhaust. The work required to displace the charge and exhaust gases comes from either the crankcase or a separate blower. For scavenging, expulsion of burned gas and entry of fresh mix, two main approaches are described: Loop scavenging, and <b>Uniflow</b> <b>scavenging,</b> SAE news published in the 2010s that 'Loop Scavenging' is better under any circumstance than <b>Uniflow</b> <b>Scavenging.</b>|$|E
50|$|All Series 71 engines use <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging,</b> where a gear-driven Roots type blower {{mounted to}} the {{exterior}} of the engine provides intake air through cored passages in the engine block and ports in the cylinder walls at slightly greater than atmospheric pressure. The engine exhausts through pushrod-operated poppet valves in the cylinder head(s), with either two or four valves per cylinder. Unit injection is employed, one injector per cylinder, with no high fuel pressure outside of the injector body. The injectors are cycled from the same camshaft responsible for opening the exhaust valves.|$|E
5000|$|In this method, {{the fresh}} charge, while {{entering}} {{from one side}} (or sometimes two sides) of the engine cylinder pushes out the gases through the exit valve situated {{on the top of}} the cylinder. In <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging,</b> both the fresh charge and burnt gases move in the same direction. Usually in diesel type engines the direction of flow is upward but with spark ignition engines such as the Ricardo Dolphin the direction of flow is generally downward with fresh air / fuel entering at the top of the engine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives the}} results of air-flow tests through {{two-stroke}} cycle and four-stroke cycle diesel engine cylinder heads and ports on steady-flow low-pressure air flow rigs. An analysis is made of the pressure drop through a diesel engine cylinder head inlet port system which shows {{the effect of the}} various parts of the system on flow loss. This also includes the effects of valve lift, valve seat angle, and valve shape on isentropic area. A comparison is made between tandem and Siamese porting on a four-stroke cycle engine cylinder head. The results of tests on <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenged</b> two-stroke cycle inlet ports and exhaust vaIves are aIso included...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the piston}} rises, the intake charge of air is compressed. Near top dead center, fuel is injected, {{resulting}} in combustion {{due to the}} charge's extremely high pressure and heat created by compression, which drives the piston downward. As the piston moves downward in the cylinder, it will {{reach a point where}} the exhaust port is opened to expel the high-pressure combustion gasses. However, most current two-stroke diesel engines use top-mounted poppet valves and <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Continued downward movement of the piston will expose the air intake ports in the cylinder wall, and the cycle will start again.|$|E
50|$|Direct-injection {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engines}} {{tend to use}} exhaust valves actuated either by camshafts or electronic control, rather than exhaust ports. This system is called <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Opposed piston engines are inherently uniflow-scavenged, but these do use piston-controlled cylinder ports. Two-stroke opposed piston engines such as the Napier Deltic and Junkers Jumo 204 engines use one piston to control the inlet port and the other the exhaust, allowing more flexibility in timing. A variation {{of this approach is}} taken by the split-single engine, in which two cylinders share one combustion chamber, with the piston in one cylinder controlling the transfer port and the other the exhaust port.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{crankshaft}} configurations do {{not necessarily}} need a cylinder head at all because they can instead have a piston {{at each end of}} the cylinder called an opposed piston design. Because fuel inlets and outlets are positioned at opposed ends of the cylinder, one can achieve <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging,</b> which, as in the four-stroke engine is efficient over a wide range of engine speeds. Thermal efficiency is improved because of a lack of cylinder heads. This design was used in the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel aircraft engine, using two crankshafts at either end of a single bank of cylinders, and most remarkably in the Napier Deltic diesel engines. These used three crankshafts to serve three banks of double-ended cylinders arranged in an equilateral triangle with the crankshafts at the corners. It was also used in single-bank locomotive engines, and is still used in marine propulsion engines and marine auxiliary generators.|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to design the engine of this conception and to reveal benefits and defects of this concept by using this method. In this thesis the emphasis is put on design of the construction groups which {{are directly related to}} unconventional concept of engine. On the other hand, the parts which can be designed conventionally were solved marginally or were not solved at all.

50|$|The <b>uniflow</b> {{method of}} <b>scavenging</b> {{has been widely}} used for {{two-stroke}} diesels, such as the Detroit Diesel Series 53,71,92,110 AND 149 and also the locomotive Electro-Motive Diesel and Cleveland Diesel and used in large 2 stroke ship propulsion engines such as Wärtsilä engines.|$|R
50|$|The Winton Engine Corporation {{produced}} the first practical two-stroke diesel engines in the 400 to 1,200 hp (300 to 900 kW) range. They powered early Electro-Motive Corporation (another GM subsidiary) diesel locomotives and U.S. Navy submarines. In 1934 an 8-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447 kW), 8-201A diesel engine powered the first American diesel-powered train the Burlington Zephyr streamliner passenger train. The locomotive diesel manufacturing side of Winton {{became part of}} the Electro-Motive Corporation (later the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors) in 1935. The 2-stroke Winton Model 201 series engines featured <b>Uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> with intake ports in the cylinder walls and exhaust valves in the cylinder heads which would carry over to later Cleveland Diesel designs. They were a 60 degree opposed V type engine with mechanical injection. They were produced for rail use until late 1938 when the new lighter-weight diesel engine with more speed and flexibility had been developed and introduced as the EMC designed Model 567 series. EMD's successor is still producing locomotive engines based on the Model 567 design.|$|E
50|$|CI {{engines that}} use a blower {{typically}} use <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging.</b> In this design the cylinder wall contains several intake ports placed uniformly spaced along the circumference {{just above the}} position that the piston crown reaches when at BDC. An exhaust valve or several like that of 4-stroke engines is used. The final part of the intake manifold is an air sleeve which feeds the intake ports. The intake ports are placed at an horizontal angle to the cylinder wall (I.e: they are in plane of the piston crown) to give a swirl to the incoming charge to improve combustion. The largest reciprocating IC are low speed CI engines of this type; they are used for marine propulsion (see marine diesel engine) or electric power generation and achieve the highest thermal efficiencies among internal combustion engines of any kind. Some Diesel-electric locomotive engines operate on the 2-stroke cycle. The most powerful of them have a brake power of around 4.5 MW or 6,000 HP. The EMD SD90MAC class of locomotives use a 2-stroke engine. The comparable class GE AC6000CW whose prime mover has almost the same brake power uses a 4-stroke engine.|$|E
40|$|Conventional 2 -stroke {{engines are}} {{commonly}} used for two-wheeled and marine vehicles that have small engine displacement. However problems such as unstable combustion, high fuel consumption rate, high hydrocarbon (HC) emission need to be resolved. Beside that, the two stroke engines also have its advantages over the four stroke engines such as higher torque and power, being more compact and lighter. In order to solve these problems without compromising these advantages, a new 2 -stroke engine was designed with numerical simulations to produce {{what is called a}} two stroke engine <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> system. In this study, the performance of the <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> engine was researched, and considerations concerning fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions were made. These findings were then compared with the earlier research to consider gas flow and diffusion of fuel inside the cylinder. This study also describes the effects of the scavenging ports configuration to the flow pattern, the scavenging efficiency and the scavenging pressure, in case of <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> two-stroke engine. In this research we will analyses all the parameters of the two stroke <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> system based on of the geometry of the intake and exhaust port design, by applied mathematical formulas using of graphical dynamic system simulation software which is MatLab...|$|E

40|$|In opposed-piston folded-cranktrain diesel engines, the {{relative}} movement rules of opposed-pistons, combustion chamber components and injector position {{are different from}} those of conventional diesel engines. The combustion and heat release characteristics of an opposed-piston folded-cranktrain diesel engine under different operating conditions were investigated. Four phases: ignition delay, premixed combustion, diffusion combustion and after combustion are used to describe the heat release process of the engine. Load changing has a small effect on premixed combustion duration while it influences diffusion combustion duration significantly. The heat release process has more significant isochoric and isobaric combustion which differs from the conventional diesel engine situation, except at high exhaust pressure and temperature, due to its two-stroke and <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> characteristics. Meanwhile, a relatively high-quality exhaust heat energy is produced in opposed-piston folded-cranktrain diesel engines...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an opposed-piston {{two-stroke}} (OP 2 S) gasoline {{direct injection}} (GDI) engine is introduced and its working principles and scavenging process were analyzed. An optimization function was established to optimize the scavenging system parameters, include intake port height, exhaust port height, intake port circumference ratio, the exhaust port circumference ratio and opposed-piston motion phase difference. The effect of the port height on the effective compression ratio and effective expansion ratio were considered, and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) was employed as the optimization objective instead of scavenging efficiency. Orthogonal experiments were employed to reduce the calculation work. The effect of the scavenging parameters on delivery ratio, trapping ratio, scavenging efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency were calculated, and the best parameters were also obtained by the optimization function. The results show that IMEP {{can be used as}} the optimization objective in the <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> system; intake port height is the main factor to the delivery ratio, while exhaust port height is the main to engine trapping ratio, scavenging efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency; exhaust port height is the most important factor to effect the gas exchange process of OP 2 S-GDI engine...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{investigated}} experimentally {{the influences of}} stroke bore ratio, scavenging port angle and scavenging air flow quantity on the swirl characteristics in a model cylinder of diesel engine with <b>uniflow</b> <b>scavenging</b> system. In this test, the laser doppler velocity meter (LDV) was employed to measure the axial and circumferential velocity distributions precisely. As a result, the following behaviors have been made clear. (1) Swirl intensity does not almost vary {{in spite of the}} increase in stroke bore ratio. (2) The larger the stroke bore ratio is, the less influence of exhaust valve on swirl flow pattern is. (3) With a small scavenging port angle swirl intensity decreases downstream significantly, and the dead zone at the lower part of cylinder liner is larger as compared with the case of a large scavenging port angle. (4) In case of the large scavenging port angle, swirl intensity does not vary in entire region of cylinder, but there is a little inverse flow region {{near the center of the}} cylinder. (5) The velocity profiles are similar in a whole flow field at different air flow rate conditions...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation, {{aimed to explore}} the potential of 2 -stroke Diesel engines, able to meet Euro VI requirements, for application to medium size commercial vehicles (power rate: 80 kW at 2600 rpm, max. torque 420 Nm from 1200 to 1400 rpm). The study is based on experimental performance of a highly developed 4 -stroke engine. Two different designs are considered: Loop and <b>Uniflow</b> <b>scavenging,</b> the latter obtained through an opposed piston configuration. In both cases, no poppet valves are used, and the lubrication is provided by a 4 -stroke-like oil sump. The study started {{with the development of}} a 4 -stroke EURO VI engine, {{on the basis of a}} previous EURO IV version. A prototype of the new engine (named 430) was built and tested. The second phase of the study consisted in the comparison to the 2 -stroke configurations, considering the same performance and emissions targets, as well as the same constraints Engine outputs are calculated by using GT-Power models: while for the 4 -stroke unit these results are fully supported by experimental data, the 2 -strokes are just "paper" engines. However, the CFD- 1 D modeling was supported by other detailed numerical simulations, including both scavenging and combustion analyses. The two stroke concepts analyzed in the paper appear to yield several advantages, in comparison to their 4 -stroke counterpart: reduced fuel consumption, cleaner combustion conditions, more compact dimensions, higher flexibility of the EGR control. On the other hand, they require a strong effort for the development of a specific combustion system...|$|E
