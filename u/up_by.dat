5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the detector.|$|E

40|$|Impact of some nanoadditives, such as {{amorphous}} SiO 2 (AS) of pozzolanic {{properties and}} carbon fibers (CF) reduced to nanosize particles on {{autoclaved aerated concrete}} (AAC) forming mixtures, the following parameters were investigated: changes in consistence of binding material during hydration, spreadability, expansion and temperature of mixture, plasticity strength. The investigations were carried out with AAC forming mixture where 10  % lime was replaced by equivalent content of Portland cement. Upon completion of investigations, it was established that the optimal replacement of sand by AS was 1. 0  % resulting in increase of temperature of AAC forming mixture <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 2. 1  %, expansion <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 11. 0  %, ultrasonic impulse velocity (UIV) <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 3. 0  % and plasticity strength <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 271. 4  %. Meanwhile the optimal replacement of sand by CF was 0. 1  % resulting in decrease in temperature of AAC forming mixture <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 1. 5  %, expansion <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 16. 0  % and increase in  UIV <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 2. 0 % and plasticity strength <b>by</b> <b>up</b> to 152. 9  %.
