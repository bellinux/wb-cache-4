5|$|The {{target was}} <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be {{attacked}} by August 1945.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} methods date the wood, not the {{inscriptions}} themselves. Pacific rosewood is not durable, and is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> survive long in Easter Island's climate.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{decision}} emasculated NIRA, it had little practical impact, as Congress was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have reauthorized the Act in any case.|$|E

5|$|An {{assessment}} of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that its range is <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, the {{conditions}} {{have not yet}} been met. When the switchover date is announced at least a further 2 years will pass so it is very <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> occur before 2020.|$|E
5|$|Avril Doyle, former MEP and TD. On 21 June 2011, she {{announced}} her candidacy. She {{withdrew from the}} contest on 7 July stating that she realised she was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> receive the nomination.|$|E

5|$|No other {{francolin}} {{share this}} bird's restricted range (although the yellow-necked francolin occurs elsewhere in Djibouti) {{so it is}} <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be confused with any other species.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1939, as {{it became}} clear that Poland was <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> halt the ongoing German invasion, BS-4 {{received}} orders to destroy part of its files and evacuate essential personnel.|$|E

5|$|Overall, about 1 {{percent of}} all people have one or more {{cerebral}} aneurysms. Most of these, however, are small and <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> rupture.|$|E
5|$|The dams on the Lhasa river {{built as}} part of the Three Rivers Development Project are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> affect the flow of the Brahmaputra in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} {{candidates}} in the Democratic primary were regarded as <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> win; when the election was held, the three combined drew less than 3% of the vote.|$|E
50|$|Jiří Dienstbier Jr., Senator and Party's presidential {{candidate}} in 2013. His candidacy is considered <b>unlikely</b> due <b>to</b> lack of support in the party.|$|R
25|$|A {{subsidiary}} of the British company DB Schenker Rail (UK), EuroCargoRail, operates trains in France and Spain, a situation <b>unlikely</b> prior <b>to</b> the liberalisation.|$|R

5|$|The {{planet is}} <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short {{timescales}} {{relative to the}} age of the system.|$|E
5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.|$|E
5|$|A {{handful of}} days before the Sugar Bowl, Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Hall broke a bone in his foot during practice and was considered <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> play. Hall was Tech's second-leading receiver, having caught 25passes for 398yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting punt returner, and had returned 40kicks for 510yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{problems}} of listing maximal cliques or finding maximum cliques are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be fixed-parameter tractable with the parameter , they may be fixed-parameter tractable for other parameters of instance complexity. For instance, both problems {{are known to be}} fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the degeneracy of the input graph.|$|E
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> occur. The only {{reported}} hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E

50|$|Faster-than-light {{space travel}} is not invented in Cherryh's {{timeline}} until 2234, making colonization of the remote Hydri reach by anyone <b>unlikely</b> prior <b>to</b> that date.|$|R
