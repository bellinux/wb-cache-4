5|$|The Khitan spoken {{language}} is most {{closely related to}} the Mongolic language family; some broader definitions of the Mongolic family include Khitan as a member. More broadly, Khitan is an Altaic language, although scholars are divided on the question whether the Altaic is a true language family or linguistic area in which originally distinct languages have influenced each other over a long period. Khitan shares some terms with the Altaic but non-Mongolic Turkic spoken by the <b>Uighur</b> peoples, who shared the steppes of North Asia with the Khitans for several hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The Liao {{employed}} {{two separate}} governments operating {{in parallel with}} one another: a Northern Administration in charge of Khitan and other nomadic peoples, most of whom lived in the northern side of Liao territory, and a Southern Administration {{in charge of the}} Chinese populace that lived predominantly in the southern side. When Abaoji first established the system, these two governments did not have strict territorial boundaries, but Emperor Shizong established formally delineated boundaries for the two administrations early in his reign. The newly delineated Northern Administration had large Chinese, Balhae, and <b>Uighur</b> populations, and was given its own set of parallel northern and southern governments.|$|E
50|$|When the Turks where overthrown by the <b>Uighurs</b> in 745 the war-loving {{power of}} the Turks was {{replaced}} by the commerce-loving <b>Uighurs.</b> The control that the <b>Uighurs</b> had on the Khitans were of a different kind. <b>Uighurs</b> were focusing on economic exchanges, were the protectors of the diplomatic stability and left large political and internal freedom to their vassals. The Khitans used this to keep a peaceful environment helping to strengthen all their demographic, economic and structural force.|$|R
2500|$|The United States {{continued}} to detain the <b>Uighurs,</b> believing their lives {{would be in}} danger if they were released to China. There was considerable political pressure from members of Congress not to release the <b>Uighurs</b> in the United States, and the United States {{had a difficult time}} finding another country willing to accept them. [...] Eventually, the Republic of Palau announced that it would accept the remaining <b>Uighurs</b> on a temporary basis.|$|R
5|$|Following the An Lushan Rebellion, the Khitans became vassals of the <b>Uighurs,</b> while {{simultaneously}} paying tributes to the Tang, {{a situation that}} lasted from 755 until {{the fall of the}} <b>Uighurs</b> in 840. From 840 until the rise of Aboji, the Khitans remained a tributary of the Tang dynasty.|$|R
5|$|Mongolian first adopted loanwords from Old Turkic, Sanskrit (these often through <b>Uighur),</b> Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, Tungusic, and Chinese. However, {{more recent}} loanwords come from Russian, English, and Mandarin Chinese (mainly in Inner Mongolia). Language {{commissions}} of the Mongolian state continuously translate new terminology into Mongolian, {{so as the}} Mongolian vocabulary now has jerönhijlögč 'president' ("generalizer") and šar ajrag 'beer' ("yellow kumys"). There are several loan translations, e.g., galt tereg 'train' ('fire-having cart') from Chinese huǒchē (火车, fire cart) 'train'. Other loan translations include mön chanar (essence) from Chinese shízhì (实质, true quality), khün am (population) from Chinese rénkǒu (人口, person mouth), erdene shish (corn, maize) from Chinese yùmǐ (玉米, jade rice) and bügd nairamdakh uls (republic) from Chinese gónghéguò (共和国, public collaboration nation).|$|E
5|$|During the Islamic {{conquest of}} Persia (633–656), {{the son of}} the last ruler of the Sassanid Empire, Prince Pirooz, fled to Tang China. According to the Old Book of Tang, Pirooz was made the head of a Governorate of Persia in what is now Zaranj, Afghanistan. During this conquest of Persia, the Rashidun Islamic Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan (r. 644–656) sent an embassy to the Tang court at Chang'an. By the 740s, the Arabs of Khurasan had {{established}} a presence in the Ferghana basin and in Sogdiana. At the Battle of Talas in 751, Qarluq mercenaries under the Chinese defected, helping the Arab armies of the Islamic Caliphate to defeat the Tang force under commander Gao Xianzhi. Although the battle itself was not of the greatest significance militarily, this was a pivotal moment in history; it marks the spread of Chinese papermaking into regions west of China as captured Chinese soldiers revealed secrets of Chinese papermaking to the Arabs. These techniques ultimately reached Europe by the 12th century through Arab-controlled Spain. Although they had fought at Talas, on June 11, 758, an Abbasid embassy arrived at Chang'an simultaneously with the Uyghur Turks bearing gifts for the Tang Emperor. In 788–9 the Chinese concluded a military alliance with the <b>Uighur</b> Turks who twice defeated the Tibetans, in 789 near the town of Gaochang in Dzungaria, and in 791 near Ningxia on the Yellow River.|$|E

The Uighurs in Kashgar under Yūsuf {{and his older brother}} Jahān Khoja of Yarkand revolted in 1754 against the Dzungars, but Jahān was taken prisoner by the Dzungars after he was betrayed by the Uch-Turfan <b>Uighur</b> Xiboke Khoja and Aksu <b>Uighur</b> Ayyūb Khoja. Kashgar and Yarkand were assaulted by 7,000 Khotan Uighurs under Sādiq, the son of Jahān Khoja. The Uighurs supported the 1755 Qing assault against the Dzungars in Ili, which occurred {{at the same time as}} the <b>Uighur</b> revolts against the Dzungars. Uighurs like Emin Khoja, 'ʿAbdu l-Mu'min and Yūsuf Beg supported the Qing attack against Dawachi, the Dzungar Khan.

The East Turkestan Republic banished the Swedish missionaries and tortured and jailed Christian converts, mainly Kirghiz and Uighurs. The openly Islamic East Turkestan Republic forcibly ejected the Swedish missionaries and was openly hostile to Christianity while espousing a Muslim Turkic ideology. The East Turkestan Republic subjected former Muslim Christian converts like Joseph Johannes Khan to jail, torture and abuse after he refused to give up Christianity in favor of Islam. After the British intervened to free Khan he was forced to leave his land and in November 1933 he came to Peshawar.|$|E

[...] The <b>Uighurs</b> carried out [...] "acts of resistance" [...] like hiding the goods which were collected as taxes or violently resisting the Dzungar Oirat tax collectors, but these incidents were infrequent and widespread anti-Dzungar opposition failed to materialize. Many opponents of Dzungar rule like <b>Uighurs</b> and some dissident Dzungars escaped and defected to Qing China during 1737-1754 and provided the Qing with intelligence on the Dzungars and voiced their grievances. ʿAbdu l-Lāh Tarkhān Beg and his Hami <b>Uighurs</b> defected and submitted to Qing China after the Qing inflicted a devastating defeat at the battle of Jao Modo on the Dzungar leader Galdan in September 1696.|$|R
