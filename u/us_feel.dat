From 16 August 144 RAC regularly worked with 153rd (Highland) Brigade of 51st Highland. 'On arriving at Brigade Headquarters, Major Secretan {{found that he was}} to support the 1st Gordons, the beginning of a long association between B Squadron and that battalion... this was really the beginning of our close connection with 153 Infantry Brigade, an association which was to continue {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Each infantry battalion also grew accustomed to being supported by the same squadron and in this way very close ties of confidence and friendship were established between A Squadron and the 5th Black Watch, B squadron and the 1st Gordons, and between C Squadron and the 5/7th Gordons... In order to make <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> part of the family, the 51st Highland Division asked us to wear the famous HD flash and issued every man in the brigade with one, a gesture which was very much appreciated'.|$|E

500|$|In April 2014, The Daily Telegraph {{placed the}} title on its top ten {{list of the}} most overrated films. Telegraphs Tim Robey stated, [...] "It's a {{criminal}} failing of the movie that it purports to be about people’s dreams being invaded, but demonstrates no instinct at all for what a dream has ever felt like, and no flair for making <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like we're in one, at any point."

During the interview Pusztai said he had [...] "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what we thought it was necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing." [...] When asked why he felt concerned, he said [...] "it was because we had done some experiments which made <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> concerned" [...] and discussed his results in general terms.|$|E

And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E

500|$|... "The Reporter" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz. Blitz previously directed episodes of The Office, a comedy series created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels. Michael Schur, who created Parks along with Daniels, said of Blitz, [...] "He's such a great director, and it made <b>us</b> <b>feel,</b> launching this new show, safe and happy to have him." [...] It was originally {{supposed to be the}} second episode shown in the series, but the broadcast schedule was changed and [...] "Canvassing," [...] the original third episode, was shown second instead. Goor was very upset with the switch so, as a prank, the Parks and Recreation producers sent him an e-mail message claiming NBC was going to be further held until the second season because it was preempted by [...] "a sports thing." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|The Iron Giant {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the concept of existentialism, as well as the nature of humanity.

And that plays out {{for the rest of your}} life." [...] McCanlies added that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would [...] "make <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like we're all part of humanity [...] is something we need to feel." [...] When some critics compared the film to [...] (1982), Bird responded by saying [...] "E.T. doesn't go kicking ass. He doesn't make the Army pay.

[...] He noted that [...] "the powerful closing sentiments of Achtung Babys 'Acrobat' can help <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> motivated and empowered in the face of powers that want us to feel powerless." [...] Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self. He noted [...] "here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of the world around them. The 'enemy' that one can feel is oneself. 'To feel' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance." ...|$|E
500|$|Escape was {{recorded}} in 16 days at Battery Studios in London, with Hutchins often writing lyrics in the studio.

Hutchins worked well with Smith, and said that the producer became involved in the music-making and [...] "would start talking a lot of shit to us to let <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like he felt". Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... But we knew we got something right when Larry started grabbing his dick, and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E
500|$|Although Clements and Musker had {{originally}} intended to hire animator Glen Keane to animate Ursula due to his history of animating Disney villains, Keane specifically requested that he be allowed to animate Ariel after hearing Benson sing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for the first time. Captivated by her performance, he {{decided to make the}} scene his most important assignment, volunteering to animate the entire [...] "Part of Your World" [...] musical sequence himself and becoming its lead animator. Animating one particular scene to appear as though the camera is rotating around Ariel while she sings [...] "Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?" [...] was particularly challenging for the animators to perfect without the aid of computer animation, taking them considerably longer to complete. Keane described the song as the moment [...] "the audience starts thinking of Ariel as this real, living thing. A girl who's dreaming of something more. And since so many of <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> just like that ... that's when the audience falls in love with this character." ...|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, some reviewers found Jawss {{description}} of the shark attacks entertaining. John Spurling of the New Statesman asserted that while the [...] "characterisation of the humans is fairly rudimentary", the shark [...] "is done with exhilarating and alarming skill, and every scene in which it appears is imagined at a special pitch of intensity." [...] Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the novel in a short review for The New York Times, highlighting the [...] "strong plot" [...] and [...] "rich thematic substructure." [...] The Washington Posts Robert F. Jones described Jaws as [...] "much more than a gripping fish story. It is a tightly written, tautly paced study," [...] which [...] "forged and touched a metaphor that still makes us tingle whenever we enter the water." [...] New York Magazine reviewer Eliot Fremont-Smith found the novel [...] "immensely readable" [...] {{despite the lack of}} [...] "memorable characters or much plot surprise or originality"; Fremont-Smith wrote that Benchley [...] "fulfills all expectations, provides just enough civics and ecology to make <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> good, and tops it off with a really terrific and grisly battle scene".|$|E
500|$|Claudio Abbado, {{principal}} guest conductor since 1971, succeeded Previn {{as chief}} conductor in the orchestra's diamond jubilee year, 1979. In a 1988 {{study of the}} LSO in Gramophone magazine James Jolly wrote that Abbado {{was in many ways}} the antithesis of Previn in terms of style and repertoire, bringing to the orchestra a particular authority in the Austro-German classics as well as a commitment to the avant-garde. From the orchestra's point of view there were disadvantages to his appointment. His relationship with the players was distant and he was unable to impose discipline on the orchestra in rehearsals. He insisted on conducting without a score, and many times this led to barely-avoided disaster in concerts. Abbado had considerable international prestige, but this too had its downside for the LSO: he frequently made his major recordings with the Boston or Chicago Symphony Orchestras or the Vienna Philharmonic. One of the LSO's principals commented, [...] "Although we were sweating our guts playing those vast Mahler symphonies for... Abbado, he would go and record them with other orchestras, which made <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like second, maybe even third choice".|$|E
500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that makes <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> no longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe, which {{at the same time we}} feel we can understand. Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E

500|$|In April 2014, Minaj {{posted a}} picture on Instagram of herself with Soulja Boy in a studio. Later that month, he posted a Vine of him singing the song's chorus. Originally, Joseph DaVinci & Soulja Boy created the song's beat but {{according}} to him, it lacked a hook. However, he later {{came up with the}} idea for the hook while making a Vine, and added it into the song. He then brought the unfinished version of [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] to Minaj, who was impressed by the song and recorded her vocals. After Minaj sent the track back to him, it took [...] "about a day" [...] for Soulja Boy to finish mixing the record. In May 2014, Minaj spoke of the meaning behind the word [...] "yasss": [...] "When I watch RuPaul's Drag Race,' I live for the way they speak. Females, we adopted it and it makes <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like very cocky and very just like sexy and feminine. So saying 'yass' as opposed to 'yes,' it's just putting on a billion times more attitude to the word 'yes'." [...] On May 3, 2014, Minaj posted the song on her official SoundCloud shortly after midnight.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E

[...] A review of her 2011 Sun Valley concert stated that [...] "Evancho transported [...] with pure, joyous, unaffected notes". Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream With Me that [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat makes <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with what felt like real yearning". The Wall Street Journal called Evancho's 2011 performance of the song [...] "Angel" [...] on the Tonight Show [...] "moving".|$|E
