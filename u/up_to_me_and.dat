5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E
500|$|For Streep, {{the most}} {{significant}} thing about the film was that [...] "his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I know what you felt like, {{this is kind of}} like my life.' That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about Devil Wears Prada—it engaged men on a visceral level," [...] she told Indiewire.|$|E

60|$|The {{little man}} stared at me; then, {{deliberately}} disencumbering himself of surcingle, threads, and implements, he got <b>up,</b> advanced <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{held out his}} hand.|$|R
500|$|Matt Groening noted: [...] "I can't {{tell you}} how many times people have come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, 'No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.'" [...] Cast member Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name [...] "F" [...] and lived in the room next door at his college.|$|E
500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> says, 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV {{all the time and}} I guess I pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Miller {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the Second World War. It changed him ... In the first post-war Ashes Test ... England were caught on a sticky ... Bill Edrich came in. He'd had a serious war and he survived and Miller thought, 'He's my old Services mate. The last thing he wants after five years' war is to be flattened by a cricket ball, so I eased up. Bradman came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Don't slow down, Keith. Bowl quicker.' That remark put me off Test cricket. Never {{felt the same way}} about it after that.' ...|$|E

500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one." ...|$|E
500|$|Recognizing Dylan's {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{progress}} of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: [...] "Grossman came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'". Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's Music Row in February 1966.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{attributed}} {{his service}} in the regiment to his need for [...] "a little recreation. Life was dull. Fellow came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> he says, 'The Marine Reserves are organizing a twentieth regiment. Why don't you come down?'" [...] He made the dubious claim of being rapidly promoted {{to the rank of}} First Sergeant; Hubbard later explained his unusually rapid promotion as being due to his unit being newly formed and his superiors being unable to [...] "find anyone else who could drill." [...] He stated that he was rated 'excellent' for military efficiency, obedience and sobriety. On October 22, 1931, Hubbard received an honorable discharge along with the annotation [...] "not to be re-enlisted." ...|$|E
6000|$|He thought upon that. [...] "A means," [...] he asked, [...] "to what? Look here, Marjorie, what do {{you think}} you are <b>up</b> <b>to</b> with <b>me</b> <b>and</b> yourself? What do you see me doing--in the years ahead?" ...|$|R
60|$|After breakfast, Dorcas came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> rather mysteriously, <b>and</b> {{asked if}} she might have a few words with me.|$|R
60|$|Presently he turned, and perceiving that I {{was sitting}} <b>up</b> {{advanced}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{with the utmost}} courtesy said that he trusted that I felt better. I answered that at present I scarcely knew how I felt, except that I ached all over.|$|R
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, it was {{announced}} that Wood would take a brief break from the program to film the fifth installment in the Final Destination film series, Final Destination 5. Wood recorded several scenes in advance of her planned absence. In May 2012, when The Bold and the Beautiful was shooting [...] Hope and Liam's wedding on location in Italy, Wood performed her own stunts in a drowning scene. Wood learned about her Daytime Emmy nomination just before filming a scene in the Adriatic sea, stating, [...] "I was just about to shoot a scene in the Adriatic sea in Italy. The water was only 54 degrees! [...] Brad Bell came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} Emmy nominated?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} door of the sleeper and stepped inside. A big, fat old man came wabbling <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> puffing <b>and</b> blowing. He had one coat-sleeve on and was trying to put his vest on over that. I don't know who he thought I was.|$|R
6000|$|At Torquay station, to {{my great}} surprise, a fresh-looking girl {{of my own}} age rushed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> kissed <b>me</b> without one word of warning.

6000|$|... "Tom," [...] {{my brother}} said, coming <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> quietly, <b>and</b> {{speaking}} in a very unwonted whisper; [...] "this {{is not the place}} to discuss all these things. The sooner you and I can get out of it the better. It's my belief Kalaua has saturated the ground with something and set it on fire." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to keep his anonymity, Grohl planned to release the songs under the name Foo Fighters. It {{would be a very}} low-key release, with only 100 LP records being pressed after the {{sessions}} were finished. Grohl also went to a cassette duplication lab in Seattle and created 100 cassette copies of the session and started handing them to friends for feedback and [...] "I'd give tapes to everybody. Kids would come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> say 'Nirvana was my favourite band' and I'd say 'well here, have this'". Eddie Vedder premiered two songs from the recording on January 8, 1995 during his Self-Pollution radio broadcast. The recordings quickly circulated amongst the music industry, which in turn created record label interest. A deal was eventually signed to Capitol Records, as president Gary Gersh was a personal friend of Grohl ever since he worked on Nirvana's label Geffen Records.|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have come <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E
500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around {{with a friend of}} mine and this hard-rock guy came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I {{was cutting}} the double-shuffle, and toe-and-heeling {{it in the}} [...] "rail" [...] style, Blanche danced <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> smiling, <b>and</b> said, [...] "Be on your guard; I see Cambaceres talking to Fouche, the Duke of Otranto, about us; and when Otranto turns his eyes upon a man, they bode him no good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} {{watching}} for his mistress to come back,' said Leonard; 'but she must have passed an hour ago, and she does not deserve to have him, for she never looked back for him; and he had run <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> frisking <b>and</b> making much of me, {{as if he had}} found an old friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her face {{settled in}} lines {{that were not}} girlish as she repeated: [...] "It's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go, <b>and</b> I'm going, Mart! I didn't realize {{how bad it was}} for you here--I didn't, really!" ...|$|R
500|$|Morrison's {{also contributed}} [...] "Been Down So Long", a song {{inspired}} by folk singer Richard Fariña's book Been Down So Long It Looks Like <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Furry Lewis's tune, [...] "I Will Turn Your Money Green". A conventional blues song reminiscent of earlier Doors performances, the lyrics showed depression, liberation, and sexuality owing to Morrison's potential imprisonment. He also contributed the blues number [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window". Unlike {{most of the}} other tracks, it was composed in the studio. Manzarek recalled that [...] "Jim said it was about living in Venice , in a hot room, with a hot girlfriend, and an open window, and a bad time. It could have been about Pamela Courson". L.A. Woman closes its first side with the title track, the lengthiest song on the album. Thought of as Morrison's final goodbye to Los Angeles, it communicated his mixed feelings of passion and disdain for [...] "the city of night". The lyrics feature an anagram for Morrison: [...] "Mr. Mojo Risin'".|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E
