2500|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} his {{political}} career, Hacker {{was a member of}} the Opposition, and he served as Shadow Minister of Agriculture from 1974 on. In 1980, he served as the head of the <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>party</b> leadership campaign of Martin Walker; the winner of this campaign, Herbert Attwell, later went on to win the general election in 1981, and thereby became the UK's new prime minister. [...] Hacker was nervous that Attwell would pass him over for a Cabinet post as an act of revenge for running Walker's campaign against him, but Attwell appointed Hacker to the cabinet as minister for the (fictitious) Department of Administrative Affairs. At least one news commentator of the time speculated that the appointment was actually an act of revenge, as the DAA had a reputation as [...] "a political graveyard" [...] that could end Hacker's career.|$|E
60|$|The {{influence}} of races in our early ages, {{of the church}} in our middle, and of parties in our modern history, are three great moving and modifying powers, that must be pursued and analyzed with an untiring, profound, and unimpassioned spirit, before a guiding ray can be secured. A remarkable feature of our written history is the absence in its pages {{of some of the most}} influential personages. Not one man in a thousand for instance has ever heard of Major Wildman: yet he was the soul of English politics in the most eventful period of this kingdom, and one most interesting to this age, from 1640 to 1688; and seemed more than once to hold the balance which was to decide the permanent form of our government. But he was the leader of an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>party.</b> Even, comparatively speaking, in our own times, the same mysterious oblivion is sometimes encouraged to creep over personages of great social distinction as well as political importance.|$|E

60|$|At a later period, the Saxon families, {{who fled}} from the exterminating sword of the Conqueror, {{with many of}} the Normans themselves, whom discontent and {{intestine}} feuds had driven into exile, began to rise into eminence upon the Scottish borders. They brought with them arts, both of peace and of war, unknown in Scotland; and, among their descendants, we soon number the most powerful border chiefs. Such, during the reign of the [Sidenote: 1249] last Alexander, were Patrick, earl of March, and Lord Soulis, renowned in tradition; and such were, also, the powerful Comyns, who early acquired the principal sway upon the Scottish marches. [Sidenote: 1300] In the civil wars betwixt Bruce and Baliol, all those powerful chieftains espoused the <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>party.</b> They were forfeited and exiled; and upon their ruins was founded the formidable house of Douglas. The borders, from sea to sea, were now at the devotion of a succession of mighty chiefs, whose exorbitant power threatened to place a new dynasty upon the Scottish throne. It is not my intention to trace the dazzling career of this race of heroes, whose exploits were alike formidable to the English, and to their sovereign.|$|E

50|$|Two couples met at an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>party.</b> It is {{revealed}} that {{all four of}} them are in stereotypical marriages. They get drunk, swap partners and exchange keys. A rich aunt comes from Switzerland, and after an awkward lunch with in-laws, a cuckolded husband arrives to punish his wife's infidelity, as well as the wife of an influential official who comes to save what she sees as her daughter's slumming. The plot gets complicated with many misunderstandings, and it can be regarded as a farce. The order is restored happily, even though everyone did not get what they wanted.|$|E
5000|$|Porter was {{a senior}} sea captain in the employ of the British East India Company, working mainly as a whaler.

The migration may also have been influenced by his cousin, Captain William Field Porter (born, 1784), who had financed and led what was to be an <b>unsuccessful</b> <b>party</b> of settlers to Port Lincoln in two ships, nine months earlier. He helped his cousin set up one of the first shipping services operating out of Port Lincoln and Port Adelaide to Australian and New Zealand ports.|$|E

50|$|The {{procedural}} {{system of}} Germany {{is based on}} a highly active role of the judge or the judges.

Each side can (in higher courts must) require the services of one or several attorneys. They present facts and evidence for their version of the case of their own accord and without the help of the judge, who then makes his judgement independently.
