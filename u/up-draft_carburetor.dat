50|$|The Model AA Ford {{is powered}} by the same 201-cubic-inch (3.3 L) engine I4 engine that the Model A Ford used. The engine {{produced}} a maximum of forty horsepower at 2,200 rpm. The engine featured an <b>up-draft</b> <b>carburetor,</b> six-volt generator, 2-blade fan, mechanical water pump, mechanical oil pump, electric starter and four-row radiator. All of these features were identical to the Model A Ford except the radiator. The engine could also be crank started if necessary by a hand crank that is inserted {{through a hole in}} the radiator shell. The Model AA was based on a chassis that was similar in design to the Model A Ford, except it was substantially larger and heavier to accommodate the work this truck was designed for.|$|E
