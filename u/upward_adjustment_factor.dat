40|$|Preexisting distortions in factor markets {{complicate the}} {{estimation}} of the social welfare effects of regulatory interventions. The existence of these tax interaction effects (TIEs) suggests that general equilibrium (GE) approaches {{should be used to}} evaluate regulatory policies. However, formal GE analysis is not always feasible for the numerous environmental regulations proposed by federal, state, and local agencies. The question addressed in this paper is whether an empirically based ‘‘rule of thumb’’ <b>upward</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>factor</b> is appropriate to properly scale social cost estimates in environmental policy. We argue that such rule of thumb adjustments are significantly less reliable than estimates based on a detailed general equilibrium analysis because of the uncertainty about both the magnitude and sign of the social cost distortion. In addition to addressing this question, the paper gives an overview of TIEs and their relevance to environmental policy.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Dutch Bicycle Master Plan, an {{analysis}} of road, traffic and accident characteristics was performed on ten selected cycle routes. The principal question was: is the 'separation' of cyclists (keeping them off the main roadway) safer than 'mixing' cyclists (allowing them on the roadway) ? To date, road stretches and intersections have always been studied separately, without considering {{the relationship between the}} two. In contrast, this study is based on selected routes. These combine individual routes that underlie a more or less similar trip motive, as defined by the road authorities. It was noted that there were hardly any data available on moped and cycle intensities, and on the intensities and speed of motorised traffic. These routes were therefore subjected to measurements. Statistical methods of analysis were used, due to the complex relationships between the various characteristics. On the basis of the collected material, it proved to be impossible to draw any conclusions on potential differences in risk between 'mixed' and 'separate' traffic. It is recommended to nevertheless apply corrections to the <b>upward</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors,</b> if necessary on the basis of estimates. In addition, it is recommended to add further data, and to perform other analyses...|$|R

30|$|The ROS <b>adjustment</b> <b>factor</b> is a FARSITE {{parameter}} {{commonly used}} by fire managers {{to adjust the}} outputs based on expert knowledge of the expected fire behaviour for each fuel model (FM) class. Since no data is available regarding {{the distribution of the}} ROS <b>adjustment</b> <b>factor,</b> we used eight wildfires that occurred in Portugal between 2003 and 2005 to estimate the uncertainty PDFs for the ROS <b>adjustment</b> <b>factor</b> parameter through an inverse modelling approach (Refsgaard et al. 2007). The impact of uncertainty of this parameter was assessed given the observed discrepancy between simulated fire spread and satellite thermal active fires, for eight wildfires (data not shown). Each <b>adjustment</b> <b>factor</b> was varied between 0.33 and 3 for each fuel model class independently, corresponding to a threefold decrease or increase in fire spread rate, respectively.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{process in}} construction cost estimation {{is the appropriate}} adjustment of costs to reflect project location. Unfortunately, location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> from adjacent locations, {{referred to as the}} nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> was evaluated against an established cost index database and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors.</b> When compared with NN and other alternative location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25 - 40 % reduction of the median absolute error. This work contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a more accurate method for estimating location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> which can improve cost estimates for construction projects where location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> do not currently exist.

If these adjustments are not accurate, the PTAs will be biased and the genetic progress will be less than expected. <b>Adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> are usually estimated from solutions of a linear model. Some covariance components are needed to use in an animal model. However, the effect of different variance component estimates when estimating <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> has not been studied. The goals for this study were: (1) estimate covariance components {{to be used in}} mixed model equations; (2) test for the effect of interactions of milking frequency with parity, covariates of days in milk, and covariates of days pregnant; (3) estimate <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> to correct yield records from 3 x to 2 x; (4) evaluate the effect of covariance component estimates on estimating <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> to correct yield records from 3 x to 2 x.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundAdjustment of {{body weights}} for {{systematic}} environmental effects such as dam age and litter size {{is essential for}} accurate prediction of breeding values in meat sheep and often accomplished by pre-adjusting records using simple multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors,</b> which are derived as ratios of least-squares means of weights of lambs in target and reference classes. However, increasing use of multibreed genetic evaluations that incorporate data from both purebred and commercial flocks has generated concerns regarding the ability of simple additive or multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> to properly correct for environmental effects in flocks that differ widely in mean performance. Thus, consistency of <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> across flocks and systematic effects {{of the level of}} flock performance on these factors were evaluated using data from the US National Sheep Improvement Program. MethodsWe used birth and weaning weights of lambs from 29 flocks that had at least 500 records per flock and represented several terminal-sire sheep breeds. Effects of lamb sex, dam age class and litter size on birth weights, and of dam age class and combined effects of type of birth and rearing on weaning weights were evaluated. Interactions between these effects and flock were assessed. Bias associated with different adjustment protocols was evaluated for high- and low-performance flocks. ResultsEffects of litter size and differences between yearling and adult dams varied (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) among flocks. For weaning weights, additive <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> were not associated with the level of flock performance, but multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> were strongly and inversely related to flock means for weaning weights (W). Flock-specific <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> (F[*]=[*]αWβ) reduced bias in adjusted weaning weights associated with differences in flock performance. By contrast, simple multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> were appropriate to adjust birth weights. ConclusionsDifferences in weaning weights among single, twin, and triplet lambs were inversely related to the level of flock performance. Use of simple multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> led to <b>adjustment</b> bias when applied across flocks with large differences in mean performance. This bias was reduced by using additive <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> or multiplicative factors that were derived as simple exponential functions of flock means for weaning weight...|$|R
