40|$|Ultrasonic waves form {{a useful}} {{nondestructive}} evaluation (NDE) probe for determining physical, microstructural, and mechanical {{properties of materials}} and parts. Noncontacting laser ultrasonic methods are desired for remote measurements and on-line manufacture process monitoring. Researchers at the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) have developed a versatile new method for detection of ultrasonic motion at surfaces. This method directly images, {{without the need for}} scanning, the surface distribution of subnanometer ultrasonic motion. By eliminating the need for scanning over large areas or complex parts, the inspection process can be greatly speeded up. Examples include measurements on parts with complex geometries through resonant ultrasound spectroscopy and of the properties of sheet materials determined through anisotropic elastic Lamb wave propagation.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in detecting {{objects such as}} landmines shallowly buried in loose earth or sand. Various techniques involving microwave, acoustic, thermal and magnetic sensors {{have been used to}} detect such objects. Acoustic and microwave sensors have shown promise, especially if used together. In most cases, the sensor package is scanned over an area to eventually build up an image or map of anomalies. We are proposing an alternate, acoustic method that directly provides an image of acoustic waves in sand or soil, and their interaction with buried objects. The INEEL Laser <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Camera</b> utilizes dynamic holography within photorefractive recording materials. This permits one to image and demodulate acoustic waves on surfaces in real time, without scanning. A video image is produced where intensity is directly and linearly proportional to surface motion. Both specular and diffusely reflecting surfaces can be accomodated and surface motion as small as 0. 1 nm can be quantitatively detected. This system was used to directly image acoustic surface waves in sand as well as in solid objects. Waves as frequencies of 16 kHz were generated using modified acoustic speakers. These waves were directed through sand toward partially buried objects. The sand container was not on a vibration isolation table, but sat on the lab floor. Interaction of wavefronts with buried objects showed reflection, diffraction and interference effects that could provide clues to location and characteristics of buried objects. Although results are preliminary, success in this effort suggests that this method could be applied to detection of buried landmines or other near-surface items such as pipes and tanks...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) {{to check the}} integrity of materials in different fields of industry has increased significantly in recent years. Actually, industry demands NDT methods that allow fast (preferably non-contact) detection and localization of early-stage defects with easy-to-interpret results, so that even a non-expert field worker can carry out the testing. The main challenge is to combine {{as many of these}} requirements in one single technique. The concept of acoustic cameras, developed for low frequency NDT, meets most of the above mentioned requirements. These cameras make use of an array of microphones to visualize noise sources by estimating the Direction Of Arrival (DOA) of the impinging sound waves. Until now, however, because of limitations in frequency range and lack of integrated nonlinear post-processing, acoustic camera systems have never been used for the localization of incipient damage. The goal of the current paper is to numerically investigate the capabilities of locating incipient damage by measuring the nonlinear airborne emission of the defect using a non-contact ultrasonic sensor array. We will consider a simple case of a sample with a single near-surface crack and prove that after efficient excitation of the defect sample, the nonlinear defect responses can be detected by a uniform linear sensor array. These responses are then used to determine the location of the defect by means of three different DOA algorithms. The results obtained in this study can be considered as a first step towards the development of a nonlinear <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>camera</b> system, comprising the ultrasonic sensor array as hardware and nonlinear post-processing and source localization software. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Two {{challenges}} for rescue robots are to detect {{human beings and}} to have an accurate positioning system. In indoor positioning, GPS receivers cannot {{be used due to}} the reflections or attenuation caused by obstacles. To detect human beings, sensors such as thermal <b>camera,</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> and microphone can be embedded on the rescue robot. The drawback of these sensors is the detection range. These sensors have to be in close proximity to the victim in order to detect it. UWB technology is then very helpful to ensure precise localization of the rescue robot inside the disaster site and detect human beings. We propose a new method to both detect human beings and locate the rescue robot at the same time. To achieve these goals we optimize the design of UWB pulses based on B-splines. The spectral effectiveness is optimized so the symbols are easier to detect and the mitigation with noise is reduced.

These wireless sensors reduce the wiring complexity and mounting costs in the automotive industry while substituting signal wires by radio communication.

For this purpose, we developed a low computational-cost method of detecting and tracking a parking spot in real time using 1 -D OF measurements around the vehicle as well as the vehicle's longitudinal velocity and steering angle.

This is accomplished by emulating the rodent’s specialized navigation and spatial awareness brain cells, as found {{in and around the}} hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, at a higher level of abstraction than previously used neural representations. Specifically, the focus of this research will be on replicating place cells, boundary cells, head direction cells, and grid cells using data structures and logic driven by each cell’s interpreted behavior. This method is used along with a unique multimodal source model for place cell activation to create a cognitive map.

This report provides a record of data acquired during a series of experiments designed to measure the leaching rate of salt walls in a labscale simulated cavern, as well as discussion of the data. These results should be of value to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models used to simulate leaching applications. Three experiments were run in the transparent 89 -cm (35 -inch) ID diameter vessel previously used for several related projects. Diagnostics included tracking the salt wall dissolution rate using <b>ultrasonics,</b> an underwater <b>camera</b> to view pre-installed markers, and pre- and post-test weighing and measuring salt blocks that comprise the walls. In addition, profiles of the local brine/water conductivity and temperature were acquired at three locations by traversing conductivity probes to map out the mixing of injected raw water with the surrounding brine. The data are generally as expected, with stronger dissolution when the salt walls were exposed to water with lower salt saturation, and overall reasonable wall shape profiles. However, there are significant block-to-block variations, even between neighboring salt blocks, so the averaged data are considered more useful for model validation. The remedial leach tests clearly showed that less mixing and longer exposure time to unsaturated water led {{to higher levels of}} salt wall dissolution.

The tanks contain high level waste, are buried underground, and have only two access ports to an annular space between the tank and the secondary concrete vault. A specialized remote system was proposed to provide both a visual surveillance and ultrasonic thickness measurements of the tank walls.

40|$|This Innovation Analysis Report 2014 builds upon two {{previous}} technology assessments in project 10. 10. 02 pursuing the usability evaluation of new display and interaction technology at a potential multimodal ATCO workplace within the TMA/ACC environment. Additional functionalities within the ATM systems and heightened demands for the ATS operator {{due to an}} increased number of traffic justify the need to scout and analyse new market trends and innovations available within the upcoming years. The current speed of innovations brings out many devices to support the operators with their task in safely separating traffic and which could potentially be used within the TMA/ACC environment. Working with devices like touch screens, tablets etc. in daily life, raises expectations on the end users side for the handling and {{look and feel of}} modern technical systems and HMIs. This report documents the technology assessments for Motion Caption/Sense Technologies, Mobility, NFC, eye tracking and the discussion outcomes of a moderated expert workshop providing insight into the potential usability and availability of multimodality for the ATCO workplace. The approach taken is a combination of literature reviews and assessments (experiments and workshop). The results are used for underlining the benefits of the technologies, and provide guidelines for deploying them. Indra assessed the accuracy and efficiency of new CWP complementary technologies such as Motion Caption/Sense Technologies, Mobility and Near Field Communication (NFC). The Motion Caption/Sense Technologies offer a promising interaction that allows the CWP to be aware of movements of the controller without the need that the user touches the CWP itself. <b>Ultrasonic</b> sensors, <b>Cameras</b> and LEAP Motion devices were assessed to test the real reliability of the devices. Mobility complements the interaction experience for the controller and extends the possibilities of multi-touch indirect interaction, which have been assessed in earlier studies by Indra. NFC allows the CWP to read smart tokens via radio frequency. Thales was involved in the innovation analysis of Eye tracker technology in the ATC environment, which has rapidly evolved between 2011 and 2013. The size and cost of the sensors has been reduced to offer solutions compatible with the public market. The major challenge of the eye tracking equipment is to be less sensitive to user movement and to cover the entire surface of the ATC display. The accuracy is compatible with the selection of a track label, and can thus be used as additional interaction mean to the mouse pointer. In addition, the technology seems to have a strong impact on the duration required for interacting with the HMI. In order to best support the operators (alerts, predictions, coordinations…), using the eye tracker technology could be a solution for reducing the time required for inputting data such as clearances. The objective of the assessment is to compare the usability for performing actions using the mouse or using the eye tracker. The test case specially evaluates the usability for pointing an aircraft and inputting data. In order to confirm the usability of the eye tracker, new functions were measured for SESAR projects that would like to implement an eye tracker system in order to support the human system dialog. The Workshop “Future Multimodal Controller Working Positions – Application-Related Scenarios and HMI Concept” took place from 16 th to 17 th of September at Braunschweig site of DLR. Ten participants, mostly project partners and an invited industrial design expert had an intense moderated discussion on future concepts for the CWP. In two consecutive sessions selected interaction technologies (eye tracking, automatic speech recognition and multi-touch) were discussed with respect to their availability within the scope of SESAR, as well as their usability to support a multimodal ATCO-system-interaction in an exemplary ATC scenario “Non RBT AC Crossing Sector”. Overall, the assessment results offer a valuable baseline for further developments and studies including potential evaluations with controllers to compare the solutions and assess the impacts on the CWP use and on the KPIs. Integrating several of these technologies on the same position could be the solution for building a new HMI concept to face the future challenges of ATM...|$|R
40|$|Coarse-grained beaches, such as pure gravel (PG), mixed {{sand-gravel}} (MSG) and composite (CSG) beaches, can {{be considered}} {{as one of the most}} resilient non-cohesive morpho-sedimentary coastal environments to energetic wave forcing (e. g., storms). The hydraulically-rough and permeable nature of gravel (D 50 > 2 mm), together with the steep (reflective) beach face, provide efficient mechanisms of wave energy dissipation in the swash zone and provide a natural means of coastal defence. Despite their potential for shore protection very little is known about the response of these environments during high energetic wave conditions. Field measurements of sediment transport and hydrodynamics on coarse-grained beaches are difficult, because there are few instruments capable of taking direct measurements in an energetic swash zone in which large clasts are moving, and significant morphological changes occur within a short period of time. Remote sensing methods emerge in this context as the most appropriate solution for these types of field measurement. A new remote sensing method, based around a mid-range (50 m) 2 D laser-scanner was developed, which allows the collection of swash zone hydrodynamics (e. g., vertical and horizontal runup position, swash depth and velocity) and bed changes on wave-by-wave time scale. This instrument allowed the complete coverage of the swash zone on several coarse-grained beaches with a vertical accuracy of approximately  0. 015 m and an average horizontal resolution of 0. 07 m. The measurements performed with this new methodology are within the accuracy of traditional field techniques (e. g. video <b>cameras,</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> bed-level sensors or dGPS). Seven field experiments were performed between March 2012 and January 2014 on six different coarse-grained beaches (Loe Bar, Chesil, Slapton, Hayling Island, Westward Ho! and Seascale), with each deployment comprising the 2 D laser-scanner together with complementary in-situ instrumentation (e. g., pressure transducer, ADV current meter). These datasets were used to explore the hydrodynamics and morphological response of the swash zone of these different environments under different energetic hydrodynamic regimes, ranging from positive, to zero, to negative freeboard regimes. With reference to the swash zone dynamics under storms with positive freeboard regimes (when runup was confined to the foreshore) it was found that extreme runup has an inverse relationship with the surf scaling parameter (= 2 Hs /gTptan 2 ). The highest vertical runup excursions were found on the steepest beaches (PG beaches) and under long-period swell, while lower vertical runup excursions where linked to short-period waves and beaches with intermediate and dissipative surf zones, thus demonstrating that the contrasting degree of wave dissipation observed in the different types of surf zones is a key factor that control the extreme runup on coarse-grained beaches. Contrasting morphological responses were observed on the different coarse-grained beaches as a result of the distinct swash zone hydrodynamics. PG beaches with narrow surf zone presented an asymmetric morphological response during the tide cycle (accretion during the rising and erosion during the falling tide) as a result of beach step adjustments to the prevailing hydrodynamics. On dissipative MSG and CSG beaches the morphological response was limited due to the very dissipative surf zone, while on an intermediate CSG beach significant erosion of the beach face and berm was observed during the entire tide cycle as a result of the absence of moderate surf zone wave dissipation and beach step dynamics. Fundamental processes related to the link between the beach step dynamics and the asymmetrical morphological response during the tidal cycle were for the first time measured under energetic wave conditions. During the rising tide the onshore shift of the breaking point triggers the onshore translation of the step and favors accretion (step deposit development), while during the falling tide the offshore translation of the wave breaking point triggers retreat of the step and favours backwash sediment transport (erosion of the step deposit). Under zero and negative freeboard storm regimes (when runup exceeds the crest of the barrier or foredune), field measurements complimented by numerical modelling (Xbeach-G) provide clear evidence that the presence of a bimodal wave spectrum enhances the vertical runup and can increase the likelihood of the occurrence of overtopping and overwash events over a gravel barrier. Most runup equations (e. g., Stockdon et al., 2006) used to predict the thresholds for storm impact regime (e. g., swash, overtopping and overwash) on barriers lack adequate characterisation of the full wave spectra; therefore, they may miss important aspects of the incident wave field, such as wave bimodality. XBeach-G allows a full characterization of the incident wave field and is capable of predicting the effect of wave spectra bimodality on the runup, thus demonstrating that is a more appropriate tool for predicting the storm impact regimes on gravel barriers. Regarding the definition of storm impact regimes on gravel barriers, it was found that wave period and wave spectra bimodality are key parameters that can affect significantly the definition of the thresholds for these different regimes. While short-period waves dissipate most of their energy before reaching the swash zone (due to breaking) and produce short runup excursions, long-period waves arrive at the swash zone with enhanced heights (due to shoaling) and break at the edge of the swash, thus promoting large runup excursions. When offshore wave spectrum presents a bimodal shape, the wave transformation on shallow waters favours the long period peak (even if the short-period peak is the most energetic offshore) and large runup excursions occur. XBeach-G simulations show that the morphological response of fine gravel barriers is distinct from coarse gravel barriers under similar overtopping conditions. While on coarser barriers overtopping regimes are expected to increase the crest elevation and narrow the barrier, on fine barriers sedimentation occurs on the back of the barrier and in the lower beach face. Such different sedimentation patterns are attributed to the different hydraulic conductivity of the different sediment sizes which control the amount of flow dissipation (due to infiltration) and, therefore, the capacity of the flow to transport sediment across and over the barrier crest. The present findings have significantly improved our conceptual understanding of the response of coarse-grained beaches during storms. A new field technique to measure swash dynamics in the field was developed during this thesis and has great potential to become widely used in a variety of coastal applications. EPSR...|$|R
