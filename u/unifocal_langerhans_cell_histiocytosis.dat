Clinical Features A 6 -year-old girl had thigh pain of insidious onset that would wake her at night. Orthopedic testing reproduced local pain, and imaging revealed an osteolytic process in the femoral diaphysis with laminated periosteal reaction. Intervention and Outcome The patient was referred for further evaluation; <b>unifocal</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> was found at biopsy and spontaneous healing subsequently reported.

30|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} is a {{group of}} idiopathic disorders characterized by proliferation of specialized, bone marrow–derived Langerhans cells and mature eosinophils. <b>Unifocal</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> presents as a single osteolytic lesion, usually affecting long or flat bones. Multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis shows osteolytic lesions involving the calvaria, the sella turcica, the mandible, the vertebrae, and/or the long bones of the upper extremities. Although lesions typically appear granulomatous, with a reactive background of macrophages, eosinophils, multinucleated giant cells, and T cells, the key to diagnosis is identification of pathologic Langerhans cells. The Birbeck granule is their distinctive ultrastructural hallmark [17, 18]. In our case, no Birbeck granules were demonstrated, therefore Langerhans cell histiocytosis was ruled out.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} rare {{presentation}} of <b>unifocal</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> (LCH) simulating a limbal papilloma. Case report: A 24 -year-old man {{presented with a}} limbal mass in his left eye which had initially been suspected to be a papilloma based on clinical findings. The mass was excised and a histopathological diagnosis of "acute bullous inflammation with granulation tissue" was made. The lesion relapsed 10 months later which necessitated repeat resection along with corneoscleral patch grafting. Histopathological studies of the excised lesion led to a final diagnosis of LCH. Conclusion: To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the second report of a rare presentation of LCH in the limbus which recurred after excision of the primary mass. The recurrent lesion was diagnosed based on histopathology and managed accordingly...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the findings and outcomes in eosinophilic granuloma (<b>unifocal</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> [LCH]) of the orbit, and {{to explain the}} paradox of aggressive bone destruction responsive to minimal intervention. Methods: Retrospective, consecutive, interventional case series of patients treated from 1985 through 2001. Minimum inclusion criteria were demonstration of CD 1 a positivity or Birbeck granules, treatment by a single surgeon, systemic evaluation by a pediatric oncologist, and follow-up of 12 months. A pathogenetic construct was assembled from general LCH concepts and the specific orbital findings. Results: Seven patients met study criteria. All were male, 2 to 16 years of age. All had eyelid or forehead swelling and osteolytic defects, with symptoms of 2 to 6 weeks ’ duration. All underwent incisional biopsy, with frozen-section exam-ination suggestive of LCH in 6 of 7 cases. The 2 earliest patients received low-dose irradiation after simple biopsy. The 5 most recent patients had subtotal curettage {{at the time of}} biopsy; 4 of 5 received simultaneous intralesional cortico-steroid injection. In all cases, systemic evaluation showed no other focus of LCH, reossification was timely, and no local recurrence or additional focus was noted in follow-up of 1 to 17 years. Conclusions: Transient immune dysfunction may provoke the cytokine-mediated proliferation of pathologic Langerhans cells within the hematopoietic marrow of the anterolateral frontal bone. These cells cause osteolysis through elabora-tion of interleukin- 1 and prostaglandin E 2. Corticosteroids can inhibit the mediators. We recommend incisional biopsy, frozen-section provisional diagnosis, subtotal curettage, intralesional corticosteroid instillation, postoperative systemic evaluation, and long-term follow-up.

40|$|Objective: <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> is {{an unusual}} {{disorder}} of unknown etiology with heterogeneous clinical behaviors and variable outcomes. It can involve one or more organs or systems, but to our best knowledge, parotid glands involvement in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> is extremely rare in English literature. Method: We report a 13 -month-old girl who presented with bilateral parotid swelling as presenting symptom. She was misdiagnosed for 4 months, but final diagnosis was multisystem <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis.</b> Result: After being treated for 18 months, the patient acquired complete remission and attained similar growth status to other healthy children. Conclusion: <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> may involve any organ; in patients with parotid enlargement, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> {{should be kept in}} mind in the differential diagnoses.

40|$|Objective – <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> is a {{rare disease}} {{characterized}} by monoclonal proliferation and infiltration of organs by large mono-nuclear cells. Here we report a case of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> with non-classic perianal presentation and diabetes insipidus.
