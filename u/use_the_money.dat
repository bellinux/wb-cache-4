5|$|His {{refusal to}} accept {{anything}} short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid {{with the news that}} López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. PedroII turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to build elementary schools.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|At the plantation, Northup meets Patsey, {{a favored}} slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps {{regularly}} rapes and abuses. Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail {{a letter to his}} friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E

As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an {{upstanding}} member of the community, would be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E

5|$|In October 1899, Rhodes, aged 22, married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe, {{who lived}} in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior. They lived in a farmhouse, shared with other people, at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton. On 25 August 1902 his wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, their only child. Rhodes found Yorkshire's {{dealings}} with money to be ungenerous; following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire, as was their custom, paid only one-third of the money to Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf, only paying out the interest. Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to build a stone house at Marsh, Huddersfield, which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912. He lived there until 1956.|$|E

During their fight, Spider-Man unsuccessfully tries to find out who hired him before finally bringing the building down and defeating the Shocker.|$|E
5|$|Raimi and Campbell grew up together, {{and have}} been friends from a young age. The duo {{directed}} several low-budget Super 8 mm film projects together. Several were comedies, including Clockwork and It's Murder!. Shooting a suspense scene in It's Murder! inspired Raimi to approach {{a career in the}} horror genre, and after researching horror cinema at drive-in theaters, Raimi was set on directing a horror film. The idea was to shoot a short film first, which would attract the interest of producers, and then <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> gained from that to shoot a full-length project. The short film that Raimi created was called Within the Woods. It was produced for $1,600, but for The Evil Dead, Raimi needed over $100,000.|$|E

5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to buy a new television set.|$|E
5|$|Novelist {{and social}} {{commentator}} Walter Besant proposed a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This {{coincided with a}} project by the philanthropist businessman, Edmund Hay Currie to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from the winding up of the 'Beaumont Trust', together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing {{an eclectic mix of}} populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold for classes in 1892, and by 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London was introduced. In 1931, the building was destroyed by fire, but the Draper's Company, major donors to the original scheme, invested more to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary's College in December 1934. A new 'People's Palace' was constructed, in 1937, by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, in St Helen's Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.|$|E
