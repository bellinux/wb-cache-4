25|$|One of the {{economic}} problems that the citizens of Guwahati have to put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> the hike in prices of many essentials, chiefly vegetable, poultry and fish. The prices of these commodities keep escalating at an inordinate rate because of which the buyers {{find it difficult to}} buy these items. Vegetables are transported into Assam from West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra and Meghalaya and the truckers en route have to pay considerable amount of money as tax at various check posts. It is one of the causes of rise in prices of vegetables in the markets of Guwahati. The prices of locally available vegetables and fruits undergo large markup because of transportation expenses grounds, besides intra-State check posts taxes. In addition to these, the wholesale dealers as well as the retail sellers augment the prices of the commodities according to their own desires. The prices of poultry, mainly chicken that reach the city markets from places like Chaygaon and Barpeta have been soaring rapidly because of similar factors. There has been steep rise in the prices of fishes as well, the prominent varieties of which being Rohu ("Rou"), Catla ("Bahu"), Walking catfish ("Magur") and Monopterus ("Kuchia") among many others.|$|E

But the best they can come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> an assistant government whip". Tony Lloyd, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, called the rebellion a [...] "bit of a sideshow", and Emily Thornberry MP called Brown the [...] "best qualified" [...] to lead Britain through the economic crisis of 2008. The Labour Party said that it had received letters from a small number of MPs asking why no nomination papers had been released. David Miliband continued to show his support for Brown {{in the face of the}} challenge in September, as did Business Secretary John Hutton, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and Chief Whip Geoff Hoon.|$|E

[...] Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy – [...] "what {{you get to see}} on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing." [...] The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is their only appearances in the series.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|... "Mutt Romney Blues" [...] is a three-chord, {{acoustic}} Delta blues song. Drawing {{parallels between}} the Mitt Romney dog incident and his political [...] "plans and schemes", the song criticizes Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and is sung {{from the perspective of}} the Romney family's dog. Cooder was inspired by Al Sharpton's quote [...] "how he treated his dog tells you a lot about him", and found the dog to be [...] "a useful character... when you view it in the light of the blues. Like a servant, a yardman, someone very low in the social order. He's just begging to be let down [...]" [...] Bud Scoppa of Uncut characterizes the song as [...] "the musical equivalent of a political cartoon". [...] "Brother Is Gone" [...] is poignantly styled as a sad folktale and features a haunting mandolin riff, a rueful tone, and wounded vocals. Its lyrics attribute the conservative Koch Brothers to the Deal with the Devil myth, which Cooder adapted from Robert Johnson's [...] "Cross Road Blues". The lyrics cite their [...] "crossroads" [...] as [...] "the prairie town of Wichita", where Koch Industries is headquartered. He said in an interview that [...] "the only logical explanation for the Brothers I could come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is,</b> they made their deal at the crossroads with Satan." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek cites it as [...] "among the finest songs 's written." ...|$|E

Will is puzzled to hear that a [...] "strawberry blond hair woman, with brown eyes" [...] still loves him, and he reveals to Psychic Sue that he is gay. Will tells Grace of what occurred with Psychic Sue, which leads to Grace [...] "tripping" [...] over the steps in the kitchen, and her saying [...] "I just broke my grandmother's China." [...] Will reacts to what Psychic Sue told him. He also learns that his parents send him a package containing photos of his deceased dog, Daisy, who had [...] "thick coat of strawberry blond hair." [...] Will revisits Psychic Sue with the intention of knowing about his future love life. She tells Will that the man he will end <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> named [...] "Jack". Will tells Grace about his return visit to Psychic Sue and how he will end up with someone named [...] "Jack". Will is frightened of the idea that he and his friend Jack, also gay, will end up together. Will finally tells Jack what the psychic said, which horrifies Jack, but Will and Jack realize they are meant to stay together, just in the non-romantic relationship they have always had.|$|E
500|$|Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst {{found that}} [...] "man cannot live by {{composition}} alone"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 {{he was appointed}} first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the [...] "White Viennese Band", conducted by Stanislas Wurm. Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for [...] "the Worm" [...] or any other light orchestra [...] "a wicked and loathsome waste of time". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted {{that some of the}} music was [...] "trashy" [...] but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: [...] "To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely {{to the fact that he}} has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>is</b> something very like the same old story." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fifth, By these words, we {{find the}} Pharisee, not only appropriating {{conversion}} to himself, but rejoicing in that conversion: [...] "God, I thank thee," [...] saith he, [...] "that I am not as other men"; which saying of his, gives us {{to see that he}} gloried in his conversion; he made no doubt at all of his state, but lived in the joy of the safety that he supposed his soul by his conversion to be in. Oh! thanks to God, says he, I am not in the state of sin, death, and damnation, as the unjust, and this Publican is. But a strong delusion! to trust to the spider's web, and to think, that a few of the most fine of the works of the flesh, would be sufficient to bear up the soul in, at, and under the judgment of God.
