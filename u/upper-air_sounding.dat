Using thunderstorm occurrence and precipitation observations for the period 1948 – 77, along with automated lightning strike data for the period 1986 – 96, it was possible to classify convective days as either ‘‘dry’ ’ or ‘‘wet’ ’ for several stations in the Pacific Northwest.

Although the contiguous areas of cold cloudiness associated with tropical wave troughs are large and long lived, the underlying precipitation structure is most frequently small, isolated convection from mixed-phase clouds. This mismatch in instantaneous cold cloudiness area versus radar-observed precipitation area in-dicates differences in the rate and nature of evolution between the mesoscale anvil cloud and the underlying precipitating portion of the cloud.

To mitigate limitations in the rawinsonde dataset due to missing and bad wind observations, a procedure was developed to combine profiler and sonde winds to produce an integrated, high-quality, <b>upper-air</b> <b>sounding</b> dataset. In addition to improving the overall quality of the winds, this procedure eliminates several data gaps in the sonde dataset. For example, below 800 hPa the amount of bad and missing wind data is reduced from about 45 % to 20 % at the land-based ISS sites. This paper describes the procedure for combining sonde and profiler winds into a single, coherent merged dataset. Examining the impact of this merger upon various atmospheric analyses, the authors find that inclusion of profiler winds results in some substantial changes in the analyses, particularly on daily to weekly timescales. To assess whether these changes are an improvement, budget-derived rainfall estimates from analyses with and without profiler winds are compared to Special Sensor Microwave/Imager satellite-based estimates.

During COARE, sounding data were collected from 29 sites with Vaisala-manufactured systems and 13 sites with VIZ-manufactured systems. A recent publication has documented the characteristics of the humidity errors at the Vaisala sites and a procedure to correct them. This study extends that work by describing the nature of the VIZ humidity errors and their correction scheme. The corrections, which are largest in lower-tropospheric levels, generally increase the moisture in the Vaisala sondes and decrease it in the VIZ sondes. Use of the corrected humidity data gives a much different perspective on the characteristics of convection during COARE. For example, application of a simple cloud model shows that the peak in convective mass flux shifts from about 88 N with the uncorrected data to just south of the equator with corrected data, which agrees better with the diagnosed vertical motion and observed rainfall. Also, with uncorrected data the difference in mean convective available potential energy (CAPE) between Vaisala and VIZ sites is over 700 J kg 21; with the correction, both CAPEs are around; 1300 J kg 21, which is consistent with a generally uniform warm pool SS...|$|E

The {{characteristics of the}} environmental conditions {{for the development of}} QSCCs were described through a comparison with those for no-rain cases. We identified 4133 QSCCs over the Japanese major islands. By compiling numerous QSCC samples, the horizontal scales of QSCCs with a circular shape are about 20 km on average with a maximum of 72 km, indicating that warm-season QSCCs in Japan are meso-β-scale phenomena. The analyses of the environmental conditions for the QSCC and no-rain cases showed that the amount of moisture in the lower layer controls the stability condition {{for the development of the}} QSCCs, and that the magnitudes of the wind shear and the helicity in the lower troposphere distinguish the kinematic environments for the development of the QSCCs. An increase in the middle-level moisture leads to a larger amount of precipitable water vapour in the QSCC environments, suggesting that atmospheric moistening before the development stage of convection plays an important role in the development of the QSCCs. Additionally, the precipitation intensity has a higher correlation with the convective instability, whereas the precipitation area correlates with the shear intensity. A comparison between slower- and faster-moving CCs indicated that the precipitation intensity of the slower-moving CCs is stronger.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{potential}} parameters, {{as a result of}} the <b>upper-air</b> <b>sounding</b> with radiosonde and of the dual polarization radar for detecting hailstorms. The data were collected during the 2012 summer consisting of 12 hail and 1129 no-hail rainstorms of seven studied dates from April to May, 2012. They were analyzed to discern the character of hail and use them as data for detecting hail echoes and for severe weather forecast in upper Thailand. On the day of hail, the instability indices were high enough to contribute to its formation. The following indices include Lifted Index (LI), Showalter Index (SI) and Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). LI and SI displayed the marginally instability ranged - 1 to - 4. In the case of CAPE, it could reach the extreme instability (CAPE > 2500 J/kg) and also came with the large updraft speed. TITAN software (Thunderstorm Identification, Tracking, Analysis and Nowcasting) was also applied for comparing rainstorms with hailstorms. The significant seven echo characteristics included storm period, speed, mean-maximum reflectivity in the horizontal polarization (ZH), area, volume and mass. Based on the character and frequency distributions in summer, hailstorms had greater values of storm duration, area, volume, mass, speed and highest reflectivity than individual rainstorms. Besides, the mean reflectivity of the storms was a negligible factor to identify the type of storm. For the case study on hail by determining polarimetric radar measurement at S-band across Chiang Maun, Northern Thailand, radar signatures with EDGE software showed that the hail was detected 100 % during its falling. It also presented as followings: Vertically integrated liquid (VIL) exceeding 100 kg/m 2, ZH over 60 dBZ near the surface and ETOP greater than 17 km. Differential reflectivity (ZDR) of rain-hail mixtures almost reached zero. In addition, the coincidental values of correlation coefficient (CC) were ranged 0. 988 and 0. 996, and specific differential phase (KDP) was ranged 2. 1 and 3. 2 deg/km...|$|E
40|$|The Maritime Continent (MC) is an {{exceedingly}} complex region {{from the perspective}} of both its meteorology and its aerosol characteristics. Convection in the MC is ubiquitous and assumes a wide variety of forms under the influence of an evolving large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic context. Understanding the interaction between convective systems and their environment, both individually and in the aggregate, requires knowledge of the dominant patterns of spatial and temporal variability. Ongoing cloud model ensemble studies require realistic perturbations to the atmospheric thermodynamic state to devise system sensitivities. Apart from modeling studies, evanescent signals in the tropical system are obscured by the underlying broad-scale meteorological variability, which if constrained could illuminate fine-scale physical processes. To this end, radiosonde observations from  2008 to 2016 are examined from three <b>upper-air</b> <b>sounding</b> sites within the MC for the purpose of exploring the dominant vertical temperature, humidity, and wind structures in the region. Principal component analysis is applied to the vertical atmospheric column to transform patterns present in radiosonde data into canonical thermodynamic and wind profiles for the MC. Both rotated and non-rotated principal components are considered, and the emerging structure functions reflect the fundamental vertical modes of short-term tropical variability. The results indicate that while there is tremendous spatial and temporal variability across the MC, the primary modes of vertical thermodynamic and wind variability in the region can be represented in a lower-dimensional subspace. In addition, the vertical structures are very similar among different sites around the region, though different structures may manifest more strongly at one location than another. The results indicate that, while different meteorology may be found {{in various parts of the}} MC at any given time, the processes themselves are remarkably consistent. The ability to represent this variability using a limited number of structure functions facilitates analysis of covariability between atmospheric structure and convective systems and also enables future systematic model-based ensemble analysis of cloud development, convection, and precipitation over the MC...|$|E
40|$|On 11 January 1998, a {{cold front}} formed in {{southeast}} China {{as a result}} of a cold-air outbreak in northeast Asia. During this synoptic development, a series of roll clouds (along the SW–NE direction) was observed in East Asia; some of the clouds stretched for over a thousand kilometers. This roll cloud formation moved southeastward across Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and Japan, and eventually into the open ocean. In order to explore the possible cause of these roll clouds the following preliminary analyses were made in this study: 1) the location of roll clouds relative to the cold front was determined in terms of the contrast between the infrared images of the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite of Japan and surface charts issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency, 2) the intrusion of the density current was identified using <b>upper-air</b> <b>soundings</b> at Taipei, and 3) the migrations of roll clouds and the cold front were judged by comparing the arrival time of the first roll cloud and the front with time series of surface meteorological variables measured at a surface station in northwest Taiwan. These observations imply that the series of roll clouds formed in association with solitary wave disturbances generated on the density current (i. e., the outflow from the cold-air break) but behind its leading edge. 1...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} on tropical storm {{systems that have}} made landfall and undergone a period of sustainability or reintensification {{have been linked to}} the synoptic environment at the time the storm restrengthened. Tropical Storm (TS) Erin is an interesting case study in that it did not take on hurricane-like structure nor reach hurricane intensity until it moved through west-central Oklahoma on 19 August 2007. This study seeks to examine the possible impact of anomalously wet soils across much of Oklahoma on the reintensification of TS Erin during {{the early morning hours of}} 19 August 2007. To determine the degree to which the antecedent soil state impacted TS Erin. s inland evolution and reintensification, analyses of the synoptic environment and the mesoscale environment/boundary layer environment is undertaken using operational and research datasets such as <b>upper-air</b> <b>soundings,</b> surface soil moisture and temperature data, and multiple products from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) mesoanalysis archive. ^ This observational assessment is complemented with numerical experiments using the Weather Research and Forecast Model, Advanced Research Version 3. 2 (WRF-ARW) to further study the role of soil moisture availability and surface fluxes that may have led to boundary layer feedback and inland reintensification. Observational analysis and model results indicate that anomalously wet conditions over the central Oklahoma region may have helped develop a regional boundary layer feedback that appears to have contributed positively to the inland reintensification of TS Erin. ...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{time and}} space {{distribution}} of upper-air observations is considered {{in connection with the}} detection and prediction of instability lines-a mesoscale phenomenon. It is shown that the optimum spacing of observational stations is not only a function of the scale of the phenomena to be detected but of observational and analytical errors as well. When these errors are considered the optimum network spacing can be determined with regard to the dimensions of the atmospheric feature requiring detection. Because actual data are lacking, inferences concerning the maximum {{time and space}} distribution of <b>upper-air</b> [...] <b>sounding</b> stations suitable for the detection of instability lines are drawn from a theoretical atmospheric model, 1...|$|R
