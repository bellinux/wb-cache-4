40|$|The {{objectives}} of the whole review were to: *Provide recommendations for the <b>uprating</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> (initially for the uprating due in October 2012). * Review the benefits system and make recommendations. Throughout the review, and particularly in looking to the future, {{we were asked to}} take into account the possible effects and impacts of the opening of the St Helena international airport (scheduled for 2016). A minimum income standard for St Helena was recommended as the basis for setting and uprating benefit levels. The introduction of a child benefit allowance was recommended to start as soon as possible. Further recommendations on the targeting of benefits, reorganisation of benefits structures and or office procedures were also made...|$|E
40|$|A key {{rationale}} {{of welfare}} reform has been to encourage people into work including attempts to activate recipients of out of work benefits, including lone parents and those with a health condition or disability. However, participants {{in both of these}} groups reported they wanted to work, but faced considerable barriers to doing so. ■■The experience of the transition from Incapacity Benefit to Employment and Support Allowance was stressful for some participants, particularly those who subsequently appealed the initial verdict. Sources of stress included: finding the process itself confusing; the waiting time involved; and unpleasant experiences of the medical or tribunal. ■■There was limited support on offer to help recipients of out of work benefits move into work. Even those participating in the Work Programme did not report that it was particularly helpful. Some respondents, including those who had moved into work since the first interview, reported receiving more intensive, personalised and targeted assistance from third sector organisations, which they found more useful. ■■Welfare reform has also aimed to manage public expenditure, through measures such as the ‘bedroom tax’ (also known as the ‘removal of the spare room subsidy’), and through limited or no <b>uprating</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> Participants reported struggling to make ends meet, particularly in a context of prices of essential items rising faster than benefits. The bedroom tax created temporary hardship for some participants, although for most this impact was mitigated through Discretionary Housing Payments. ■■The way in which the UK Government has communicated the rationale for welfare reform had a negative impact on participants, who felt unfairly tarnished by stigmatising messages about benefit claimants not wanting to work. ■■Communication of the detail of benefit changes by relevant agencies such as the Department for Work and Pensions was also cited as poor. Official correspondence was described as long, confusing, and sometimes conflicting with previous correspondence. This made it difficult for participants to understand the changes and their potential impact. ■■There was some geographical variation in access to affordable basic items, which was particularly poor in rural areas. However, this was also an issue for those in urban areas who were not within walking distance of larger and cheaper shops, due to the high expense of bus fares relative to benefit income.

50|$|CPI {{is usually}} lower, {{though this is}} due more to the {{differences}} in the calculation formulas for the indices than to the differences in coverage.

40|$|This is {{a report}} {{published}} by the Child Poverty Action Group. The cost of bringing up children is a crucial factor affecting family wellbeing and poverty. Many parents {{find it hard to}} afford the additional expense that children bring, while often having less disposable income because of caring responsibilities or care costs. In 2014, the UK economy is starting to grow after the longest period of shrinkage and stagnation in recent times. In these difficult years, families have become less able to afford an adequate living standard, as the cost of bringing up a child has risen much faster than earnings, while help from the state to cover these costs has shrunk. Although wages are now forecast to start growing again, in real terms, the <b>uprating</b> <b>of</b> family <b>benefits</b> and tax credits has been capped at a level below inflation. This means that the reduced living standards being experienced by families on low incomes is not only persisting, but could continue to get worse. In 2012, the Child Poverty Action Group and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation supported a study developing a systematic calculation of the cost of a child. This report is the second annual update of that calculation, and also assesses the changing relationship between the cost of a child and the wages and <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> families on low incomes. This year’s report also considers some of the key drivers pushing up the cost of living for families...|$|R
30|$|CSB-MIPI {{includes}} {{policy changes}} that impacted {{on the net}} disposable income of minimum income recipients, i.e. it includes changes in additional support if minimum income beneficiaries are entitled, even when this additional support is provided through a different scheme, as well as conditions tied to minimum income receipt implemented in the period 2008 –start 2012. Ideally, we would focus on those measures taken {{in response to the}} crisis (see Marchal et al. 2014 a). However, as the period under consideration is quite large, the distinction between measures that are driven by the crisis, are adjustments to a changed socio-economic context or would have been enacted anyhow, becomes more and more blurred. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of changes enacted since the onset of the crisis that were relevant for households relying on minimum income benefits. The focus is on policy changes that require actual intervention. For instance, regular <b>uprating</b> <b>of</b> the <b>benefit</b> based on an indexation mechanism is not included in the overview. In order to provide an overview as complete as possible, measures provided by the CSB-MIPI respondents were cross-checked with the OECD Benefits and Wages series (OECD 2011), the ILO/World Bank Inventory of policy responses to the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 (ILO/World Bank 2012) and MISSOC (2013). Where possible, we indicate in the main text where measures are especially unlikely to have been related to the crisis context, as per assessment of the respondent or evidence of a clear preparation before the onset of the crisis (and implemented without further modification or reference to the crisis) in secondary sources. This distinction is however more robust for the first crisis years.|$|R
40|$|Public {{effort in}} social {{expenditure}} grew in Spam during the 1980 s while in otber coun-trres there were sizeable cuts. The bistorical {{delay in the}} development of social protection and the desire to enlarge its coverage and adequacy helped to narrow the gap between the Spanisb and European welfare states. The results are a reduction of poverty and some improvements towards less inequality. How-ever, {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s the usual economic restrictions of a pertod of stagnation have led to a deep discussion about possible reductions in the process <b>of</b> <b>uprating</b> <b>benefits,</b> and abandoning the empbasis on universal and egalitarian income maintenance schemes. This has created a favourable ambience for privatiz-ation strategies and the expansion of private provisions of pensions or health care. The ideological reply suffered by most contempor-ary welfare states has thus arrived also in Spain, although the system has still not reached adulthood. The objective of this article is to examine the main trends in income distri-bution and social protection developments in Sparn, and try to foresee the potential inci-dence of social expenditure cuts...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, <b>uprating</b> <b>of</b> {{existing}} {{overhead power}} line has become a popular option for electric utilities to address increasing demand for power.

40|$|LecturePg. 105 - 120 Major <b>uprates</b> <b>of</b> process {{compressor}} train {{performance can}} be achieved utilizing the existing machinery. The following is a broad overview of a project to revamp two identical compressor trains to achieve levels well over original design flow. Significant internal modifications to an air compressor, a process compressor, and an expander have achieved most of our planned flow increase. The first train was modified in April 1986, and the second was modified in August 1986. An additional extensive <b>uprate</b> <b>of</b> our existing steam turbine driver to almost double the design power rating will push performance even beyond the envisioned maximum rate. This project was developed and managed by plant engineers. This paper documents the development, manufacturing, and startup phases of both the performance uprate {{as well as a}} seal system redesign for increased reliability. The mechanical redesign was primarily done by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Contributions from corporate specialists, after market suppliers and independent consultants were also vital to the project's success. Measures taken to ensure the performance of the contractors and confidence in the reliability of the end products are described. The mechanical performance is up to company expectations now, but not without first overcoming a few obstacles. Actual operating rates are beyond expectations, primarily due to the effect of liquid carryover into the process compressor. Troubleshooting and performance testing techniques are described...|$|R
