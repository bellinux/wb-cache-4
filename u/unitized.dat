40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{longitudinal}} case {{study was to investigate}} the progressive development of <b>unitizing</b> in a cohort of students receiving reform-oriented mathematics instruction. One-on-one videotaped mathematics interviews were conducted twice annually for 4 years from Grade 1 to Grade 4 with a varying number of participants from 61 to 45 respectively. Multiplication and quotative division questions were analyzed for correctness, the physical model used to solve the problem, and the computation strategy used to solve the problem. Multiplication and adding up for division models that required the development of more sophisticated <b>unitizing</b> included modelling only one group, modelling just the groups, modelling the groups with the composite numeral, and modelling the new whole. Multiplication and adding up for division strategies that indicated the development of a <b>unitizing</b> structure included rhythmic counting, starting with a doublet, skip counting, regrouping to form a new composite, and splitting the composite and then iterating the sub-composites to find the total.

This study investigated Algebra I students' cognitive obstacles and implemented previous research results. The cognitive obstacles were those related to students' thinking about variables, variable expressions, <b>unitizing,</b> and equation solving techniques. A total of 86 Algebra I students from a large suburban high school participated in the study. The treatment group (53 students) was given a researcher-developed review unit of instruction which began with a cognitive structure facilitator based on the advance organizer. The remainder of the unit, based on research on the cognitive obstacles, used elaboration theory to directly address the obstacles with the students. Administered instruments included the Chelsea Diagnostic Test for Algebra and a researcher-developed instrument which focused on students' cognitive obstacles. Seven students from the treatment group were interviewed to support and to expand on the findings of the quantitative-based analyses. ANCOVA results failed to show that the instructional unit had an effect on the cognitive obstacles formed by students and investigated in this study. However, the treatment group results did indicate an improvement in the application of <b>unitizing.</b> Analyses of the interactions and the problem-solving processes of the interviewed students supported the quantitative-based results. Students' understanding of variables, variable expressions, and equation-solving techniques were quite adequate, but students were somewhat reluctant to <b>unitize</b> complexes...|$|R

While considerable effort has been made concerning categorization, fewer studies address <b>unitizing</b> and when both paradigms are combined even fewer methods are available and discussed. The aim of this article is threefold. First, we advocate that to deal with <b>unitizing,</b> alignment and agreement measure should be considered as a unified process, since a relevant measure should rely on an alignment of the units from different annotators, while this alignment should be computed according to the principles of the measure. Second, we propose the new versatile measure γ which fulfills this requirement and copes with both paradigms, and we introduce its implementation. Third, we show that this new method performs as well as, or even better than, other more specialized methods, devoted to categorization or segmentation, while combining the two paradigms at the same time...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{emergence}} of the three-input majority gate as a practical element for logical design has demanded a useful method of design using these elements. In order to facilitate {{the use of this}} gate, a digital computer program is presented to implement the design procedure. Utilizing the truth table of a logical function, with "don't care" terms omitted, as the input, the program employs a <b>unitizing</b> method of function realization using three-input majority gates. The program complements and <b>unitizes</b> the table, and, using some fundamental theorems, reduces the table and selects the majority gate which gives maximum reduction. The reduction and gate selection processes continue until a final gate is obtained and the function is realized. The result is an efficient and relatively fast method of logical design employing three-input majority gates. The program was written in the FORTRAN II language for an IBM 1620 computer with 40 K decimal digits of storage. In the form presented, it uses over 39 K digits of storage...|$|R
