40|$|<b>User</b> <b>evaluations</b> of {{information}} systems are frequently used as measures of MIS success, since {{it is extremely difficult}} to get objective measures of system performance. However, <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> have been appropriately criticized as lacking a clearly articulated theoretical basis for linking them to systems effectiveness, and almost no research has been found that explicitly tests the link between <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> of systems and objectively measured performance. In this paper, we focus on <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> of task-technology fit for mandatory use systems and develop theoretical arguments for the link to individual performance. This is then empirically tested in a controlled experiment with objective performance measures and carefully validated <b>user</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Statistically significant support for the link is found for one measure of performance but not for a second. These findings are consistent with others which found that users are not necessarily accurate reporters of key constructs related to use of IS, specifically that self reporting is a poor measure of actual utilization.

40|$|Active {{interactive}} {{genetic algorithms}} (aiGAs) rely on actively optimizing synthetic fitness functions. In interactive genetic algorithms (iGAs) framework, <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{provide the necessary}} input for synthesizing a reasonably accurate surrogate fitness function that models <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> or, in other words, his/her decision preferences. <b>User</b> <b>evaluations</b> collected via tournament selection only provide partial-ordering relations between solutions.

40|$|Organizations spend {{millions}} of dollars on information systems to improve organizational or individual performance, but objective measures of system success are extremely difficult to achieve. For this reason, many MIS researchers (and potentially MIS practitioners) rely on <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> of systems as a surrogate for MIS success. However, these measures have been strongly criticized as lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. Furthermore, empirical evidence of their efficacy is surprisingly weak. Part of the explanation for the theoretical and empirical problems with <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> is that they are really a measurement technique rather than a single theoretical construct. <b>User</b> <b>evaluations</b> are elicited beliefs or attitudes about something, and they have been used to measure a variety of different "somethings. " What is needed for <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> to be an effective measure of IS success is the identification of some specific user evaluation construct, defined within a theoretical perspective that can usefully link underlying systems to their relevant impacts. We propose task-technology fit (TTF) as such a user evaluation construct. The TTF perspective views technology as a means by which a goal-directed individual performs tasks. TTF focuses on the degree to which systems characteristics match user task needs. We posit that higher task-technology fit will result in better performance. Further, we posit that users can successfully evaluate task-technology fit. This latter proposition is strongly supported in a survey of 259 users in 9 companies. <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> of IS, task-technology fit, measurement of MIS success...|$|E
40|$|<b>User</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{have gained}} {{increasing}} importance in visualization research {{over the past}} years, as in many cases these evaluations are {{the only way to}} support the claims made by visualization researchers. Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming <b>user</b> <b>evaluations</b> traditionally conducted {{at the end of the}} design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research. We will describe the system's design and the considerations made during the design process, and demonstrate the system by conducting three <b>user</b> <b>evaluations,</b> all of which have been published before in the visualization literature...|$|E

Energy-efficient buildings are often rated better than conventional buildings on indoor climate, but on digging deeper, users have different concerns.
