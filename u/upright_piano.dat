5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the attic, have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an <b>upright</b> <b>piano</b> in the sunroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on November19, 2010 on MTV and MTV.com. and it involves Mars's efforts to sing to a woman he loves after dragging an <b>upright</b> <b>piano</b> with a rope tied to it through Los Angeles. Scenes also feature the singer singing in a dark bedroom, looking out of a rainy window. He wears a suit and encounters a gang and a pit bull along the way. When he reaches the woman's house and finds out she is with another man, he drags himself and the piano {{in front of a}} train to attempt suicide. As the train approaches Bruno at full speed, the video cuts to black.|$|E
5|$|Because of William's {{impending}} {{retirement and}} the consequent fall in the family's income, Ferrier's hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO telephone exchange in Blackburn. She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the Daily Express. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer <b>upright</b> <b>piano</b> as a prize. On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn's King George's Hall. After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist.|$|E

50|$|<b>Upright</b> <b>pianos,</b> {{also called}} {{vertical}} pianos, are more compact because {{the frame and}} strings are vertical. <b>Upright</b> <b>pianos</b> are generally less expensive than grand <b>pianos.</b> <b>Upright</b> <b>pianos</b> are widely used in churches, community centers, schools, music conservatories and university music programs as rehearsal and practice instruments, and they are popular models for in-home purchase. The hammers move horizontally, and return to their resting position via springs, which are susceptible to degradation. <b>Upright</b> <b>pianos</b> with unusually tall frames and long strings are sometimes called <b>upright</b> grand <b>pianos.</b> Some authors classify modern pianos according to their height and to modifications of the action {{that are necessary to}} accommodate the height.|$|R

5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it.

Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E

50|$|Pianos {{have had}} pedals, or some close equivalent, since the {{earliest}} days. (In the 18th century, some pianos used levers pressed upward by the player's knee instead of pedals.) Most grand pianos in the US have three pedals: the soft pedal (una corda), sostenuto, and sustain pedal (from left to right, respectively), while in Europe, the standard is two pedals: the soft pedal and the sustain pedal. Most modern <b>upright</b> <b>pianos</b> also have three pedals: soft pedal, practice pedal and sustain pedal, though older or cheaper models may lack the practice pedal.

[...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric.
