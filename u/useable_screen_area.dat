2500|$|MWAA is also {{planning}} a new [...] "Secure National Hall" [...] project. Currently, National Hall is before security, {{with a separate}} security <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> {{for each of the}} three concourses. Since Terminal B and C were designed pre-9/11, the security <b>screening</b> <b>areas</b> are cramped and congested. Further, passengers cannot access the concessions and restaurants of National Hall after they go through security, and going from one concourse to another requires re-screening, or, in certain situations, taking a bus between concourses.|$|R
5000|$|Increasing the <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> of each panel {{transfers}} {{the load}} across more surface area {{and therefore the}} wear tends to be decreased in comparison to other screens.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the use of}} {{multiple}} projectors set up to project onto a <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> over-projected images could be designed as animations. Typical multi-image animation effects included fading from one photograph or graphic to another, progressively building text to form a completed statement, inserting images or graphics into frames or windows on screen, step by step movement of images across the <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> and superimposing text or images onto a background. The visual effects were synchronized to music or voice and based on the capabilities and limitations of the slide projectors and dissolve units.|$|R
50|$|Because of the building-block {{nature of}} the system, the {{configuration}} of the overall <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> and shape is flexible, leading to simple traditional rectangular displays, and more complex non-standard shapes.|$|R
50|$|Two {{modifications}} of the TC2048 exist: the TC2128 (by STAVI) and the TC2144 (by Jarek Adamski).Both extend the RAM to 128K and upgrade the ULA to use four <b>screen</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Game Gear's lower screen {{resolution}} {{results in}} the Game Gear version having a smaller visible <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Underground Zone, the reduced <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle {{takes place in a}} smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it allowed}} {{children}} {{to interact with}} the characters of their favorite fairy tales, most of the stories' major events would happen off-screen, with the player's movement limited to a four-by-four <b>screen</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{expansion}} {{projects are}} planned or underway. The recently constructed 101-foot control tower {{was completed in}} September 2012. An expansion of the terminal building, with a new security <b>screening</b> <b>area,</b> was completed in 2007.|$|R
50|$|Enormous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} in the screening process kinetics. It is found that screening process performance can be described as an exponential function of the process characteristics, which include feed rate, <b>screening</b> <b>area,</b> <b>screen</b> length, critical size fraction in feed. The sections below will give a brief introduction of these process characteristics and how they affect the screening.|$|R
5000|$|Area of screen: Larger <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> {{indicates}} a higher screening capacity. The largest area available is given as approximately 25,000 cm2, a larger area will cause severe uneven distributions of material along the screen surface.|$|R

50|$|The icon was {{originally}} designed by Norm Cox {{as part of}} the user interface for the Xerox Star, and it saw a resurgence starting in 2009 stemming from the limited <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> available to mobile apps.|$|R
40|$|Background We {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} screening uptake and socioeconomic deprivation for London women aged 50 â€“ 52 invited to their first routine screening appointment between 2006 and 2009. Methods We examined uptake for London overall and within six <b>screening</b> <b>areas,</b> using deprivation quintile, based on post code of residence. Results After adjustment for age, area and ethnicity, overall uptake decreased with increasing deprivation (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0. 95, P, 0. 001). However, in two <b>screening</b> <b>areas</b> with lower uptake, women living in deprived areas had higher uptake than women from affluent areas. Conclusions These potential inequalities in early diagnosis across London require further investigation...|$|R
5000|$|These differing panel shapes {{are used}} {{in an attempt to}} reduce the {{quantity}} of panels on each frame but still provide maximum rigidity and support for the mesh attached to them. The purpose of reducing these panels is to maximize usable <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> as the walls of each panel {{get in the way of}} the mesh and prevent it from being used, this is known as [...] "blanking". The non-blanked <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> of a shaker screen is widely used as a selling feature, the more screen surface you have available to work the more efficient your shaker becomes and therefore can handle a higher quantity of fluid.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{television}} with a diagonal of 82 cm (32 in) has a <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> A = 28.7 dm2 and a reference power consumption of 144 W. The energy classes are {{as in the}} table below.|$|R
50|$|A {{rotary vacuum}} filter {{consists}} of a large rotating drum covered by a cloth. The drum is suspended on an axial over a trough containing liquid/solids slurry with approximately 50-80% of the <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> immersed in the slurry.|$|R
25|$|Growth in the Gallatin Valley {{prompted}} the Gallatin Airport Authority in 2009 {{to expand the}} Gallatin Field Airport with two new gates, an expanded passenger <b>screening</b> <b>area,</b> and a third baggage carousel. Gallatin Field was subsequently renamed Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport.|$|R
40|$|The program ERG (Easy Reading Glasses) {{has been}} studied and {{implemented}} to help in reading dyslexic people and more generally people with significant reading difficulties. This is obtained by expanding in a specific <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> the textual data contained in two <b>screen</b> <b>areas</b> containing web pages and texts. In fact, the text present in an embedded web browser or text page can be selected and displayed in a new, more readable, format in the embedded expanded page. This is done by performing word evidentiation and decomposition into pseudo-syllabic groups according to a novel method of segmentation. The program is highly configurable, for it allows the user to easily configure several significant size, spacing and colour parameters...|$|R

5000|$|High profile {{trials are}} {{held on the}} Ninth Floor of the building, with a {{secondary}} <b>screening</b> <b>area</b> {{in addition to the}} main screening at the ground floor level. [...] Furthermore, the Eighth and Tenth floors are inaccessible from the public elevators and stairwells.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{horizontal}} position register for sprites is one byte and {{limited to a}} maximum value of 255, it could not cover the entire 320 pixels of the VIC-II's <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> so an additional register called the Most Significant Byte Flag is provided for this.|$|R
50|$|Every MicroTile {{unit has}} sensors in each side that detect {{whether there is}} another unit next to it, {{allowing}} the display controller to automatically determine the tile layout and the size and magnification of the video picture to be displayed across the <b>screen</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
40|$|Multi-media have a {{valuable}} contribution {{to make in the}} presentation of science and technology. The use of multimedia can be stimulating, effective and fun. The main features of multimedia techniques are simultaneous image presentation, larger <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> increased information density and enhanced flexibility of presentation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{method for}} {{measuring}} ANSI lumens {{is defined in}} the IT7.215 document which was created in 1992. First the projector is set up to display an image in a room at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. The brightness and contrast of the projector are adjusted so that on a full white field, {{it is possible to}} distinguish between a 5% <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> block of 95% peak white, and two identically sized 100% and 90% peak white boxes {{at the center of the}} white field. The light output is then measured on a full white field at nine specific locations around the screen and averaged. This average is then multiplied by the <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> to give the brightness of the projector in [...] "ANSI lumens".|$|R
50|$|The {{important}} {{parameters are}} <b>screen</b> <b>area,</b> acceleration {{level in the}} final drainage zone and cake thickness. Cake filtration affects residence time and volumetric throughput. Residence on the screen {{is controlled by the}} screen's length and diameter, cake thickness and the frequency and stroke length of the cake.|$|R

50|$|Reasons {{for using}} a video wall instead of a single large screen can include the ability to {{customize}} tile layouts, greater <b>screen</b> <b>area</b> per unit cost, and greater pixel density per unit cost, due to the economics of manufacturing single screens which are unusual in shape, size, or resolution.|$|R
5000|$|Text-based user {{interface}} (TUI), also called textual {{user interface}} or terminal user interface, is a retronym coined sometime after {{the invention of}} graphical user interfaces.
