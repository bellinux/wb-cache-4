5|$|In 1830, {{following}} the widespread {{acceptance of the}} Napoleonic code, which allowed interest, throughout Europe, {{with the approval of}} Pope Pius VIII, the Inquisition of Rome, distinguished the doctrine of <b>usury</b> from the practice of <b>usury,</b> decreeing that confessors should no longer disturb the latter.|$|E
5|$|The {{text of the}} {{encyclical}} was destroyed in several countries. In France, the ban on <b>usury</b> persisted until the French Revolution of 1789, the same year in which Turgot's Mémoire sur les prets d'argent, a defense of <b>usury,</b> was allowed to be published.|$|E
5|$|Vix pervenit: On <b>Usury</b> and Other Dishonest Profit was an encyclical, {{promulgated by}} Pope Benedict XIV on November 1, 1745, which {{condemned}} {{the practice of}} charging interest on loans as <b>usury.</b> Because the encyclical was addressed to the Bishops of Italy, it is generally not considered ex cathedra. The Holy Office applied the encyclical to {{the whole of the}} Roman Catholic Church on July 29, 1836, during the reign of Pope Gregory XVI.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{community}} in England continued to provide essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise {{banned by the}} <b>usury</b> laws, and grew in the 12th century by Jewish immigrants fleeing the fighting around Rouen. The Jewish community spread beyond London to eleven major English cities, primarily the major trading hubs in the east of England with functioning mints, all with suitable castles for protection of the often persecuted Jewish minority. By {{the time of the}} Anarchy and the reign of Stephen, the communities were flourishing and providing financial loans to the king.|$|E
5|$|Another {{source of}} crown income was {{represented}} by England's Jews. The Jews were the king's personal property, and {{he was free to}} tax them at will. By 1280, the Jews had been exploited to a level at which they were no longer of much financial use to the crown, but they could still be used in political bargaining. Their <b>usury</b> businessa practice forbidden to Christianshad made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment. In 1275, Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed <b>usury</b> and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions; in 1279, {{in the context of a}} crack-down on coin-clippers, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed. In 1280, he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but these exhortations were not followed. The final attack on the Jews in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England. This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament. The expulsion, which was reversed in 1656, followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes: Philip II of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182; John I, Duke of Brittany, drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning <b>usury</b> as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on <b>usury.</b> During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries of the opportunities offered by trading in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to <b>usury.</b> Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|His poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley {{consists}} of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless. Published in June 1920, it marked his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the massive {{loss of life}} {{during the war and}} was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word <b>usury</b> appears in his work for the first time. The critic F. R. Leavis saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that {{her use of}} loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was <b>usury</b> and a mortal sin. He also felt that Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include {{the top of the}} head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham's reason was that they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the crisis between 1290 and 1348 and the {{subsequent}} epidemics produced many challenges for the English economy. In the decades after the disaster, {{the economic and social}} issues arising from the Black Death combined with the costs of the Hundred Years War to produce the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Although the revolt was suppressed, it undermined many of the vestiges of the feudal economic order, and the countryside became dominated by estates organised as farms, frequently owned or rented by the new economic class of the gentry. The English agricultural economy remained depressed throughout the 15th century; growth at this time came from the greatly increased English cloth trade and manufacturing. The economic consequences of this varied considerably from region to region, but generally London, the South and the West prospered {{at the expense of the}} Eastern and the older cities. The role of merchants and trade became increasingly seen as important to the country, and <b>usury</b> gradually became more widely accepted, with English economic thinking increasingly influenced by Renaissance humanist theories.|$|E
5|$|The {{wool and}} cloth trade was {{primarily}} now {{being run by}} English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners. Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, 66–75% of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%; London managed around 50% of these exports in 1400, {{and as much as}} 83% of wool and cloth exports by 1540. The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, continued, and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, {{rather than the other way}} around. <b>Usury</b> grew during the period, and few cases were prosecuted by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He decided to run for the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of <b>usury</b> by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the Jobless Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{community}} {{played an}} important role in England throughout much of the period. The first Jews arrived in England in the aftermath of the Norman invasion, when William the Conqueror brought over wealthy members of the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London. The Jewish community expanded out across England and provided essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise banned by the <b>usury</b> laws. During the 12th century, the Jewish financial community grew richer still, operating under royal protection and providing the king with a source of ready credit. All major towns had Jewish centres, and even the smaller towns saw visits by travelling Jewish merchants. Towards the end of Henry II's reign, however, the king ceased to borrow from the Jewish community and instead turned to extracting money from them through arbitrary taxation and fines. The Jews became vilified and accusations were made that they conducted ritual child murder, encouraging the pogroms carried out against Jewish communities in the reign of Richard I. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community and, with the breakdown in order in 1215, the Jews were subject to fresh attacks. HenryIII restored some protection and Jewish money-lending began to recover. Despite this, the Jewish community became increasingly impoverished and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{has always}} {{condemned}} <b>usury,</b> but in modern times, {{with the rise}} of capitalism and the disestablishment of the Catholic Church in majority Catholic countries, this prohibition on <b>usury</b> has not been enforced.|$|E
25|$|By the 18th century, <b>usury</b> {{was more}} often {{treated as a}} metaphor than a crime in itself, so Jeremy Bentham's Defense of <b>Usury</b> was not as {{shocking}} {{as it would have}} appeared two centuries earlier.|$|E

25|$|The First Council of Nicaea, in 325, forbade clergy from {{engaging}} in <b>usury</b> (canon 17). At the time, <b>usury</b> was interest of any kind, and the canon forbade the clergy to lend money at interest rates even as low as 1 percent per year. Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} the scholastics, Saint Anselm of Canterbury, led the shift in thought that labeled {{charging}} interest the same as theft. Previously <b>usury</b> had {{been seen as a}} lack of charity.|$|E
25|$|The papal {{prohibition}} on <b>usury</b> {{meant that it}} was a sin to charge interest on a money loan. As set forth by Thomas Aquinas, the natural essence of money was as a measure of value or intermediary in exchange. The increase of money through <b>usury</b> violated this essence and according to the same Thomistic analysis, a just transaction was one characterized by an equality of exchange, one where each side received exactly his due. Interest on a loan, in excess of the principal, would violate the balance of an exchange between debtor and creditor and was therefore unjust.|$|E

25|$|Usury– the {{accumulation}} of interest on loan principal– is prohibited by the texts of some major religions. In Christianity and Judaism, adherents are forbidden to charge interest to other adherents or to the poor (Leviticus 25:35–38; Deuteronomy 23:19). Islam forbids <b>usury,</b> known in Arabic as riba.|$|E
25|$|In England, {{the departing}} Crusaders {{were joined by}} crowds of debtors in the massacres of Jews at London and York in 1189–1190. In 1275, Edward I of England passed the Statute of the Jewry which made <b>usury</b> illegal and linked it to blasphemy, in order to seize {{the assets of the}} violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their {{property}} went to the Crown. In 1290, all Jews were to be expelled from England, allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown's. <b>Usury</b> was cited as the official reason for the Edict of Expulsion; however, not all Jews were expelled: it was easy to avoid expulsion by converting to Christianity. Many other crowned heads of Europe expelled the Jews, although again converts to Christianity were no longer considered Jewish (see the articles on marranos or crypto-Judaism).|$|E
25|$|Muslim {{scholars}} have varying opinions about life insurance. Life insurance policies that earn interest (or guaranteed bonus/NAV) are {{generally considered to}} be a form of riba (<b>usury)</b> and some consider even policies that do not earn interest to be a form of gharar (speculation). Some argue that gharar is not present due to the actuarial science behind the underwriting.|$|E
25|$|One {{school of}} thought {{attributes}} Calvinism with {{setting the stage for}} the later development of capitalism in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of <b>usury</b> and, implicitly, of profit in general. Such a connection was advanced in influential works by R. H. Tawney(1880–1962) and by Max Weber (1864–1920).|$|E
25|$|The common view of riba (<b>usury)</b> among {{classical}} jurists of Islamic law {{and economics}} during the Islamic Golden Age was {{that it is only}} riba and therefore unlawful to apply interest to money exnatura sua—exclusively gold and silver currencies—but that it is not riba and is therefore acceptable to apply interest to fiat money—currencies made up of other materials such as paper or base metals—to an extent.|$|E
25|$|Some {{members of}} Congress {{have tried to}} create a federal <b>usury</b> statute that would limit the maximum {{allowable}} interest rate, but the measures have not progressed.

The act provides for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate some credit practices but has no interest rate limit.|$|E
25|$|Payday {{loans are}} legal in 27 states, and 9 others allows {{some form of}} short term {{storefront}} lending with restrictions. The remaining 14 and the District of Columbia forbid the practice. The annual percentage rate (APR) is also limited in some jurisdictions to prevent <b>usury.</b> And in some states, there are laws {{limiting the number of}} loans a borrower can take at a single time.|$|E
