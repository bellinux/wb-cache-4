60|$|Washington's solicitude for {{harmony in}} his cabinet had been {{rendered}} more anxious by public disturbances {{in some parts}} of the country.

Combinations were formed to defeat the execution of it, and the revenue officers were riotously opposed in the execution of their duties. Determined to exert all the legal powers with which he was invested to check so daring and unwarrantable a spirit, Washington, on the 15th of September, issued a proclamation, warning all persons to desist from such <b>unlawful</b> <b>combinations</b> and proceedings, and requiring all courts, magistrates, and officers to bring the infractors of the law to justice; copies of which proclamation were sent to the governors of Pennsylvania and of North and South Carolina.|$|R

40|$|In {{these times}} when we see {{combinations}} of employers co-operating under trade agreements with combinations of employees to conduct immense industries, we are apt to forget the remarkable development of ideas concerning industrial economy that has occurred within a life-time.

The right of workmen to combine for exactly these purposes, then considered by many as unlawful, has long since been recognized.

5000|$|The Bausch & Lomb and Beech-Nut {{decisions}} {{cannot be}} read as merely limited to particular fact complexes justifying the inference of an agreement {{in violation of the}} Sherman Act[...] [...] [...] The Sherman Act also forbids combinations of traders to suppress competition. True, there results the same economic effect as is accomplished by a prohibited combination to suppress price competition if each customer, although induced to do so solely by a manufacturer's announced policy, independently decides to observe specified resale prices. So long as Colgate is not overruled, this result is tolerated, but only when it is the consequence of a mere refusal to sell in the exercise of the manufacturer's right [...] "freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal." [...] When the manufacturer's actions, as here, go beyond mere announcement of his policy and the simple refusal to deal, and he employs other means which effect adherence to his resale prices, this countervailing consideration is not present, and therefore he has put together a combination in violation of the Sherman Act. Thus, whether an <b>unlawful</b> <b>combination</b> or conspiracy is proved is to be judged by what the parties actually did, rather than by the words they used.|$|R
5000|$|In Russell Stover Candies v.

The Eighth Circuit reversed, however, pointing to the statement in Parke Davis that [...] "a simple refusal to sell to customers who will not resell at prices suggested by the seller is permissible under the Sherman Act" [...] although an unlawful [...] "combination is also organized if the producer secures adherence to his suggested prices by means which go beyond his mere declination to sell to a customer who will not observe his announced policy"; the court added that Parke Davis had been found to have gone far [...] "beyond the limits of the Colgate doctrine" [...] by enlisting wholesalers and retailers to adhere to and participate in the price-fixing program. The court said that the FTC has presented a case in which [...] "there are no 'plus factors' to take the case beyond Colgate," [...] so it reversed the Commission. [...] "Despite the FTC's attempt to gut Colgate," [...] however, [...] "it did not choose to argue that Section 5 the FTC Act does not require agreement." [...] Instead, the FTC attempted to find a violation by invoking § 1 of the Sherman Act, including specifically the requirement of a contract,combination, or conspiracy, but it failed to establish that.|$|R

50|$|Nova Scotia {{had one of}} {{the first}} labour {{organizations}} in what became Canada.

50|$|The {{enforcement}} of laws by executive or judicial action {{is an important}} matter relating to labour legislation, for without action such laws would remain dead letters. Under the constitutions of the states, the governor is the commander-in-chief of the military forces, {{and he has the}} power to order the militia or any part of it into active service in case of insurrection, invasion, tumult, riots or breaches of the peace or imminent danger thereof. Frequent action has been taken in the case of strikes with the view of preventing or suppressing violence threatened or happening to persons or property, the effect being, however, that the militia protects those working or desiring to work, or the employers. The president of the United States may use the land and naval forces whenever by reason of insurrection, domestic violence, <b>unlawful</b> obstructions, conspiracy, <b>combinations</b> or assemblages of persons it becomes impracticable to enforce the laws of the land by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or when the execution of the laws is so hindered by reason of such events that any portion or class of the people are deprived thereby of their rights and privileges under the constitution and laws of the country.

[...] "But that excuse does not extend to a boycott of retailers who buy dresses copied from 'published' designs; if that is to be justified, the excuse must be found elsewhere." [...] The court could find no other excuse, and it observed that the effect of the boycott by the FOGA members [...] "puts into their hands collectively the power to control the supply and with it the price," [...] to the detriment of consumers. The court perceived each dress design as the subject of a monopoly (i.e., relevant submarket), so that [...] "for these reasons the <b>combination</b> was <b>unlawful</b> per se." ...|$|R
