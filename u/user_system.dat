The PICMSS system uses stateof-the-art techniques for setting up and performing CFD calculations. It consists of a front-end program that runs on <b>user</b> <b>systems</b> and prepares program input, a compute engine that runs on parallel systems and calculates results, and post-processing programs that run on <b>user</b> <b>systems</b> and analyze and present results. The PICMSS compute engine was installed as a NetSolve service on three parallel systems and was tested on four <b>user</b> <b>systems.</b> NetSolve provides the infrastructure required to run the compute engine on the parallel systems and transfer program input and output files between <b>user</b> <b>systems</b> and parallel systems. The results of this project show that using NetSolve to run parallel programs is an effective and productive alternative to directly executing parallel programs on a parallel system...|$|R
