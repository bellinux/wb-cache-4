40|$|The Wakatipu Basin {{lies within}} the Otago Schist belt, and {{aggregates}} {{derived from the}} schist do not meet New Zealand basecourse specifications. This study comprises engineering geological investigations of the <b>roading</b> <b>aggregate</b> {{with the objective of}} identifying potential aggregate source areas which comply with specifications. Five aggregate sources, two glacial and three post-glacial, have been identified, and their geology related to aggregate quality. A survey of existing aggregate quarries confirmed the sub-specification quality of schist derived <b>roading</b> <b>aggregate,</b> and that the highest quality <b>roading</b> <b>aggregate</b> of the Basin is produced from exotic glacial transported graywacke. A graywacke rich aggregate source area of Kame terraces was investigated. Investigations included mapping at scales of 1 : 10 000 and 1 : 1 500, and the excavation of test pits. A geotechnical testing programme concluded that the Kame terrace source area was capable of producing <b>roading</b> <b>aggregate</b> for basecourse, and is comparable with the highest quality <b>roading</b> <b>aggregate</b> of the Wakatipu Basin. Subsequently, the Queenstown - Lakes District Council has developed an aggregate quarry within the Kame terrace source area...|$|R

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>aggregate</b> is {{the largest}} {{component}} contributing to road construction. In Sri Lanka, naturally occurring sources that suits construction work are not available. Therefore, this requirement is most commonly fulfilled by excavating rocks and crushing them to suitable sizes. Demand for <b>road</b> <b>aggregate</b> has increased due to the current development of highway sector in Sri Lanka, {{and it is difficult}} to satisfy the requirement. In some areas of the country, especially in the Northern region, it is hard to fulfill these requirements due to several reasons such as archeological sites and environmental-sensitive forest areas. Therefore, quality control and fulfillment of the requirement with the available limited sources is a challenge. Considering the use of crushed rock for road construction, it is important to select materials in an acceptable quality. Especially when crushed rock is used for the road bases and surfacing, these properties play a vital role in ensuring durability. To ensure the quality, various tests have been introduced by relevant authorities. When selecting a source to produce crushed rock as road construction material, production from the selected source have to satisfy certain requirements. The los angeles abration value (LAAV) and aggregate impact value (AIV) is the two important tests which ensure the strength requirement of <b>road</b> <b>aggregate.</b> With the blasting operation, a considerable variation of rock fragmentation is noted. This is mainly due to the explosive quantity used for blasting operation. Types and features of explosives and blasting design also play an important role of rock mass fragmentation. In Sri Lanka, blasting design patterns and the explosives used do not vary considerably. But usage of explosives changes in continuous operation even the place is unchanged. These changes may be due to environmental conditions such as rainy seasons or due to some significant change of nature and properties of rock mass. The objective of this study was to identify the changes of AIV and LAAV with the use of explosive percentage used for the blasting operation and improve the strength of <b>road</b> <b>aggregate</b> by controlling the explosive usage for aggregate production. There was not found a relationship between explosive usage for blasting and the aggregate strength properties.

40|$|Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR) is a deleterious, {{expansive}} {{reaction in}} concrete. Several ASTM methods test potential aggregates for ASR risk. One method uses NaOH digestion, followed by spectroscopic methods, {{to estimate the}} amount of reactive silica present in an aggregate. NaOH, however, can digest both crystalline (i. e. quartz) and non-crystalline (e. g. opal), or poorly crystalline silica, potentially yielding falsely high estimates of reactive silica.

Here we test this approach by analyzing reactive silica in <b>road</b> <b>aggregate.</b> Tiron extraction of reactive silica is more selective, in some cases extracting only ~ 30 % of the silica compared to the harsher NaOH extraction: variation is due to differences in aggregate mineralogy, specifically SiO 2.

The profile analyses were based on a method developed at LCPC for characterizing the asperity shape end relief. The SEM observations were done at different magnification levels. Results from the profile analyses showed that polishing involves two microtexture scales: the “roughness” scale, composed of few ten microns asperities, and the “undulation” scale, composed of few hundred microns asperities. Evolutions of the asperity shape and relief at these two scales depended on the rock nature.

These layerings comprised (i) a layer of Â uncrushed, granitic, sandy gravel - a good quality <b>road</b> <b>aggregate</b> (ii) a layer of shale - a poor quality aggregate, and (iii) a layer of crushed limestone an excellent quality aggregate with a wet mix macadam (WMM) grading on top of a poor quality shale sub-base layer. The repeated load testing rig was designed and constructed to test different surface or completion layering thicknesses of the aggregates over a common formation or subgrade material of silty sandy soil. This testing was achieved by surface loading the aggregates through a 200 mm-diameter rubber pad - attached to a hydraulic actuator on the test rig - for up to 150, 000 load applications. The subgrade pressures and surface deflections were measured at applied stresses of 500 kPa, 750 kPa and 1000 kPa.

40|$|Skid {{resistance}} of road surfaces depends mostly on pavement texture. This texture is usually divided to two components:microtexture and macrotexture. Microtexture {{refers to the}} smallscale texture of the <b>road</b> <b>aggregate</b> component while macrotexture refers to the large-scale texture of the road as a whole due to the aggregate particle arrangement. Both components contribute to the generation of friction between tyre and road. However, due to traffic, the firstcited component is continuously polished over the road's life. Maintaining that microtexture depends greatly on the aggregates used in the wearing course, the traffic level and the vehicle velocities. This work tries to quantify the influence of these three parameters on skid resistance degradation. Different specimens fabricated from different types of aggregates are submitted to different polishing pressure levels and velocities. From experimental results, {{an updated version of}} an existing model of skid resistance evolution is thereby proposed and validated.

40|$|International audienceLarge chalk {{deposits}} are to {{be found}} in the North of France, and, as a result, developing chalk as a load-bearing aggregate is considered by French road building companies. Due to its limited mechanical performance, chalk is subjected to a medium heat treatment process (up to 500 °C). In this context, microstructure and poro-mechanical performance of Haubourdin chalk are characterized before and after heat treatment. The investigation of the so-called water weakening effect is associated to that of heat-treatment, mainly to show to what extent the strength of Haubourdin chalk decreases at a given water saturation state, prior to or after heat-treatment. In terms of microstructure analysis, SEM and FIB/SEM observations show the initial weak cementation of Haubourdin chalk, in direct relation with its moderate mechanical performance. After heat treatment, minor re-crystallisation of calcium carbonate is observed, which should be confirmed further. The specific behavior of Haubourdin chalk is highlighted under partial water saturation and after heat treatment, by using uniaxial compressive tests, and triaxial drained and undrained compressive tests. Pore collapse is quantified directly under increasing hydrostatic stress by measuring coupled gas permeability and porosity change. A heat-hardening effect is identified, which is counter-balanced by the water-weakening effect. The latter makes natural Haubourdin chalk unsuitable as load-bearing <b>road</b> <b>aggregate,</b> without further binding matter...|$|R
