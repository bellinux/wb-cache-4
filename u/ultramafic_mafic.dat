The sequence is distinctive from other Permo-Triassic ophilite-type complexes in Western North America by its large volume of silicic intrusive and volcanic rocks. By the mid-Triassic, this complex had been heavily fragmented, uplifted, and overlain by Triassic-age oceanic sediments. All of these Permo-Triassic rocks were incorporated onto the western margin of North America by the mid-Cretaceous. Extensive Tertiary-age continental volcanic flows covered the region, and subsequent uplift and erosion has exposed the older basement.

50|$|Ophiolite {{series and}} ultramafic rocks have a {{widespread}} occurrence in Iran {{and can be}} grouped as follows: <b>Ultramafic</b> and <b>mafic</b> units of Late Precambrian-Early Cambrian. Although comparable to modern ophiolites, these rocks do not display all typical features of an oceanic crust. The term “old ophiolite” might be a misnomer. These rocks are widespread in Takab and Anarak Regions. They might be representing a protorift. <b>Ultramafic</b> and <b>mafic</b> rocks of Upper Paleozoic occur as metamorphosed as well as non-metamorphosed bodies in some areas like Fariman, Shanderman, and Asalem. These rocks display many typical features of modern ophiolites. Ophiolite series of Early Cretaceous-Paleogene age show typical features of ophiolitic sequences and {{are thought to be}} associated with the closure of the Neotethys. These ophiolite series are widespread in Iran. Some of the more important locations include Kermanshah-Neyriz-Oman Belt, Makran (south of Jazmurian), ultramafic-mafic rocks related to Flysch Zone in Khash-Nosrat Abad-Birjand Belt, <b>ultramafic</b> and <b>mafic</b> rocks north of Dorooneh fault, Torbat-e Jam-Torbat-e Heydarieh-Sabzevar-Fariman regions, and Central Iran-Nain-Baft-Shahr-e Babak, Khoy-Maku. <b>Ultramafic</b> and <b>mafic</b> rocks also occur in association with large gabbroic intrusions. This type probably resulted from differentiation in a large mafic magma chamber, comparable to those of the layered mafic intrusions. Examples occur in Sero, Urumiyeh, and in Masooleh that are Late Cretaceous to Lower Oligocene in age.

The most frequent lithologies are Al-spinel gabbronorites, generally containing minor olivine, and Fe-Ti oxide-bearing gabbronorites. Troctolites, olivine gabbronorites and anorthosites were also recovered. Relics of primary textures as well as mineral and bulk-rock compositional variations indicate a comagmatic intrusive origin for the protoliths of the mafic granulites. This intrusive mafic complex underwent a subsolidus reequilibration under granulite facies conditions, at 0. 6 - 0. 9 GPa and 810 - 920 °C, and was derived from crystallization at intermediate levels of tholeiite-derived liquids, possibly affected by crustal contamination.

40|$|The Atlantic {{island of}} Maio in the Cape Verde {{archipelago}} has a Basement Complex of Mesozoic and Tertiary age which is invaded by an intense swarm of sheet intrusions {{ranging in age}} from c. 16 to 8 Ma. These cut an alkaline <b>ultramafic,</b> <b>mafic</b> and felsic plutonic complex (Central Igneous Complex) and its host, a segment of Jurassic ocean floor with pillow lavas and abyssal sediments. The Basement Complex is dissected and unconformably overlain by a sequence of lavas of basanitic and nephelinitic composition. The sheet intrusions comprise sills and dykes of alkaline lamprophyre, many of which are aphyric or sparsely porphyritic. Phenocrysts are predominantly clinopyroxene, with smaller amounts of olivine and Ti-magnetite. Microphenocrysts are kaersutite, apatite and biotite. The groundmass is dominated by potassium feldspar and analcime. Calcic plagioclase is extremely rare. Chemically the intrusions are basanitic, with major and minor element compositions directly comparable with the Neogene and Pleistocene basanitic lavas which cap the island. Calculations based on observed phenocryst phases suggest that the liquids involved in the crystallization of the sheet intrusions may have been derived by crystal fractionation from a range of basanitic parents.

These samples represent a proxy drill hole that can be re-assembled into an ‘ophiolite-type’ model of oceanic lithosphere. Petrographic and geochemical examination of the gabbroic and depleted mantle xenoliths indicates that the New Ireland fore-arc lithosphere is a fragment of ancient Pacific Plate generated at a mid-ocean ridge spreading centre and transported to the Pacific–Australian Plate margin. Convergent margin processes subjected the harzburgitic mantle wedge to hydrofracturing and hydration metasomatism at T= 790 – 1030 °C {{as a consequence of}} dewatering of a subducted slab. Advection of a high-density, H 2 O-rich fluid containing a substantial dissolved component (alkali aluminosilicate melt and aqueous carbon and sulphur species) through these mantle fractures caused a net transfer of soluble elements from the lower to upper mantle wedge and created a network of oxidised (ΔFMQ≈ 1. 8 – 2. 0) metasomatised peridotite enriched in orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, phlogopite, amphibole, magnetite, and Fe–Ni sulphides. The vein mineral assemblage magnetite+sulphide indicates precipitation from a hydrous fluid with high SO 2 /H 2 S, consistent with the hydrous fluid being derived from dehydration of subducted, altered oceanic crust. Preferential partial melting of these metasomatically enriched mantle wedge regions could account for the highly oxidised, sulphur- and alkali-rich nature of the high-K calc-alkaline volcanoes of the Tabar–Lihir–Tanga–Feni island chain...|$|E

40|$|The Yakuno {{ophiolite}} {{is exposed}} {{in the eastern}} part of the Maizuru Tectonic Belt which consists of ophiolite rocks. The Yakuno ophiolite is made up of <b>ultramafic,</b> <b>mafic,</b> intermediate, and felsic rocks which are regarded as the fragments of an ancient oceanic crust. Major element analyses (23 samples) and Sr isotope determinations (12 samples) were made for the representative rocks of the Yakuno ophiolite. The chemical features of the rocks and relict clinopyroxenes indicate that the ophiolite belongs to the tholeiitic rock series and shows a similarity to MORB in discrimination diagrams. However, the Yakuno ophiolite is much thicker than normal oceanic crust, and is associated with evolved rocks such as quartz diorite, granophyre and trondhjemite, but not with typical sheeted dyke complex. The Yakuno ophiolite is higher in normative plagioclase content and initial Sr isotope ratio (0. 705092) than typical MORB. Hence, the Yakuno ophiolite resembles both ocean ridge and oceanic island basalts in magmatic nature, which suggests that it has been generated by oceanic island magmatism at an ocean ridge. The Rb-Sr isochron age of the Yakuno ophiolite was determined as 285 Ma, which is almost identical with those of other ophiolites from the Maizuru Tectonic Belt. So far as the available chemical data are concerned, the ophiolites from the Maizuru Tectonic Belt seem to have originated at various tectonic settings, i. e. oceanic island at ocean ridge, ocean ridge, island arc and marginal sea from east to west...|$|E

Samples from the later magmatic sequence are dated at 96. 4 ± 0. 3, 95. 74 ± 0. 3 and 95. 2 ± 0. 3 Ma; the early crustal section, which has not been dated directly, is thus constrained to be older than c. 96. 4 Ma. Petrological evidence shows that the early crustal section formed at a spreading ridge, but the later magmatic sequence was formed from hydrous magmas that produced different mineral crystallisation sequences to normal midocean ridge basalt (MORB). Mineral and whole-rock geochemical analyses show that the early crustal rocks are chemically similar to MORB, but the later magmatic sequence has chemical features typically found in suprasubduction zone (SSZ) settings. The ophiolite in the United Arab Emirates thus preserves clear evidence for two stages of magmatism, an early episode formed at a spreading centre and a later episode associated with the onset of subduction.

In the Gavarnie–Heas dome (central Pyrenees), <b>ultramafic,</b> <b>mafic</b> and intermediate rocks form three massifs several kilometers in size emplaced within the anatectic series: (i) the Gloriettes massif, which mostly consists of norites with enclaves of ultramafic rocks; (ii) the Troumouse massif, which comprises intermediate rocks (gabbro-diorite and diorite) with norite enclaves, and (iii) the Aguila massif, which consists of intermediate rocks with hornblendite enclaves. U–Pb zircon geochronology (first data for these rock types in the Axial Zone of the Pyrenees) revealed an age of 294 Ma for the diorite crystallization and correlatively for the crystallization of the anatectic granite. This new radiometric age allows us to suggest that the Variscan orogeny continued at least until the Early Permian and spread over around 30 Ma. The Nd and Sr isotopic compositions of all UM and M samples plot within the field of the continental crust. Two scenarios can explain the genesis and the emplacement of the components of the magmatic suite: i) evolution of mantle melts and contamination (AFC); ii) evolution of melts originating from a heterogeneous source (mantle + crust) at the local or regional scale. The strong crustal affinity of all UM and M rock types from Gavarnie–Heas leads us to favor the second scenario...|$|E

We suggest that the carbonatite-like dyke is not a “normal” carbonatite, but instead represents melted carbonates, which can be associated with an unexposed, deep-seated, causative magmatic body. This dyke has a fluidal texture and carries xenoliths of ultramafic rocks that can be up to 35 cm in size. Its isotopic composition plots between primary unaltered carbonatites and marine carbonates, and ranges between 13. 79 ‰ and 18. 89 ‰ for δ 18 OVSMOW and between – 1. 22 ‰ and 1. 31 ‰ for δ 13 CVPDB. These values are significantly lower than those observed in carbonatites analyzed during this study and range between 6. 53 ‰ and 8. 10 ‰ for δ 18 OVSMOW and between – 5. 82 ‰ and – 4. 32 ‰ for δ 13 CVPDB, which is the primary isotope signature of most magmatic carbonatites.

The goal of the present study is to establish the kinematic, petrogenetic and temporal development of the TGC in order to evaluate the magmatic and structural evolution of the deep crustal roots of this Cambrian-aged island-arc. Fieldwork during GANOVEX X was carried out to provide insight into: (i) the spatial relations between the different igneous lithologies of the TGC, (ii) the nature of the contact between the TGC and Bowers Terrane, and (iii) the high-temperature shear zones exposed in parts of the TGC. Here, we report the results of detailed field and petrological observations combined with new geochronological data. Based on these new data, we tentatively propose a petrogenetic-kinematic model for the TGC, which involves a two-phase evolution during the Ross orogeny. These phases can be summarized as: (i) an early phase (maximum age c. 530 Ma) involving tectono-magmatic processes that were active at the deep crustal level represented by the TGC within the Bowers island arc and within a general NE-SW directed contractional regime and (ii) a late phase (maximum age c. 490 Ma) attributed to the late Ross orogenic intrusion of the TGC into the higher-crustal metasedimentary country rocks of the Bowers Terrane under NE-SW directed horizontal maximum stress and subsequent cooling...|$|E

Putative CH[subscript 3]SH synthesis by abiotic (nonbiological) reduction of inorganic carbon (CO[subscript 2] or CO) has been invoked as an initiation reaction {{for the emergence of}} protometabolism and microbial life in primordial hydrothermal settings. Thiols are also presumptive ligands for hydrothermal trace metals and potential fuels for associated microbial communities. In an effort to constrain sources and sinks of CH[subscript 3]SH in seafloor hydrothermal systems, we determined for the first time its abundance in diverse hydrothermal fluids emanating from <b>ultramafic,</b> <b>mafic,</b> and sediment-covered midocean ridge settings. Our data demonstrate that the distribution of CH[subscript 3]SH is inconsistent with metastable equilibrium with inorganic carbon, indicating that production by abiotic carbon reduction is more limited than previously proposed. CH[subscript 3]SH concentrations are uniformly low (∼ 10 [superscript − 8] M) in high-temperature fluids (> 200 °C) from all unsedimented systems and, in many cases, suggestive of metastable equilibrium with CH[subscript 4] instead. Associated low-temperature fluids (< 200 °C) formed by admixing of seawater, however, are invariably enriched in CH[subscript 3] 3 SH (up to ∼ 10 [superscript − 6] M) along with NH[+ over 4] and low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons relative to high-temperature source fluids, resembling our observations from a sediment-hosted system. This strongly implicates thermogenic interactions between upwelling fluids and microbial biomass or associated dissolved organic matter during subsurface mixing in crustal aquifers.

40|$|AbstractHow ophiolitic mélanges can {{be defined}} as sutures is {{controversial}} with regard to accretionary orogenesis and continental growth. The Chinese Altay, East Junggar, Tianshan, and Beishan belts of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in Northwest China, offer a special natural laboratory to resolve this puzzle. In the Chinese Altay, the Erqis unit consists of ophiolitic mélanges and coherent assemblages, forming a Paleozoic accretionary complex. At least two ophiolitic mélanges (Armantai, and Kelameili) in East Junggar, characterized by imbricated ophiolitic mélanges, Nb-enriched basalts, adakitic rocks and volcanic rocks, belong to a Devonian–Carboniferous intra-oceanic island arc with some Paleozoic ophiolites, superimposed by Permian arc volcanism. In the Tianshan, ophiolitic mélanges like Kanggurtag, North Tianshan, and South Tianshan occur as part of some Paleozoic accretionary complexes related to amalgamation of arc terranes. In the Beishan there are also several ophiolitic mélanges, including the Hongshishan, Xingxingxia–Shibangjing, Hongliuhe–Xichangjing, and Liuyuan ophiolitic units. Most ophiolitic mélanges in the study area are characterized by <b>ultramafic,</b> <b>mafic</b> and other components, which are juxtaposed, or even emplaced as lenses and knockers in a matrix of some coherent units. The tectonic settings of various components are different, and some adjacent units in the same mélange show contrasting different tectonic settings. The formation ages of these various components are in a wide spectrum, varying from Neoproterozoic to Permian. Therefore we cannot assume that these ophiolitic mélanges always form in linear sutures {{as a result of the}} closure of specific oceans. Often the ophiolitic components formed either as the substrate of intra-oceanic arcs, or were accreted as lenses or knockers in subduction-accretion complexes. Using published age and paleogeographic constraints, we propose the presence of (1) a major early Paleozoic tectonic boundary that separates the Chinese Altay–East Junggar multiple subduction systems of the southern Siberian active margin from those of the northern Tarim; and (2) a major Permian suture zone that separates the Tianshan–Beishan from the northern active margin of the Tarim Craton.

40|$|International audienceTectonic {{mixing of}} slab- and mantle-derived {{materials}} at {{the interface between}} converging plates highly enhances fluid-mediated mass transfer from the slab to the overlying mantle. Subduction mélanges can provide information about the interaction among different slices accreted at plate interface domains, with implications on the tectonic and geochemical evolution of the plate-interface itself. At Cima di Gagnone, pelitic schists and gneiss enclose chlorite harzburgite and garnet peridotite lenses, like in subduction mélanges located in-between downgoing slabs and overlying mantle. These peridotites host MORB-type eclogite and metarodingite, and derive from dehydration of serpentinized mantle protoliths. Their enrichment in fluid-mobile B, As, Sb, U, Th {{is the result of}} an early-stage oceanic serpentinization, followed by interaction with host metasediments during subduction burial. Here we define the element exchange process in the Gagnone mélange by means of the B, Sr and Pb isotope analysis of its main lithologies (<b>ultramafic,</b> <b>mafic</b> rocks and paragneiss). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios of ultramafic rocks (0. 7090 – 0. 7124 and 18. 292 – 18. 837, respectively) show enrichments in radiogenic Sr and Pb after exchange with the host paraschist (up to 0. 7287 87 Sr/ 86 Sr; 18. 751 206 Pb/ 204 Pb). The δ 11 B values of peridotites (down to − 10 ‰) point to a combined effect of (1) 11 B release to deserpentinization fluids (serpentinized protoliths likely had positive δ 11 B and lower radiogenic Sr, Pb), and of (2) exchange with fluids from the surrounding metasediments. The whole Gagnone rock-suite is finally overprinted by retrograde fluids that essentially bring to an increase in radiogenic Pb (about 19. 0 206 Pb/ 204 Pb) and to values of 0. 710 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and of − 10 ‰ δ 11 B. The recognition of different stages of interaction between mantle rocks and sedimentary/crustal reservoirs allows us to define the geochemical effects related to the early coupling of such rocks along the plate-interface. Our study shows that ultramafic rocks involved in subduction-zone metamorphism and serpentinization uptake radiogenic Pb and Sr released by associated sedimentary reservoirs. The exchange process envisioned here is not only representative of subduction mélanges: it can also be a proxy of mass transfer between slab and serpentinized supra-subduction mantle, as occurs in forearcs. Dehydration of the Gagnone-type serpentinized mantle releases crust-derived components to arcs, without direct involvement of metasediment dehydration and/or melting in subarc environments. The retention of appreciable amounts of fluid-mobile elements, radiogenic Pb and Sr in dehydrated Gagnone peridotites has implications on element recycling in the deep Earth’s mantle...|$|E

It {{is now clear that}} Dmss/liquid for all the elements show a strong dependence on the S content of the run in S-undersaturated and S-saturated runs. However, in S-oversaturated runs the S content of the run does not appear to influence Dmss/liq. The greater precision of the PMP data establishes that in S-oversaturated runs Dmss/liq at 1000 °C are consistently higher than those at 1100 °C. In contrast, Dmss/liq in the S-undersaturated and S-saturated runs are similar at both temperatures. This difference in behaviour is thought to arise because in the S-undersaturated and S-saturated runs the amount of S in the mss is controlled by the S content of the run. As the S content in the mss increases, the number of vacancies {{in the structure of the}} mss also increases, and Dmss/liq rises. In contrast, in S-oversaturated runs the mss has absorbed the maximum amount of S and thus the S content of the run no longer influences the structure of the mss and hence does not control Dmss/liq. Thus, the effect of temperature on Dmss/liqonly becomes apparent in the S-oversaturated runs. The tendency for Os, Ir, Ru and Rh to partition into mss and the exclusion of Cu, Pt and Pd from mss maybe used to explain a number of phenomena; the zonation of massive sulphide bodies, the tendency for Os, Ir, Ru and to a lesser extent Rh to be enriched in cumulates with minor sulphides, and the presence of two types of sulphides in mantle nodules (an Os-Ir -rich mss and Cu-Pd rich pentlandite). The tendency of sulphide liquids to crystallize RuOsIr and Pt-Fe minerals at low f S 2 may explain the enrichment of RuOsIr in <b>ultramafic</b> <b>mafic</b> cumulate rocks in the following manner. Sulphide solubility increases as pressures falls. Thus, sulphide droplets in rising basalt magma could be partly resorbed. The PGM could crystallize from this liquid. If these PGM survive long enough, then they could be incorporated into the early cumulate phases such as olivine and chromite. This would explain both the presence of PGM in many olivine and chromite cumulates and the tendency of more evolved magmas to have high Pd/Ir ratios...|$|E
50|$|Regionally, several subvolcanic lopolithic layered {{intrusions}} {{have been}} identified from mapping and drilling. These are interpreted to represent the feeder conduits to extrusive <b>ultramafic</b> and <b>mafic</b> igneous rocks stratigraphically higher in the belt. Examples include the Medcalf Ultramafic Intrusion, a 3.5 km long, ~1 km thick pile of gabbroic to pyroxenitic cumulates which contain subeconomic stratiform vanadiferous magnetite deposits.|$|R
25|$|Gneisses are the {{predominant}} rocks in Attappadi. All rock types of Attappadi other than supracrustals could be categorized into seven broad types. They are charnockite, hornblende gneiss, migmaititic amphibolite, quartz biotite gneiss, quartz-feldspathic gneiss, biotite granite gneiss, and pegmatite. Among the rock types charnockite, hornblende gneiss, migmatitic amphibolite, quartz biotite gneiss, quartz-feldspathic gneiss, and biotite granite gneiss {{have been identified}} that belong to the Peninsular Gneissic Complex. The granite and pegmatite of Attappadi represent the post-kinematic intrusives. Many dolerite dykes also have been reported from this area. The bands and layers of <b>ultramafics</b> and <b>mafic</b> rocks (<b>Ultramafic</b> and <b>mafic</b> rocks represented by metapyroxinite, talc-tremolite-actinolite schist and amphibolites) of varying dimension, BIF, sillimamite/kyanite bearing quartzite and fuchsite quartzite occurring within the Peninsular Gneissic Complex of Attappadi area designated as Attappadi Supracrustals. Remnants and enclaves of Attappadi supracrustals occur within the gneisses. BIF is another important rock type occurring in close association with the metapyroxinite and amphibolites.|$|R
5000|$|Sulfide type nickel {{deposits}} {{are formed}} in {{essentially the same}} manner as platinum deposits. Nickel is a chalcophile element which prefers sulfides, so an <b>ultramafic</b> or <b>mafic</b> rock which has a sulfide phase in the magma may form nickel sulfides. The best nickel deposits are formed where sulfide accumulates in the base of lava tubes or volcanic flows [...] - [...] especially komatiite lavas.|$|R
