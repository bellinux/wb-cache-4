5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full Cushion {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers {{were designed to}} be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors {{similar to those found}} on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} passenger-carrying CMV (e.g., commercial and city buses, passenger vans, and school buses) {{for more than}} 10hours, or to drive after having been on-duty for 15hours. The 5-hour difference between the 10-hour driving limit and the 15-hour on-duty limit gives drivers {{the opportunity to take}} care of non-driving work-related duties such as loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> and luggage, and fueling the vehicle, as well as non-working duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing a 10 to 15-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 8hours off-duty.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010 a {{proposal}} was unveiled by then-Mayor Jerry Sanders and philanthropist Irwin M. Jacobs {{to divert traffic}} away from the central Prado areas of the park, such as the Plaza de Panama {{in front of the}} Art Museum and the California Quadrangle in front of the Museum of Man, and restore the areas to pedestrian use. The plan would provide replacement parking via a two-level parking garage {{at the site of the}} current Spreckles Organ Pavilion parking lot. The plan also called for changes in access to the park via the Cabrillo Bridge. The bridge would become one-way, eastbound only, so that people could enter the park via the Cabrillo Bridge but could exit only via Park Boulevard. Inbound traffic would be deflected via a new bridge offramp through the current Alcazar Gardens parking lot toward the new parking garage. The Alcazar Gardens parking lot would be for disabled parking only and for loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> The new parking garage would house 750–900 cars and would be landscaped on top. The plan became controversial because of its alteration to the appearance of the bridge and the possibility of charging for parking in the parking garage. In July 2012 the City Council voted to proceed with the Jacobs plan. Construction was due to begin in October 2012 and be completed in time for the park's centennial in 2015. However, the scheduled start of construction was pushed back to February 2013 due to a legal challenge from the Save Our Heritage Organization (SOHO). In February 2013 a judge voided the project, after which Jacobs withdrew his offer to finance it. Since the Park's master plan already called for removing the 67-space parking lot from the Plaza de Panama, the city went ahead with that portion of the proposal, removing all parking from the plaza and converting it into a pedestrian area with tree planters, seats, and tables.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{feature of}} the station is that in addition, it has a second {{southern}} platform {{that would have allowed}} a quicker <b>unload</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> from the centrebound areas. However, its use has been discontinued in 1985 and in turn a second, western vestibule was built in 1990. However, during the winter months it is closed and the space is used otherwise.|$|R
5000|$|Mississauga Transit has {{an active}} bus fleet of 443 units: 340 regular 40-foot buses, 67 60-foot {{articulated}} buses, and 36 32-foot minibuses. MiWay operates only fully wheelchair-accessible buses (...) however, some routes {{are still not}} designated as accessible {{due to the lack}} of bus stop pads for safe loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> disabled <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{original}} 1976 Marriott's Great America ride, Orleans Orbit, and renamed [...] "Orbit", {{took its}} final spin in August 2016. While resembling a Ferris wheel, it delivers {{a far different}} ride experience. The entire wheel rests flat, just above ground level, to allow simultaneous loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> all <b>passenger</b> cabins. Once riders are locked in, the wheel begins to rotate. The spinning wheel picks up speed and is lifted on an arm to a nearly vertical position, sending riders upside-down as they go over the highest point. [...] "Enterprise" [...] is the common industry name for such a ride.|$|R
2500|$|As {{railways}} {{began to}} be completed {{along the banks of}} the Columbia, the steamboats, tied to the river which required too much loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> and cargo, proved to be unable to compete, and one by one they were taken off the Middle River. [...] The turn of the Hassalo came on Saturday, May 26, 1888, under the command of Captain James W. Troup. [...] The event had been announced well in advance, and three thousand people gathered {{along the banks of the}} Columbia to watch. [...] The channel through the Cascades was six miles (10km) long.|$|E
50|$|Most {{airports}} have groundcrew {{handling the}} loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers,</b> crew, baggage and other services. Some groundcrew {{are linked to}} specific airlines operating at the airport.|$|E
50|$|LSS Aerial Port ensures safe {{loading and}} <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> and cargo at home station and ensures {{compliance}} with Dangerous Goods Regulations at all aerial ports where SAC C-17s pick up cargo from.|$|E
30|$|The Station {{subsystem}} performs two functions—respectively interface and storage—firstly, {{for passengers}} and secondly, for vehicles. With regard to passengers, the interface function links a particular service line (route) {{to all the}} other transport services (another route or another mode), whilst the storage function concentrates travellers within vehicles or waiting areas prior to vehicle loading. As regards the vehicles, the interface function separates the upstream and downstream parts of the route, hinging around the <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> alighting <b>passengers</b> and the loading of boarding passengers; the storage function pertains to the division of platforms and tracks within the station between vehicles {{on the basis of their}} real-time allocation (operational service or temporary immobilisation).|$|R
50|$|The Port of Tilbury lies on {{the north}} shore of the River Thames, 25 mi {{downstream}} of London Bridge, at a point where the river makes a loop southwards, and where its width narrows to 800 yd. The loop is part of the Thames lower reaches: within the meander was a huge area of marshland. Gravesend on the opposite shore had long been a port of entry for shipping, all of which had used the river itself for loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> cargo and <b>passengers.</b> There was also a naval dockyard at Northfleet. The new deepwater docks were an extension of all that maritime activity.|$|R
50|$|In the Southern region, {{the early}} units were {{replaced}} in the 1950s and 60s with new slam-door third-rail electric units, {{first of all}} the compartment commuter units '4-SUB' and '4-EPB' (BR Class 415) and later the much more comfortable longer distance trains which survived in use until {{the early years of}} the 21st century. These included the '4-CIG' British Rail Class 421), '4-CEP' (British Rail Class 411) and '4-VEP' (British Rail Class 423); the former two being fairly similar while the latter was designed with more crowded seats and more doors to enable faster <b>unloading</b> and loading <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A new {{control tower}} {{is in the}} {{planning}} and approval stage. Future plans also call for construction of a jet bridge to facilitate loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> from large aircraft without being exposed to the weather.|$|E
50|$|Fisherman's Wharf {{was built}} by the Pacific Coast Steamship Company in 1870 for the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> and goods. The wharf was also used by other {{commercial}} operations, {{and the city of}} Monterey took ownership in 1913. The wharf was expanded through 1920.|$|E
50|$|The ABC {{system also}} allows {{self-levelling}} suspension, which raises or lowers the vehicle {{in response to}} changing load (i.e. the loading or <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> or cargo). Each vehicle equipped with ABC has an “ABC Sport” button that allows the driver to adjust the suspension range for different driving style preferences. This feature allows the driver to adjust the suspension to maintain a more level ride in more demanding driving conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{agreement}} {{was signed in}} Zagreb, Croatia on 22 November 1998 and followed by a protocol of 11 December 2001 further regulating the issue. The agreement provides for unobstructed transit of vehicles with Croatian license plates and documents traveling from and to Croatian territory, prohibits loading or <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> goods or <b>passengers</b> and changes <b>of</b> mode of transportation except in cases of traffic accidents or vehicle breakdowns, but it does allow officials of the Bosnia and Herzegovina to prohibit transit of goods whose import is not permitted due to health concerns. The agreement finally provides that it shall be in force as long as Ploče Agreement, regulating use of the Port of Ploče by Bosnia and Herzegovina, is implemented.|$|R
30|$|It is {{also clear}} that there are often gaps in the {{timetables}} of metro systems, which would allow a dedicated freight train to operate. Due to issues with safety and speed <b>of</b> <b>unloading,</b> combining <b>passengers</b> and freight on the same train would be unrealistic; however, with careful planning, it would often be possible to run a dedicated freight train and cause no disruption to passenger transport. This must be the case if such a system is to succeed, and great care must be taken to achieve minimal passenger disruption.|$|R
50|$|A double yellow line {{means no}} stopping. This means that <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> goods and {{alighting}} <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> is not permitted.|$|R
50|$|Hodge's {{operates}} a 25 vehicle fleet {{of various sizes}} ranging from 16 to 70 seater vehicles, they specialise in corporate transport, private hire and home to school transport and club/society travel. The 57 seater MANs are a popular vehicle on school swimming contracts and as shuttle vehicles between venues, {{this may be due}} to the high seating capacity and the front and rear kerbside doors which allows for easier loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being used {{at the end of}} vehicle trip, layovers can be scheduled at timing points during the trip, in which case they are often referred to as loading/unloading time. In this case, they serve as extra time provided for the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers,</b> which is most often scheduled at busy stops. They also allow time to pass if a service is running early, to prevent arriving at a timing point ahead of schedule.|$|E
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} the station {{is that it has}} a second {{platform}} for eastbound trains. When the station was the line's terminus, this was used for quicker <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> who were traveling from the centre to save the congestion in the small vestibules during peak hours (which were operating entry only). However, after the extension to Lisova in 1979, the passenger traffic fell rapidly and this arrangement was discontinued, although the platform itself remains.|$|E
50|$|A triple variant was custom {{designed}} for the Marriott Corporation, each ride had three main components: the wheels with their passenger cars; a set of supporting arms; and a single central supporting column. Each wheel rotated {{about the end of}} its own supporting arm. The arms in turn would either pivot or rotate together as a single unit about the top of the supporting column. The axis about which the rotating arms turned was offset from vertical, so that as the arms rotated, each arm and its corresponding wheel was raised and lowered. This allowed one wheel to be horizontal at ground level, and brought to a standstill for simultaneous loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> all its <b>passenger</b> cars, while the other wheel(s) continued to rotate vertically at considerable height.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{services}} provided {{at the station}} is only embarkment and disembarkment <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> for commuter and regional lines. There is no loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> luggage.|$|R
500|$|The {{squadron}} operates eight Boeing C-17 GlobemasterIIIs, {{the first}} of which entered service in December 2006. The eighth and last was delivered in November 2015. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, the latter being responsible for the loading, carriage and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> cargo or <b>passengers.</b> The C-17 can carry 70 tonnes of equipment, and is large enough to accommodate helicopters, tanks and other military vehicles. It can also carry over 130 passengers, and is designed for aerial despatch of paratroops or cargo. The C-17 has a range of some [...] and is able to operate from short and unsealed airstrips. Flown with a joystick and fly-by-wire controls, the aircraft is also highly manoeuvrable and responsive considering its size.

40|$|Abstract: Rationalisation is {{the process}} of using logic, {{academic}} reason and criteria in order to make judgment on policies, among other matters. There is a need to decongest EDSA, the main artery of the National Capital Region. One of the primary causes of the traffic problems is the disorganized loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> bus <b>passengers.</b> This study aims to provide rational criteria on designating bus stop locations along EDSA in order to aid {{in the development of a}} sustainable stop policy. GIS and statistical analysis are used to analyze service area parameters and relate them to bus transit use. Microcomputer simulation and prediction equations from multi-linear regression are generated and utilized to evaluate the criteria developed. A sound, rational ranking and weighting criteria was formulated and proposed. Simulations show drastic improvements in bus performance and prediction equations reveal consistent results with the hypothesized effects of service area parameters. Aside from the significant improvement that the criteria can ensue, the methodology may be replicated in other thoroughfares throughout the country. Moreover, the prediction equations generated are useful in determining future boarding and alighting patterns along EDSA. Lastly, these prediction equations establish that land use class areas are significantly related to trip generation...|$|R

50|$|Noorduyn's bush plane design {{revolved}} around {{a few basic}} criteria: {{it should be an}} aircraft with which a Canadian operator utilizing existing talents, equipment, and facilities could make money; it should be a high-wing monoplane to facilitate loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> and cargo at seaplane docks and airports; and it should be an all-around superior aircraft to those currently in use in Canada. The final design layout looked much like one of the Fokker models with all-welded steel tubing fuselage structure and wood stringers were applied to it for attachment of a fabric skin. The wing was all-wood construction and fabric-covered except for the flaps and ailerons, which were made of welded steel tubing. The resulting utility bush plane, known as the Norseman, flew {{for the first time in}} 1936. Since then it has been used as both a military and civil cargo aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|In 1851, a site {{north of}} Naughten Street {{and east of}} High Street was {{purchased}} jointly from Orange Johnson by the Columbus and Xenia Railroad (C&X) and Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad (CC&C). A wood barn structure measuring 90 by 175 ft was installed to serve passengers, {{the rest of the}} site given over to shops and freight tracks. The station had three tracks for loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> In 1853, the Central Ohio Railroad entered the city and connected to the station. In 1864, the Steubenville and Indiana Railroad was connected the Central Ohio at Newark, and entered the station on shared tracks. This road was called the [...] "panhandle route" [...] because it crossed the panhandle of West Virginia on its way east. The station was inadequate and in 1868 the railroads formed the Union Depot Company to undertake a replacement.|$|E

40|$|Transport {{system is}} a whole {{composed}} of technical, technological, organisational, economic and legislative elements with the aim to perform transfer, loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> goods and <b>passengers.</b> Taking in consideration that most economic activities demand participation of certain transport system elements, any economic growth is impossible without an adequate transport system development. In order to secure environmental sustainable economic growth the economic policy subjects have to {{pay special attention to}} those parts of economy whose negative impact on environment cannot be neglected. One of them is transport. The influence of transport on environment consists in emission of gasses, smokes, noise and visual degradation of nature. A part of economic system that is extremely sensitive regarding environmental devastation is tourism. At the same time the efficiency of tourism strongly depends of the level of transport system development. On the example of interdependence of transport system and tourism in the Adriatic region the possibility of optimising the balance between these economic activities will be examined. ...|$|R
30|$|According to the {{information}} provided by NRC, the rail system between Iddo and Ijoko/Kajawla comprises 25 train stations. These stations are all stopping points for the transit service and are principally used for the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> goods and <b>passengers.</b> Some <b>of</b> these stations have multiple-track facilities for coach attachment and detachment. The MTT is generally considered as the economy train because of its cheaper fare charges, the number of coaches hauled and the seating capacity. The DMU, on the other hand, is considered as a first-class train because of the air-conditioned coaches, small number of coaches hauled and reduced seating capacity which make it more expensive. The rail service operates from Monday through Saturday and runs three shifts: morning (06 : 00 – 14 : 00), afternoon (14 : 00 – 22 : 00) and night (22 : 00 – 06 : 00) shifts. As {{at the time of}} this survey, the fare charged per trip either way regardless of the boarding station was 230 naira 1 for Mass Transit Train (MTT) and 300 naira for Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) train during off peak period. However, the fare charged by the DMU during the peak period (06 : 00 – 12 : 59 and 16 : 01 – 21 : 00) could go up to as high as 750 naira.|$|R
