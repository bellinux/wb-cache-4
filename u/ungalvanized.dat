40|$|Ring-shank nails {{are used}} in {{engineered}} structures with lateral connection design values based on theoretically derived equations which were validated only for common nails. The goal {{of this study was}} to quantify the input parameters and lateral connection strength of several types of ring-shank nails in Southern Pine lumber and critically evaluate the applicability of the theoretical equations for ring-shank nails. Two sizes of galvanized and <b>ungalvanized,</b> hardened steel ring-shank nails from two manufacturers were studied. The hardened, ring-shank nails carried significantly higher loads than the common wire nails studied. Because the current method of determining yield load does not give adequate credit to hardened, ring-shank nails, an alternate method is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Ring-shank nails {{are used}} {{extensively}} in post-frame construction {{due to their}} superior performance, yet surprisingly little testing {{has been done on}} nail sizes above 12 d. Experience in the post-frame industry suggests that published allowable design values for ring-shank nails may be overly conservative and need revision. The goal of the research reported herein was to characterize the withdrawal strength of ring-shank nails embedded in Southern Pine lumber. Three sizes ofgalvanized and <b>ungalvanized</b> (bright) ring-shank nails from two manufacturers were studied. Ring-shank nails had approximately twice the withdrawal resistance of smooth-shank nails of the same diameter. Galvanizing slightly reduced withdrawal strength (approximately 8 %) due to partial filling of the threads. Nail head pull-through was studied as a possible failure mode. Even allowing for galvanizing and head pull-through, strong evidence is presentedfor increasing withdrawal design valuesfor ring-shank nails...|$|E
40|$|Steel wires {{coated with}} {{thermoplastics}} {{have found a}} wider range of application in the field of science and engineering. However, steel-polymer interfaces frequently suffer from poor adhesion strength that is undermining their long-term stability under external stress because of weak interaction between the steel and polymer surfaces. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the influence of adhesive (Chemlok 213 and Cilbond 49 SF) on the adhesion strength of galvanized and <b>ungalvanized</b> steel wire coating with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Surface treatments including grinding with sandpaper, thermal oxidation and degreasing with alkaline solution were done on the steel wire substrate prior to coating by compression molding and extrusion process. The adhesion was characterized with a single wire pullout test and field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM). The experimental results confirmed that Cilbond 49 SF adhesive with sandpaper grinding treated wire outperformed all other surface treatments tested. In comparison of the processes, compression molding process has an upper hand over the extrusion process because it provide an avenue for sufficient control of curing time required for optimum setting of the adhesive...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 58 - 60. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goals of this research were {{to gain a better understanding}} of the performance of ring-shank (annularly threaded) nails in lateral connections common to the post-frame industry, and to evaluate the European yield model (EYM), the basis for derivation of allowable design values, for ring-shank nails. Inputs to the EYM include nail bending yield strength, dowel bearing strength, and connection geometry. These parameters as well as single-shear connection strength were determined for nine nail groups tested in Southern Pine lumber. Nail specimens included three suppliers, two shank types (smooth and ringshank), two diameters (3. 76 and 4. 50 mm), and two coatings (galvanized and <b>ungalvanized).</b> Ring-shank nails averaged 85 % higher nail bending yield strength than the common nails for all but two groups. A regression model relating dowel bearing strength to specific gravity was developed based on tests with the nine nail groups loaded parallel-to-grain in Southern Pine. A statistically significant reduction in dowel bearing strength was observed for 4. 50 compared to 3. 76 mm diameter nails. While ring-shank nail connection maximum loads were roughly twice that of common nails for the same diameter, no significant differences were observed for yield loads. The current yield load definition is based on the slope of the initial portion of the load-displacement curve and does not adequately account for increases in connection strength resulting from higher steel quality. As a result, predicted yield loads based on the EYM were significantly higher than observed yield loads. A revised yield load definition is needed which includes yielding predicted by the EYM without including factors extraneous to the model. Ring-shank nails exhibited significantly higher lateral connection strengths than the common nails tested as a result of increased steel strength and gripping action of the threads. Finally, standardization in ringshank nail manufacturing must be instituted to ensure minimum steel and thread quality, before any increase in design values for ring-shank nails is implemented...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 78 - 80. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The overall goal of this research was to was {{to gain a better understanding}} of ringshank nail connections, and to critically evaluate allowable design values for withdrawal. Specific goals]Included: 1) measuring and comparing withdrawal resistances of ring-shank nails embedded in Southern pine lumber, 2) identifying candidate probability distributions for the withdrawal data, 3) critically evaluating currently published design values for withdrawal resistance of ring-shank nails, and 4) examining the failure mode of nail head pull-through. Withdrawal resistances were measured for 3. 76 mm (0. 148 in.), 4. 50 mm (0. 177 in.), and 5. 26 mm (0. 207 in.) diameter galvanized and <b>ungalvanized</b> ring-shank nails from two different manufacturers embedded in Southern pine lumber. Data were statistically evaluated to determine the effects of threading and galvanization on withdrawal resistance. Results indicated that the threading process and galvanization had significant effects on withdrawal resistance. The mean withdrawal values for the 3. 76 mm (0. 148 in.) bright and galvanized were, respectively, 64 N/mm (367 lb/in.) and 60 N/mm (343 lb/in.). The means for the 4. 50 mm (0. 177 in.) bright and galvanized nails were 76 N/mm (434 lb/in.) and 69 N/mm (396 lb/in.). The mean for the 5. 26 mm (0. 207 In.) nails was 83 N/mm (474 lb/in.). Coefficients of variation ranged from 0. 226 to 0. 269. The Welbull and lognormal were the best-fitting probability distributions for the withdrawal data. Current allowable design values were critically evaluated. If the current method of dividing the mean ultimate resistance by a factor of five to obtain design values were used, an increase of 26 % to 29 % over current design values was noticed. Using the method of 5 % parametric tolerance limit, values increased over 50 % compared to current design values. Ring-shank nails were found to have approximately twice the withdrawal resistance of smooth-shank nails of the same diameter.,Although head pull-through was found to have a slight effect on mean ultimate connection strength, the left tall of the strength distribution was not affected. From a design standpoint, head pull-through was not as significant. Current design values appeared to be conservative. Further research is needed on a variety of lumber species and nail sizes...|$|E
