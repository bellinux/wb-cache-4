500|$|The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition {{comprised}} two parties. The first, under Sir Ernest Shackleton, {{sailed to}} the Weddell Sea in the Endurance, intending {{to establish a}} base there from which a group would march across the continent via the South Pole to McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea side. A second party under Aeneas Mackintosh in Aurora would be landed at a Ross Sea base, {{with the task of}} laying supply depots along the expected route of the latter stages of Shackleton's march, a mission which Shackleton thought straightforward. [...] Shackleton [...] devoted little time to the details of the Ross Sea operation; thus, [...] on arriving in Australia to take up his appointment, Mackintosh found himself faced with an <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ship</b> and no funds to rectify the situation. Aurora, though strongly built, was 40years old and had recently returned from Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition in need of an extensive refit. After the intervention of the eminent Australian polar scientist Edgeworth David the Australian government provided money and dockyard facilities to make Aurora fit for further Antarctic service.|$|E

25|$|During the Civil War, Southard and a {{business}} associate, Cornelius Vanderbilt, were accused of endangering the lives of Union soldiers by selling the government <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ships</b> at inflated prices for the 1862 Banks expedition to New Orleans. Southard was also accused of charging an illegal 5% commission on the sales. Southard was eventually censured by Congress {{for his role in}} the scandal, but Vanderbilt escaped censure, reportedly due to his political influence.|$|R
50|$|During this period, when Rome and her allies {{had many}} {{troops in the}} field, and it was {{necessary}} to transport goods to them by sea, the state assumed all risks on behalf of private suppliers, such as Postumius and Pomponius, insuring them against all losses to their ships caused by storms. Taking advantage of their position, they outfitted <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ships</b> with small and mostly worthless cargoes, sent them to sea, then removed the crews and sank them, reporting the loss while exaggerating the value of the cargo. They also reported imaginary shipwrecks.|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s, after {{increased}} loss {{of ships}} due to overloading, a British MP, Samuel Plimsoll, {{took up the}} load line cause. A Royal Commission on <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ships</b> was established in 1872, and in 1876 the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act made the load line mark compulsory, although the positioning of the mark was not fixed by law until 1894. In 1906, laws were passed requiring foreign ships visiting British ports to be marked with a load line. It was not until 1930 (the 1930 Load Line Convention) that there was international agreement for universal application of load line regulations.|$|R
6000|$|All four had toiled {{the best}} part of six weeks getting ready; and though Captain Wicks was of course not seen or heard of, a fifth was there to help them, a fellow in a bushy red beard, which he would {{sometimes}} lay aside when he was below, and who strikingly resembled Captain Wicks in voice and character. As for Captain Kirkup, he did not appear till the last moment, when he proved to be a burly mariner, bearded like Abou Ben Adhem. All the way down the harbour and through the Heads, his milk-white whiskers blew in the wind and were conspicuous from shore; but the Currency Lass had no sooner turned her back upon the lighthouse than he went below for the inside of five seconds and reappeared clean shaven. So many doublings and devices were required to get to sea with an <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ship</b> and a captain that was [...] "wanted." [...] Nor might even these have sufficed, but for the fact that Hadden was a public character, and the whole cruise regarded with an eye of indulgence as one of Tom's engaging eccentricities. The ship, besides, had been a yacht before: and it came the more natural to allow her still some of the dangerous liberties of her old employment.|$|E
6000|$|The news of {{his death}} was {{scarcely}} a surprise and scarce a grief to me. I could not conceive my father a poor man. He had led too long a life of thoughtless and generous profusion to endure the change; and though I grieved for myself, I was able to rejoice {{that my father had}} been taken from the battle. I grieved, I say, for myself; and it is probable there were at the same date many thousands of persons grieving with less cause. I had lost my father; I had lost the allowance; my whole fortune (including what had been returned from Muskegon) scarce amounted to a thousand francs; and, to crown my sorrows, the statuary contract had changed hands. The new contractor had a son of his own, or else a nephew; and it was signified to me, with business-like plainness, that I must find another market for my pigs. In the meanwhile I had given up my room, and slept on a truckle-bed {{in the corner of the}} studio, where, as I read myself to sleep at night, and when I awoke in the morning, that now useless bulk, the Genius of Muskegon, was ever present to my eyes. Poor stone lady! born to be enthroned under the gilded, echoing dome of the new capitol, whither was she now to drift? for what base purposes be ultimately broken up, like an <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ship?</b> and what should befall her ill-starred artificer, standing with his thousand francs on the threshold of a life so hard as that of the unbefriended sculptor? ...|$|E

25|$|One {{explanation}} for the alleged size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely for a display of imperial power by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats on the Yangtze River when on court business, including when reviewing Zheng He's actual expedition fleet. The Yangtze River, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable for such large but <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ships.</b> Zheng He {{would not have had}} the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships. The largest ships of Zheng He's fleet were the 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons.|$|R

50|$|This {{came too}} late for the {{concentration}} camp prisoners within the area who were now within Dönitz's nominal authority, while under the actual control of the SS. These had numbered around 10,000 when Dönitz assumed the Presidency; mainly former inmates of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg, which had been shut down in preparation for the surrender of the city to the British. Between 16 and 28 April, the prisoners had been moved eastwards and concealed by the SS in a flotilla of <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ships</b> anchored in the Bay of Lubeck, where they then remained without food or medical attention. At the time, this action had been protested by Rear Admiral Konrad Englehardt on Dönitz's staff, but when the Flensburg government came into being, Dönitz made no attempt to free the prisoners, and his government avoided any subsequent acknowledgement that they had known they were there. On 3 May 1945, the prison flotilla was sunk by the Royal Air Force in the mistaken belief that the ships were being prepared to evacuate leading SS personnel. Over 7,000 prisoners drowned, mainly on the former liner Cap Arcona.|$|R

Some of the party were last-minute additions: Adrian Donnelly, a railway engineer who had never been to sea, became Auroras second engineering officer, while Lionel Hooke, the wireless operator, was an 18-year-old apprentice. Auroras chief officer was Joseph Stenhouse, from the British India Steam Navigation Company. Stenhouse, who was 26 years old when he joined the expedition, was in Australia recovering from a bout of depression when he heard of Shackletons plans, and had travelled to London to secure the Aurora post. Although as a boy he had been inspired by the polar exploits of Fridtjof Nansen, Scott and William Speirs Bruce, Stenhouse had no direct experience of Antarctic waters or ice conditions.|$|E

60|$|The {{prevailing}} weather of the North Atlantic {{is typical}} {{of the way in which}} the West Wind rules his realm on which the sun never sets. North Atlantic is the heart of a great empire. It is the part of the West Wind's dominions most thickly populated with generations of fine ships and hardy men. Heroic deeds and adventurous exploits have been performed there, within the very stronghold of his sway. The best sailors in the world have been born and bred under the shadow of his sceptre, learning to manage their ships with skill and audacity before the steps of his stormy throne. Reckless adventurers, toiling fishermen, admirals as wise and brave as the world has ever known, have waited upon the signs of his westerly sky. Fleets of victorious ships have hung upon his breath. He has tossed in his hand squadrons of war-scarred three-deckers, and shredded out in mere sport the bunting of flags hallowed in the traditions of honour and glory. He is a good friend and a dangerous enemy, without mercy to <b>unseaworthy</b> <b>ships</b> and faint- hearted seamen. In his kingly way he has taken but little account of lives sacrificed to his impulsive policy; he is a king with a double-edged sword bared in his right hand. The East Wind, an interloper in the dominions of Westerly weather, is an impassive- faced tyrant with a sharp poniard held behind his back for a treacherous stab.|$|R

25|$|A Lloyd's surveyor, Captain Arundel, and {{the manager}} of the State Implement Works, Frank Shaw, {{declared}} her seaworthy to return to Fremantle. But the crew distrusted her condition and demanded to be paid a premium to work her back to Fremantle. The SSS summonsed each crew member for refusal of duty, so the Police Court Bench obtained an independent survey of the ship by Captain Mills, wharfinger of Carnarvon. Mills declared the <b>ship</b> <b>unseaworthy</b> so the magistrates dismissed the case.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 January 1944, after repairs at Havannah Harbor, Efate, New Caledonia, Seid got {{underway}} to Nouméa and resumed her escort duties with the 3rd Fleet. A week later, she sustained severe damage to frames, longitudinals, and equipment during a typhoon. While serious, {{the damage was}} not sufficient to make the <b>ship</b> <b>unseaworthy.</b> She continued her escorting duties as scheduled, except, having been blown off course, for missing a rendezvous with [...] Seid arrived at Port Purvis, Florida Island, on 23 January for storm damage repair.|$|R
50|$|An {{earthquake}} strikes {{suddenly and}} begins to destroy the colony, and everyone flees in the only intact boat just before the entire island sinks into the sea. The refugees set sail for their original port, but a storm renders the <b>ship</b> <b>unseaworthy</b> once again and they must pull in to a different port. A ship bound for England is docked there and the Rigondas soon arrange for their passage home to England. The novel ends as the children are finally reunited with their parents, who are none too eager to hear their tales of adventure.|$|R
50|$|When the new Secretary of the Navy, Richard W. Thompson, assumed office, he {{appointed}} {{an ad hoc}} naval board to review the monitor contracts. The board concluded that the work Roach had done on Puritan was first-class, and {{that the price of}} the contracts had been reasonable; however, it averred that the extra weight of the armored belts would render the <b>ship</b> <b>unseaworthy.</b> Roach scoffed at the latter conclusion, but two further naval inquiries confirmed the findings of the first, as a result of which the government refused to honor the contracts.|$|R

Nisbet spoke to him about the <b>unseaworthy</b> way the <b>ship</b> was repaired. McGregor agreed, and went ashore. The next day Nisbet and six of the crew left three days before the Jacatra was posted to sail, {{and the rest of the}} crew followed. The captain, mate, second mate, cook, and {{carpenter}} were left on board. Nevertheless, the Jacatra arrived in Sydney on 15 November 1857 without Malcolm McGregor on board.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{explanation}} for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable {{for a number of}} reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered. Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become <b>unseaworthy.</b> That the <b>ship</b> was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something else could have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.|$|R
50|$|The Bermuda Regiment also {{provided}} a cordon at the Bermuda International Airport in October, 1996, when the Chinese ship, Xing Da, {{was brought to the}} island. The ship had been detained on the Atlantic by the United States Coast Guard carrying over a hundred illegal migrants with the intent of smuggling them into Massachusetts. It was intended to transfer the passengers and crew to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, but the <b>ship</b> was deemed <b>unseaworthy.</b> Taking the <b>ship</b> into a US port to transfer the detainees to Cuba was undesirable as the US Government would have then been obliged to allow any who requested to enter the process for asylum application. The only other port within reach was Bermuda, roughly 640 miles from North Carolina and 1,061.4 miles from Guantanamo Bay. As the UK Government was wary of allowing the detainees to set foot on British territory for the same reason, the ship was kept offshore while the two governments negotiated. A Company of the Bermuda Regiment was embodied, pending the outcome. On the 9th of October, it provided a cordon to close off the Weapons Pier of the former United States Navy NAS Bermuda, while Bermuda Government ferry boats brought the detainees into Castle Harbour. Bermuda Police and US Coast Guard powerboats transferred the detainees to the Weapons Pier, where they were handcuffed and loaded, one-by-one, aboard waiting US Coast Guard C-130 Hercules, with each aeroplane taking off and heading for Cuba {{as soon as it was}} full.|$|R
2500|$|As Decatur {{approached}} the berthed Philadelphia he encountered a light wind {{that made his}} approach tedious. He had to casually position his ship close enough to Philadelphia to allow his men to board while not creating any suspicion. When the two vessels were finally close enough, Catalano obtained permission for Decatur to tie Intrepid to the captured Philadelphia. Decatur surprised the few Tripolitans on board when he shouted the order [...] "board!", signaling to the hidden crew below to emerge and storm the captured ship. Without losing a single man, Decatur and 60 of his men, dressed as Maltese sailors or Arab seamen and armed with swords and boarding pikes, boarded and reclaimed Philadelphia in less than 10 minutes, killing at least 20 of the Tripolitan crew, capturing one wounded crewman, and forcing the rest to flee by jumping overboard. Only one of Decatur's men was slightly wounded by a saber blade. There was hope that the small boarding crew could launch the captured ship, but the vessel was in no condition to set sail for the open sea. Decatur soon realized that the small Intrepid could not tow the larger and heavier warship out of the harbor. Commodore Preble's order to Decatur was to destroy the ship where she berthed as a last resort, if Philadelphia was <b>unseaworthy.</b> With the <b>ship</b> secure, Decatur's crew began placing combustibles about Philadelphia with orders to set her ablaze. After making sure the fire was large enough to sustain itself, Decatur ordered his men to abandon the ship and was the last man to leave Philadelphia. [...] As the flames intensified, the guns aboard Philadelphia, all loaded and ready for battle, became heated and began discharging, some firing into the town and shore batteries, while the ropes securing the ship burned off, allowing the vessel to drift into the rocks at the western entrance of the harbor.|$|R
