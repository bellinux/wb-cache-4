5|$|There is {{a yearly}} 45-day ban on fishery with motorboats in the region. The fishing ban {{for the year}} 2012 was {{effective}} during the months of April–May. The jetty at Rameswaram is the largest landing centre for fishing boats {{in the region and}} it <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> alive after the ban, with the arrival of fishermen, boat captains, shore workers and others from their native places.|$|E
5|$|Siward can {{be found}} {{witnessing}} numerous charters during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A Dux ("earl") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two charters in 1050, {{and this may be}} Siward. There is another attestation in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at Lincoln—between Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.|$|E
5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the {{beginning}} of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E
50|$|T. alni {{produces}} a distinctive tongue-like growth which derives {{mainly from the}} ovarian tissues of the alder catkin or from the bracteoles. These alder pseudocones may carry several tongue galls, each of which <b>usually</b> appear to <b>come</b> from the same position; those curling down <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> from the bracteoles tissues and those projecting upwards <b>usually</b> <b>come</b> from ovarian tissues.|$|R

25|$|This fast {{response}} {{has led to}} suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight, {{because they can be}} used to detect sudden changes in which way is up (because light, especially UV light which is absorbed by vegetation, <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> from above).|$|E
25|$|Paget-Schroetter {{disease is}} the {{obstruction}} of an upper extremity vein (such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein) by a thrombus. The condition <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> to light after vigorous exercise and usually presents in younger, otherwise healthy people. Men are affected more than women.|$|E
25|$|A TV dinner (also called {{prepackaged}} meal, ready-made meal, ready meal, frozen dinner, frozen {{meal and}} microwave meal) is a pre-packaged frozen or chilled meal that <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> {{as an individual}} portion. It requires very little preparation and contains all the elements for a single-serving meal.|$|E

25|$|The Speaker <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> {{from among}} MPs of the {{governing}} party. But {{because he or she}} cannot vote unless his or her vote would break a tie and by convention must vote {{to maintain the status quo}} (which includes voting confidence in the government), a minority government can slightly weaken the opposition's power by electing an opposition speaker.|$|E
25|$|Students {{then take}} a driving test. If they pass, a driver's licence is granted; it <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> by mail a few days later. Until then newly {{licensed}} drivers are given a temporary licence (valid for a year). The licences are issued by the Swedish Transport Agency. For both tests a fully valid identity document is needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{road vehicle}} loading ramp in Dereham yard is {{frequently}} used by mainline train operators to load damaged rolling stock onto road vehicles. Such rolling stock <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> at night (via {{the connection with}} the mainline at Wymondham) at slow speed (sometimes on wheelskates) from Crown Point depot in Norwich (where no road-rail loading facilities are available) for onward road movement to specialist repair facilities around the country.|$|E

25|$|The given name(s) {{normally}} {{comes before}} the surname. However, in {{a list of}} people sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> first. Hence some people may also use this order in spoken language (e.g. introducing themselves as Kowalski Jan instead of Jan Kowalski), but this is generally considered incorrect or a throwback to the Communist era when this order was sometimes heard in official situations. In many formal situations, the given name is omitted altogether.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother. This may be due to a nondisjunction in the father. Meiotic errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father. Isochromosome X or ring chromosome X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents. Overall, the functional X chromosome <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> from the mother.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{fertilizer}} and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, eutrophication often occurs in waterways {{affected by this}} type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of algae blooms that soon consume most of the oxygen. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication. Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as stream pools and the pools behind dams, weirs, and some drop structures. Eutrophication <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.|$|E

25|$|Psychobilly guitarists often play rockabilly-style hollowbody archtop guitars with f-holes and a tremolo bar. Guitarists {{may play}} punk-style power chords one moment, and then shift into rockabilly-style fingerpicking and rockabilly guitar-style seventh chords. Notes are often bent, either by pulling the string down or {{by using the}} tremolo bar. Gretsch hollowbody guitars are a popular choice. Guitarists often use 1950s-style tube {{amplifiers}} such as by makers such as Fender and {{it is common to}} see stacks of two speaker cabinets. As with rockabilly guitarists, the overdrive tone <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> from what is produced naturally by overdriving the tube amp, rather than by plugging into a distortion pedal.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{normally}} reserved for complications of Crohn's disease or when disease that resists treatment with drugs {{is confined to}} one location that can be removed. Surgery {{is often used to}} manage complications of Crohn's disease, including fistulae, small bowel obstruction, colon cancer, small intestine cancer and fibrostenotic strictures, when strictureplasty (expansion of the stricture) is sometimes performed. Otherwise, and for other complications, resection and anastomosis – the removal of the affected section of intestine and the rejoining of the healthy sections – is the surgery usually performed for Crohn's disease (e.g., ileocolonic resection). None of these surgeries cure or eliminate Crohn's disease, as the disease eventually comes back in healthy segments of the intestine, although when Crohn's disease recurs after surgery, it <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> back {{at the site of the}} surgery.|$|E
25|$|A {{rear spoiler}} <b>usually</b> <b>comes</b> {{standard}} in most sports vehicles and resembles {{the shape of}} a raised wing {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The main purpose of a rear spoiler in a vehicle's design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A rear spoiler design that stands off the rear deck lid will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the coefficient of drag. Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of reduced lift are not required.|$|E
