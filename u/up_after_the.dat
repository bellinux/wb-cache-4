5|$|Tallon's {{little left}} finger swelled <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Third Test and he {{exacerbated}} the injury during a tour match against Middlesex.

5|$|After a {{match in}} the Cincinnati Gardens, Costello's hip was damaged when an enraged fan threw a fire {{extinguisher}} from the balcony. Costello had hip replacement surgery later that year.

5|$|As the Golden Path secures Kyrat's {{southern}} provinces, Ajay is {{contacted by}} Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary {{in exchange for}} killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, {{and that he was}} sent to clean <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on debut and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position. Laker, the off spinner, replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{continued}} to see {{service in the}} Greek fleet until the early 1930s, with Kilkis serving as the flagship of the fleet. In 1932, Lemnos was disarmed and used as a barracks ship, and Kilkis {{was reduced to a}} training ship. Lemnos was used as a barracks ship after 1937, and Kilkis became a floating battery at Salamis Naval Base in 1940. During the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, both ships were attacked and sunk in Salamis. German Ju-87 Stuka dive-bombers bombed both ships in the harbor; Kilkis was sunk outright while Lemnos was beached to avoid sinking. Both ships were broken <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the war.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, most of Western Armenia was {{occupied}} by the Russian Empire {{as part of the}} Caucasian Campaign of World War I. In parts of the occupied areas, especially around Van, an Armenian autonomy was briefly set up. The Russian army left the region due to the Revolution of 1917. The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories from the small number of irregular Armenian units. In the Caucasus, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was set <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> February Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{appeared}} {{regularly in}} the Syfy series Haven, which started in July 2011, as Dwight Hendrickson, a troubled man whose affliction is revealed to be attracting bullets and {{who works as a}} cleaner, cleaning <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> troubles.

5|$|In El Salvador, {{heavy rains}} from the {{depression}} helped alleviate drought conditions; however, flooding also inundated 200homes in San Salvador along the Acelhuate River. Fifteen farms were inundated by flooding, five {{of which were}} destroyed. Seventy people evacuated to shelters set <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm by the local Red Cross and armed forces. Military crews were quickly deployed to help clean up the damages on September22.

5|$|On 27 November 1942, {{the ship}} was {{captured}} almost intact by the Germans when they occupied Toulon and {{was turned over to}} the Italians on 14 December. The Regia Marina redesignated her as FR 22 and she recommissioned on 19 January 1943 after Pierre Laval, head of Vichy France, agreed to transfer her on 11 January; she sailed to Taranto on 23 March where the Italians used her as a transport in Italian waters. The ship's most notable mission was when she transported former Italian Premier Benito Mussolini from Ponza Island to La Maddalena, Sardinia on 6 August. The ship was scuttled at La Spezia on 9 September 1943 following the Italian armistice and broken <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
5|$|Party Politics, {{who won the}} 1992 Grand National with partner Carl Llewellyn, {{was also}} pulled <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> water jump when in a good position. Since his Aintree victory the {{previous}} April he had run unimpressively in two chases without Llewellyn in the saddle before they were reunited to win the Greenhalls Gold Cup at Haydock in February. As defending champion, and with his jockey taking his fourth ride in a Grand National, the horse was popular with the public who had backed him down to 7/1 favourite at the start.|$|E

5|$|Pattle claimed four {{victories}} during five sorties on 14 April. One Bf 109, one Ju 88 and a Bf 110 were {{claimed as}} destroyed. His final victory was an Italian SM.79 in the afternoon. The day took his tally to 40 enemy aircraft. As {{the wreckage of}} some old Greek aircraft and a captured SM.79 was being cleared <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> attack on 13 April, John D'Albiac, Air Officer Commanding British Forces in Greece, arrived to warn him of the Allied collapse in the north.

5|$|Tallon was {{retained}} as {{the teams}} then played out a {{draw in the}} Third Test at Manchester.

5|$|The {{album is}} named after the Office of Strategic Influence, an {{organization}} set <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> September 11 attacks to spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media, among other functions.

5|$|The crime gained {{national}} notoriety for the particularly brutal way {{in which}} Pryce was murdered, only metres from his own home, and had only his Oyster card and mobile phone taken from him, but no money (the case being widely reported {{as an example of}} steaming). The murderers were later tracked down when the police examined CCTV footage of where the Oyster card was used after the murder. The crime caused a political uproar and condemnation of railway station security. The Tom ap Rhys Pryce Memorial Trust was set <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> murder, and a school was built in his honour.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} the season and overshadowed the sport. Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in the big leagues were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the Naval Reserve in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President Ed Barrow as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.|$|E
5|$|The {{organs of}} farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was {{able to continue to}} collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E
