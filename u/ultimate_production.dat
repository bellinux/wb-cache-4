(The idea of {{industrial}} production {{in rural areas}} had been attempted under Mao but with much more limited success; for instance, industrial plants in highly remote areas found their <b>ultimate</b> <b>production</b> efforts hampered.) Soon, however, an imbalance appeared where northern, interior, and western China remained at a far lower degree of economic development, a situation which persists to the 21st century. However, there are multiple, complex factors contributing to this state of affairs. For instance, distances are much farther, and geography often more challenging, in western and interior regions. Population is more spread out; social structures may also play a role, in that the demographics and social structures of these regions often differ significantly from those of coastal China.|$|E
60|$|I was frankly, {{at the end}} {{of three}} days, a very prejudiced critic, so that one morning when, in the garden, my great man had offered to read me {{something}} I quite held my breath as I listened. It was the written scheme of another book—something put aside long ago, before his illness, but that he had lately taken out again to reconsider. He had been turning it round when I came down on him, and it had grown magnificently under this second hand. Loose liberal confident, it might have passed for a great gossiping eloquent letter—the overflow into talk of an artist’s amorous plan. The theme I thought singularly rich, quite the strongest he had yet treated; and this familiar statement of it, full too of fine maturities, was really, in summarised splendour, a mine of gold, a precious independent work. I remember rather profanely wondering whether the <b>ultimate</b> <b>production</b> could possibly keep at the pitch. His reading of the fond epistle, at any rate, made me feel as if I were, for the advantage of posterity, in close correspondence with him—were the distinguished person to whom it had been affectionately addressed. It was a high distinction simply to be told such things. The idea he now communicated had all the freshness, the flushed fairness, of the conception untouched and untried: it was Venus rising from the sea and before the airs had blown upon her. I had never been so throbbingly present at such an unveiling. But when he had tossed the last bright word after the others, as I had seen cashiers in banks, weighing mounds of coin, drop a final sovereign into the tray, I knew a sudden prudent alarm.|$|E

60|$|In the {{treatment}} of a subject so vast and complex, within the limits prescribed for an essay like the present, where it is impossible not to say either {{too much or too}} little (and too much because too little), an author is entitled to make large claims on the candour of his judges. Many things he must express inaccurately, not from ignorance or oversight, but because the more precise expression would have involved the necessity of a further explanation, and this another, even to the first elements of the science. This is an inconvenience which presses on the analytic method, on however large a scale it may be conducted, compared with the synthetic; and it must bear with a tenfold weight in the present instance, where we are not permitted to avail ourselves of its usual advantages as a counterbalance to its inherent defects. I shall have done all that I dared propose to myself, or that can be justly demanded of me by others, if I have succeeded in conveying a sufficiently clear, though indistinct and inadequate notion, so as of its many results to render intelligible that one which I am to apply to my particular subject, not as a truth already demonstrated, but as an hypothesis, which pretends to no higher merit than that of explaining the particular class of phenomena to which it is applied, and asks no other reward than a presumption in favour of the general system of which it affirms itself to be a dependent though integral part. By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life, or that most general form under which Life manifests itself to us, which includes all its other forms. This I have stated to be the tendency to individuation, and the degrees or intensities of Life to consist in the progressive realization of this tendency. The power which is acknowledged to exist, wherever the realization is found, must subsist wherever the tendency is manifested. The power which comes forth and stirs abroad in the bird, must be latent in the egg. I have shown, moreover, that this tendency to individuate cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet. We might say that the life of the magnet subsists in their union, but that it lives (acts or manifests itself) in their strife. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the <b>ultimate</b> <b>production</b> of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{outstanding}} {{issue in the}} oil and gas industry is how to evaluate quantitatively the influences of water production on production performance of gas wells. Based on gas–water flow theories, therefore, a new method was proposed in this paper to evaluate quantitatively the production performance of water-producing gas wells by using gas & water relative permeability curves after a comparative study was conducted thoroughly. In this way, quantitative evaluation was performed on production capacity, gas <b>production,</b> <b>ultimate</b> cumulative gas <b>production</b> and recovery factor of water-producing gas wells. Then, a case study was carried out of the tight sandstone gas reservoirs with strong heterogeneity in the Sulige gas field, Ordos Basin. This method was verified in terms of practicability and reliability through a large amount of calculation based on the actual production performance data of various gas wells with different volumes of water produced. Finally, empirical formula and charts were established for water-producing gas wells in this field to quantitatively evaluate their production capacity, gas <b>production,</b> <b>ultimate</b> cumulative gas <b>production</b> and recovery factor in the conditions of different water–gas ratios. These formula and charts provide technical support for the field application and dissemination of the method. Study results show that water production is serious in the west of this field with water–gas ratio varying in a large range. If the average water–gas ratio is 1. 0 (or 2. 0) m 3 / 104  m 3, production capacity, cumulative gas production and recovery factor of gas wells will be respectively 24. 4 % (or 40. 2 %), 24. 4 % (or 40. 2 %) and 17. 4 % (or 33. 2 %) ...|$|R

With 1970s technology, the ability to generate of so many characters on demand in the end-user's terminal was seen as prohibitive.

This led to a videotex system called Captain ("Character and Pattern Telephone Access Information Network"), created by NTT in 1978, which went into full trials from 1979 to 1981. The system also lent itself naturally to photographic images, albeit at only moderate resolution.

"The {{sugarcane}} {{enters the}} sugar mill and is processed {{along one of}} two product chains: the sugar chain (containing the originally conceived sugar reﬁnery and the alcohol plant) or the paper chain (containing the pulp and paper mills). Each downstream (internal) company uses the by-products from upstream companies as secondary material inputs. In addition, careful attention is given to reducing the residual waste and to its ultimate disposal. The sugar chain results in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>production</b> of sugar, alcohol, cement, and compound fertilizer (i.e., fertilizer with a speciﬁc ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). In the sugar reﬁnery, the sugarcane “juice” that is released in the crushing and grinding assembly in the sugar mill is reﬁned in a carbonation process that yields a higher quality reﬁned sugar than does the sulﬁtation process {{that is used by}} the majority of cane sugar plants in China (Wei 2004). Wei notes that sulﬁtation is favored by the GG’s competitors, in part, because the ﬁlter mud (one of the wastes from the reﬁning process) from sulﬁtation can easily be disposed of as a direct application fertilizer. Filter mud from the carbonation process, on the other hand, can have a signiﬁcant negative effect on the local soil if it is applied directly to the land. The GG has addressed this problem by using the carbonation ﬁlter mud as an input to the State-owned cement production facility it manages, rather than as a fertilizer. The GG contributes the ﬁlter mud and pays for transportation costs, balancing the savings from not having to pay for disposal. The fuel for the cement plant is coal, introducing an added environmental burden on the symbiosis. The residues from the alcohol plant (molasses)—which once would have been released into the environment—are now used as input to the production of compound fertilizer, which goes back to the sugarcane ﬁelds, thus closing this loop. The paper chain is driven by the input of bagasse, which is the residue from the sugar mill, minus the pith; that is, the soft interior portion of the cane. Sixty percent of the bagasse has ﬁbers long enough for paper-making. The short ﬁbers of the pith are used as fuel in a cogeneration power plant. Earlier, the GG burnt the bagasse in its power plant and sold it to homeowners for cooking and heating. The pulping operation that prepares the bagasse for conversion into paper requires a signiﬁcant addition of alkali, which ends up in the residue of that operation. The GG has constructed an alkali recovery plant that recycles the waste from the pulping operation (black liquor), generating a white sludge that can be used as input to the cement mill, which is primarily a part of the sugar chain. The pulp is processed by one of the three paper mills, where a major waste (white liquor) is generated and subsequently treated to recover major portions of ﬁber and water, which are recycled to the paper mills.” ...|$|E
