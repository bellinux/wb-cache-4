60|$|The launch {{was large}} and coppered, and it carried two lug-sails. I had both masts stepped, with the yards, sails, sheets, &c. prepared, and put in their places; a stout rope was next carried round the entire boat, outside, and a few inches below the gunwale, where it was {{securely}} nailed. From this rope, led a number of lanyards, with eyes turned into their ends. Through these eyes I rove a sort of ridge-rope, leading it also {{through the eyes of}} several stancheons that were firmly stepped on the thwarts. The effect, when the ridge-rope was set up, was to give the boat the protection of this waist-cloth, which inclined inboard, however, sufficiently to leave an open passage between the two sides, of only about half the beam of the boat. To the ridge-rope and lanyards, I had tarpaulins firmly attached, tacking their lower edges strongly to the outer sides of the boat. By this arrangement, when all was in its place, and properly secured, a sea might break, or a wave slap against the boat, without her taking in much water. It doubled her security in this particular, more than answering the purposes of a half-deck and wash-board. It is true, a very heavy wave might carry all away; but very heavy waves would probably fill the boat, under any circumstances. Such a craft could only find safety in her buoyancy; and we made her as safe as an <b>undecked</b> <b>vessel</b> very well could be.|$|E
50|$|In {{the age of}} sail, a gunboat {{was usually}} a small <b>undecked</b> <b>vessel</b> {{carrying}} a single smoothbore cannon in the bow, or just two or three such cannons. A gunboat could carry one or two masts or be oar-powered only, but the single-masted version of about 15 m length was most typical. Some types of gunboat carried two cannons, or else mounted a number of swivel guns on the railings.|$|E
25|$|Handliners â€“ are {{normally}} <b>undecked</b> <b>vessels</b> used for handlining (fishing {{with a line}} and hook). Handliners include canoes and other small or medium-sized vessels. Traditional handliners are less than 12 metres o/a, {{and do not have}} special gear handling, there is no winch or gurdy. Locating fish is left to the fishermen's personal knowledge of fishing grounds rather than the use of special electronic equipment. Non traditional handliners can set and haul using electrical or hydraulic powered reels. These mechanised reels {{are normally}} fastened to the gunwale or set on stanchions close to or overhanging the gunwale. They operate all over the world, some in shallow waters, some fishing up to 300 metres deep. No typical deck arrangement exists for handliners.|$|R
5000|$|Trincadour (from the Portuguese troingador), was {{a type of}} small, <b>undecked,</b> flat-bottomed, {{coasting}} <b>vessel</b> with {{a raised}} bow. Trincadours had two or three lug sails on horizontal yards, or lateen sails. In the 18th and early 19th Centuries they were common in the Bay of Biscay, though they would often {{be found in the}} Mediterranean. The French Navy of the time had several built to use as gunboats.|$|R
