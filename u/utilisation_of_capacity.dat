It implies better loading factors of trains, 10  % more TEU per length on fewer axles, and thus lower energy consumption, less maintenance and lower cost per transported unit (VEL wagon 2012). Other measures are short‐coupled wagons with draw‐bars, or automatic couplers without buffers.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{profitability}} within the process industry is heavily dependent upon the degree of utilisation of the plants. Utilisation, in turn, is dependent upon the often very volatile market conditions for the commodity produced. This paper examines the implications for capital budgeting, dealing with a situation of changing levels of utilisation. A paper-pulp mill is chosen for the purpose of investigating whether, in this specific case, the variation of utilisation in response to changing market conditions affects plant value in any major way. Comparing a fixed and a variable production rate (using the net present value rule and option pricing by means of the Feynman-Kac formula), it is found that the difference in value is considerable. However, an inappropriately specified price process may explain the difference. The geometric Brownian motion assumed allows the price to decline to almost zero. In order to overcome this problem, an alternative price process allowing for mean reversion in the nominal price of pulp is developed and tested. The value of the ability to cut production is then found to be insignificant. Based on the findings of this study, it is not worthwhile to model a variable <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity.</b> It is, however, of utmost importance to evaluate different assumptions about pulp price behaviour, as this will affect results substantially.

40|$|The biggest {{contribution}} to the vigorous growth of the Austrian economy in 2006 was made by manufacturing. The total value added surpassed the previous year's level by 7. 5 percent in real terms – {{the highest rate of}} increase in years. Industrial production mainly benefited from strong export demand. Exports of goods increased by 10. 2 percent in real terms over the previous year's result, which primarily reflects the strength of economic growth in foreign markets, above all in the oil-exporting countries, Asia and North America, as well as the twelve new EU countries, but also {{in the rest of the}} European Union. Moreover, considering their prices and the quality of their products, domestic enterprises are highly competitive. The unit labour costs of the highly export-oriented Austrian manufacturers dropped by 2. 3 percent against those of their trading partners in 2006. In the course of the year, the strong expansion of production resulted in a substantially higher <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacities</b> (up from 81. 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 to 84. 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006).

The study has shown that in the study catchment there is a potential opportunity {{to reduce the number of}} gullies and hence reduce the maintenance requirement by as much as 50 %. However, there are potential cost implications resulting from the need to make gulley gratings perform more effectively. Furthermore the study has demonstrated the potential of using relatively simple approaches to assessment of the interactions between surface and sub surface drainage systems to maximise the <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> in both systems to reduce the frequency of surface water flooding. However, the study has highlighted the uncertainties involved in the collection of data for the assessment of gulley performance on site. This means that there is a need to collect more data to improve the understanding of the uncertainties and the best way to manage them. The next steps to be taken are as follows: • To continue with the data collection, including the reinstallation of a rain gauge close to the test site in Thornton Road • To explore the implementation of the findings of the report by applying them at locations where there is an identified need to solve problems. This is likely to involve the participation of the teams responsible for gulley maintenance and those teams and organisations responsible for the sub surface drainage systems. • To explore the application of the findings of the report to the design of new developments to help improve the effectiveness of gullies and other inlets and at the same time to reduce the burden of maintenance.

40|$|What do we {{know about}} {{long-term}} determinants of investment? It seems to me that both neoclassical and Keynesian theory of economic growth provide a poor answer to this question so important for any theory of growth and accumulation. If we consider the traditional theory in which the interest rate represents the key variable for studying investment decisions, both theoretical and empirical considerations suggest, as is well known, to change direction. In the Keynesian theories of economic growth, the investment decisions are reduced to the mechanism of adjusting the productive capacity to the demand according to the accelerator principle, whose use presupposes a constant full (or normal) <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity,</b> no technical change and a mechanical behaviour of firms. I propose to adopt a different observation point and to regard investment decisions {{as the result of a}} series of inducing mechanisms by which these decisions are activated. After analysing the significance of satisfying the need to adjust productive capacity to expected demand and the need for profitability, I refer to the general characteristics of the actual working of competition and define the notion of capacity to generate investment understood as capacity to create and exploit new investment opportunities through inducing mechanisms linked with the innovative activity of firms. In the Hirschman, Perroux and Dahmèn tradition, these inducing mechanisms are defined in terms of dynamic linkages and are connected with four strategic factors in investment decisions: focusing mechanism and learned processes, complementarities and interdependences, expectations and uncertainty, growth in demand. Abandoning the neoclassical paradigm, this paper disputes the antithesis between demand factors and supply factors in the investment determinants. Expected demand induces investment decisions as far as it is regarded as permanent and this forces an enquiring into the way in which expectations concerning the future demand are formulated. On the supply side, the technological characteristics of the investment, the economic reasons behind it (product innovation, opening up of new markets, goals of cost reduction), the decisions concerning localisation and the economic and social environment within which firms reach their investment decisions are considered crucial elements in the explanation of the long-term determinants of investment in a way wholly independent of the full capacity saving of the economy.

40|$|Economic {{growth is}} the single most {{important}} factor in the economic success of nations. Growth can be robust in trying circumstances over the short term, but usually requires the basic tenets of peace, safety and security, the rule of law, price and exchange rate stability and a market friendly ambience to be sustainable over decades. Achieving this is a formidable task, but does not guarantee success, because other factors, such as pessimism or uncertainty in the business community, rumours and corruption, can impede progress. Government policy plays a vital role in economic growth, but measures of it are scarce and problematic. Similarly, economic data focus on outcomes, rather than on causes, for example, numbers employed rather than labour market policies. Growth analysts generally use indirect measures to analyse growth causes and effects. There are more of these, but many are also volatile over the long term. Economists devised empirical tools to compensate for these obstacles, and such tools were used in this study to investigate South Africa’s growth record, in order to determine what worked and what did not. This study shows that measures of openness of the economy to trade are indicative of growth. A robust and export-oriented manufacturing sector contributes to growth and perpetuates itself. This implies that barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas must be minimised and manufactured exports promoted, rather than primary products such as iron ore and coal. Nonproductive government spending reduces the growth rate and should be minimised, and the largest expenditures should be on safety and security (because crime incidence reduces growth), housing for the poor, and education, while most other services such as electricity, transport and communication should be privatised. While investment is important, its link to growth is bi-directional. However, productivity is a significant contributor to growth. Unused capacity of human resources and machines is productivity’s main detractor. Policies to enhance rival competition in the private sector, with full <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity,</b> increase productivity growth and can have sizeable spin-offs for economic growth and living standards.

This study {{focuses on}} {{optimising}} operations effectiveness and capacity at a heavy engineering plant, namely Heavy Engineering Vereeniging, {{a division of}} DCD–DORBYL (Pty) Ltd. The implementation and adoption of technology {{was included in the}} investigation. The company operates from 2 premises in Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark (Gauteng), and consists of 5 factory buildings. A literature review was conducted to ascertain current industry best practises and technology implementation initiatives. This review included a discussion on the following aspects: Capacity and its utilisation, flexible technology and advanced manufacturing systems, technology in manufacturing, capacity expansion and scheduling, factory layouts, technology and capacity utilisation in a South African context, and finally future trends in capacity and technology at Heavy Engineering Vereeniging. Data collection from within the organisation was done via the issuing of a questionnaire and conducting interviews with various management and supervision employees. The gathered data was analysed for employees’ opinions on current <b>utilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> and use of technology, as well as suggestions regarding improved working methods, factory layout and the implementation of new technology. The quantitative data was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software, with the provided descriptive statistical test results used for the identification of possible trends and further interpretation. It was found that current capacities and equipment are being well utilised, but not to their optimal level. The well entrenched management information systems, measurement systems and operating procedures currently in use will aid to increase the level of utilisation of the available capacity and equipment. The implementation of technology and latest best practises within the operation will gain HEV a competitive edge, ensuring their future sustainability and market leadership. However, this implementation must be done with the input and buy in of the work force. The variances in perceptions and attitudes between the various job functions, discovered during the statistical analysis, must be taken into cognisance during any capacity optimisation or technology implementation initiative. Continued capital expenditure and the current drives in research and development need to be maintained to further ensure sustainability. Various inefficiencies were identified and recommendations were made to improve the current operation’s effectiveness and factory layout, primarily by decreasing operating inefficiencies. The recommendations were made {{based on the results of}} the study and included the expenditure involved in their execution. Financially viable options, calculated using payback periods and net present values (NPV), included the purchase of phased array ultrasonic testing equipment, horizontal SAW for longitudinal flanges and a modular type furnace. Other options, which could improve operations effectiveness, but not returning financially positive results, included the moving of the Hausler roll into the main fabrication workshop and the moving of the Sachems drills to alongside the lathes. A number of new processes and initiatives were recommended, for which cost comparisons to current similar practices could not be performed. These included the full production implementation of the punch through tandem arc submerged arc welding for wind turbine tower manufacture, implementation of a customer interfacing and communication platform and internal communication display boards. Current practises regarding touch time measurements for welding and drilling were validated. By undertaking these recommendations, it was felt that HEV would continue to be wepositioned to capture the predicted ongoing growth in the mining market in which they currently operate, and to fully benefit from the future upturn in the energy market.
