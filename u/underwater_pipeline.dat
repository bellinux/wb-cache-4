According to the memorandum of understanding, the Leviathan field off Israel's Mediterranean coast would supply 7 billion cubic meters annually for 15 years via an <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline.</b> This equates to average volumes of 685 million cubic feet a day, the equivalent of just over 70% of the BG-operated Idku plant's daily volumes.|$|E
2500|$|After {{testing the}} groundwater, the ATSDR {{determined}} that Naval training and testing has {{in no way}} affected the drinking water on Vieques. [...] First of all, most of the island’s drinking water comes through an <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline</b> from mainland Puerto Rico. [...] Secondly, groundwater from the former Live Impact Area cannot leach into wells due to geological barriers. [...] High levels of nitrates in some wells are due to local, most likely agricultural, sources.

2500|$|Opening a [...] "Second Front" [...] {{was a top}} {{priority}} of the Allies, and especially of the Soviets to relieve their burden on the Eastern Front. While Italy had been knocked {{out of the war}} in the Italian campaign in September 1943, the easily defensible terrain of the narrow peninsula required only a relatively limited number of German troops to protect and occupy their new puppet state in northern Italy. However, as the Dieppe raid had shown, assaulting the Atlantic Wall was not an endeavour to be taken lightly. It required extensive preparations such as the construction of artificial ports (operation Mulberry) and an <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline</b> across the English Channel (operation Pluto), intensive bombardment of railways and German logistics in France (the Transportation Plan), and the wide-ranging military deception such as creating entire dummy armies like FUSAG (operation Bodyguard) to make the Germans believe the invasion would take place where the Channel was at its narrowest.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2007, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Finland made a {{statement}} on the environmental impact assessment programme of the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, in which it mentioned that alternative routes via the Baltic states, Kaliningrad and/or Poland might theoretically be shorter than the route across the Baltic Sea, {{would be easier to}} flexibly increase the capacity of the pipeline, and might have better financial results. [...] There were also calls from Sweden to consider rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Poland had proposed the construction of a second line of the Yamal–Europe pipeline, as well as the Amber pipeline through the Baltic states and Poland as land-based alternatives to the offshore pipeline. [...] The Amber project foresees laying a natural gas pipeline across the Tver, Novgorod and Pskov oblasts in Russia and then through Latvia and Lithuania to Poland, where it would be re-connected to the Yamal–Europe pipeline. [...] Latvia has proposed using its underground gas storage facilities if the onshore route were to be used. [...] Proponents have claimed that the Amber pipeline would cost half as much as an <b>underwater</b> <b>pipeline,</b> would be shorter, and would have less environmental impact. [...] Critics of this proposal say that in this case it would be more expensive for the suppliers over the long-term perspective, because the main aim of the project is to reduce transit costs. [...] Nord Stream AG has responded that the Baltic Sea would be the only route for the pipeline and it will not consider an overland alternative.|$|E

40|$|Wave-induced seabed {{liquefaction}} and {{shear failure}} {{have been identified}} as important mechanisms of submarine buried pipelines failure. Most previous studies evaluated the potential of seabed instability around <b>underwater</b> <b>pipelines</b> using two-dimensional numerical/analytical solutions. In real ocean environments, however, waves can approach the pipeline from an oblique direction. In this study, a three-dimensional FE numerical model is established and validated to simulate the wave-seabed-pipeline interaction. The seabed consolidation under the dynamic loading of ocean waves is simulated to evaluate the wave-induced seabed response. Simulation results are used to carry an instability analysis around pipeline. The numerical study reveals that the risk of seabed shear failure near the pipeline is considerably dependant to the wave angle of incidence...|$|R

We {{assume that the}} linear UV sensor networks follow Thomas cluster process (TCP), in which the cluster locations are modelled by Poisson point process (PPP), while the cluster members (UVs) are normally distributed around their cluster centers. We focus on communications between UVs within a cluster such as local sensing data transfer or swarm coordination, where multiple UV pairs can share the same frequency band simultaneously. Thus, {{in the presence of}} co-channel interference both from the same cluster and the other clusters, we study the coverage and area spectral efficiency of the clustered UV sensor networks in a linear topology...|$|R
