40|$|During {{the last}} 5 years, {{information}} on the regional tropospheric ozone levels over the eastern Mediterranean has become available but was confined to measurements at ground level. Here available information is expanded with measurements at two more rural ground level sites spanning 8 ° latitude, ozonesonde ascents, lidar observations, ship cruises, and aircraft flights. During wintertime the ozone monthly values are 1020 ppbv higher than values at other European sites, while during summertime the values are comparable. This results in regional ozone background levels {{in the area that}} are above the European Union (EU) 32 ppb/ 24 hours phytotoxicity limit during the entire year. Late spring lidar observations show that south and southwestern synoptic flows which are associated with Saharan dust events result in lower ozone above the planetary boundary layer (PBL) by 20 - 35 ppbv as compared to these during northerly flows, which transport air from continental Europe. These lidar observations along with ship measurements during July show that ozone is enhanced 1. 5 - 2. 2 times in the continental outflow, when compared to aged maritime air or air from the African continent. These results along with ozonesonde observations suggest that ozone abatement in the area is largely beyond the control of regional emissions and can be controlled only with emission reductions on a European scale. During September, measured background NO and NO 2 levels between 3 and 4. 5 km above sea level ranged from 1 to 221 pptv and from 102 to 580 pptv, respectively. The troposphere contains around 40 - 70 Dobson <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> during summer and around 20 - 30 Dobson units during winter. Copyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

40|$|The {{combined}} effects <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> (O- 3) {{and drought}} on isoprene emission were studied {{for the first}} time. Young hybrid poplars (clone 546, Populus deltoides cv. 55 / 56 x P. deltoides cv. Imperial) were exposed to O- 3 (charcoal-filtered air, CF, and non-filtered air + 40 ppb, E-O- 3) and soil water stress (well-watered, WW, and mild drought, MD, one-third irrigation) for 96 days. Consistent with light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat), intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci) and chlorophyll content, isoprene emission depended on drought, O- 3, leaf position and sampling time. Drought stimulated emission (+ 38. 4 %), and O- 3 decreased it (- 40. 4 %). Ozone increased the carbon cost per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> isoprene emission. <b>Ozone</b> and drought effects were stronger in middle leaves (13 th- 15 th from the apex) than in upper leaves (6 th- 8 th). Only Asat showed a significant interaction between O- 3 and drought. When the responses were up-scaled to the entire-plant level, however, drought effects on total leaf area translated into around twice higher emission from WW plants in clean air than in E-O- 3. Our results suggest that direct effects on plant emission rates and changes in total leaf area may affect isoprene emission from intensively cultivated hybrid poplar under combined MD and O- 3 exposure, with important feedbacks for air quality...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{bactericidal}} effects <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> solutions {{were tested}} against Escherichia coli suspensions at lo, and the lethal concentration {{was found to}} be that quantity <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> necessary to produce a detectable residue in the suspension; under the conditions of our experiments this was 04 - 0 - 5 mg. /l. A comparison of the bactericidal activity of chlorine under similar conditions emphasized the different modes of action of the two agents. Quantitative studies on the antibacterial activity <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> are difficult because of the instability <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> solutions. The decomposition <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> in solution is described as occurring in a stepwise fashion, producing in turn hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radicles (Adler & Hill, 1950), both of which exhibit considerable biological activity. The decomposition process is temperature dependent and is catalysed by hydroxyl ion (Adler & Hill, 1950; Stumm, 1954).
