40|$|This article {{takes up}} the {{question}} of whether emergencies are altogether extraordinary events that occur in <b>unforeseeable</b> <b>circumstances</b> or whether they are more ordinary dynamics, which also characterize times of normal politics. In facing this issue, the article sets forth an alternative reading of Schmitt’s conception of the state of exception, interpreted in the light of his work of the 1930 s. Based on this analysis, the exception is portrayed not as the foundational moment of a political community, but as a disruptive threat to the material core of the constitutional order on which the community is founded. Accordingly, emergencies are depicted as legal devices designed to handle the emergence of potentially unsettling societal phenomena. The article concludes by commenting on a 2008 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights that foregrounds how the fine line between normality and exception is safeguarded through legal means...|$|E

While giving due credit to the scope and sophistication of his book, the review article asks whether Cohen’s focus on scientific discourses and highly structured organisations leaves sufficient room for contingency. It argues that interwar political leadership in interwar Europe was not least about seeing and seizing opportunities in <b>unforeseeable</b> <b>circumstances,</b> often thriving on a positive fascination with crises and states of emergency. It also points out that, contrary to what the combined title and subtitle suggest, "le siècle des chefs" hardly ended in 1939, and that the quest for leadership continues to preoccupy present-day societies, cultures and polities...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue the case for {{investigating}} the culture of information in primary schools. Recent technological change has altered the relationship between the individual and information, yet this change appears not to be reflected in the culture of schools, especially primary schools.

Using Hatano’s concept of Adaptive Expertise as its theoretical perspective, the curriculum is analysed from the point of view of how well it is likely to prepare children for a life in which the ability to evaluate information will become a generically crucial skill needing to be applied in many varied and <b>unforeseeable</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Educational researchers have argued the case for change in the way we teach children to deal with information in schools; however this paper suggests that the existing culture of schools needs to be understood and opportunities for change identified if these skills are successfully to be introduced...|$|E

Typically, the total number of required workstations are minimised for a given cycle time (this problem is referred to as type- 1), or cycle time is minimised for a given number of workstations (this problem is referred to as type- 2) in traditional balancing of assembly lines. However, variation in workload distributions of workstations is an important indicator {{of the quality of the}} obtained line balance. This needs to be taken into account to improve the reliability of an assembly line against <b>unforeseeable</b> <b>circumstances,</b> such as breakdowns or other failures. For this aim, a new problem, called lexicographic bottleneck mixed-model assembly line balancing problem (LB-MALBP), is presented and formalised. The lexicographic bottleneck objective, which was recently proposed for the simple single-model assembly line system in the literature, is considered for a mixed-model assembly line system. The mathematical model of the LB-MALBP is developed for the first time in the literature and coded in GAMS solver, and optimal solutions are presented for some small scale test problems available in the literature. As it is not possible to get optimal solutions for the large-scale instances, an artificial bee colony algorithm is also implemented for the solution of the LB-MALBP. The solution procedures of the algorithm are explored illustratively. The performance of the algorithm is also assessed using derived well-known test problems in this domain and promising results are observed in reasonable CPU times...|$|E

It envelopes the vulnerability surrounding the internal conflict, and external interference and influence of cultural, societal, and familial norms. The purpose of this autoethnography is to share my own experience with identity crisis, loss of career, and embracing the identity of being the mother of a special-needs child, and to share my personal struggle with the pressure in having to choose between career and motherhood as well as arrive at cultural analysis and interpretation regarding the research question: What is the phenomenology of the Latina woman and career? The objectivity and subjectivity position within this autoethnography will be coupled and supported by a feminist theoretical framework. Rom Harré’s and Fathali Moghaddam’s explanation of positioning theory in The Self and Others Positioning Individuals and Groups in Personal, Political, and Cultural Contexts will also be used as a theoretical framework to better understand the psychology behind the phenomenology. The objective behind this autoethnography is to open the door to much needed discourse, and to establish literature on the intersectional identities of women, especially those who are mothers of special-needs children, and women {{from all walks of life}} who have found themselves in the vacuum of loss of career, loss of identity, and who face the challenges that come with being a woman, wife, and mother. Feminist epistemology about womanhood, motherhood, and career are examined, and the research method of phenomenology will serve as the vessel by which knowledge will be constructed, and made sense of, in an effort to make connections to our culture, to our society, and to each other. ...|$|E
40|$|Pricing in {{the market}} is the most {{sensitive}} part of trade. It is through pricing where the buyers are able to acquire goods and it is through it also that the sellers get their profit. Pricing of commodities {{can be said to}} be the lifeline of trade and also the lifeline of competition. Competition law, in addition to other factors such as quality of goods and their availability, also deal with the issue of pricing of goods. It is touted that competition law has a strong inclination to supervise pricing of commodities and how the conduct of market players influence pricing of goods. Competition law does this by making the market as competitive as possible in order to prevent any firm from dictating prices. It short, it strives to make the firms {{in the market}} to be price takers and not price setters as a way of reigning in on high prices in the market. However, in certain circumstances the competition laws become unable to supervise the market. In times such as those, the governments have been forced to intervene through other laws and policies {{in order to protect the}} market from possible abuse. This study looked at government intervention in the market through price control legislation. Price control legislation is a legislation that gives the government powers to artificially set prices of commodities. This is done in those dire circumstances where the market out of <b>unforeseeable</b> <b>circumstances,</b> is unable to be competitive. Examples of such instances include national crises, innovations and legal huddles. Price control legislations unlike the traditional competition laws are not created to promote competition per se. They are created on the back of competitive conduct to provide a safety net to consumers from exploitative activities of producers in instances where the influence of competition laws is ineffective. Price control legislations are there to make sure that when all competition laws and interventions are unable to protect consumers from the condition of the market and the exploitative actions of the producers, then there are certain laws created as a safety net to the consumers. Price control is used to mitigate the circumstances that make it impossible for the market through competition to control pricing of commodities. Currently, price control is becoming a prevalent way oftarning prices in many jurisdictions. A policy used in the medieval times in simple markets, with little or no inclination towards the market, has now become more imposing even in the most sophisticated markets. Price controls in areas like Canada and the European Union are being used together with competition laws to cater for areas where the governments feel that the market is not competitive enough and competition laws are not effective. In other areas such as Zimbabwe, it is being abused for political purposes to influence prices against a competitive market and the competition laws. What is clear and true is that price control having both an immediate impact and being effective, is one mechanism that has far reaching and substantial effects on the competitiveness in the market. With its target being the most sensitive area of trade, this makes it a very important policy issue that competition lawyers should not ignore. Price control ability of superseding the market mechanism of supply and demand, to impose prices and the way it is implemented gives it the power to reduce and even kill competition in a particular market. That is why it is imperative to understand this safety net as competition lawyers in order to know whether it is needed and if so how we can limit its negative effects in the market...|$|E
40|$|This master's thesis {{addresses}} {{the theme of}} maturation and the spending of leisure time through the “eyes of the youth”. We want to integrate into the Slovenian area the term “good locations”, which includes those important segments of accommodations of youth, where they feel good and where they frequent. The aforementioned term is also a means for help in the pedagogical (operations), because it illustrates specific activities, which can have an educational effect on an individual or a group. The theoretical part starts with a discourse about socialization, primary as well as secondary. In the context of primary socialization we are also interested in risk factors within the family, which can also be the cause {{for the child to}} be put in an institution. Secondary socialization refers to everything else, which is not connected with the immediate family. Even the development of largely depends on secondary socialization, especially on peers, who implicitly and explicitly “decide” about the spending of leisure time. A theory of group socialization, which was “created” by an American psychologist Rich Harris, is presented here. Along with the fore mentioned segments of secondary socialization specific “good locations” and general effects of the social environment and society is highlighted. It is the youth’s wish to have maturation progress in accordance with their interests. This can only be accomplished if the youth participates in the selection of spending their time and, with that, participate in their own maturation. Secondary socialization is bound to the institutions which the children and youth are involved in by law. We focus on primary school, as an institution in which the participation is mandatory for youth, and institutional education, where some children and youth find themselves due to <b>unforeseeable</b> <b>circumstances.</b> This adds a short depiction of school, risk factors in school {{and the role of the}} teacher to the theoretical part. A short history of institucional education, its operation and a specific institutional education of children and youth with behavioural and personality disorders is next. As a counterweight to the totality of institutional care humanization, normalization and inclusion is mentioned. The theoretical part is concluded with Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model, which illustrates all the systems and subsystems, in which an individual operates. The empirical part represents the analysis of qualitative research, which included the population of youth aged from 12 to 16. The focus of interviews was on thinking about specific “good locations”, important persons, facing crisis and the ways of spending leisure time. Based on the analysis of the interviews we enable the reader to see into a few segments of maturation of today’s youth. Analysis includes a discourse about specific “good locations” where the youth is spending their time. Playgrounds, youth clubs, or better, the wish for these kinds of places and a personal room, which is also a sanctuary in crisis, are highlighted. We found a few differences in the selection of during the week “good locations” among the youth who live at home and those that are in an institutional care facility. The research showed smaller gender discrepancies in the choice. Further analysis shows the opinion of adults about “good locations”, which is bad, negative. Main focus of the research is on the youth’s spending of leisure time. The findings point to the fact that active spending of youth’s leisure time includes sports activities, hiking and helping with daily chores. Passive spending of youth’s leisure time is watching TV, using a computer and chatting with friends. The research showed us that the youth would want to spent their leisure time better, if they had the necessary means and a greater choice, this is especially true for the youth in institutional care. Friends are a vital and the most important factor during maturity. The results of our research also point to that fact. Friends are the ones the youth confide in, spend their time with, and have common interests. It is with friends they also experience alcohol, drugs and sex for the first time. Friends are the most important people during maturity. The research shows that friends are a lifeline in crisis for some, because the youth talks about problems amongst each other. However, there are some who rather isolate themselves in their room, listen to music and wait for problems to pass. The primary goal and purpose of the research is participation of youth in spending leisure time, in other words, so that they would be heard, to try and enable them to spend leisure time with more quality and with that an easier transition into adulthood. We would like to appeal to different institutions to help with creating some sort of model for the occupation of youth during their leisure time with this research. We are thinking of a model with a goal as simple as getting the youth “off the street”. We cannot imagine the model without the participation of youth. They would be invited to participate with the phisical construction of the model (space, equipment, color of walls, furniture) and, of coure, with the planning and the implementation of activities, which would be offered. We want to offer the youth an option of cooperating at different themed workshops, where they would also invite guests or lecturers (drugs, sex, media, arts, literary and fashion workshops …), films that show maturation or current affairs, organized field trips and competitions, and we believe there would be nothing wrong if there was also billiards or similar “games” available for passive breaks, if we can call them that. We believe that at least an additional reference person (social educator), who the youth can turn to at every moment, is required within this kind of a model. We cannot imagine the realization of the model without the cooperation of local schools, associations and also an educational institution if one is in the vicinity. We believe that the presented model means a great contribution in pedagogical capital, because it contains an important component and, with it, the help or preventive operation in education. The cooperation of youth also means their participation in a life oriented education. ...|$|E
