The results showed that the availability <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> is significant and that they can be used at a cost 20 - 60 % lower than that of wind power generation, a subsidized source of energy in Brazil.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{possible}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>wastes</b> as aggregate {{in the concrete}} industry. Large volumes {{of natural resources and}} raw materials are being used for concrete production around the world in laboratory. To reduce or minimize the undesirable environmental effect of the concrete industry and promote environmental sustainability of the industry, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> from industry as materials for concrete construction is considered as an alternative solution for preventing the excessive usage of raw materials. It aims to support the notion <b>of</b> <b>using</b> these <b>wastes</b> by explaining their engineering properties. This review of existing knowledge about the successful <b>use</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>wastes</b> in the concrete industry helps to identify other existing waste products for use in concrete manufacturing. Recycling <b>of</b> such <b>wastes</b> and <b>using</b> them in construction materials appears to be feasible solution not only to the pollution problem but also an economical option in construction. In this constructed environment, the intensifying cost of building construction materials is the factor of immense concern. In this paper, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell as a coarse aggregate has been discussed based on the results obtained from wide-ranging review of literature. The coconut shell is a material which can be a replacement of aggregates. The intension {{of this paper is to}} increase knowledge about the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell as a construction material in civil engineering...|$|R
