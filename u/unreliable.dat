5|$|A {{parcel service}} was also offered, {{although}} this proved unpopular {{as it was}} <b>unreliable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chess historians H. J. R. Murray, David Hooper and Ken Whyld {{described}} Edge as <b>unreliable</b> {{and having}} an extreme bias against Staunton.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Texas Transportation Institute {{determined}} that the Skyway was the sixth-most <b>unreliable</b> road in the United States because of the unpredictability of traffic congestion and therefore travel times.|$|E
5|$|The season premiered at the Pacific Design Center on January 26, 2017, {{ahead of}} its FX debut on February 8. It ran for eight episodes, until March 29. The season {{received}} critical acclaim for its cast, particularly Stevens; Hawley's visuals and design; and the nonlinear, <b>unreliable</b> nature of the storytelling. Several critics did note that the latter aspects would not be for all viewers, and some criticized this as just {{the latest in a}} trend of series with <b>unreliable</b> narratives. Legion was renewed for a second season on March 15, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Access {{to parts}} of the station is {{difficult}} for people with physical disability. The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from the concourse, though customers found them <b>unreliable</b> and frequently broken down. Wayfindr technology {{was introduced to the}} station in 2015 to help the visually impaired navigate the station.|$|E
5|$|British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was {{concerned}} that, given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe {{at the end}} of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was <b>unreliable,</b> there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Gulf {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} branded product sales by selling gasoline in containers and from pumps marked with a distinctive orange disc logo. A customer buying Gulf-branded gasoline could be assured of its quality and consistent standard. (In the early 20th century, non-branded gasoline in the United States was often contaminated or of <b>unreliable</b> quality).|$|E
5|$|Hospital Based Service – Hospitals {{may provide}} their own {{ambulance}} {{service as a}} service to the community, or where ambulance care is <b>unreliable</b> or chargeable. Their use would be dependent on using the services of the providing hospital.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide <b>unreliable</b> data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by Angus Reid Strategies in October 2007, 89 per cent of respondents said that using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power was positive for Canada, because these sources were better for the environment. Only 4 per cent considered using renewable sources as negative since they can be <b>unreliable</b> and expensive.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2012 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{rejected}} {{his appeal}} for retrial that asserted, {{based on a}} 2009 report by the National Academy of Science, that forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and accepted into evidence in the original trial was <b>unreliable.</b> It {{was reported to be}} the former death row inmate's last legal appeal.|$|E
5|$|P. H. Vanderweyde {{noted that}} Crookes {{was already a}} believer in psychic powers before he {{obtained}} {{the results of the}} experiments. Vanderweyde stated the spring balance used in Crookes' experiment was <b>unreliable</b> as it was easy to manipulate by deception and suggested he should repeat the experiment by using a chemical balance.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in {{the city}} consists primarily of a First West of England bus network. Other providers are Abus, Stagecoach West, Stagecoach South West and Wessex Bus. Bristol's bus service has been criticised as <b>unreliable</b> and expensive, and in 2005 FirstGroup was fined for delays and safety violations.|$|E
5|$|Sensory– darkening, smoke, foaming, thickening, rancid {{taste and}} {{unpleasant}} smell when heating. This {{is the most}} <b>unreliable</b> way to decide when to change oil because those are very individual factors and can depend on different causes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{developing}} countries use shortwave {{as a means}} of receiving local and regional programming. China and Russia retransmits some domestic channels on shortwave that target listeners in far off provinces. Shortwave listening is also used as an educational tool in classrooms. Poor sound reproduction, <b>unreliable</b> signal quality, and inflexibility of access are seen as disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|The 1939 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{ran through the}} summer and fall of 1939. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes was extremely <b>unreliable.</b> Most east Pacific storms were of no threat to land. However, 1939 saw a large number of storms threaten California.|$|E
5|$|The C center {{produces}} a characteristic {{infrared absorption spectrum}} with a sharp peak at 1344 cm−1 and a broader feature at 1130 cm−1. Absorption at those peaks is routinely {{used to measure the}} concentration of single nitrogen. Another proposed way, using the UV absorption at ~260 nm, has later been discarded as <b>unreliable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Germans rapidly {{realised}} that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers {{had grown}} to 8,000, were inefficient and <b>unreliable,</b> and even the Nedić government had no confidence in them. They were completely disbanded by March 1943. Pećanac himself was interned by the Nedić regime for some time, and was killed by agents of Mihailović in May or June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The PIATs' {{ammunition}} {{used the}} Hollow charge principle, which, if the often <b>unreliable</b> round design delivered it correctly to the target, allowed the warhead to penetrate almost all enemy armour types at close range.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} a {{stand-alone}} episode, like most episodes of The X-Files, and follows the normal Monster of the Week {{pattern of the}} show but features more humor than typical via manipulation of point of view, leading to multiple re-tellings of certain events {{with varying degrees of}} <b>unreliable</b> narrators.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of Elagabalus' sexual orientation is confused, owing to salacious and <b>unreliable</b> sources. Elagabalus married and divorced five women, three {{of whom are}} known. His first wife was Julia Cornelia Paula; the second was the Vestal Virgin Julia Aquilia Severa.|$|E
5|$|Third Reich {{authorities}} {{disapproved of}} {{his choice of}} a Catholic marriage ceremony, performed by Klawitter. Klawitter had been barred from membership in the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically <b>unreliable</b> after a 1936 breach of the Pulpit Law, a remnant of the 1870s Kulturkampf that among other religions barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the pulpit.|$|E
5|$|To reduce {{rolling and}} {{increase}} stability for aircraft operations, a gyrostabilizer {{produced by the}} American Sperry Gyroscope Company was installed. The installation initially proved <b>unreliable</b> as the Japanese technicians were badly trained by Sperry, but eventually the system proved its worth as the technicians gained experience.|$|E
5|$|Treadgold's {{estimates}} {{are based on}} figures for Constantine's army provided by Zosimus, who is notorious among scholars as an <b>unreliable</b> chronicler, both in general and as regards figures in particular: e.g. he reports that 60,000 Alamanni were killed at the Battle of Strasbourg in 357, an absurd inflation of the 6,000 reported by the contemporary and reliable Ammianus Marcellinus.|$|E
5|$|Turbines {{were never}} {{replaced}} in battleship design. Diesel engines were eventually {{considered by some}} powers, as they offered very good endurance and an engineering space taking up less {{of the length of}} the ship. They were also heavier, however, took up a greater vertical space, offered less power, and were considered <b>unreliable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Twitter has {{mobile apps}} for iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows 10, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and Nokia S40. Users can also tweet by sending SMS. In April 2017, Twitter {{introduced}} Twitter Lite, a progressive web app designed for regions with <b>unreliable</b> and slow Internet connections, {{with a size}} of less than one megabyte, designed for devices with limited storage capacity.|$|E
5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} <b>unreliable</b> evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also <b>unreliable</b> in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} a small producer, VAT had {{problems}} with <b>unreliable</b> deliveries and quality problems caused by the component suppliers. Semi-finished lorries often waited outside the factory for engines or other key components. The British diesel engines suffered from more quality problems compared with their Swedish and German competitors. The company's owners became increasingly reluctant to fund the unprofitable business.|$|E
5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land forces is difficult; most figures are <b>unreliable</b> estimates based on known items delivered in the past. The IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give only slightly differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's equipment is non-operational due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's armoured vehicles were estimated as being serviceable.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's chosen {{life as an}} explorer, his <b>unreliable</b> {{sources of}} income and his {{frequent}} extended absences, all placed severe strains on the marriage, and the couple became estranged around 1916. However, they continued {{to live in the}} same house until Bruce's death. Eillium became a Merchant Navy officer, eventually captaining a Fisheries Research Ship which, by chance, bore the name Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to <b>unreliable</b> ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than <b>unreliable</b> ones.|$|E
5|$|Clowes {{assigned}} the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, {{and kept the}} veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack. Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was <b>unreliable</b> in the conditions, the Australian command and control system consisted largely of cable telephones, or where {{there was not enough}} line available, runners. The soft ground made movement by road and even on foot difficult.|$|E
5|$|Documents with {{accounts}} of the battle include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the writings of Anglo-Norman historian William of Malmesbury and the Annals of Clonmacnoise. In Snorri Sturluson's Egils saga, the antihero, mercenary, berserker and skald, Egill Skallagrimsson, served as a trusted warrior for Æthelstan. It {{has been suggested that}} the account in Egil's Saga is <b>unreliable.</b> Sagas have more than once placed their hero in a famous battle and then embellished it with a series of literary mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved <b>unreliable,</b> owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure. Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already {{on their way}} to the front.|$|E
5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was {{used not to}} make ships disappear, but to make them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an enemy {{and to make the}} ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was <b>unreliable</b> and never went into production.|$|E
