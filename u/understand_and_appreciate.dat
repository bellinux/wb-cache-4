5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> his position.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, in {{reaction}} to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> the controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.|$|E

500|$|Hagen calls Angelou's coding [...] "signifying" [...] and states, [...] "A {{knowledge}} of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances {{the appreciation of}} Angelou's poems". [...] Line six in [...] "Harlem Hopscotch," [...] for example ("If you're white, all right / If you're brown, hang around / If you're black stand back"), is a popular jingle used by African Americans that people of other cultures might not recognize. [...] Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou's poems, the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> them.|$|E
500|$|Both Yokoyama and Satou {{noted the}} [...] "Japanese-ness" [...] of the anime during the panel {{discussion}} following the main showing at the Scotland Loves Animation festival. [...] Yokoyama {{had originally been}} concerned that foreign audiences would not fully <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> the work, but {{the reaction of the}} audience at the Glasgow showing alleviated his concerns. [...] According to Yokoyama and Satou, elements of the story that exhibited strong elements of Japanese culture included the watermelon eating scene, the part where Gin hits young Hotaru over the head with a stick, and the scene where young Hotaru gets scared at night when she sees the face of a yōkai in the patterns of the wood panels on the ceiling.|$|E
500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by other Blacks. In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show" [...] in Diiie, for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned. Sylvester states that Angelou uses this technique often in her poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", also in Diiie, in which the understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. Hagen calls Angelou's coding [...] "signifying" [...] and states, [...] "A knowledge of black linguistic regionalisms and folklore enhances the appreciation of Angelou's poems". Hagen believes that despite the signifying that occurs in many of Angelou's poems, the themes and topics are universal enough that all readers would <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> them. DeGout states that Angelou conveys meaning through literary imagery, denser vocabulary, and poetic techniques such as catachresis, ambiguity, and anthropomorphism. Angelou's use of language frees her readers from their traditional perceptions and beliefs about human experience. She uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. DeGout says that although this use of language is not the main technique she uses in her poetry, it appears in her more popular poems.|$|E

A music-hall audience in Munich are very particular as to how their beloved Wagner is rendered, and the trifles from Mozart and Haydn that they love to take in with their sausages and salad, and which, when performed to their satisfaction, they will thunderously applaud, must not be taken liberties with, or they will know the reason why.|$|R

2500|$|... "To <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> Fatima is to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> Portuguese Catholicism". Jeffrey S. Bennett takes note of how, {{starting}} in the 1930s, the image of Our Lady of Fatima developed into a rallying point for anti-communism, an idea that spread far beyond the Iberian peninsula. Martindale mentions a concept where the fruits of a phenomenon {{are more important than}} its historical origins. Therefore, it is possible to conceive of a vibrant cultus where the strength of the devotion, shrine, or pilgrimage, can outweigh uncertainties regarding its origin. According to Maunder, Fatima demonstrates not only how seriously Catholics took [...] "the revelations of an enclosed nun remembering visions she had experienced at the age of ten, but also show how difficult it is for the hierarchy to manage a movement of popular piety, despite critics claims of manipulation. Following Fatima, there would be proliferation of apocalyptic manifestations, such as at Necedah.|$|E

2500|$|A {{statue of}} the American {{entertainer}} Michael Jackson was unveiled by Al-Fayed in April 2011 at Craven Cottage In 1999 Jackson had attended a league game against Wigan Athletic at the stadium.

I don't want them to be fans." [...] The statue was removed by the club's new owners in 2013; Al-Fayed blamed the club's subsequent relegation from the Premier League on the 'bad luck' brought by its removal. Al-Fayed then donated the statue to the National Football Museum.|$|E

The video is roughly one hour long, but contains 30 minutes of singing, either by the group of children accompanying him, or by Mr. T himself. He sings [...] "Treat Your Mother Right (Treat Her Right)," [...] and also raps a song about growing up in the ghetto and praising God. The raps in this video were written by Ice-T.|$|E

2500|$|Within the church, {{there have}} also been a number of {{unofficial}} statements regarding gender. For example, [...] "Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family" [...] (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, [...] "Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children." [...] The book also states: God created us male and female. This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. What we call gender is an essential characteristic of our existence prior to our birth. Gender is part of our eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. Although we may not know all the reasons why this is so, we do know some of the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. To achieve our exaltation, an eternal marriage {{between a man and a}} woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars, {{pointing}} out the CGI as the apex achievement of the film.

Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan remarked that [...] "The Jungle Book is the kind of family film calculated to make even those without families wish they had one to take along." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, labeling it scary and thrilling, yet unique and unforgettable, and adding that it [...] "fills us with something rare in movies today — a sense of wonder." [...] The Village Voices Bilge Ebiri hailed the film as fast and light and that it [...] "manages to be just scary enough to make us feel the danger of solitude {{in the middle of a}} massive jungle, but never indulgent or gratuitous." [...] The New York Times Manohla Dargis was less enthusiastic. Cath Clarke of Time Out compared Elba's character of Shere Khan to Scar from The Lion King, calling him [...] "baddie of the year." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com also had high praise for Elba's portrayal of Shere Khan stating: [...] "His loping menace is envisioned so powerfully that he'd be scary no matter what, but the character becomes a great villain through imaginative empathy.
