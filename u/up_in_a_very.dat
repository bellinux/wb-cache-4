George had a nanny named Miss Euphemia Andrew as a child, who was also very strict. George is often away at work and rarely spends time with the children.

500|$|In the Americas, Native American {{nations were}} {{severely}} damaged by European settlers, specifically {{because of the}} Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation [...] "in the frustration of not having the technology {{to allow you to}} prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side." [...] In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny. Favreau also said of the premise, [...] "It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> classic way and then turns it on its ear." [...] When the aliens appear, the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to The Magnificent Seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the duties}} {{assigned}} to Simms {{was to find}} a suitable location for the factory. Simms found the Trusty Oil Engine Works, a company in receivership whose six-acre site at Cheltenham included a foundry, a machine shop, and testing facilities. Simms recommended buying the works immediately since, with ready facilities and the availability of skilled workers, they could start <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> short time.

They also had five daughters, including Christophine, the eldest. Schiller grew <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> religious family and {{spent much of his}} youth studying the Bible, which would later influence his writing for the theatre. [...] His father was away in the Seven Years' War when Friedrich was born. He was named after king Frederick the Great, but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone. Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever he happened to be stationed. When the war ended in 1763, Schiller's father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to nearby Lorch.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Lowenthal {{was cast}} as Jinnosuke, aka [...] "Kuma", a teddy-bear-headed warrior, in the anime feature Afro Samurai which starred Samuel L. Jackson {{as the title}} character. In an {{interview}} with Eastern Kicks, Lowenthal said that what he liked about Jinno was that he [...] "starts off as one guy and ends <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different, very very dark place.

What's not to like?" [...] He also said that they recorded the voicing for Afro Samurai separately so he did not get to meet Jackson personally until a release party for the related video game years later. Luke Carroll of Anime News Network described Lowenthal's voicing as a [...] "good performance" [...] but [...] "not enough to make it more than an average dub at best". Dennis Amith of J-ENT! thought the voice acting was well done. Lowenthal would reprise the role in the 2009 feature [...] Steve Fritz of Newsarama wrote [...] "The action sequencing is still top notch, and the vocal performances from Jackson, [...] Liu, Lowenthal and company is on the money." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early January 2009, Romney {{supported}} the $750 billion federal {{economic stimulus package}} proposed by the incoming president, Barack Obama, {{who had not yet}} taken office. Romney said at the time: [...] "I frankly wish that the last Congress would have dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president [...] could assign that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> difficult time.... I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies." [...] However, as a candidate for president in May 2012, Romney said that the economic stimulus package that had been enacted in February 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) had been a waste of money that did little to jump-start the economy, and that the federal government had inflated the numbers of jobs that had been created or preserved by the various projects funded through the stimulus program.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to find yourself. There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. I mean that the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point. In Iceland, you understand empirically exactly what this place is: its what and how. That accessibility effects the nature of one’s experience, the experience of the world. Any place you’re going to stand in, in any given moment, is a complement {{to the rest of the}} world, historically and empirically. What you can see in that moment, what you can touch in that moment, is confluent with everything else.|$|E
