5000|$|Hill {{has also}} spoken {{out against the}} police tactic of stings in which police {{officers}} go <b>undercover</b> as gay <b>men</b> and according to Hill try to [...] "entrap" [...] gay men into committing crimes.

2500|$|About an hour later, {{the same}} IRA unit raided College Square but found nobody there. Meanwhile, {{a unit of}} the 3rd Battalion made for the room above the massage parlour, which they {{believed}} was being using to gather intelligence. They claimed to have shot three <b>undercover</b> soldiers: two <b>men</b> and a woman. According to some sources, the IRA claimed to have killed two surveillance officers allegedly hidden in the laundry van, and two MRF members at the massage parlour. However, the British military only confirmed the death of the van driver on that day. Brendan Hughes said that the operation [...] "was a great morale booster for the IRA and for the people that were involved".|$|R
50|$|In 1933, David Barr is {{the manager}} and chief {{designer}} of Glasgow shipbuilding firm Burns, McKinnon & Co. He {{comes up with}} a radical new ship design that can carry 25% more cargo for the tonnage and use less fuel {{at a time when the}} industry as a whole is in recession. Barr decides to build not just one ship, as Lord Dean advises, but twenty (to bring the costs down to a manageable level). Manning, a rival shipbuilder Barr loathes, hears rumors and sends two <b>men</b> <b>undercover</b> to find out what they can. They manage to get themselves hired. Manning then offers to purchase either the design or all the ships they can build. Both offers are rejected.|$|R
5000|$|Bauer {{worked in}} Hollywood {{under the name}} David Wolfe until being blacklisted. As a result, the Internet Movie Database and other online sources confuse many of his film credits with those of another David Wolfe (1915-1994). The [...] "David Wolfe" [...] who appears in The <b>Undercover</b> <b>Man,</b> Where The Sidewalk Ends, Salt of the Earth. and other Hollywood films of the period is in fact David Bauer.|$|E
5000|$|Yet, {{the staff}} at Variety {{magazine}} gave the film a positive review, and wrote, [...] "Narrated in a straightforward, hardhitting documentary style, The <b>Undercover</b> <b>Man</b> is a good crime-busting saga. Standout features are the pic's sustained pace and its realistic quality. Fresh, natural dialog help {{to cover up the}} formula yarn, while topnotch performances down the line carry conviction. Joseph H. Lewis's direction also mutes the melodramatic elements but manages to keep the tension mounting through a series of violent episodes." ...|$|E
50|$|Red was an <b>undercover</b> <b>man</b> for the cops. With {{only one}} man on the force, his old friend Inspector Scott, {{absolutely}} sure what side he was truly on, Red undertook the most dangerous possible missions — infiltrating the ranks of deadly gangsters while seldom able to count on {{the support of the}} police. At first Red worked alone, but he later picked up a kid named Ouchy Mugouchy. Eventually, Ouchy and a couple of friends, collectively known as The Terrific Three, became major stars.|$|E

5000|$|The {{anthology}} format {{also allowed}} {{the show to}} try out characters and settings for series development, and, during its broadcast run, Police Story generated three spin-offs. A first-season episode, [...] "The Gamble," [...] starring Angie Dickinson, became the pilot for the successful Police Woman, which ran from 1974 to 1978. [...] "The Return of Joe Forrester," [...] a second-season episode starring Lloyd Bridges, was developed into the weekly series Joe Forrester, which lasted a full season. Finally, [...] "A Chance to Live," [...] a special episode from the fifth season starring David Cassidy, was spun off into the series <b>Man</b> <b>Undercover.</b> That series didn't do as well, and lasted only ten episodes.|$|R
50|$|Five {{tracks were}} {{previously}} released on the 1999 eMusic compilation album Long Tall Weekend, while four others are culled from the Working <b>Undercover</b> for the <b>Man</b> EP.

Others were produced for various side projects, such as ABC's Nightline in Primetime TV mini-series Brave New World ("All Alone", a sea shanty-like song about a bacterium transported to the Moon by Surveyor 3); a special edition of McSweeney's Quarterly Concern ("Theme from McSweeney's"); and the radio show This American Life ("I'm Sick (of This American Life)").
