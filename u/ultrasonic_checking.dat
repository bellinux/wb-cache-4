40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{general-purpose}} detectors to {{be provided}} for the LHC project at CERN. The design field of the CMS superconducting magnet is 4 T, the magnetic length is 12. 5 m and the free bore is 6 m. In order to withstand the electro-mechanical forces during the operation of the CMS magnet, the superconducting cable embedded in a 99. 998 % pure aluminum matrix is reinforced with two sections of aluminum alloy EN AW- 6082 assembled by continuous Electron Beam Welding (EBW). A dedicated production line has been designed by Techmeta, a leading company in the field of EBW. The production line has a total length of 70 m. Non-stop welding of each of the 20 lengths of 2. 5 km, required to build the coil, will last 22 hours. EBW is the most critical process involved in the production line. The main advantage of the EBW process is to minimize the Heat Affected Zone; this is particularly important for avoiding damage to the superconducting cable located only 4. 7 mm from the welded joints. Two welding guns of 20 kW each operate in parallel in a vacuum chamber fitted with dynamic airlocks. After welding, the conductor is continuously machined on the four faces and on each corner to obtain the required dimensions and surface finish. Special emphasis has been put on quality monitoring. All significant production parameters are recorded during operation and relevant samples are taken from each length for destructive testing purposes. In addition, a continuous phased array <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>checking</b> device is located immediately after the welding unit for the continuous welding quality control, along with a dimension laser measurement unit following the machining. 8 Refs.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problems in}} making Non-Destructive Testing of <b>Ultrasonic</b> Unit <b>Checks</b> via a WebService according to the standards ISO TC- 135 and SS-EN 12668. The task was to build a WebService which can handle the two standards as well as be able to extract coordinates from a photography on an oscilloscope screen with the corresponding time function. The core problem is to extract the data {{from a wide range}} of different types of photographies. The focus in this thesis is on photography with a green component in the graph. Result from the extraction of coordinates shows good accuracy. Only small deviation can be detected if the extracted coordinates are interlaced with the original photography. An runnable WebService has also been developed...|$|R

However, cervical stenosis and deformation prevented the probe from passing through the cervical canal, and the external os was unclear. Assisted by transvaginal ultrasonic echo, we injected potassium chloride to the fetus. Most of contents of the uterus were exhausted by postoperative day 4. By transvaginal <b>ultrasonic</b> echo <b>checked</b> at postoperative day 9, no contents were recognized in the uterine cavity. The human chorionic gonadotropin level from a urinary test was ascertained as under 50 IU/ 1.

40|$|Recently, {{multilayer}} piping {{has been}} used widely. Multilayer piping has excellent durability and corrosion resistance. An effective means for quality maintenance of multilayer piping is the laser <b>ultrasonic</b> technique for <b>checking</b> the state of adhesion of the vinyl chloride layer and the steel layer of multilayer piping. The wave is refracted at the interface between the steel layer and the vinyl chloride layer based on the wave motion principle. The arrival time of the reflection wave was calculated and confirmed by measurements. If measurement of piping under high temperature becomes possible, {{the effectiveness of the}} non-destructive testing technology by the laser ultrasonic technique can be expected, enabling the production of higher reliability and quality of multilayer piping...|$|R
30|$|Before forging the gear, the {{oxidized}} {{layer and}} surface defects were removed using a hand sand wheel to effectively avoid the cracking phenomenon of forging residue. In the forging process, the procedures must be strictly followed; the forging temperature must be strictly controlled with the temperature difference not exceeding 300  °C. After forging, the forging part must be normalized under more than 950  °C and tempered less than 600  °C to eliminate forging stress and improve cutting performance. After a rough-machining of the gear blank, each part underwent an <b>ultrasonic</b> defect <b>check.</b> A grinding undercut large radius hob {{was used for}} gear grinding to increase gear root fillet, and improve the impact resistance and bearing capacity of gears. In the carburizing and quenching heat treatment process, the carbon potential concentrations were strictly controlled at 0.8  %– 1.0  %. A “quenching + deep freezing + low temperature tempering” process was used {{to ensure that the}} gear surface hardness reached HRC 58 - 62, surface carbide reached Grade 1 – 3, the depth of effective hardened layer reached 1.5 – 1.7  mm range (including grinding), core hardness reached HRC 38 approximately, and retained austenite content was less than 9  %. All gears were ground in high precision grinding machine NILES, and some of the key components, such as planetary gear and sun gear, were under tip relief operation. At the same time, the accuracy of gear machining was one level higher than the specified level on the drawings to ensure a good meshing of the gears. The ground gears were treated by strengthened shot blast to eliminate the burns on the tooth surface and increase residual compressive stress, thereby enhancing the gear’s contact fatigue strength and bending fatigue strength.|$|R
40|$|A cocured {{carbon fibre}} {{composite}} stiffened panel {{was designed to}} have an early onset of skin buckling and larger postbuckled strength. IMA/M 21 prepreg was used for fabricating the panel using autoclave moulding process. Special end fixtures were developed using a metallic casing and the panel was encased in it using a mixture of epoxy resin and aluminium powder. The panel was tested under axial compression to its full load bearing capacity in a universal testing machine. Full field displacement measurement was carried out using advanced techniques like Digital Image Correlation (DIC) apart from acoustic emission technique and strain gauges for monitoring the structural response. After the test, the panel was subjected to <b>ultrasonic</b> scan to <b>check</b> for any delamination or disbonding that might have occurred due to post buckled response. Concurrently, a finite element model was developed to predict the buckling and postbuckling response of panel. DIC captured the onset of skin buckling and deformations/ mode shapes in postbuckling regime. These experimental observations were correlated with numerical simulations. In the postbuckled regime, severe bending and twisting of skin and stringers was observed, resulting in complete loss of global axial stiffness of the panel. It is suspected that such a state of stress in the panel could lead to delamination, debonding or fiber failures. However, acoustic emission sensors bonded to the panel did not record any significant events during tests, even in the deep postbuckled regime. This was further corroborated through ultrasonic inspection conducted after unloading the panel...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 35 - 42 Severely damaged rotors {{often can}} be rebuilt even when damage has {{occurred}} to the shaft/rotor forging. Such shop repair returns {{what would have}} been a scrapped or degraded rotor to original equipment standards. The repair procedure is to: ? Remove damaged areas of the rotor by machining. ? Build up metal with metallurgically compatible weld wire and fluxes, using submerged arc welding in sequences as dictated by repair design. ? Thoroughly inspect the welded/machined area by magnetic particle, <b>ultrasonic,</b> and dye <b>check</b> procedures after each sequence. ? Stress relieve the welded area after each sequence, using computer controlled heating of the desired area so as to control hardness in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and assure adequate metallurgical properties in the weld metal. ? Repeat these sequences until the repaired area conforms to the design required by welding engineering, mechanical engineering, insurance specialists, and/or consulting metallurgical laboratories. These procedures can often provide metallurgical properties superior to those of the original material, move the heat affected zone (HAZ) out of the steam path, strengthen the repaired area, compensate for anticipated problems, and/or improve the original design of the rotor. Such repairs involve use of special jigs, equipment, techniques, and procedures. A detailed description of the turbine rim weld repair is given, including use of supplementary pictures, drawings and techniques. Cracks were discovered in the body of a nominal 22 in diameter, first stage Curtis wheel of a forged turbine rotor. Laboratory analysis indicated the cracks were due to stress corrosion, believed to have been caused by caustic introduced accidentally with inlet steam. The damaged portion of the wheel was removed by machining at a point well into the unaffected portion of the wheel. The remaining rim was welded to build up, heat treated, finish machined to accept blades, and rebladed. The finished rotor was dynamically balanced at operating speed, installed in its casing, and returned to service. The reinstalled rotor has operated without trouble at up to design conditions for a number of months. These welding procedures were evolved and improved through experience gained over the past eight years in the repair of about 80 damaged turbine rims. Similar repairs have also been performed on centrifugal compressor rotor wheels and shafting. Monitoring and periodic shop inspection of these welded rotors has shown no degradation in the repaired areas. Repair costs have been well below those that would have been incurred by replacement with original vendor equipment and, most often, in significantly less time than it would have taken if a new rotor was provided from the original equipment manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) of deep {{foundations}} {{has become}} an integral part of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s standard manufacturing processes. It is not unusual for the evaluation of the integrity of the concrete to include the measurement of ultrasonic wave speeds. Numerous methods have been proposed that use the propagation speed of <b>ultrasonic</b> waves to <b>check</b> the integrity of concrete for drilled shaft foundations. All such methods evaluate the integrity of the concrete inside the cage and between the access tubes. The integrity of the concrete outside the cage remains to be considered to determine the location of the border between the concrete and the soil in order to obtain the diameter of the drilled shaft. It is also economic to devise a methodology to obtain the diameter of the drilled shaft using the Cross-Hole Sonic Logging system (CSL). Performing such a methodology using the CSL and following the CSL tests is performed and used to check the integrity of the inside concrete, thus allowing the determination of the drilled shaft diameter without having to set up another NDT device. ^ This proposed new method is based on the installation of galvanized tubes outside the shaft across from each inside tube, and performing the CSL test between the inside and outside tubes. From the performed experimental work a model is developed to evaluate the relationship between the thickness of concrete and the ultrasonic wave properties using signal processing. The experimental results show that there is a direct correlation between concrete thicknesses outside the cage and maximum amplitude of the received signal obtained from frequency domain data. This study demonstrates how this new method to measuring the diameter of drilled shafts during construction using a NDT method overcomes the limitations of currently-used methods. ^ In the other part of study, a new method is proposed to visualize and quantify the extent and location of the defects. It is based on a color change in the frequency amplitude of the signal recorded by the receiver probe in the location of defects and it is called Frequency Tomography Analysis (FTA). Time-domain data is transferred to frequency-domain data of the signals propagated between tubes using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Then, distribution of the FTA will be evaluated. This method is employed after CSL has determined the high probability of an anomaly in a given area and is applied to improve location accuracy and to further characterize the feature. The technique has a very good resolution and clarifies the exact depth location of any void or defect through the length of the drilled shaft for the voids inside the cage. ^ The last part of study also evaluates the effect of voids inside and outside the reinforcement cage and corrosion in the longitudinal bars on the strength and axial load capacity of drilled shafts. The objective is to quantify the extent of loss in axial strength and stiffness of drilled shafts due to presence of different types of symmetric voids and corrosion throughout their lengths. ...|$|R
