5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they may}} not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford {{developed}} an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They {{became one of the most}} successful double steal pairings in baseball history.|$|E

5000|$|Albert Cleary: Comptroller, Albert is a {{financial}} genius and always keeps a cool head, even when presenting bills {{to the likes}} of Doctor Doom. He possesses the <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> never <b>to</b> wrinkle his suit. Doctor Doom at one time offers Cleary a job. Cleary politely turned down the offer. Doom respected Cleary's decision enough to let him live. Although Cleary will never admit it, he found his encounter with Doom unnerving.|$|R
5000|$|... "In recounting such events, Mr. Self {{demonstrates}} an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability,</b> similar <b>to</b> that {{displayed by}} Kafka in The Metamorphosis, to lend utterly absurd events {{an aura of}} verisimilitude by grounding the fantastic in the mundane. He possesses all those gifts a satiric writer might want: an eye for the telling detail, an ear for the pretensions of contemporary locution, an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> write idiosyncratic prose that twinkles with cleverness and wit. Unfortunately, in this volume, these copious gifts are all too frequently put {{in the service of}} a misogynistic and ridiculously sophomoric vision. [...] " [...] Michiko Kakutani, New York Times ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{he began working}} {{full-time}} on short stories and radio scripts, and during that period, he was a gagwriter for radio host Robert Q. Lewis. Chayefsky later recalled, [...] "I sold some plays to men who had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> not <b>to</b> raise money." [...] During 1951-52, Chayefsky wrote adaptations for radio's Theater Guild on the Air: The Meanest Man in the World (with James Stewart), Cavalcade of America, Tommy (with Van Heflin and Ruth Gordon) and Over 21 (with Wally Cox).|$|R
25|$|He {{was also}} able to master {{difficult}} Lotus sportscar prototypes such as the Lotus30 and 40. Clark had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adapt to whichever car he was driving. Whilst other drivers would struggle {{to find a good}} car setup, Clark would usually set competitive lap times with whatever setup was provided and ask for the car to be left as it was.|$|E
25|$|His {{personal}} {{warmth and}} charm were {{combined with an}} <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inspire confidence {{in a wide range}} of people. No other Irish leader of the time matched his remarkable ability to recruit people of every kind to the movement, win their trust and loyalty, pinpoint their capacities and unite them in coordinated action that was of maximum value to the cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} 120 days in office, Castelli passed {{two pieces of}} {{legislation}}, {{the first of which}} was signed into law by Governor David A. Paterson as Chapter 294 of the Laws of 2010. Castelli showed an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> pass his own prime-sponsored legislation despite {{being a member of the}} Assembly's minority, which has a reputation for legislative powerlessness amid the control of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph M. Koehler {{described}} Nesbitt's {{talent in}} a review in the July 31, 1943, issue of Billboard: [...] "His sense of the dramatic, <b>uncanny</b> timing and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> discover the exact moment when drama must replace the spoken word combine to explain why he's radio's No. 1 story-teller." ...|$|R
2500|$|... : The fourth demon to be defeated, he is a blind swordsman who {{challenges}} Jubei to a {{fight to}} the death in a bamboo forest. He uses his <b>uncanny</b> hearing <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> seek out his enemies, and can blind them by reflecting light from his sword. He is the only Devil of Kimon without any apparent supernatural powers. He is killed by Jubei due to Kagero's sword blocking his own, which he could not hear, making it appear as if Jubei had blocked and attacked him at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Is God A Mathematician? was {{released}} on January 6, 2009. It discusses the <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> of mathematics <b>to</b> describe and predict accurately the physical world. Livio also attempts {{to answer a question}} with which mathematicians and philosophers have struggled for centuries: Is mathematics ultimately invented or discovered? The book was selected by the Washington Post {{as one of the best}} books of 2009, and it was also selected as a [...] "2009 Borders Original Voices" [...] finalist.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} Hiddink rated Song so highly was his <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> shut down {{opposing}} players - against the highly fancied Portugal, Song was deployed as a wingback and successfully marked a (although injured) Luís Figo {{out of the game}} during Korea's group match, greatly reducing the threat to Korea's defence. Ironically, Song started his professional career as a right winger and Luís Figo was his greatest idol.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a lateral}} thinker, a {{prolific}} reader, especially of military history, and a linguist who was proficient in several languages. A superb conversationalist {{known for his}} disarming charm and excellent social and people skills, he had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> establish rapport and win people over and achieve consensus. Sharaf could be obdurate, refusing {{to comply with the}} instructions of international border officials to postpone his travel till daylight and insisting on his right, as a diplomat, to free and unfettered movement across borders, only to be told of the impossibility of crossing the border at night due to dangers associated with the presence of active mine fields.|$|E
25|$|When Johnson {{arrived in}} a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or {{in front of the}} local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical {{associates}} have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.|$|E
2500|$|Bird possessed an <b>uncanny</b> and unparalleled <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{anticipate}} {{and react}} to the strategies of his opponents. His talent for recognizing the moves of opponents and teammates prompted his first coach with the Celtics, Bill Fitch, to nickname him [...] "Kodak", because he seemed to formulate mental pictures of every play that {{took place on the}} court.|$|R
5000|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were very positive. The film {{received}} an overall score of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, thus obtaining a [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] rating. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Although McNamara is photographed through the Interrotron, the movie is far from offering only a talking head. Morris is <b>uncanny</b> in his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bring life to the abstract, and here he uses graphics, charts, moving titles and visual effects in counterpoint to what McNamara is saying." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{changes with}} the arrival of Jason McCullough (James Garner), a calm and {{exceptionally}} competent man from [...] "back east" [...] who says he is only passing through town on his way to Australia. While in the town saloon, he sees young Joe Danby (Bruce Dern) gun down a man. Needing money after discovering the town's ruinous rate of inflation, McCullough demonstrates his <b>uncanny</b> firearms <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> the mayor and town council, and becomes the new sheriff. He breaks up a street brawl and while at the Perkins house meets Prudy under circumstances that are mortifying for her. McCullough arrests Joe and tosses him in the town's unfinished jail, which lacks bars for the cell doors and windows. McCullough keeps the dimwitted Joe imprisoned {{through the use of a}} chalk line, some dribbles of red paint, and applied psychology.|$|R
25|$|His uncle soon {{discovered}} that Hamilton had a remarkable ability to learn languages, and from a young age, had displayed an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> acquire them (although this is disputed by some historians, who claim he had only a very basic understanding of them). At {{the age of seven}} he had already made very considerable progress in Hebrew, and before he was thirteen he had acquired, under the care of his uncle (a linguist), almost as many languages as he had years of age. These included the classical and modern European languages, and Persian, Arabic, Hindustani, Sanskrit, and even Marathi and Malay. He retained much of his knowledge of languages {{to the end of his}} life, often reading Persian and Arabic in his spare time, although he had long since stopped studying languages, and used them just for relaxation.|$|E
500|$|According to Susan Zuccotti, Venturi [...] "had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{gain access}} where more {{official}} papal diplomats could not" [...] and thus was utilized {{for some of}} the most important papal priorities. Venturi had no official rank in the church to match his extraordinary influence, and was known in Vatican circles as the [...] "man in black".|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from [...] {{called the}} poems in Diiie [...] "craftsmanlike and powerful though not great poetry", and recommended it for libraries with {{a collection of}} African-American literature. [...] Critic William Sylvester, who says that Angelou [...] "has an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> capture the sound of a voice on a page", places her poems, especially the ones in this volume, in the [...] "background of black rhythms". [...] Chad Walsh, reviewing Diiie in Book World, calls Angelou's poems [...] "a moving blend of lyricism and harsh social observation".|$|E
50|$|As Conan {{was often}} deeply {{suspicious}} of magic, this barbarian was {{limited in its}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use magical items until higher levels. This class was a great leaper and an able climber, like Conan. The D&D 3.5 version retained some similarities, but eliminated the disdain for magic. A less psychotic version of a berserker's fury was incorporated as the rage ability (previously, berserkers had been NPCs or monsters) for barbarians. The 3.5 barbarian remained close to its archetypal founder, however, possessing a trap sense and <b>uncanny</b> dodge <b>abilities</b> similar <b>to</b> Conan's keen eye for trouble. In 4th edition, the barbarians' rage abilities are overtly magical; the barbarian allowing himself or herself to be possessed by Primal (nature) spirits which provide supernatural rage. Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd is also an influence.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} in which Beren first sees Luthien she is dressed in blue. Later she encases herself in her own hair as she escapes from the tree house in which she has been imprisoned. She has many <b>uncanny</b> powers, {{including}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> cast sleep over others, to sing songs of enchantment and slumber, to change her form (to a vampire at one point) and that of her lover and use these shapes to enable efficient transport, {{as well as the}} power of healing and the power to cast off her body and go to the halls of the dead and plead for her lover to be returned.|$|R
50|$|High {{school senior}} Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) is {{introduced}} as a stereotypical, shallow cheerleader at Hemery High School in Los Angeles. She is a carefree popular girl whose main concerns are shopping and {{spending time with}} her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey. While at school one day, she is approached {{by a man who}} calls himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland). He informs her that she is The Slayer, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> not known <b>to</b> her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature, indifference to slaying and sharp-tongued remarks.|$|R
500|$|The Argos {{reached an}} all-time low in 1981 when they {{finished}} 2–14; this despite having such talented players as quarterback Condredge Holloway, running back Cedric Minter, and receiver Terry Greer. The team began the year 0–10 and {{there was talk of}} a [...] "perfect" [...] losing season. The team had been inept so long by this point (29 seasons without a Grey Cup win) that the notion of an [...] "Argo Bounce" [...] had become inverted; now [...] "it was the unluckiest bounce in the world, the one that usually arose from the Argos' <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> lose critical games in the dying minutes by committing an improbable blunder." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Douglas' demure appearance—she {{stood at}} [...] and weighed , {{and was always}} immaculately dressed in pearls, a floppy straw hat and gloves—she had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> get her point across. She was known for {{speaking}} in perfect, precise paragraphs, and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades. Jeff Klinkenberg, {{a reporter for the}} St. Petersburg Times who interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas, wrote of her, [...] "She had a tongue like a switchblade and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen." [...] Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.|$|E
500|$|In {{reference}} to the song [...] "Secrets of the Sun", Binkelman describes [...] "lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic {{with a dash of}} wistfulness besides". The synth sounds remind him a little of Ray Lynch. [...] Parsons details this as [...] "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements". [...] Debbage writes that [...] "the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph’s <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> compose elegant and emotive ballads. Back track to 'Secrets Of The Sun' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on 'The Edge Of My Heart'.|$|E
50|$|Schnyder {{also played}} rugby for the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. During this period, Schnyder learned to run {{large-scale}} operations. His boundless energy and his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{be involved in}} almost every aspect at the factories {{as well as his}} <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> with Thai language abetted his success.|$|R
50|$|Charles Cannan, who {{had been}} {{instrumental}} in Gell's removal, succeeded Gell in 1898, and Humphrey S. Milford, his younger colleague, effectively succeeded Frowde in 1907. Both were Oxford men who knew the system inside out, and the close collaboration with which they worked was a function of their shared background and worldview. Cannan was known for terrifying silences, and Milford had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability,</b> testified <b>to</b> by Amen House employees, to 'disappear' in a room rather like a Cheshire cat, from which obscurity he would suddenly address his subordinates and make them jump. Whatever their reasons for their style of working, both Cannan and Milford had a very hardnosed view of {{what needed to be}} done, and they proceeded to do it. Indeed, Frowde knew within a few weeks of Milford's entering the London office in 1904 that he would be replaced. Milford, however, always treated Frowde with courtesy, and Frowde remained in an advisory capacity till 1913. Milford rapidly teamed up with J. E. Hodder Williams of Hodder and Stoughton, setting up what was known as the Joint Account for the issue {{of a wide range of}} books in education, science, medicine and also fiction. Milford began putting in practice a number of initiatives, including the foundations of most of the Press's global branches.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{a system}} of imagery for {{olfaction}} exists is currently an unsettled issue. Moreover, the dimensions underlying odor perception have eluded researchers for many years. Two experiments bearing on these issues are presented. In one experiment, a group of 32 undergraduates rated the similarity of pairs of 16 commonplace odorants (e. g., chocolate and leather) they perceived using scratch and sniff stimuli; in another, a different group of 44 undergraduates was asked to imagine and then rate the similarity of the same pairs of odors. Multidimensional scaling of the data suggests that three-dimensional solutions with similar stimulus dimensions, such as fruitiness, strength, and familiarity, underlied the ratings of both perceived and imagined odors. By finding that similar dimensions define the psychological space of both the imagery and the perception tasks, {{this study suggests that}} imagery does indeed exist for olfaction. Many have remarked on the <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> of smells <b>to</b> revive long-forgotten memories (e. g., Engen, 1987; Laird, 1935). Some researchers have shown a relationship between odor and emotion experimentally (e. g., Ehrlichman & Halpern...|$|R
500|$|Michael {{lives in}} two {{separate}} realities after a car accident. In one reality (where he wears a red wristband), his wife Hannah (Laura Allen) survives the accident; in the other reality (where he wears a green wristband), his son Rex (Dylan Minnette) survives. Michael does not know which reality is real and uses the wristbands to differentiate between the two. He sees two therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) in the [...] "red reality" [...] and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones) in the [...] "green reality". At work, Michael's erratic behavior triggers clashes with his team; {{they do not know}} about Michael's <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> solve crimes using details from both realities.|$|E
500|$|The X-Files {{centers on}} a pair of FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases usually, but not exclusively, linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Agent Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Agent Scully has been {{assigned}} by the FBI to debunk his work. However, the two have developed a close friendship. In [...] "Trevor", Agents Mulder and Scully search for an escaped convict in Mississippi who was suspected of killing his prison warden under mysterious circumstances. They then set out to find and apprehend him, but in doing so, Agents Mulder and Scully quickly discover that he has the <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> pass through solid, conductive materials.|$|E
500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it {{a long time ago and}} decided I would step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Tigers were {{considered}} <b>uncanny</b> for their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> search territory and smoke out enemy soldiers and weapons. They would plan operations meticulously {{and sometimes even}} rehearse it beforehand. The soldiers would seal off a relatively small area, no more than 9 or 10 square kilometers. Troops would be brought in by air and land, but would arrive {{at the same time}} to maximize the chokehold. Slowly but surely the cordon would be tightened, and everyone and everything would be searched. Civilians were separated and interrogated, routinely offered rewards if they cooperated. It was not unusual for an area to be searched three or four times by different platoons. To prevent enemy breakouts, the Koreans had special reaction forces that could plug holes in the perimeter. General William R. Peers considered the Koreans the best at these so-called [...] "cordon and search operations." ...|$|R
5000|$|All other supernatural <b>abilities</b> are termed <b>Uncanny</b> <b>Abilities</b> and are {{presented}} in a modular fashion breaking down these abilities into statistics. These powers are based on skill type attribute dependent [...] "power checks". <b>Uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> are built from general categories determining their nature and filling in the varying statistics needed for gameplay. The experience system is point reliant but uses them in a [...] "cash-in" [...] system. That is allowing players to [...] "buy" [...] certain perks such as feats, combat and class levels which expends experience points.|$|R
