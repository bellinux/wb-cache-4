The study showed {{that it is impossible to}} remove the smaller air bubbles (dissolved air) that are created during the injection process, even when the injection pipe is fully saturated. The pumping tests showed that there were large differences in the well hydraulic parameters between the pumping and the recharge tests despite that they were conducted at the same well. Two mechanisms are responsible for the reduction in the aquifer coefficients during the recharge event. The first mechanism is the pressures that the injected water needs to overcome; the aquifer pressure and the pore water pressure it is supposed to replace at the time of the injection. The second mechanism is the pressure that the injected water needs to overcome the clogging process. It is expressed as the high water level inside the recharge well in comparison to the small rising of the water level in the observation wells. This research gives good insight into the injection mechanism through wells and is essential for any further development of injection facilities and for the operation and management protocols...|$|R

The network comprises: wind turbines; electrolysers, fuel cells, compressors and expanders; pressurised vessels and underground storage for hydrogen storage; hydrogen pipelines and electricity overhead/underground transmission lines; and fuelling stations and distribution pipelines. The spatial distribution and temporal variability of energy demands and wind availability were considered in detail in the model. The suitable sites for wind turbines were identified using GIS, by applying a total of 10 technical and environmental constraints (buffer distances from urban areas, rivers, roads, airports, woodland and so on), and {{used to determine the}} maximum number of new wind turbines that can be installed in each zone. The objective is the minimisation of the total cost of the network, subject to satisfying all of the demands of the domestic transport sector in Great Britain. The model simultaneously determines the optimal number, size and location of each technology, whether to transmit the energy as electricity or hydrogen, the structure of the transmission network, the hourly operation of each technology and so on. The cost of distribution was estimated from the number of fuelling stations and length of the distribution pipelines, which were determined from the demand density at the 1  km level. Results indicate that all of Britain's domestic transport demand can be met by on-shore wind through appropriately designed and operated hydrogen-electricity networks. Within the set of technologies considered, the optimal solution is: to build a hydrogen pipeline network in the south of England and Wales; to supply the Midlands and Greater London with hydrogen from the pipeline network alone; to use Humbly Grove <b>underground</b> <b>storage</b> for <b>seasonal</b> <b>storage</b> and pressurised vessels at different locations for hourly balancing as well as seasonal storage; for Northern Wales, Northern England and Scotland to be self-sufficient, generating and storing all of the hydrogen locally.

The {{model has been}} designed for several Spanish cities that {{are representative of the}} different climatic areas with a significant demand of thermal energy for heating. The system should cover the heating demand of 1000 apartments of 100 m 2 in multifamily buildings with similar features, providing a solar fraction of about 50 % without wasting solar heat in summer and without oversizing the <b>seasonal</b> <b>storage</b> tank. Climatic and specific demand data for each city have been used. The model simulates the solar collector field, pipe lines, heat exchangers, a <b>seasonal</b> <b>storage</b> tank, pumps, auxiliary boiler and auxiliary pieces of equipment needed in the model.

The estimated cost of the heat produced in CSHPSS with a solar fraction of 50 % can be competitive with the heat cost of domestic heat boilers, which is a very common solution for heating in residential buildings in Spain.

40|$|The {{so-called}} closed greenhouse (closed ventilation windows) is {{a recent}} innovation in Dutch greenhouse industry. The technical concept consists of a heat pump, <b>underground</b> (aquifer) <b>seasonal</b> energy <b>storage</b> as well as daytime storage, air treatment units with heat exchangers, and air distribution ducts. Savings of up to 30 % in fossil fuel and production increases by up to 20 %, {{mainly because of the}} continuously high CO 2 concentration, have been reported. Economic feasibility of this innovative greenhouse highly depends on the yield increase that can be obtained. In this simulation study the effects of greenhouse climate on tomato yield in a closed greenhouse are presented. The explanatory model INTKAM was used, which has several submodels e. g. for light interception, leaf photosynthesis and biomass partitioning. The closed greenhouse offers possibilities for combinations of light, temperature, air humidity and CO 2 concentration that are impossible in a conventional greenhouse. At high CO 2 concentration and high light intensity, leaf photosynthesis shows a more narrow optimum for temperature than at high CO 2 and moderate light intensity. However, the response of crop photosynthesis to temperature has a much broader optimum than that of leaf photosynthesis. Besides photosynthesis, temperature also influences aspects like partitioning, leaf area development and fruit development. Yield potential reduces at temperatures above 26 °C, with fruit set being one of the first processes that is negatively influenced by supra-optimal temperatures. Based on actual climatic conditions in a conventional and a closed greenhouse (same crop management) measured during two years, INTKAM predicts an increase in yield by about 17 %. Hence, in a closed greenhouse a higher stem density can be maintained for obtaining the same average fruit weight (size) as in a conventional greenhouse. In 2005 actual yield increase was similar to the simulated one (16 %), but in 2004 only a 9 % higher yield was realized, at least partly because of botrytis infection in the closed greenhouse...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>seasonal</b> heat <b>storage</b> {{is based on}} storing {{sensible}} heat during the season of low heat demand to be used during the cold season, when the need for heating is higher. Combining this concept with solar thermal energy collection produces what is known as: Central Solar Heating Plant with <b>Seasonal</b> <b>Storage</b> (CSHPSS). ^ Thermal energy is stored by injecting heat into the ground by circulating hot water through a matrix of U-tubes inserted 10 to 30 meters deep into the soil. While the CSHPSS technology is becoming increasingly attractive the heat transfer process of <b>seasonal</b> <b>storage</b> remains complex and only very few modeling tools are available. ^ In an effort to properly design a CSHPSS system for the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, several comprehensive design and performance analyses were conducted. Thus, a complete and detailed CSHPSS system model using TRNSYS is presented in this dissertation. The U-tube <b>seasonal</b> <b>storage</b> is modeled based on a validated ground heat storage module, DST. The storage performance given by this model was compared with a finite element model and experimental results. The simulations yielded positive comparisons and a procedure for modeling U-tube storage system was established. ^ The CSHPSS model developed in this work features a unique control strategy that operates on a seasonal basis. This control strategy is based on four modes of operation and is found {{to contribute to the}} simulation stability. This strategy can also provide greater solar contribution to the load as opposed to the conventional ON/OFF controllers. ^ The heat collected by solar collectors is transferred to a storage or a building side through a shell and tube heat exchanger. A heat exchanger model that takes into account variations in the heat transfer coefficient and effectiveness caused by variable flow rates is developed to provide a realistic heat exchanger performance. ^ A thermal analysis of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>storage</b> and the heat exchanger was performed from the first and second law analysis viewpoints. Meaningful interpretations of the heat transfer process in the CSHPSS system can be made from these analyses. Finally, recommendations for improving CSHPSS simulations and performance are discussed. ...|$|R
