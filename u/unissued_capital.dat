The {{possession}} of treasury shares {{does not give}} the company the right to vote, to exercise preemptive rights as a shareholder, to receive cash dividends, or to receive assets on company liquidation. Treasury shares are {{essentially the same as}} <b>unissued</b> <b>capital</b> and no one advocates classifying unissued share capital as an asset on the balance sheet, as an asset should have probable future economic benefits. Treasury shares simply reduce ordinary share capital.|$|E

Sonnenberg and Sir Simon Marks, son of the M&S founder, became good friends which led to M&S buying all <b>unissued</b> share <b>capital</b> of Woolworths in 1947. Later, David Susman, Woolworths' managing director, married Ann Laski, Lord Marks' niece. David Susman became a non-executive director of M&S, a position he held for nearly 30 years. Although M&S ultimately sold its shares of Woolworths, the two companies maintained close personal ties {{as well as a}} formal technology agreement.|$|R

These shares were later sold, but close ties still remain. The first Woolworths store opened in The Old Royal Hotel in Cape Town in October 1931.
