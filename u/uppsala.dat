5|$|After {{the cathedral}} in Gamla <b>Uppsala</b> was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought {{permission}} from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of <b>Uppsala</b> be maintained. At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.|$|E

5|$|In May 1741, Linnaeus was {{appointed}} Professor of Medicine at <b>Uppsala</b> University, first {{with responsibility for}} medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus {{was responsible for the}} Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in <b>Uppsala.</b>|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus felt <b>Uppsala</b> was {{too noisy}} and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in <b>Uppsala.</b> He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of <b>Uppsala</b> and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E

5|$|The {{next step}} was to take an oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from <b>Uppsala,</b> Peter Artedi. Before their departure from <b>Uppsala,</b> Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of <b>Uppsala</b> by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as {{the year of the}} crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact that}} also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in <b>Uppsala.</b> Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of <b>Uppsala</b> for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|About 1272, {{work began}} on {{building}} a new cathedral in Östra Aros near the Fyris River to the south. It was constructed {{on the site of}} the earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity, located almost exactly where the cathedral's chancel now stands. It was here that Sweden's patron saint Eric Jedvardsson had attended mass before he was murdered in 1160. The name of <b>Uppsala</b> was kept, and the surrounding town Östra Aros soon changed its name accordingly. The relics of Saint Eric, the treasure of <b>Uppsala,</b> were moved from Gamla <b>Uppsala</b> to the new site in 1273, along with the formal move of the archbishopric. The church was designed by French architects although the name of the author of the detailed initial plans who supervised work until 1281 has not been recorded. In 1287, a promissory note drawn up by the provost of Paris covers the expenses to be incurred by master builder Étienne de Bonneuil and his assistants in travelling to Sweden to work on the construction of a cathedral at <b>Uppsala.</b> Étienne is credited with work at the east and south chapels of the chancel, the transepts and probably the south portal, although in most of his work he appears to have meticulously followed the plans of his predecessor. Progress was slow as a result of the cold climate, the plague and many financial difficulties. It was not until the end of the 14th century that work on the initial plans was completed, thanks in particular to the contribution of the master builder Nikolaus från Västerås who began construction of the nave.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting these claims, {{the medieval}} Annales Suecici Medii Aevi and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of <b>Uppsala</b> (Henricus scilicet Upsalensis) in 1129, {{participating}} in the consecration of the saint's newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the Chronicon Roskildense written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna, the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was moved a few kilometers to its later location in <b>Uppsala</b> sometime before 1164. He is ignored in all Swedish bishop chronicles, unless he is the same Henry who was later redated to the 1150s. That would make the claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in <b>Uppsala</b> sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{high-profile}} start of Henry's cultus, {{it took more}} than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of <b>Uppsala.</b> According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Linköping seems to have {{played a key role in}} establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in <b>Uppsala</b> nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.|$|E
5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend <b>Uppsala</b> University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In <b>Uppsala,</b> Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In December 1777, he {{had another}} stroke which greatly {{weakened}} him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby. Despite his desire {{to be buried in}} Hammarby, he was buried in <b>Uppsala</b> Cathedral on 22 January.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus was {{relieved}} of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual {{for more than}} ten years after. He stepped down as rector at <b>Uppsala</b> University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.|$|E
5|$|Parallels {{have been}} pointed out between the {{description}} of Urðarbrunnr {{at the base of}} the world tree Yggdrasil and Christian medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen's account of a well at the base of a sacred tree at the Temple at <b>Uppsala,</b> Sweden, found in his 11th century work Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum.|$|E
5|$|The Finsta Chapel or St Eric's Chapel on the north-west {{corner of}} the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy, {{the patron saint of}} Sweden, who was killed in 1160 on the site where <b>Uppsala</b> Cathedral was later built. His shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla <b>Uppsala</b> as soon as work began on the new building. In 1580, King John III melted his shrine down but {{replaced}} it with a new gold-plated one which still contains Eric's relics and crown. The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born. They were entombed in the chapel in 1328. A relic of their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small gold-plated shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{is located}} on Domkyrkoplan in the centre of <b>Uppsala.</b> It is open to {{visitors}} most days from 8 am to 6 pm. The Treasury Museum in the north tower is open from 10 am to 4 pm, Sundays from 12.30 pm.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{historical}} {{record of a}} Bishop of <b>Uppsala</b> called Henry {{during the reign of}} King Eric (about 1156–1160). Early phases of the diocese remain obscure up to the point of Stefan, who was appointed as the archbishop in 1164.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in <b>Uppsala</b> was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of <b>Uppsala,</b> which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E
5|$|Carl Joachim Hambro (7 June 1914 – 19 February 1985) was a Norwegian novelist, journalist, essayist, {{translator}} and Romance philologist. The {{son of the}} Conservative politician C. J. Hambro, he {{embarked on}} a philological career, graduating in 1939. During the Second World War he taught at Oslo Commerce School and the Norwegian College in <b>Uppsala.</b> After the war, he taught Norwegian at Sorbonne, whilst also working as Paris correspondent for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and a few Norwegian daily newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Further {{renovation}} {{work in the}} early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in <b>Uppsala</b> Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus' {{last years}} were troubled by illness. He had {{suffered}} from a disease called the <b>Uppsala</b> fever in 1764, but survived thanks {{to the care of}} Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.|$|E
5|$|No {{surviving}} list {{of bishops}} or dioceses under the Archbishop of <b>Uppsala</b> from 1164, 1189, 1192, 1233, 1241 or 1248 contains {{any reference to}} Finland, neither factual or propagandist. No claim about a Swedish bishop in Finland is made in any other source from the era prior to the so-called Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.|$|E
5|$|The bishop's {{violent death}} itself was nothing {{exceptional}} and {{could well have}} happened. Many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of <b>Uppsala</b> in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Linköping in 1220.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} need for a {{thorough}} revision of the taxonomy of the flowering plants (angiosperms), systematists formed the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), resulting in a new classification published in 1998. The scheme was largely {{based on the work of}} Kåre Bremer and colleagues at <b>Uppsala</b> and Stockholm universities in the late 1970s, and became universally accessible on the internet in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Uppland {{was granted}} arms created for Gustav Vasa's funeral in 1560, and the royal orb symbolises spiritual and worldly power. Historically, Uppland ranked as a duchy and the {{coat of arms}} was {{represented}} with a ducal coronet. Despite the fact that <b>Uppsala</b> län has a different name and a smaller territory, it was granted the same coat of arms in 1940, but with a royal crown {{in place of the}} ducal crown of the landskap arms. Blazon: Gules, a royal orb Or.|$|E
5|$|Back in <b>Uppsala,</b> Linnaeus' {{relations}} with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted {{an invitation from}} the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun. Sohlberg's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic {{was one of the}} most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Solander {{was living}} in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in <b>Uppsala.</b> Linnaeus was very fond of him, {{promising}} Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. Solander {{was not the only}} apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit with}} his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the {{detailed}} results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded {{a grant from the}} Royal Society of Sciences in <b>Uppsala</b> for his journey.|$|E
5|$|He {{was well}} {{regarded}} in Sweden for his studies on Linnaeus, and possessed a good {{grasp of the}} language. In addition to his honorary doctorate from <b>Uppsala,</b> the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded him their Linnaeus Medal in 1972, he was granted the title of Commander of the Swedish Order of the Star of the North (Polar Star) in 1980 and admitted to membership of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1983. Stearn was also elected to membership of the Swedish Linnaeus Society.|$|E
5|$|His {{library and}} {{collections}} {{were left to}} his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to <b>Uppsala.</b> In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried {{to sell it to}} Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.|$|E
