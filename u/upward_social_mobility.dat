As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E

The principal empirical results are: (1) that nonmigrant <b>social</b> <b>mobilities</b> have gender-specific spatial structures; (2) that this gender specificity is greater for upward than for downward social mobility; (3) that women are especially likely to be upwardly mobile in the South East region, and particularly so for entry into managerial posts; (4) that migrant <b>social</b> <b>mobilities</b> have gender-specific spatial structures; (5) that flows to the South East involve <b>upward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobilities</b> both for men and for women but are relatively to the advantage of women's careers; and (6) that flows from the South East often involve the exit of women from the labour market, imply sideways or upward mobility for men, but are strongly to the disadvantage of women's employment careers. ...|$|R

Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion {{that he was involved}} in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963.

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>mobility</b> {{is defined}} as the {{movement}} of individuals, families, households, or other categories of people within or between layers or tiers in an open system of social stratification.

Absolute <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> refers to the overall numbers of people who end up in a different layer of stratification from that of their parents. Relative <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> refers to the differences in probability of attaining a certain outcome, regardless of overall structural changes; a society can have high absolute mobility and low relative mobility. The availability of at least some <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> can be important in providing pathways to greater equality in societies with high social inequality.|$|R

Industrial output thus fell by 20%, real wages by at least 36%, and the public debt soared from US$8 billion to US$45 billion; by 1983, interest charges alone reached US$6.5 billion, creating a balance of payments crisis that weakened the economy for years.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{longitudinal}} data {{to examine the}} changing professional identity of one beginning teacher over a three-year period. Using a post-structuralist framework and theories of social class and capital, I highlight the complexities, contradictions and impossibilities of new graduate, Luke, sustaining an identity as ‘Aboriginal teacher’ in Australian schools. I trace the shift in his commitment to working with underachieving Aboriginal boys in challenging school contexts {{at the beginning of}} his career, to his move into a middle-class white girls’ school towards the end of his third year of teaching. I suggest this was a result of the ongoing stress associated with the expectation that he take sole responsibility for the education of the school’s Aboriginal students, as well as his own <b>upward</b> <b>social</b> class <b>mobility.</b> The paper concludes by raising a number of concerns for education systems, including the retention of Aboriginal teachers in Australian schools...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between education and <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> {{has been of}} interest to sociologists since the 1950 s.

Both functionalist and conflict perspectives will be applied to explain the purpose of formal schooling, and signaling theory will be used to explain the significance of academic qualifications in the labour market. Ultimately, the examination of these mechanisms demonstrates how the hidden curriculum of schooling lends itself to the reproduction rather than the <b>upward</b> transmission of <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> The ruling class maintains its privilege in the labour market through a system that falsely promotes the ideas of equal opportunity and meritocracy in education...|$|R

25|$|The {{linguistic}} diversity among Chinese Singaporeans {{varies according to}} age group. Most young Chinese Singaporeans speak either English or Mandarin while the elderly, though able to converse in Mandarin, have preferred other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka, or Hainanese. As the south-eastern Chinese varieties are not taught in school, the number of their speakers has steadily declined. In addition, many parents have begun to communicate with their children solely in English, believing that the language is essential to attain <b>upward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Many of the young Chinese in Singapore are unable to use their mother tongues fluently. This applies equally even to the more westernised Chinese Christian community, who prefers the English language over any other.

25|$|The Malaysian {{information}} technology (IT) sector {{is made up}} equally of women and men, {{with large numbers of}} women employed as university professors and in the private sector. This is a product of two historical trends: the predominance of women in the Malay electronics industry, the precursor to the IT industry, and the national push to achieve a ‘pan-Malayan’ culture beyond the three ethnic groups of Indian, Chinese and Malay. Government support for the education of all three groups is available on a quota basis and, since few Malay men are interested in IT, this leaves more room for women. Additionally, families tend to be supportive of their daughters’ entry into this prestigious and highly remunerated industry, in the interests of <b>upward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility.</b> Malaysia's push to develop an endogenous research culture should deepen this trend.|$|E
25|$|Between 1900 and 1924, {{approximately}} 1.75 million Jews {{migrated to}} America, the bulk from Eastern Europe.

25|$|The steady {{expansion}} and {{rapid population growth}} of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, {{but on the whole}} hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude of most Americans. While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons {{for tens of thousands of}} pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were two of the richest men in the world by 1900. Historians have emphasized that <b>upward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> came in small steps over time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized upward mobility, and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.|$|E

Their prospectus for the publication, published November 21, 1846, announced their intentions to create a magazine [...] "to circle around the family table". Willis intended the magazine for the middle and lower classes and included the message of <b>upward</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> using himself as an example, often describing in detail his personal possessions. When discussing his own social climbing, however, he emphasized his frustrations rather than his successes, endearing him to his audience. He edited the Home Journal {{until his death in}} 1867. It was renamed Town & Country in 1901, and it is still published under that title as of 2011. During Willis's time at the journal, he especially promoted the works of women poets, including Frances Sargent Osgood, Anne Lynch Botta, Grace Greenwood, and Julia Ward Howe. Willis and his editors favorably reviewed many works now considered important today, including Henry David Thoreau's Walden and Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance.|$|E
