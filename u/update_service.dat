50|$|Windows Server <b>Update</b> <b>Services</b> (WSUS), {{previously}} {{known as}} Software <b>Update</b> <b>Services</b> (SUS), {{is a computer}} program developed by Microsoft Corporation that enables administrators to manage the distribution of updates and hotfixes released for Microsoft products to computers in a corporate environment. WSUS downloads these updates from the Microsoft Update website and then distributes them to computers on a network. WSUS is an integral component of Windows Server.|$|R
25|$|Microsoft Office Update {{was a free}} {{online service}} that allowed users to detect and install updates for certain Microsoft Office products. This <b>update</b> <b>service</b> {{supported}} Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007. On 1 August 2009 Microsoft decommissioned the Office <b>Update</b> <b>service</b> as such; its functionality is subsumed within Microsoft Update. Microsoft Update does not support Office 2000; {{this is not a}} limitation for existing up-to-date installations of Office 2000, because it is no longer supported and no new updates are issued. However, it affects new or re-installation of MS Office 2000 from original CDs.|$|E
25|$|Patches and updates to {{the browser}} are {{released}} periodically and made {{available through the}} Windows <b>Update</b> <b>service,</b> {{as well as through}} Automatic Updates. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{releases}} security patches {{through its}} Windows <b>Update</b> <b>service</b> approximately {{once a month}} (usually the second Tuesday of the month), although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary. In versions of Windows after and including Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP, updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so. As a result, Service Pack 2 for Windows XP, as well as Service Pack 1 for Windows Server 2003, were installed by users more quickly than it otherwise might have been.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} SafetyLit {{came from an}} {{electronic}} mailing list service provided in the early-1990s by the librarians at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). This bibliographic update was a print-out of article citations from Medline that were indexed with selected MeSH terms related to the treatment and prevention of injuries. This free service was provided {{at a time when}} searching Medline was quite costly. The NCIPC <b>update</b> <b>service</b> ended in 1994, about one year before the National Library of Medicine began providing an experimental version of PubMed.|$|E
25|$|During 1999, several {{publishing}} companies began supplying their journal article citation {{and abstract}} data to SafetyLit and the journal sources expanded {{far beyond what}} was available through PubMed. In 2001 the SafetyLit <b>update</b> <b>service</b> moved {{from a series of}} lengthy flat-file newsletters to a database-driven dynamic website. The email newsletter became a simple announcement that a pdf version of Update Bulletin is available on the SafetyLit website. With that improvement, an archive database with search capacity was established. From that time forward, each week brought the addition of about 300-400 recently published articles and more than 250 articles from the back-files of journals that published relevant material.|$|E
25|$|Interface {{languages}} for {{the operating}} system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. Language Interface Packs (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later) they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the Windows <b>Update</b> <b>service</b> (except Windows 8).|$|E
5000|$|Windows Server <b>Update</b> <b>Services</b> 2.0 {{and above}} {{comprise}} {{a repository of}} update packages from Microsoft. It allows administrators to approve or decline updates before release, to force updates to install by a given date, and to obtain extensive reports on which updates each machine requires. System administrators can also configure WSUS to approve certain classes of updates automatically (critical <b>updates,</b> security <b>updates,</b> <b>service</b> packs, drivers, etc.). One can also approve updates for [...] "detection" [...] only, allowing an administrator to see which machines will require a given update without also installing that update.|$|R
5000|$|Windows Update has {{supported}} delta updates since Windows XP which are called express installation files. On redistributing updates, Windows Server <b>Update</b> <b>Services</b> {{has supported}} delta updates since Windows Server 2003.|$|R
30|$|The {{architecture}} {{supports the}} concept of dynamically plugging in new network services whenever required. This paves the road for pay-per <b>update</b> <b>services</b> and stimulates the development of companies supporting network services.|$|R
500|$|Cortana updates are {{delivered}} independently {{of those to}} the main Windows Phone OS, allowing Microsoft to provide new features at a faster pace. Not all Cortana-related features can be updated in this manner as some features such as [...] "Hey Cortana" [...] require the Windows Phone <b>update</b> <b>service</b> and the Qualcomm Snapdragon SensorCore Technology.|$|E
2500|$|Variant C of {{the virus}} resets System Restore points and {{disables}} a number of system services such as Windows Automatic Update, Windows Security Center, Windows Defender and Windows Error Reporting. [...] Processes matching a predefined list of antiviral, diagnostic or system patching tools are watched for and terminated. [...] An in-memory patch is also applied to the system resolver DLL to block lookups of hostnames related to antivirus software vendors and the Windows <b>Update</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
2500|$|All Chrome {{channels}} are automatically distributed {{according to their}} respective release cycles. The mechanism differs by platform. On Windows, it uses Google Update, and auto-update can be controlled via Group Policy. Alternatively, users may download a standalone installer of a version of Chrome that does not auto-update. On OS X, it uses Google <b>Update</b> <b>Service,</b> and auto-update can be controlled via the OS X [...] "defaults" [...] system. On Linux, it lets the system's normal package management system supply the updates. This auto-updating behavior is a key difference from Chromium, the non-branded open source browser which forms the core of Google Chrome. Because Chromium also serves as the pre-release development trunk for Chrome, its revisions are provided as source code and buildable snapshots are produced continuously with each new commit, requiring users to manage their own browser updates.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the service}} {{integrates}} with Windows Server <b>Update</b> <b>Services</b> and System Center Configuration Manager 2007 so that network administrators can deploy updates downloaded from the website remotely across a network.|$|R
5000|$|Vundo inserts {{registry}} {{entries to}} suppress Windows warnings about the disabling of firewall, antivirus, and the Automatic <b>Updates</b> <b>service,</b> disables the Automatic <b>Updates</b> <b>service</b> and quickly re-disables it if manually re-enabled, and attacks Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, Spybot Search & Destroy, Lavasoft Ad-Aware, HijackThis, {{and several other}} malware removal tools. It frequently hides itself from Vundofix and Combofix. Rather than pushing fake antivirus products, the new [...] "ad" [...] popups for the drive by download attacks are copies of ads by major corporations, faked so that simply closing them allows the drive-by download exploit to insert the payload into the user's computer.|$|R
40|$|Patch {{management}} {{is an important}} part of an organization's security strategy. Patch management refers to the method of distributing, tracking, and recording the installation of necessary software patches for computers. Software <b>Update</b> <b>Services</b> (SUS) simplifies patch management by providing a central location for patch distribution. It enables network administrators to control distribution as well as track and record the installation of security updates by computers running particular Microsoft Windows operating systems.
