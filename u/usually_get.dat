5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between {{the cracks in}} the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

25|$|Africa's {{geography}} {{makes it}} {{particularly vulnerable to}} climate change, and seventy per cent of the population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Tanzania's official report on climate change suggests that the areas that <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> two rainfalls in the year will probably get more, and those that get only one rainy season will get far less.

25|$|The Rangers {{faced an}} {{attendance}} {{problem for a}} few years after moving their team to Texas, in part due to the team's inconsistent performance and in part due to the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the Florida Marlins arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the Majors, with temperatures frequently topping around 100° throughout the months of summer. In part because of this, the Rangers began playing most of even their weekend games between May and September at night—a tradition that continues to this day. They <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> a waiver from ESPN to play Sunday night games.|$|E
25|$|San Antonio International Airport uses {{a system}} for its evening arrival {{aircraft}} using the terminals. Once all flights that are classified as passenger departures have departed, The airport would <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> very crowded in the terminal area, thus having no room for other aircraft. The San Antonio Airport Authority figured that a plan was needed to be placed into action. The plan was to have an arriving passenger aircraft park at a gate that is operated by their airline. Once all the passengers and crew are deplaned, and all servicing is completed on that aircraft, The plane will then be towed by a tug to the West Cargo area to sit parked overnight and give room for other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} are herbivore scavengers. Their diets contains over 300 {{species of}} plants. They consume {{a very wide}} range of plants, but mainly eat broad-leaved grass, regular grass, wiregrass, and terrestrial legumes. They also eat mushrooms, and fruits such as gopher apple, pawpaw, blackberries, and saw palmetto berries. In addition, gopher tortoises eat flowers from the genera Cnidoscolus (nettles), Tillandsia (Spanish and ball moss), Richardia, and Dyschoriste. Juvenile tortoises tend to eat more legumes, which are higher in protein, and fewer grasses and tough, fibrous plants than mature tortoises. Gopher tortoises {{have been known to}} scavenge carrion and eat excrement. As gopher tortoises <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> water from the food they eat, they usually only drink standing water in times of extreme drought.|$|E

25|$|During snowfalls when {{temperatures}} hover {{close to}} freezing, northern {{parts of the}} city, such as around Derry Road away from warmer Lake Ontario <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> more snow that sticks to the ground because of the lower temperatures. The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south kicking up lake effect snow, bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. The city usually experiences 6 months of snow free weather however there is the odd occurrence where snow does fall either in October or May. The Port Credit and Lakeview areas have a micro-climate more affected by {{the proximity of the}} open lake, warming winter temperatures as a result but it can be sharply cooler on spring and summer afternoons, this can also be the case in Clarkson, but with much less consistency.|$|E
25|$|Rugby League {{is a minor}} {{sport in}} Scotland, with the country never having had a {{professional}} club. Participation in rugby league has increased though, with a Scottish division in the Rugby League Conference with seven teams, including four in the Glasgow/West Scotland area having formed in 2006. But, unlike in England, rugby league {{is not one of}} the ten most played sports in Scotland amongst adults. Junior development has been much more rapid, with several Conference teams having junior squads as well as other clubs who don't run an open-age squad having various junior squads. An estimated 2,500 children play rugby league in Scotland, with that figure growing to 12,500 when you add the amount of children who play the sport in various school programmes. In terms of media coverage, apart from Challenge Cup matches rugby league is not shown on Scottish terrestrial television and no matches are usually broadcast on radio. However, Scotland international matches <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> reported in national newspapers like The Scotsman and sometimes in Scottish editions of London-based newspapers.|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{considered}} {{to have a good}} chance of being picked up, but ultimately the CW passed on the show. Discussing the excitement surrounding the project, Lou Diamond Phillips said, [...] "The funny thing about the Aquaman project is that there's so much buzz about it already. Which is amazing, I mean you don't <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen." [...] There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman was not on the list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender.|$|E

500|$|With {{the main}} {{characters}} in place, the development team had to decide on a setting. [...] "The events that unfolded on Earth is something fans still clamor for after being 'short changed' in Halo 2," [...] Jarrard said. [...] "Fans {{wanted to know what}} happened back on Earth, how humanity was defending it." [...] New Mombasa's urban environments fit the intended feel of the game, as Bungie felt that the change of protagonists required a change in location: [...] "We know the kinds of problems Master Chief solves," [...] Staten explained. [...] "He goes to ancient, alien ring artifacts, fights galaxy-consuming parasitic alien monsters and destroys alien empires [...] The ODST, they maybe take small parts in that larger struggle. But the kind of fights they <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> into are usually the kind of fights they can tackle in a day." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing {{segments}} for [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] {{was much}} different from normal episodes; for example, the writers only had one day to outline each segment's plot, and three to four days to write {{the first draft of}} each script, which is much less time than the writers <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> for an episode. Still, Selman has said that working on the episode was [...] "very fun" [...] for the writers. While writing the third segment, Selman listened to Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective on tape to [...] "get some of the lingo" [...] that Mark Twain used in his books. He found so many unusual words in the books that he compiled a [...] "giant" [...] list of them. [...] "We wanted to cram in every single [...] as we could", Selman said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|Tender Mercies was {{released}} on March 4, 1983, in only three theaters: one in New York City, one in Los Angeles, and one in Chicago. New York Times critic Vincent Canby observed that it {{was released}} during [...] "the {{time of year when}} distributors <b>usually</b> <b>get</b> rid of all of those movies they don't think are worth releasing in the prime moviegoing times of Christmas and the midsummer months". The simultaneous release of Angelo My Love led to some more publicity for Duvall himself, but was of no help to Tender Mercies. Duvall also believed that Universal's lack of familiarity and comfort with southern culture and the country music genre further reduced their faith in the film. When country star Willie Nelson offered to help publicize it, a studio executive told Duvall she did not understand how the singer could contribute to the promotion, which Duvall said was indicative of the studio's failure to understand both the film and the country music genre.|$|E
