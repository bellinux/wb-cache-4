50|$|A simple Van de Graaff {{generator}} {{consists of}} a belt of rubber (or a similar flexible dielectric material) moving over two rollers of differing material, {{one of which is}} surrounded by a hollow metal sphere. Two electrodes, (2) and (7), in the form of comb-shaped rows of sharp metal points, are positioned {{near the bottom of the}} lower roller and inside the sphere, over the <b>upper</b> <b>roller.</b> Comb (2) is connected to the sphere, and comb (7) to ground. The method of charging is based on the triboelectric effect, such that simple contact of dissimilar materials causes the transfer of some electrons from one material to the other. For example (see the diagram), the rubber of the belt will become negatively charged while the acrylic glass of the <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> will become positively charged. The belt carries away negative charge on its inner surface while the <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> accumulates positive charge. Next, the strong electric field surrounding the positive <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> (3) induces a very high electric field near the points of the nearby comb (2). At the points, the field becomes strong enough to ionize air molecules, and the electrons are attracted to the outside of the belt while positive ions go to the comb. At the comb (2) they are neutralized by electrons that were on the comb, thus leaving the comb and the attached outer shell (1) with fewer net electrons. By the principle illustrated in the Faraday ice pail experiment, i.e. by Gauss's law, the excess positive charge is accumulated on the outer surface of the outer shell (1), leaving no field inside the shell. Electrostatic induction by this method continues, building up very large amounts of charge on the shell.|$|E

Metal plate lithographs may be printed with the scraper bar or the printing roll.|$|E
50|$|As the {{traditional}} vertical-run Contax shutter required considerable space both {{above and below}} the film gate for the drum rollers, the <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> takes up the critical space required for the reflex housing mechanism, making it dimensionally impossible to use it for a satisfactory SLR camera. Winzenberg solved the problem by the use of a completely new horizontal-run focal-plane shutter, thus allowing space for the reflex housing.|$|E

50|$|The Pétrel was {{an upright}} V-12 engine with two banks of six cylinders, {{arranged}} at 60° to each other, driving a common crankshaft. The cylinder blocks were bolted onto the crankcase, all light alloy parts. The crankcase came in two pieces, with seven crankshaft bearings in the <b>upper</b> section. <b>Roller</b> bearings were {{used at the}} crankshaft ends; the remaining five were plain. The upper crankcase section also had integrally cast water channels {{as part of the}} cooling system.|$|R

He erected an iron rolling and slitting mill (for the manufacture of nails; the first in England) between 1590 and 1595, which by 1758 had two waterwheels, one working the <b>upper</b> <b>roller,</b> the other working the lower rollers and a guillotine.

In many cases, the delivery <b>rollers</b> (<b>upper</b> and lower) in the upper or final stage of the paper exit are worn or unserviceable. Replacement kits for these rollers are easily obtainable and can solve the problem.An alternative is to enlarge the roller slightly by using heat shrink over the output rollers. The heat shrink extra diameter pulls the paper quicker and resolves the wear/slip issues. Another alternative is to use coarse quality abrasive paper such as those used by belt sanders to roughen the surfaces of the rollers. A quality abrasive is needed to ensure no particles are shed into the mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{solidification}} conditions necessary to produce good quality/low defect metal alloy strip when thixorolling directly from the semi-solid state. To facilitate the study lead/tin alloys were chosen for their relatively low operating temperature. The objective is to extrapolate these findings to the higher temperature aluminium alloys. Three alloys (70 %Pb- 30 %Sn, 60 %Pb- 40 %Sn, 50 %Pb- 50 %wtSn) were used particularly to study {{the influence of the}} solidification interval. The equipment consists of a two roll mill arranged as an <b>upper</b> and lower <b>roller,</b> where both rollers are driven at a controlled speed. The lower roller is fed with semi solid alloy through a ceramic nozzle attached to the lower end of a cooling slope. Several types of nozzle and their position at the roller were tested. This produced different solidifications and consequently different finished strip. The alloys were first cast and then poured onto the cooling slope through a tundish {{in order to create a}} continuous laminar flow of slurry and uniformity of metal strip quality. The pouring was tested at different positions along the slope. The cooling slope was coated with colloidal graphite to promote a smooth slurry flow and avoid the problem of adherence and premature solidification. The metallic slurry not only cools along the slope but is also initiall...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSymmetric rolling (SR) and {{asymmetric}} rolling (ASR) processes {{were carried}} out on 6  mm thick AZ 31 magnesium alloy sheets that were produced by twin roll casting (TRC) technique. Before rolling processes, sheets were heat treated {{in order to obtain}} a homogenized microstructure. In this study, for the ASR process the rolling speed ratio between <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> and lower was selected as 1. 25. Both SR and ASR processes were utilized with 40 % reduction per passes using 2 pass schedule for a total reduction ratio of 0. 67. Symmetric and asymmetric rolled sheets were characterized using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques.

40|$|The ASRM Case Insulation Program used {{design of}} {{experiments}} to develop a high performance case insulation. The program traded-off more than thirty properties in areas of ablation performance, material properties, processibility, bonding/aging. Kevlar pulp {{was found to be}} the most significant factor. The low-molecular weight ethylene propylene diene monomer, EPDM was the second most significant factor. The curative was the third most significant factor. The tackifier was the fourth most significant factor. The stripwinding process for applying the insulation onto the case inner surfaces was also studied. The parameters selected for experiment were extruder speed, <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> temperature and extruder nozzle temperature. The extrudability results showed that non-Kevlar filled formulations displayed optimum edges but poor thickness continuity. High Kevlar filled formulations displayed optimum thickness continuity but poor strip edge ratings...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{main purpose}} of {{experimental}} studies is to establish {{the adequacy of the}} developed mathematical models of machine fluctuations and the actual parameters of machine vibration. Almost all casting machines for the production of mill rolls have a unique design and performances. The additional aim of this work is to compare the vibration level of the casting machine with the requirements of the current vibration standards for new technological machines. Frequency analysis of the oscillations allows establishing defects in workmanship, errors of rotating parts installation and their influence on the dynamics of the machine. Methodology. Measurement of vibration parameters was performed on the moving parts of roller bearings of the machine. To measure the amplitudes of accelerations in three mutually perpendicular directions piezoelectric sensors with magnetic mount were used. Electrical signals from the sensors were recorded on magnetic tape. Further analysis of the oscillations was carried out and visualized using specialized frequency analyzer. The frequency analyzer implements the algorithm of fast Fourier transformation and/or integration of sensor input signal. After the first integration the data for plotting the vibration velocity spectrogram were obtained {{and as a result of}} the second integration there are the data of vibration displacements spectrogram of the machine supports. Findings. The results of experimental studies of centrifugal casting machine vibrations for the production of two-layer rolls were presented. There were obtained and analyzed the spectrograms of accelerations, velocities and displacements of moving parts of the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>roller</b> supports. The work of the machine is associated with the calculated values passing of critical frequencies and the short-term development of resonance oscillations of the rotor and roller bearings. Originality. For the first time the author obtained the frequency spectra of vibration of an industrial sample of a casting machine. The oscillations with frequencies that differ from the basic rotor frequency were detected. Practical value. Based on the results of the experiment, the actual vibration parameters of the machine in steady state when testing without die-casting the metal were determined. The adequacy of mathematical models of the dynamics of the machine and its industrial model was established. Using the method of one tone the coefficients of vibration velocity distortion of the rotor harmonic, indicating the nonlinear transformations in the system "rotor - bearings" were obtained. It was experimentally established that the vibration parameters of the machine are within the acceptable ranges, regulated by standards for vibroactive machines...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the type and amount of damages on Alvestakubb caused by the harvester head during the cutting process. The aim was also to compare the damages caused by different types of feed rollers and to evaluate the effects of temperature on damage occurrence. Another purpose was to estimate the costs associated with stud damaged timber delivered to the VIDA sawmill in Alvesta.

40|$|To {{conduct an}} {{in-depth}} {{analysis of the}} wheel rim forming processes and effectively control rim forming quality defects, three-dimensional elastic–plastic finite element models of flaring and three rolling processes for 22. 5 [*]×[*] 9. 0 -type steel wheel rim were established using ABAQUS software. Some key techniques in establishing models were investigated, such as methods of imposing boundary condition given by side guide wheels and enforcing load curve. The accuracy of the models was verified by comparing the simulation results with the point-cloud model of the actual produced rim in terms of exterior shape and thickness. Distributions {{and changes in the}} equivalent stress and equivalent plastic strain were analysed. The results indicate that the rim misalignment defect often occurs when the unequal width of the reserved material at the two ends of the rim is in the first rolling process. An improved die design is proposed. The results of the finite element analysis indicate that the improved dies are conducive to the flow of the material between the gap of the <b>upper</b> <b>roller</b> and the lower roller, and the difference in the rim width is significantly reduced...|$|E
