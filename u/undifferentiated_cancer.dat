40|$|Background and Aim: Patients with gastric carcinomas have a poor {{prognosis}} and low survival rates. The {{aim of the}} present paper was to characterize cellular and molecular properties to provide insight into aspects of tumor progression in early compared with advanced gastric cancers. Methods: One hundred and nine graded gastric carcinomas (early or advanced stage, undifferentiated or differentiated type) with paired non-cancer tissue were studied to define the correlation between apoptosis (morphology, terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labeling), cell proliferation (Ki- 67 expression, morphology) and expression and localization of two proteins frequently having altered expression in cancers, namely p 53 and c-myc. Results: Overall, apoptosis was lower in early stage, differentiated and undifferentiated gastric carcinomas compared with advanced-stage cancers. Cell proliferation was comparatively high in all stages. There was {{a high level of}} p 53 positivity in all stages. Only the early- and advanced-stage <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> that were p 53 positive had a significantly higher level of apoptosis (P< 0. 05). Cell proliferation was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) only in the early <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>cancers</b> that had either c-myc or p 53 -positivity. Conclusions: The results indicate that low apoptosis and high cell proliferation combine to drive gastric cancer development. The molecular controls for high cell proliferation of the early stage <b>undifferentiated</b> gastric <b>cancers</b> involve overexpression of both p 53 and c-myc. Overexpression of p 53 may also control cancer development in that its expression is associated with higher levels of apoptosis in early and late-stage <b>undifferentiated,</b> <b>cancers.</b> (C) 2002 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Gastric cancer with {{undifferentiated}} histology {{has different}} clinicopathologic characteristics compared to differentiated type gastric cancer. We aimed {{to compare the}} risk of synchronous or metachronous tumors after curative resection of early gastric cancer (EGC) via endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), according to the histologic differentiation of the primary lesion. Clinicopathological data of patients with initial-onset EGC curatively resected via ESD between January 2007 and November 2014 in a single institution were reviewed. We analyzed the incidence of synchronous or metachronous tumors after ESD with special reference to the differentiation status of the primary lesion. Of 1, 560 patients with EGC who underwent curative resection via ESD, 1, 447 had differentiated type cancers, and 113 had undifferentiated type cancers. The cumulative incidence of metachronous or synchronous tumor after ESD was higher in the differentiated cancer group than in the <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> group (P = 0. 008). Incidence of metachronous or synchronous tumor was 4. 8 % and 1. 2 % per person-year in the differentiated and <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> groups, respectively. The Cox proportional hazard model revealed that undifferentiated cancers were associated with a low risk of synchronous or metachronous tumors after adjusting for confounding variables (hazard ratio [95 % confidence interval] = 0. 287 [0. 090 - 0. 918]). The rate of synchronous or metachronous tumors after curative ESD was significantly lower for undifferentiated cancers compare to differentiated cancers.

40|$|Thyroid {{cancer is}} the most common {{endocrine}} malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide. The majority of thyroid cancer cases are well differentiated with favorable outcome. However, <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancers</b> {{are one of the most}} lethal human malignancies because of their invasiveness, metastatization and refractoriness even to the most recently developed therapies. In this study we show for the first time a significant hyperactivation of ROCK/HDAC 6 pathway in thyroid cancer tissues, and its negative correlation with p 53 DNA binding ability. We demonstrate that a small compound, SP 600125 (SP), is able to induce cell death selectively in <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> cell lines by specifically acting on the pathogenic pathways of cancer development. In detail, SP acts on the ROCK/HDAC 6 pathway involved in dedifferentiation and invasiveness of <b>undifferentiated</b> human <b>cancers,</b> by restoring its physiological activity level. As main consequence, cancer cell migration is inhibited and, at the same time, cell death is induced through the mitotic catastrophe. Moreover, SP exerts a preferential action on the mutant p 53 by increasing its DNA binding ability. In TP 53 -mutant cells that survive mitotic catastrophe this process results in p 21 induction and eventually lead to premature senescence. In conclusion, SP has been proved to be able to simultaneously block cell replication and migration, the two main processes involved in cancer development and dissemination, making it an ideal candidate for developing new drugs against anaplastic thyroid cancer.

40|$|AbstractUndifferentiated thyroid {{carcinoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} aggressive human cancers with frequent RAS mutations. How mutations of the RAS gene contribute to <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> remains largely unknown. Mice harboring a potent dominant negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor β, TRβPV (ThrbPV/PV), spontaneously develop well-differentiated follicular thyroid cancer similar to human cancer. We genetically targeted the KrasG 12 D mutation to thyroid epithelial cells of ThrbPV/PV mice to understand how KrasG 12 D mutation could induce <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> in ThrbPV/PVKrasG 12 D mice. ThrbPV/PVKrasG 12 D mice exhibited poorer survival due to more aggressive thyroid tumors with capsular invasion, vascular invasion, and distant metastases to the lung occurring at an earlier age and at a higher frequency than ThrbPV/PV mice did. Importantly, ThrbPV/PVKrasG 12 D mice developed frequent anaplastic foci with complete loss of normal thyroid follicular morphology. Within the anaplastic foci, the thyroid-specific transcription factor paired box gene 8 (PAX 8) expression was virtually lost and the loss of PAX 8 expression was inversely correlated with elevated MYC expression. Consistently, co-expression of KRASG 12 D with TRβPV upregulated MYC levels in rat thyroid pccl 3 cells, and MYC acted to enhance the TRβPV-mediated repression of the Pax 8 promoter activity of a distant upstream enhancer, critical for thyroid-specific Pax 8 expression. Our findings indicated that synergistic signaling of KRASG 12 D and TRβPV led to increased MYC expression. Upregulated MYC contributes to the initiation of <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer,</b> in part, through enhancing TRβPV-mediated repression of the Pax 8 expression. Thus, MYC might serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{is a state}} {{wherein the}} cell has {{deviated}} from the programmed cell cycle into a condition where it grows and divides indefinitely. During the progression of cancer, different genes are seen activated or deactivated at different times. In the present study our objective was to generate cellular profiles of two distinct stages in cancer progression; neoplastic transformation and undifferentiation. For this purpose we used metasignature of cancer which comprises genes which are universally activated in all types of cancer. We employed gene ontology based clustering which is a common approach to help with biological interpretation of a list of differentially expressed genes. This is currently the de facto standard for the secondary analysis of high throughput experiments, such as microarray. FatiGO, a gene ontology tool, was used to do clustering based on biological process, cellular location and molecular functions. We found that the cellular profiles of neoplastic transformation and undifferentiation differ clearly. <b>Undifferentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> signature contains more genes belonging {{to the process of}} cell cycle.

40|$|International audienceIt has {{sometimes}} been assumed that children are more sensitive than adults {{to the effects of}} radiofrequency (RF) fields associated with cellular wireless telephones. However, relatively few in vitro or animal models have examined this possibility. In vitro studies have used several cell types, from both humans and rodents, including primary cells, embryonic cell lines, <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines, and stem cells. Overall, the balance of evidence does not suggest that field-related effects occur in any cell type: gene and protein expression were not significantly changed by exposure in nine out of 15 studies; genotoxicity was evaluated in 13 papers and in most, of these studies, no damage to DNA was detected; eight studies failed to demonstrate induction of apoptosis; and three studies reported lack of oxidative stress induction by RF-exposures. Five of eight studies investigating the effects of combined exposures to RF fields and chemical or physical agents reported a lack of field-related effects. In addition, few papers have been published on the effects of low level exposure of immature animals. The available results are very limited, both in terms of signals used and biological endpoints investigated, but the evidence does not indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposures are associated with acute adverse responses or the development of detrimental changes in the long-term.

Recent works suggest that glioblastoma patients may benefit from molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we address the compelling need for identification of new molecular targets. Leveraging global gene expression data from two independent sets of clinical tumor samples (n = 55 and n = 65), we identify a gene coexpression module in glioblastoma that is also present in breast cancer and significantly overlaps with the “metasignature” for <b>undifferentiated</b> <b>cancer.</b> Studies in an isogenic model system demonstrate that this module is downstream of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII, and that it can be inhibited by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib.

Finally, we show that ASPM inhibition by siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibits tumor cell proliferation and neural stem cell proliferation, supporting ASPM as a potential molecular target in glioblastoma. Our weighted gene coexpression network analysis provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key control networks and molecular targets for glioblastoma, and the principle eluted from our work can be applied to other cancers...|$|E

Animals were treated with Ptx i. p. and exposed locally to a single dose of 5 Gy of IR. Apoptosis in situ was detected using ApopTag Peroxidase Kit. Results: In the in vivo experiments, IR significantly inhibited but did not abrogate tumor growth. Ptx effect was stronger, and the combination therapy with Ptx and IR led to the decrease of tumor volume to 0 - 0. 3 % of the control (P < 0. 01). The systemic administration of Ptx to the animals with advanced tumors resulted in a profound tumor growth suppression and in apoptosis in tumor tissues in time-dependent manner. Conclusion: The combination of Ptx and IR is a promising strategy for further preclinical and clinical trials aimed at the develop-ment of new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancer.</b> Key Words: Paclitaxel, ionizing radiation, thyroid cancer. Paclitaxel (Ptx) has been successfully used to treat different types of human cancers [1]. Among those, the possibility of its application {{in one of the most}} ag-gressive human tumors, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), both as a monotherapy and in a combinatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recent {{findings}} {{in the past two}} decades have brought many insights into the biology of thyroid benign and malignant lesions, in particular the papillary and follicular thyroid cancers. Although, much progress have been made, thyroid cancers still pose diagnostic problems regarding differentiation of follicular lesions in relation to their aggressiveness and the treatment of advanced and <b>undifferentiated</b> thyroid <b>cancers.</b> Metallothioneins (MTs) were shown to induce cancer cells proliferation, mediate resistance to apoptosis, certain chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy. Therefore, MTs may be of utility in diagnosis and management of patients with benign and malignant lesions of the thyroid. </p...|$|R
