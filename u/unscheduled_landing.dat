5000|$|Alan Douglas Davidson (15 December 1899 [...] - [...] 24 March 1927) {{studied at}} Wesley College, Melbourne, and Melbourne Technical School. He enlisted with the AIF in January 1918 and was {{assigned}} to the Australian Flying Corps, Laverton as trainee pilot and was sent overseas in May 1918.

He left the Air Corps in 1922 and joined Qantas as a pilot. He and his two passengers, A.W.N. Bell and W.R.
