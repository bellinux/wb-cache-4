25|$|Paper {{chromatography}} is {{a technique}} that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of chromatography paper. The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of solvent and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the event, the editor, Gökşin Sipahioğlu, {{called the}} owner, Mithat Perin, asking for {{permission}} for a second run. The weather was bad, so Perin declined thinking the prints would not get sold. The newspaper's main dealer, Fuat Büke, soon called and offered to pay for the run in advance. By the time Perin went to inspect the Tan Press, 180,000 copies had already been printed. Sensing something fishy, Perin tore <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> and stopped the run. The prototype was still intact however, and the workers secretly resumed printing after Perin left. They had eventually printed 300,000 copies (on paper stocked in advance), of which 296,000 were sold. This was far above the newspaper's average circulation of 30,000–40,000 (by comparison, the best-selling Hürriyet sold 70–80 thousand copies). Perin was arrested the next day. Gökşin Sipahioğlu later alleged the NSS had pressured him to do it, while Perin says Sipahioğlu himself was an agent. Perin's innocence, however, was cast into doubt after intrepid journalist Uğur Mumcu published an excerpt from a 1962 letter between Perin and the undersecretary of the NSS, Fuat Doğu, stating that in his 25 years of journalism, he had acted in full knowledge of the NSS and had not refrained from doing anything.|$|E

The Times Rebecca Keegan asked, [...] "So when you say you’re not {{on either side of the}} aisle, does that mean you’re not voting for Trump?" [...] Eastwood replied, [...] "I’m totally an enigma. I’m just astounded. I hate to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper.</b> I think both individuals and both parties backing the individuals have a certain degree of insanity." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer. Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week. I said maybe we should make it zero columns a week." [...] On October 30, 1983, after a hiatus of more than three decades, Watson's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times.|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Star {{was founded}} on December 16, 1852, by Captain Joseph Borrows Tate. Originally {{headquartered}} in Washington's [...] "Newspaper Row" [...] on Pennsylvania Avenue, Tate initially gave the paper the name The Daily Evening Star, {{and it would be}} renamed several times before becoming Washington Star by the late 1970s. In 1853, Texas surveyor and newspaper entrepreneur William Douglas Wallach purchased the paper. As the sole owner of the paper for the next 14 years, Wallach built <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> by capitalizing on reporting of the American Civil War, among other things. In 1867, the group of investors Crosby Stuart Noyes, Samuel H. Kauffmann and George Adams acquired the paper by each of the investors putting up $33,333.33. The paper would remain family-owned and operated for the next four generations.|$|E

[...] On 3 April Burns sent proposals for publishing his Scotch Poems to John Wilson, a local printer in Kilmarnock, who published these proposals on 14 April 1786, {{on the same day that}} Jean Armour's father tore <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> in which Burns attested his marriage to Jean. To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor, Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for rebuke in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays. He transferred his share in Mossgiel farm to his brother Gilbert on 22 July, and on 30 July wrote to tell his friend John Richmond that, [...] "Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail until I can find a warrant for an enormous sum... I am wandering from one friend's house to another." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{make the}} {{proteins}} accessible to antibody detection, they are moved {{from within the}} gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). [...] The primary method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting and uses an electric current to pull proteins from the gel into the PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane. [...] The proteins move from within the gel onto the membrane while maintaining the organization they had within the gel. An older method of transfer involves placing a membrane {{on top of the}} gel, and a stack of filter papers on top of that. The entire stack is placed in a buffer solution which moves <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> by capillary action, bringing the proteins with it. In practice this method is not used as it takes too much time; electroblotting is preferred. As a result of either [...] "blotting" [...] process, the proteins are exposed on a thin surface layer for detection (see below). Both varieties of membrane are chosen for their non-specific protein binding properties (i.e. binds all proteins equally well). Protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions, as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein. Nitrocellulose membranes are cheaper than PVDF, but are far more fragile and do not stand up well to repeated probings.|$|E
2500|$|Hoffman {{was born}} November 30, 1936, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to John Hoffman and Florence Schanberg. Hoffman {{was raised in}} a middle-class {{household}} and had two younger siblings. As a child in the 1940s–50s, {{he was a member of}} what has been described as [...] "the transitional generation between the beatniks and hippies". He described his childhood as [...] "idyllic" [...] and the '40s as [...] "a great time to grow up in." [...] On June 3, 1954, 17-year-old Hoffman was arrested for the first time, for driving without a license. During his school days, he became known as a troublemaker who started fights, played pranks, vandalized school property, and referred to teachers by their first names. In his sophomore year, Hoffman was expelled from Classical High School, a now-closed public high school in Worcester. As an atheist, Hoffman wrote a paper declaring that [...] "God could not possibly exist, for if he did, there wouldn't be any suffering in the world." [...] The irate teacher ripped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> and called him [...] "a Communist punk". Hoffman jumped on the teacher and started fighting him until he was restrained and removed from the school. After his expulsion, he attended Worcester Academy, graduating in 1955. Hoffman engaged in many behaviors typical of rebellious teenagers in the 1950s, such as riding motorcycles, wearing leather jackets, and sporting a ducktail haircut. Upon graduating, he enrolled in Brandeis University, where he studied under professors such as noted psychologist Abraham Maslow, often considered the father of humanistic psychology. He was also a student of Marxist theorist Herbert Marcuse, who Hoffman said had a profound effect on his political outlook. Hoffman would later cite Marcuse's influence during his activism and his theories on revolution. He was on the Brandeis tennis team, which was coached by journalist Bud Collins. Hoffman graduated with a B.A. in psychology in 1959. That fall, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed coursework toward a master's degree in psychology. Soon after, he married his pregnant girlfriend Sheila Karklin in May 1960.|$|E
