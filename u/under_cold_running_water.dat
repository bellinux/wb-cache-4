50|$|Svi√∞ is {{prepared}} by first burning off the hair, then cleaning the head <b>under</b> <b>running</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> while paying {{special attention to}} the eyes and ears. The head must then be sawn in half lengthwise and the brain removed; if it is frozen first, this is less messy. The brains can be cooked with the skin. When it is ready for cooking, it is put into a cooking pot, sprinkled with coarse salt and partly covered with water. When the water boils, the scum is skimmed off. The head can then be cooked covered for 60 to 90 minutes, until the flesh is cooked through but before it has begun to separate from the bone. It can then be served immediately, hot, or can be left to cool down {{so that it can be}} served cold.|$|R

50|$|Hard-boiled eggs {{can vary}} widely in {{how easy it}} is to peel away the shells. In general, the fresher an egg before boiling, the more {{difficult}} it is to separate the shell cleanly from the egg white. As a fresh egg ages, it gradually loses both moisture and carbon dioxide through pores in the shell; as a consequence, the contents of the egg shrink and the pH of the albumen becomes more basic. Albumen with higher pH (more basic) is less likely to stick to the egg shell, while pockets of air develop in eggs that have lost significant amounts of moisture, also making eggs easier to peel. Keeping the cooked eggs soaked in water helps keep the membrane under the egg shell moisturized for easy peeling. Peeling the egg <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> <b>water</b> is an effective method of removing the shell. Starting the cooking in hot water also makes the egg easier to peel.|$|E
5000|$|Removing the [...] "sand vein" [...] (a {{euphemism}} for the digestive tract) {{is referred to}} as [...] "deveining". The sand vein can be removed by making a shallow cut lengthwise down the outer curve of the shrimp's body, allowing the dark ribbon-like digestive tract to be removed with a pointed utensil. Special deveining tools are sometimes used but knives, skewers, and even toothpicks can be used to devein. Alternatively, if the tail has been detached, the vein can be pinched at the tail end and pulled out completely with the fingers. On large shrimp, the [...] "blood vein" [...] (a {{euphemism for}} the ventral nerve cord) along the inner curve of the shrimp's body is typically removed as well. The shrimp is then rinsed <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> <b>water.</b> Removing the vein is not essential, as it is not poisonous and is mostly tasteless. Deveining does slightly change the flavor and makes it more consistent. Shrimp also sometimes consume small amounts of sand and the vein might thus be gritty.|$|E
