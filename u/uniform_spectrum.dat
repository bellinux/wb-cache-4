First of all, {{there is no such thing}} in nature as a perfect mathematical point source radiator; the concept is completely non-physical and is nothing more than a mathematical construct used to model and understand optical imaging systems. The utility of the point source concept comes from the fact that a point source in the 2D object plane can only radiate a perfect uniform-amplitude, spherical wave — a wave having perfectly spherical, outward travelling phase fronts with uniform intensity everywhere on the spheres (see Huygens-Fresnel principle). Such a source of uniform spherical waves is shown in the figure below.

30|$|The light {{reflected}} by an object depends {{both on the}} object's surface reflectance characteristics and on {{the composition of the}} light illuminating the object. An ideal illumination source for the measurement of an object's spectral reflectance should thus exhibit a <b>uniform</b> <b>spectrum</b> over the whole desired wavelength range. Unfortunately, no existing illumination apparatus satisfies this condition over the visible and near-infrared spectrum, so that suboptimal solutions must be adopted. As previously mentioned, state-of-the-art solutions for the multispectral acquisition of paintings mostly employ halogen lamps due to their smooth and broad spectrum. However, in our case, the inverse-square law for light intensity, combined with the low sensitivity of the CCD in the blue region and with the emission drop of halogen lamps for those wavelengths, causes the white signal to fall close to the dark signal in the blue region. This consideration has suggested the use of two different lamps, one with a broad, smooth spectrum covering the green-red region, and one with a strong emission in the blue region.|$|E

40|$|Earthquakes {{are one of}} the {{greatest}} natural disasters to human life and properties. Following lessons from previous earthquake disasters, the performance-based seismic design is increasingly accepted by engineers to prevent seismic disasters. In performance-based seismic design, realistic and reliable design response spectra are required to reliably and accurately predict responses of designing structures. However, the mostly used ground response spectra, i. e., Newmark design <b>spectrum</b> and <b>Uniform</b> Hazard <b>Spectrum</b> on soil surface, and floor response spectrum constructed by current methods do not properly meet the requirements of performance-based seismic design: 1. Newmark design spectrum exhibits lower amplitudes at high frequencies and higher amplitudes at low frequencies. Thus, it cannot realistically and reliably reflect seismic features of target sites. 2. Variability of soil parameters, nonlinear property of soils, and vector-valued seismic site response analysis are not integrated into the process of constructing <b>Uniform</b> Hazard <b>Spectrum</b> on soil surface in modern methodologies. Thus, the desired design response spectrum is not realistically and reliably represented. 3. An efficient method to generate probabilistic floor response spectrum considering random ground motions has not been addressed. The direct spectra-to-spectra method to generate floor response spectrum is superior to the time history analysis method in efficiency. However, this method is not applicable currently to generate probabilistic floor response spectrum. The objective of this study is bridge the gap between performance-based seismic design and realistic design response spectra. 1. Considering the problem of Newmark design spectrum, this study establishes a system of site design spectrum coefficients to modify the Newmark design spectrum. The modified Newmark design spectrum could more realistically and reliably represent seismic features of target sites. 2. To obtain more realistic and reliable <b>Uniform</b> Hazard <b>Spectrum</b> on soil surface, this study integrates the variability of soil parameters, the nonlinear property of soils, and the vector-valued seismic site response analysis into the process of constructing <b>Uniform</b> Hazard <b>Spectrum</b> on soil surface. 3.

Maturation of 3 G wireless network services, development of smart-phones and other broadband mobile computing devices however have motivated researchers to design wireless networks with increased capacity and coverage, therefore un-leaching the wireless broadband capabilities. In this thesis, we address two very important design aspects of wireless networks, namely, interference management and control through optimal cross-layer design and channel fading mitigation through relay-assisted cooperative communications.

For the latter problem, we study the joint problem of relay selection and power allocation in both wireless unicast and multicast cooperative cellular networks. We employ convex optimization technique to model this complex optimization problem and use branch and bound technique to solve it optimally. We also present sub-optimal methods to reduce the problem complexity and solve it more efficiently...|$|E

In this work we studied, computationally, the chromatic effects of a large set of illuminants with almost arbitrary spectral structure. The illuminants were metamers of a Planckian radiator with colour temperature of 6500 K and metamers of non-Planckian radiators with chromaticity coordinates uniformly distributed over the same isotemperature line. The metamers were generated by the Schmitt’s elements approach and were parameterized by the spectral distance to the equi-energy illuminant E. The colour rendering properties of each illuminant were quantified by the CIE colour rendering index (CRI), by a chromatic diversity index (CDI) and by the number of discernible colours estimated for a set of indoor scenes digitized by hyperspectral imaging. It was found that CRI decreases as the spectral structure of the illuminant increase and that larger values of CDI could only be obtained with illuminants with a small number of non-zero spectral bands, that is, with highly structured spectra.

40|$|Background. Nowadays little data {{related to}} the {{hemostatic}} system and fibrinolysis in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are available. This is {{due to the lack of}} standardized methods for studying the hemostasis system, as well as to the lack of a single functional test that allows the evaluation of the complete fibrinogenesis cycle in whole blood. Aim. The aim of our study was to develop a functional test capable of analyzing the blood gas composition in the “point-of-care test” method for the evaluation of the hemostatic potential in patients with COPD, based on a standardized test stimulus, which is tissue hypoxia. The current level of clinical and laboratory diagnostics requires personification and research of the hemo-coagulation system in real time (point-of-care test), which allows low-frequency piezotromboelastography(NVTEG) to be performed. Materials and methods. NVTEG was chosen to estimate the state of the hemocoagulation system. Ten patients with COPD and 10 healthy volunteers were examined. Hypoxia was selected as a standardized test stimulus. Hypoxia conditions were caused by smoking one standard cigarette (composition: resin 10 mg/cig., nicotine 0, 7 mg/cig., CO 10 mg/cig.). The degree of tissue hypoxia was assessed with the GASTAT-navi blood gas analyzer. Results. The study has shown that in response to the standard test stimulus, which is the tissue hypoxia caused by smoking of a standardized cigarette, two types of haemostatic potential reaction were detected both in patients with COPD and healthy volunteers. The first type of reaction – “hypercoagulation” – is characterized by the formation of chronometric and structural hypercoagulation at all stages of fibrinogenesis and increased coagulation activity by 25 – 30 % compared with the response in healthy individuals. The second type of reaction – “hypocoagulation” – is characterized by the formation of chronometric and structural hypocoagulation, a decrease in coagulation activity by 25 – 30 % compared with the response in healthy individuals. Conclusion. Test stimulus, which acts as tissue hypoxia, causes a <b>uniform</b> <b>spectrum</b> of changes in the blood gas composition and hemocoagulation system in both healthy volunteers and patients with COPD. The possibility of online assessment of all stages of fibrinogenesis makes it possible to stratify patients with COPD by type of reaction, which is certain to have an important diagnostic and prognostic value and in the future will allow a more personified approach for choosing the treatment tactics.  </p...|$|E

Consideration is given to the magnitude, distance and epsilon () values of ground motions. First, it is seen that selecting records based on their values is more eective than selecting records based on magnitude and distance. Second, a method is discussed for nding the conditional response spectrum of a ground motion, given a level of Sa(T 1) and its associated mean (disaggregation-based) causal magnitude, distance and value. Records can then be selected to match the mean of this target spectrum, and the same benets are achieved as when records are selected based on.
