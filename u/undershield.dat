50|$|The owner-driver's needs seem to {{have been}} {{considered}} very carefully and all but one of them met, that is the difficulty in draining engine oil which requires the removal of an <b>undershield.</b> A minor point was that the rear tappet plate was made difficult to remove by having carburettor control springs anchored on it. A few drops of oil {{two or three times a}} week and tappets will run for a long time without shake otherwise they soon become noisy.|$|E
5000|$|GR Profile: 1294cc G1A, five doors. Intended as {{competition}} for such cars as the Austin Maestro HLE, the GR Profile used {{exactly the same}} G1A engine as the lower models in the range, but combined it with subtle aerodynamic improvements and lower rolling resistance tyres to reduce the drag coefficient of the car, with the brochure claiming a fuel economy improvement of 3 miles per gallon at a constant 75 mi/h km/h. The standard equipment list included an instrument lighting rheostat, a digital clock, an engine compartment <b>undershield,</b> a glovebox lamp, a carpeted boot and a boot light. Options included metallic paint, central locking, electric windows, and central locking. It was discontinued sometime in 1988, at {{about the time of}} the introduction of the GLX.|$|E
40|$|Toward the {{understanding}} of the effect of the magnetosphere originated disturbances on the global ionospheric electric field and current system, we developed a two-dimensional ionospheric potential solver based on the so-called "thin shell model. " The important extension from the previous studies is that our model covers the pole-to-pole ionosphere without placing any boundary at the equator. By using this solver, we investigate how the ionospheric electric field changes from <b>undershielding</b> condition to overshielding condition as the field aligned current (FAC) distribution changes. Calculations are performed by changing IR 2 /IR 1 (the ratio of current intensities of region 2 (R 2) and region 1 (R 1) FACs) and by moving R 2 -FAC relative to the fixed R 1 -FAC. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The turning point, at which the ionosphere turns from <b>undershielding</b> to overshielding is IR 2 /IR 1 = 0. 7 ∼ 0. 8. (2) With increasing the local time deference between the R 1 and R 2 -FAC peaks, the efficiency of the shielding by R 2 -FAC increases but the associated potential skews to the nightside. (3) At the same time the shielding effect is weakened around noon, where the R 1 -potential intrudes to the low latitude region instead, but the R 2 -potential remains dominant at other local times. The result suggests that the overshielding or <b>undershielding</b> should be identified by observations not only in a limited local time sector but also in the overall ionosphere as much as possible. In order to accurately describe the ionospheric condition, we suggest new classification terms, "complete-overshielding" and "incomplete-overshielding. ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{refinements}} of {{the design}} had also been implemented and approved, such as the adoption of variable-pitch propellers, {{and the use of}} Vickers-produced gun turrets in the nose and tail positions. By December 1936, the specification had been revised to include front, rear, and midship wind-protected turret mountings. Other specification changes included modified bomb <b>undershields</b> and the inclusion of spring-loaded bomb bay doors. The proposal had also been developed further, a mid-wing arrangement was adopted instead of a shoulder-mounted wing for greater pilot visibility during formation flight and improved aerodynamic performance, as well as a substantially increased overall weight of the aircraft. Design studies were also conducted on behalf of the Air Ministry into the adoption of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine.|$|R
40|$|During a large {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{the electric}} field from the polar ionosphere can expand {{far enough to}} affect the mid-latitude and equatorial electric fields. These changes in the equatorial zonal electric field, called the penetration field, will cause changes in the meridional ion flows that can be observed by radars and spacecraft. In general this E × B ion flow near the equator caused by the penetration field during <b>undershielding</b> conditions will be upward on the dayside and downward on the nightside of the Earth. Previous analysis of the equatorial meridional flows observed by CINDI instrument on the C/NOFS spacecraft during the 26 September 2011 storm showed {{that all of the}} response flows on the dayside were excess downward flows instead of the expected upward flows. These observed storm-time responses are compared to a prediction from a physics-based coupled model of thermosphere–ionosphere–inner-magnetosphere in an effort to explain these observations. The model results suggest that the equatorial downward flow could be attributed to a combined effect of the overshielding and disturbance dynamo processes. However, some discrepancy between the model and observation indicates a need for improving our understanding of how sensitive the equatorial electric field is to various model input parameters that describe the magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling processes...|$|R
30|$|There are {{interesting}} cases of initial westward PPEF and the ionospheric responses to them. Batista et al. (2006) discussed {{such a case}} with an unusual early morning development of the equatorial anomaly in the Brazilian sector during the Halloween magnetic storm of October 2003. They also discussed the characteristic changes in the F layer peak height over the equator during this storm event and discussed that the F layer peak height over the equator first decreased under a strong prompt penetration westward electric field, which {{was followed by a}} significant height increase under an eastward electric field. Based on simulation results, they showed that the prompt penetration of magnetospheric electric fields of a westward polarity to the nightside equatorial region seems to be the most probable cause of the initial F layer height decreases. There are some cases where <b>undershielding</b> and overshielding PPEF successively affect the daytime equatorial ionosphere during geomagnetic storm events. Recently, Simi et al. (2012) described a case study of such event. They studied the ionospheric response of a geomagnetic storm (November 24, 2001) over the equatorial latitude of Trivandrum and discussed the highest EEJ strength during that time, which was extreme for the entire solar cycle for the month of November. This unusually large EEJ showed an equally strong polarity reversal along with a weakening of the sporadic E-layer over the equator due to an overshielding condition. The uniqueness of the event studied by them is that the main phase continued, even after the overshielding event, and it triggered the recovery of a substorm. They also studied the latitudinal variation of the F-region electron density, and Sporadic E.|$|R
30|$|The {{storm of}} November 2004, {{which is the}} subject matter of the present study, has been {{discussed}} by several workers in the past. Balan et al. (2008 a) investigated the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling through a prompt penetration electric field (PPEF) in response to a CME during 7 – 12 November, 2004. They analyzed this event using cluster and ground-based (ESR, EISCAT and Jicamarca radars and magnetometer) observations and found that this event is characterized by the strongest PPEF ever recorded. This was observed on November 9, 2004. This PPEF was generated in the magnetosphere by the v × B effect, which was mapped to the high-latitude ionosphere along the geomagnetic field lines and promptly penetrated to low latitudes. Dabas et al. (2006) also reexamined the response of the ionosphere to this particular storm. They looked into the foF 2 and h′F variations observed at a low-latitude station at Delhi. They observed a sharp enhancement in foF 2 values during the forenoon hours on November 8, 2004, and a sharp rise in h′F around the period of Dst maximum negative excursion during nighttime on November 9 – 10, 2004. Fejer et al. (2007) studied the electric fields over equatorial ionosphere during the November 7 – 9, 2004, geomagnetic storm, using radar measurements from the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, magnetometer observations from the Pacific sector and ionosonde data from Brazil. They showed very large eastward and westward daytime electrojet current perturbations with lifetimes of about an hour (indicative of <b>undershielding</b> and overshielding prompt penetration electric fields) in the Pacific equatorial region during November 7, which was the main phase of the storm. Their results highlight that the relationships between prompt penetration, solar wind electric fields, and polar cap potentials, are far more complex than implied by simple proportionality factors.|$|R
