40|$|Because of {{problems}} with the design guidelines produced by PIANC for armoured slopes under attack by bowthrusters, additional {{work has been done}} in the Netherlands. On the basis of this work computational rules have been developed. However, because of the increase of bowthruster power, more detailed knowledge is needed on the effect of a bowthruster on the stability of a riprap revetment. Especially large, fast vessels will cause problems to shore protection. Recently P&O put into operation the “Pride of Rotterdam”, a luxury ferry with two bowthrusters with a capacity of 2000 kW each. When the captain uses both thrusters simultaneously, there is a considerable risk of damaging the rock of the <b>underwater</b> <b>slope</b> protection. But also with relatively small vessels for inland navigation problems arise when skippers use their bowthrusters. For the calculation of the effect of a bowthruster at this moment the common methodology is to use the hydraulics of a plain jet. This is not correct because the propeller in the tube causes quite some extra turbulence. This extra turbulence will cause extra damage to the shoreline protection. So in a good design formula for the determination of stability in a bowthrusterflow, he effect of additional turbulence of the propeller has to be included.

In a steep-slope experiment (37 *) sand lobes were deposited at the toe of the slope and overlapped each other to form a fan-shaped body. Without sand, clay plus salt water flows of small discharge, which showed characteristics of laminar flow, tended to incise a channel on the sandy fan surface. The larger discharge flows, in which some turbulence d veloped, however, spread into the overlying water body and did not cut a channel. Clay moved further and was deposited on the basin-floor. Sand lobes occasionally migrated on to he basin-floor days, especially when an incised channel developed on the fan surface. When sand lobes reached the basin-floor clay deposits, movement of the sand accelerated basinward, the sand lobe slid on the clay like the floating plug of a debris flow, and formed crescent-shaped mounds and hummocky topography.

40|$|An <b>underwater</b> <b>slope</b> can {{collapse}} by liquefaction, wedge {{failure or}} breaching. Breaching {{is the most}} unknown process and has a low predictability. Dredge mining is strongly influenced by the breaching process. If breaching can be accurately predicted, {{the efficiency of the}} dredging production can be maximised. It is the objective to know what field- and lab tests must be conducted to be able to predict the breaching behaviour of a slope. In this report, a model is developed to predict the breaching behaviour of a slope after a single cut at the toe of the slope is made. The model is used to research the influence of several soil parameters and geometrical parameters on the breaching behaviour. The most important criterion is the difference between stable and unstable breaching. An empirical relation is created which can be used to estimate the critical cut height. This is the height at which a smaller cut height creates a stable breach and a larger cut creates an unstable breach. The critical cut height is dependent on the particle size distribution represented by the D 50 and the D- 10, the particle density and the slope angle. By using these parameters, the breaching process can be predicted. The critical cut height can be used to predict what the best cut depth for a certain slope and dredger is. After the first cut, usually several more cuts are made {{in order to keep the}} production at a high level. This process is not extensively researched in the past, so a second simplified model is created which predicts the breaching production in 3 D and can incorporate multiple cuts. The model incorporates a swinging motion by the cutter, which is essential for a dredging operation. The model can demonstrate different phenomena which might occur during a dredging operation. It will illustrate examples of consequences of a slow or fast swinging motion, large or small delay times between swings and differences in swing widths. The input parameters necessary for the model can be obtained from field- and lab tests. Several field- and lab tests are advised after analysis of the model. The tendency of the soil to either breach or liquefy can be estimated by a state parameter analysis using CPT data. It might however be more suitable to use an SPT, in this case the SPT data gives a direct indication of the relative density which can also be used to estimate the ability to breach. A sieving is necessary to obtain the particle size distribution in order to obtain the D 50 and the D 10. A pycnometer test is necessary in order to obtain the particle density. The angle of repose can be determined with a lab test or a correlation with SPT data. In order to get a better estimate of the permeability, it is advised to do an auger hole test to measure the permeability more accurately. The data from these tests are suitable to predict the breaching behaviour of any submerged slope around the world. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesGeoscience & Engineerin...|$|E

Uncertainties are often addressed indirectly through the choice of safety factors and design criteria or wording in design guidelines.

In this paper, notions of hazard, exposure, vulnerability, risk, risk management, acceptable risk, and reliability-based geotechnical design are addressed, and the State-of-Practice is exemplified with several case studies. The examples illustrate the quantification of uncertainty in geotechnical calculations, reliability-based foundation design, the assessment of hazard, vulnerability and risk, and the treatment (through mitigation measures) of risk under different design situations.

Four events have disturbed the lacustrine sedimentary sequence. Three of the four events are historical earthquakes in 1999 in Izmit, 1967 in Mudurnu and 1957 in Abant. These events are recorded in the core by turbiditic deposits and reworked sediment and by low overall palynomorph concentrations but high values of thick-exined pollen, fern spores and fungal spores. Palynomorphs in the event beds have been grouped based on their associations in modern moss, river and lake samples. The inferred mechanisms of transport and sources for the palynomorphs are: 1 - lake sediment displaced by slump, 2 - collapsed shoreline sediment owing to seiche, waves and sudden lake level changes, 3 - subsidence of deltas and 4 - river-transported soil and sediment from upland areas. The 1999 Izmit earthquake is only weakly recorded by palynomorphs, probably due to recent engineering control on the rivers.

Field measurements are presented, reporting {{for the first time}} the possibility of denser water formation and cascading from the Baltic Sea <b>underwater</b> <b>slopes,</b> which take place under fall and winter cooling conditions and deliver waters into intermediate layer of salinity stratified deep-sea area. The presence in spring within the CIL of water with temperature below that of maximum density (Tmd) and that at the local surface in winter time allows tracing its formation: it is argued that the source of the coldest waters of the Baltic CIL is early spring (March–April) cascading, arising due to heating of water before reaching the Tmd. Fast increase of the open water heat content during further spring heating indicates that horizontal exchange rather than direct solar heating is responsible for that. When the surface is covered with water, heated above the Tmd, the conditions within the CIL become favorable for intralayer convection due to the presence of waters of Tmd in intermediate layer, which can explain its well-known features – the observed increase of its salinity and deepening with time...|$|R

40|$|The {{level of}} tsunami hazard {{to the east}} coast of the United States is not well understood. This {{information}} is critical for the population, emergency services, and industry of the region. Assessing this hazard is particularly difficult {{because of the lack of}} tsunamis in the historical record and the uncertainty regarding the return periods of large-scale events that have been proposed, such as a large transoceanic tsunami possibly caused by a collapse of the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands, or a large coseismic tsunami initiated in the Puerto Rican subduction zone. The most significant tsunami hazard in this region, however, may be due to local submarine mass failures (SMF), which could cause concentrated damage in coastal communities located near the failures. This paper presents results of a probabilistic analysis that estimates the hazard, expressed in terms of runup (at a given probability of occurrence), of SMF tsunamis triggered by earthquakes, on the upper northeast coast of the United States. A Monte Carlo approach is employed, in which distributions of relevant parameters (seismicity, sediment properties, type and location of slide, volume of slide, water depth, etc.) are used to perform large numbers of stochastic stability analyses of <b>underwater</b> <b>slopes,</b> based on standard geotechnical methods. When slope failure occurs, initial tsunami characteristic height and runup are estimated, based on earlier numerical work, for specified return periods of seismic events. The overall hazard associated with SMF tsunamis along the coast is found to be quite low at most locations as compared, e. g., to the typical 100 year hurricane storm surge in the region (5 m). Two sites, however, located off of Long Island, New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey, show an elevated risk of higher tsunami runup (5. 0 - 7. 5 m).

40|$|We have {{proposed}} a conceptual model of dynamics of frozen and cooled below 0 °С rocks of the coastal zone. The map shows the areas of degradation, formation, and a stable state of permafrost. The basis of mapping is the type assignment of the coastal zone based on the transformation factors. This geological structure is characterized by ground ice occurrence, ice-bearing rocks, modern vertical movements, hydrodynamic processes, and solid runoff. Depending on {{the combination of these}} factors, in some cases sedimentation, accompanied by syngenetic freezing of rocks occurs in the coastal zone. In other cases, the seashores retreat, and the frozen deposits of the <b>underwater</b> coastal <b>slope</b> thaw. In other cases, the banks retreat, and the permafrost sediments of the <b>underwater</b> coastal <b>slope</b> are thawed. This happens due to intensive salinization at the sea depths of 0 - 2 m, where sea ice adfreezes with a bottom, as well as due to summer warming of near-bottom water. In the third case, under stable shores, the bottom rocks in the depth interval 0 - 2 m basical remain frozen and only in the interval from 2 to 3 - 5 m they are cooled. Alluvial-marine sedimentation in the mouths of rivers depends on a ratio of the volume of solid runoff and vertical tectonic movements. This can lead to formation of new permafrost or to submersion of sediments under the sea level and following thawing. Mapping of the tendency of the cryogenic dynamics of the coastal zone is based on its typing, the regional permafrost, aerospace and cartographic data. Such a map has been compiled for {{the eastern part of the}} Laptev Sea and for the western part of the East Siberian Sea. It shows the types of frozen and cooled rocks—degrading, aggradating, stable—and their subtypes.

40|$|In 2007, a seismic swarm {{with more}} than 7000 {{recorded}} earthquakes affected the region around Aysén fjord, Chile (45 ° 25 'S). The series of seismic events reached a maximum on 21 April 2007, with an Mw 6. 2 earthquake. Intensities as high as VIII to IX on the Modified Mercalli scale were reported around the epicenter. Multiple debris flows, rock slides and rock avalanches were triggered along the fjord's coastline, and several of these caused impact waves or tsunamis with wave heights of up to 6 m, which inundated the fjord shorelines and caused heavy damage and 10 casualties. In order to characterize in detail the imprint left by this series of catastrophic events in the sedimentary record of the fjord, we conducted a multi-disciplinary survey of the inner fjord region in December 2009. Multibeam bathymetry and high-resolution reflection seismic data reveal that {{large parts of the}} fjord basin floor, mostly {{at the foot of the}} fjord's steep <b>underwater</b> <b>slopes,</b> are covered by recent mass-wasting deposits or consist of mass-wasting-induced deformed basin-plain sediments. A series of short sediment cores collected throughout the inner fjord contain also the more distal deposits of this significant basin-wide mass-wasting event. By combining classical sedimentological techniques (i. e. grain-size analysis, LOI and magnetic susceptibility measurements, all at high resolution) with X-ray CT scanning and XRF scanning we were able to demonstrate that the event deposits encountered in the cores have a very complex signature and actually consist of a succession of several sub-deposits, comprising distal mass-flow deposits from different source areas (as evidenced by XRF-derived geochemical provenance indications) and with a different flow direction (as evidenced by CT-derived 3 D flow-direction indications, such as imbricated rip-up mud clasts, cross and convolute laminations) and tsunami- or seiche-generated deposits. This allowed us to reconstruct the succession of sedimentary events that affected the inner fjord region and got imprinted in the fjord's sedimentary record. The improved characterization of such a complex event deposit may help to reconstruct the exact nature and basin-wide effects of past similar events (i. e. the seismic data show clear evidence of 3 - 4 similar prehistoric events) and to establish a reliable hazard assessment for the region...|$|R

Despite {{the importance of}} the mesopelagic boundary community to both nearshore and oceanic ecosystems, it has not been well studied. This work investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of the mesopelagic boundary community and their impact the foraging behavior of its predators. Several active acoustic (sonar) techniques were utilized, complimented by trawling and optical techniques. Target strength measurements of live animals from the boundary community facilitated the use of echo-energy integration techniques and allowed conversion of acoustic backscattering measures to estimates of caloric content. Using these measures, ship-based echosounder surveys showed that mesopelagic animals are heterogeneously distributed, in both time and space. The Hawaiian mesopelagic boundary community fits the hierarchical patch structure model with patches within patches that are part of a larger scale matrix of patches. Surveys also revealed that the boundary layer undergoes diel horizontal migrations in addition to its vertical migrations. At night organisms were found within 1 km of shore, in waters much shallower than their daytime habitat. Because of this horizontal movement, the highest densities of mesopelagic animals, reaching up to 1800 animals/m^ 3, were observed nearshore. A series of bottom-mounted, sonar moorings measured vertical migration rates of 0 - 1. 7 m/min and average horizontal rates of 1. 67 km/hr. High levels of biomass were observed moving rapidly, over a great distance, into shallow waters very close to shore, providing insight into the significant link the boundary community provides between nearshore and oceanic systems. To understand how temporal and spatial heterogeneity of prey affected a pelagic predator, an echosounder was used to simultaneously measure the abundance of spinner dolphins and the boundary community. Spinner dolphins followed the migration patterns of their prey both horizontally and vertically. Overlap was observed between spinner dolphins and their prey from several minutes to an entire night, at spatial scales of 20 meters to several kilometers. An understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the mesopelagic boundary community permitted the accurate prediction of predator movement patterns and an increased understanding of their behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{has three}} major purposes: (1) {{to explore the}} static liquefaction phenomenon in saturated sand as a relevant geotechnical hazard, (2) to show the conventional testing procedures for index characterisation and strength testing of saturated fine sands at low stress levels, and (3) {{to look into the}} fluidization mechanism and the ongoing research into its applications in saturated sand testing, done at Delft University of Technology. The exploring on static liquefaction was performed by a literature study, which allowed to relate the macroscopic scale of this hazard in <b>underwater</b> <b>slopes</b> with the common practices performed in laboratory conditions. The literature found shows that a change in the framework of understanding saturated sand behaviour, accounting for anisotropy, may occur within the next years. In addition, the literature supports that improvements on the liquefaction prediction can only be done via: improvements of: the theoretical framework in which the sand behaviour is studied, the constitutive and numerical models used for prediction of the liquefaction mechanism and the testing and the physical modelling methods allowing for both sand characterisation and the determination of the constitutive model parameters. Some tests performed to characterise a fine sand were selected to see how the method can affect the obtained results and how the conditions of the sample preparation and control can affect the liquefaction potential on a saturated sand sample. The results support that idea that the amount of fines on the sand, indicated generally by a sieving test, can affect the results of the index minimum and maximum void ratio, differentiating the properties of a sand with fines and a sand without fines. In addition, several variables such as the degree of saturation, confining stress levels and membrane penetration can {{contribute to the development of}} pore pressures and the development of liquefaction. The literature study reveals that fluidization has been used on research on granular soils sedimentation, documented in the work by Allen (1984), and is not as new in earth sciences as it was thought to be. Based on the undrained triaxial testing procedure suggested by Jager and Molenkamp (2015 a), where fluidization will be used for sample preparation, some sand batches were prepared, in which layers were removed to characterise the final product. While the results on void ratio distribution along the depth of the column are not sufficient to draw further conclusions, it was found that the discharge rate can affect the porosity distribution during and after fluidization. The study not only showcases two techniques that can allow a quantitative assessment of fluidization mechanism, but also that inclusion of this method in loose sample preparation could bring improvements into granular soils characterisation.
