5|$|C.mutica {{were also}} {{discovered}} in Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Cordova, Kodiak, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and Unalaska in Alaska between 2000 and 2003. This {{was the first}} instance of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have spread into British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C.mutica have completely expanded <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> west coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|Richmond {{grew up in}} Ashland, Ohio. His parents, Al and Evelyn (née Warner) Richmond, met in {{the course}} of their work. Al was a welder for pipe {{construction}} companies and Evelyn was a field office manager. Noticing that highway crews had to dig <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide.|$|E
5|$|They {{decided to}} have a scene where Lisa and Bart visit Homer before his surgery and were unsure of how to do it, so they {{approached}} Brooks. Brooks made <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> scene on the spot. Originally, the surgery was supposed to be performed by Dr. Hibbert, but it was later changed to Dr. Nick. In the original airing of the episode, Dr. Nick's phone number was the number of a real legal clinic, whose lawyers made them change it to 1-600-DOCTORB.|$|E

5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|Davout {{anticipated}} {{the problems and}} withdrew his corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence. The northbound Austrian columns in the KelheimAbbach zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt {{in the early hours}} of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Masséna's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of S. angustirostris is a {{skull and}} postcrania, so the cranium {{of the species}} is well-described. Bell et al. re-evaluated the entire species in a 2011 {{publication}} with Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Their description found the skull to be generalized among hadrosaurines, and are much larger than any skulls of S. osborni. The most unusual feature for a hadrosaurine is the long, protruding, solid crest that extends upwards diagonally {{from the back of}} the skull roof. Unlike lambeosaurines, the crests are made up completely of the nasal bone. The premaxilla bones make up almost 50% of the entire skull length, and both sides are filled with small holes. Only in adult individuals has the front of the premaxillary contact been fused. Longer than the premaxilla, the nasal bones are the longest in the skull. They make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> length of the crest, and are never preserved as fused.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{throughout}} France, the Selle Français {{has been}} exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses {{registered with the}} stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections, including those of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, {{may be used for}} breeding, with the progeny able to be registered as Selle Français. Selle Français have proven successful at the international level of competition in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E

The Third Burmese Empire, for a brief time the terror of British India, was crippled and no longer a threat to the eastern frontier of British India. The Burmese would be crushed for years to come by repaying the large indemnity of one million pounds (then US$5 million), a large sum at that time.

25|$|As the Laotian Civil War flared from 1961 onward, the CIA {{carried out}} a {{paramilitary}} program designed to foster a guerrilla army to support the Royal Lao Government (RLG). Paralleling that, the U.S. Department of Defense covertly supported the Royal Lao Army and other Lao armed forces through a sub rosa supply system, as the U.S. picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> budget of Laos. The Annamese Cordillera in southern Laos became the haven for a communist logistics network, the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The communist war effort in South Vietnam depended on that supply route.|$|E
