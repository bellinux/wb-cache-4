5|$|Göring {{had never}} {{believed}} in Sea Lion, while Hitler had never believed Adler could achieve victory without Sea Lion. Both went their own ways. Hitler {{needed someone to}} keep up the pressure on Britain, and Göring was willing to do it. On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E

25|$|The {{collection}} and library were arranged in galleries within {{the university and}} a guidebook published in 1915. Initially, the collection's visitors were students and academics; it was not then open to the general public. Petrie retired from University College London (UCL) in 1933, though his successors continued {{to add to the}} collections, excavating in other parts of Egypt and the Sudan. During the Second World War (1939–1945) the collection was packed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> out of London for safekeeping. In the early 1950s it was moved into a former stable, where it remains adjacent to the science library of UCL.|$|E
25|$|This {{stone in}} style Fp was {{reported}} by road construction workers on April 6, 1990. A runologist arrived and noted that it was missing some parts. It was also lying with text upwards and it had probably been dug <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> by machinery the previous winter {{from somewhere in the}} vicinity. The existence of lichen showed that it had not been completely covered by soil. Later in the month, an archaeological excavation uncovered two missing pieces of the stone. On the 23rd it was moved to the museum of Sigtuna and on May 16, it was transported to a stonemason who mended the stone.|$|E

The vessel was seized by the National Bank of Greece and Hellenic Industrial Development Bank in July 1999. Since then, Regent Sky has moved from one lay up berth to another, {{including}} Perama, Ambelakia and then Kinossoura. All attempts to sell the vessel at auction failed. The Regent Sky had been laid <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> to anchorage off Eleusis, Greece, until July 2011 when she was sold for scrapping.

25|$|With the {{termination}} of passenger traffic in 1968, the ground floor became disused. It rented to Trosvik Verkstad, which at first used it for office space. Later it converted the southern part into a physician's office. From 1982 the upper story was also available and rented to the same company, until it went bankrupt in 1986. A series of renovations were carried out, which partially destroyed many dignified aspects of the building. Following the bankruptcy, the station building was sold to Nydalen Compagnie. As they did not use it, the building occupied by homeless, who scavenged the building for molding and similar which was used for firewood, rapidly dilapidating the building. Brevik Management bought the building in 1988, fixed it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> their head office there from December 1988. Also the outhouse, which had been disused since the 1960s, was restored. The renovation work was awarded Sparebankens Brevikspris in 1991. The station building and two outhouses were listed as cultural heritage sites in 1997.|$|E

25|$|As student {{enrollment}} continued to grow, another renovation project was planned {{to increase the}} capacity of the high school while updating the facilities to better meet students' needs. The two-year project began in 1995 and required the ninth grade students to remain in their respective middle schools another year. Students in grades 10-12 occupied half of the high school while the other half was being renovated. Staff and students then picked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> all books, furniture and equipment into the renovated half of the building in 1996, and construction began on the other half. The $30 million renovation project connected the former ninth grade building and the high school. New construction took place over the former parking tiers with a new cafeteria (seating capacity of 600), gymnasium (capacity of 2000), library/media center, and enclosed walkway. All classrooms were reconfigured with additional classrooms located in the former library and cafeteria. The familiar curving hallways remained, but new terrazzo floors, ceiling tiles, and freshly painted lockers were added. Along with updated lab facilities, technology was a huge part of the project, as over 500 computers were added throughout the building.|$|E
25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of scraper bars fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel washer jets supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|E
25|$|Ian Redpath and Rick McCosker {{came out}} to open for Australia on another wet wicket, but this time {{failed to make the}} stand that saved Australia at Adelaide. They were not even able to claim that their wickets fell because of the damp patch on a fast bowler's length. Lever had {{increased}} his pace with age and was thought to be fast than Willis, but had dropped the ball short at Brisbane for figures of 0/111. Back in the England team he pitched the ball <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> it in the heavy atmosphere to have both men caught by Greig at second slip. The English fielding perked up, Mike Denness set aggressive fields and it took 25 minutes for Australia to score their first run. In the Melbourne heat Geoff Arnold was replaced by Old after four overs, but Lever stayed on for seven overs and was rewarded with figures of 4/13 as Greg Chappell was caught in the covers by Denness, Ross Edwards was taken by Dennis Amiss at leg-slip for 0 and Australia were 23/4. The ball was now leaping dangerously, Ian Chappell had to fend a ball off his head and Greg had been hit on the chin. The captain decided that attack was the best form of defence and made 43 of his team's 66/5 by lunch, with Doug Walters popping the ball off Old to Edrich in gully with a frightful stroke. The exhausted Lever only managed two overs after lunch and Chappell and Rod Marsh hit 54 runs for the sixth wicket. Chris Old (3/50) has Chappell (65) caught behind after making a too fine a glance and bowled Marsh (29) for 115/7. Max Walker and Lillee hit out a few more runs, even turning down bad light so that they could continue play and get England in. The burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out they were both sent to the ground. Lever returned to remove Lillee and Mallett and Greig ended the innings by having Dymock out for a duck, with Walker 20 not out. Lever's 6/38 was his best bowling in Tests and Australia were out four minutes before tea for 152, easily their lowest score of the series.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, Chamberlain damaged his {{reputation}} in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated. In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented {{that he could}} see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position." ...|$|E
500|$|Arriving {{shortly after}} the initial contact, the lead platoon from B Company—5 Platoon under Second Lieutenant John O'Halloran—was forced to jump from their {{helicopters}} as {{they were unable to}} land after taking fire at the landing zone. The platoon quickly formed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> into the vegetation on {{the western edge of the}} landing zone, with the remainder of the company following them as they landed. Meanwhile, O'Brien estimated that A Company was facing at least a company dug-in across a [...] frontage, armed with five or six machine-guns. Unable to use artillery because of the helicopters still flying-in the remainder of the battalion, while the mortars were still with the APCs and had not yet arrived, O'Brien was without support and any further advance would not be possible. Unlike previous encounters during which the Viet Cong had attempted to avoid battle, the force now confronting A Company appeared to have no intention of withdrawing and was instead mounting an unexpectedly determined defence. The Australians suspected that this uncharacteristic willingness to fight during daylight indicated that the Viet Cong force may have been covering the withdrawal of their command elements. Under heavy fire from what appeared to be a Viet Cong base area, O'Brien extricated his platoons with difficulty and subsequently broke contact, withdrawing [...] with the wounded to the southern edge of the landing zone.|$|E
