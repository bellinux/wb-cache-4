40|$|BACKGROUND: Almost all (17 / 20) Swedish {{counties}} have pharmaceutical committees that establish {{recommendations for the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in oral healthcare. Objective To evaluate the evidence for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in oral healthcare and the agreement between Swedish recommendations and evidence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The MeSH terms 'antibiotic prophylaxis' and 'dentistry' {{were used in the}} database search. Abstracts were reviewed according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 186 articles were read in full text by the four authors independently. Data extraction and interpretation of data was carried out using a pre-defined protocol. In the end, one case-control study was included for evaluation of evidence. RESULTS: The case-control study included patients with specific cardiac conditions. The study reported a 49 % protective efficacy (odds ratio: 0. 51) <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis for first-time episodes of endocarditis within 30 days of procedure. This result was not statistically significant. The quality of the evidence was low. No studies were evaluated on patients with other medical conditions. The recommendations included several cardiac and other medical conditions for which {{there is a lack of}} evidence or no evidence to support the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence to support the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis. To avoid the risk of adverse events from antibiotics and the risk of developing resistant bacterial strains, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis should be minimised and recommendations in Sweden should be revised to be more evidence-based...|$|R
5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
40|$|Background In Orthopaedic Surgery, {{antibiotic}} {{is being}} used as prophylactic, and therapeutic agent of existinginfection.

5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

30|$|There are no data {{to support}} the routine <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> therapy before, during, or after {{surgical}} treatment of IUAs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines for antibiotic use in gynecologic procedures do not recommend antibiotic use for diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy [95]. There is, however, a theoretic risk of secondary infection, {{and it has been}} proposed that infection may be a primary cause of IUAs. This has led many surgeons to treat women undergoing surgical lysis of IUAs with preoperative or intraoperative antibiotic therapy, and some continue with postoperative antibiotic therapy; however, at this time, {{there is no evidence to}} support or refute the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> therapy.|$|R
30|$|Surgical site {{infection}} {{can result}} in increased morbidity for the patient, prolonged hospital stay and hospital readmission. Preoperative antibiotics {{reduce the incidence of}} such infections, particularly in open surgery. Universal <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis, however, is not recommended due to the risks of adverse reactions, generation of resistant bacteria and additional cost. Endoscopic procedures carry low risk of wound contamination and infection. Limited data suggest wide variability in antibiotic prophylaxis in gynaecological surgery and potential overuse <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in gynaecological endoscopic surgery.
