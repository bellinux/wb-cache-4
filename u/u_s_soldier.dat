40|$|The Obama Administration’s {{controversial}} {{exchange of}} five Taliban detainees for a captured <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>soldier</b> in May 2014 reignited {{a heated debate}} over the proper scope of wartime executive authority. From a legal perspective, the primary issue centers on the constitutional {{balance of power between}} congressional appropriations and the President’s power as Commander in Chief. A complete analysis incorporates both judicial and historical precedent to evaluate the conflict within the broader context of prisoner recovery efforts. This Note argues that, regardless of the validity of legislative restrictions on the transfer of Guantánamo detainees, the President possessed sufficient authority to conduct the prisoner exchange. Commanders in Chief have retained exclusive control over recovery efforts since the Revolutionary War, often exchanging nontraditional detainees for regular servicemembers without any congressional opposition. Furthermore, as this Note concludes, Congress elsewhere granted the President ample discretion over notification and defense spending to legally conduct the exchange...|$|E

40|$|OTTAWA- A Canadian {{court has}} sided {{for the first}} time with a {{military}} deserter who fled to Canada seeking refugee status, ruling that the <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>soldier</b> witnessed enough human rights abuses during a stint in Iraq that he could qualify for asylum. The decision yesterday also marked the first time that the Federal Court, which has heard a handful of cases involving deserters, concluded that military action against civilians in Iraq violates the 1949 Geneva Convention, an international prohibition against humiliating and degrading treatment. Federal Court Justice Richard Barnes ordered the Immigration and Refugee Board to reconsider the failed refugee claim of Joshua Key, a soldier who entered Canada with his wife, Brandi, and their small children in March, 2005. Mr. Key, an army private, deserted during a two-week break from serving as a combat engineer in Iraq, where he spent eight months in 2003 and says he was involved in military-condoned home invasions against civilians. Judge Barnes said the immigration board found Mr. Key "was not a conscientious objector in the usual sense of being opposed to war generally, and that his objections to the conflict in Iraq were not politically or religiously motivated. Rather, what Mr. Key objected to were the systematic violations of human rights that resulted from the conduct of the United States Army in Iraq and the requirement that he participate.

40|$|This essay uses Michel Foucault’s {{notion of}} biopower {{to explore how}} dogs were used by the United States {{military}} in the Vietnam wars to mitigate the territorial advantages of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army. Relying in particular on the account by <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>soldier</b> and dog handler John C. Burnam, the essay also shows agency to be situational: since the dogs’ superior sensory abilities enabled them to help significantly the United States military, their presence complicates and at times reverses dogmatic ideas of human agency trumping other animals’ agency. But the operation of contemporary biopower makes such categorical inversions flimsy and reversible: the dogs’ status changed from heroes set for moments above human soldiers to mere machinery, pressed below even animals, in order to excuse official United States policy to leave the dogs in Vietnam. Thus, most of the 4, 000 or so dogs used in conflict were abandoned in the war zone when the United States withdrew, leaving many of the dogs to become meat, to be eaten by the Vietnamese. Soldiers’ love for their canine partners heightened the teams’ effectiveness, but it also sharpened the soldiers’ sense of loss, contradiction, and betrayal {{in the face of}} the dogs’ abandonment, helping to inspire a legal change in U. S. policy regarding military dogs in 2000. This specific historical case is understood as characteristic of contemporary biopower’s function more generally...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} contains correspondence, official documents, notes, and clippings regarding Werner Kleeman's military service, restitution claims, and pension claims, {{as well as}} drafts of his book From Dachau to D-Day. Papers from the military service, immigration, and restitution claims of his father Louis Kleeman comprise {{a substantial portion of}} this collection. Also included are genealogical tables, typescripts, and clippings focused mainly on the Kleeman, Loeb, and Lehman families. The final series consists of personal papers of Norborne Gatling, Jr., a <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>soldier</b> whom Kleeman knew. Werner Kleeman, April 2000, December 2002, January 2003; August 2003 (Addenda 1); September 2005 (Addenda 2); March 2006 (Addenda "Gatling") Werner Kleeman was born on September 26, 1919 in Gaukönigshofen, Bavaria, to Louis Kleemann (born June 19, 1884), a prosperous businessman, and his wife Lina née Bamberger. He applied for a visa to immigrate to the United States via England in 1938, sponsored by a distant relative in Nebraska. Before he could leave Germany, however, he was arrested during Kristallnacht, imprisoned along with his family members, and then sent to Dachau. Because he had already obtained a visa to emigrate, he was released from Dachau January of 1939. He went to England, where he procured visas for his parents and siblings, and then came to the United States in December of 1939. Louis Kleeman(n), Werner’s father, took a Torah scroll from the local synagogue during Kristallnacht and hid it until he immigrated to the United States in 1940. This Torah is now held at the Lloyd Street Synagogue, part of the Jewish Museum of Maryland. Werner Kleeman was drafted into the U. S. Army in August of 1942 and joined the 4 th Infantry Division. He took part in the D-day invasion of Normandy alongside J. D. Salinger and Ernest Hemingway, both of whom he knew personally. After the war ended, he traveled to his hometown of Gaukönigshofen without the permission of the U. S. Army. In Gaukönigshofen, he arrested all the townspeople who had taken part in Kristallnacht, put them into the prison where they had put him, and had them sign confessions of what they had done. These confessions were later used in a trial in Würzburg in 1948. After the U. S. Army ordered Werner Kleeman to leave Gaukönigshofen, he left the army and returned to the United States. For most of his life, Kleeman worked as an interior decorator from his home in Flushing, New York. He married Lore Heiman (1927 - 1979) in 1948, and they had two daughters, Susan and Deborah. In the 1950 s and 1960 s, Werner Kleeman applied for restitution. His claims of damages to his education, property, and freedom were successful, but his claim of damages to his health was not. The restitution claims of his father, Louis Kleeman, were successful. Only later in his life did Werner Kleeman begin to share the story of his experiences in Gaukönigshofen before the war and as a <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>soldier.</b> These experiences are collected in his monograph From Dachau to D-Day, published by Marble House Editions in 2007.

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the U. S. military, {{soldiers}} have created their own theatrical entertainments as a means to boost morale, maintain resiliency, and avoid boredom. Today, the annual <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Soldier</b> Show, Army Entertainment Division 2 ̆ 7 s most widely attended production, reaches approximately 140, 000 people worldwide. With over 200 Army bases situated in the United States alone, the reach of the Army Entertainment Division 2 ̆ 7 s biggest national offering in 2013 was estimated to be 60, 000 soldiers, family members, retirees, and civilian Department of Defense (DoD) employees. This study aims to fill in a gap of knowledge for most theater scholars. Many are unaware that theater plays any role in organized military service. Because the number of U. S. Army bases operating their own independent theater seasons has dwindled over the years, it is important to study the few remaining Army-based community theaters to appreciate the unique structure and operations required within a military environment. Not only is this research important, it is long overdue. While {{the history of}} the U. S. O. during World War II has been heavily documented, there has been very little research on more recent uses of entertainment, specifically theater, in the military and even less research on those performances produced from within the military (not just for the soldier, but created by the soldier, as well). Theater scholars would benefit from recognizing the potential contributions of the military, specifically the U. S. Army and its long-running Army Entertainment Division with its multi-million dollar budget, in building new generations of both theater artists and enthusiasts. Likewise, theater scholars must recognize the potential contributions they can make on U. S. military bases as artist-educators who can continue the development and facilitation of live theater in new and creative ways before the arts disappear from military installations altogether...|$|E

40|$|Beginning in January 1999 and {{continuing}} through January 2000, a <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>soldier</b> began frequenting an off-post Internet cafe in Darmstadt, Germany, called the Netzwork Café. There he would download images {{of child pornography}} and search Internet websites, logging onto Internet chat rooms in order to communicate with individuals willing to send him images of naked children and children engaged in sex acts. Specialist Martinelli was eventually caught and charged with various violations of 18 U. S. C. § 2252 A for knowingly mailing, transporting or shipping child pornography in interstate or foreign commerce (by computer); knowingly receiving child pornography that had been mailed, shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce (by computer); knowingly reproducing child pornography for distribution through the mails, or in interstate or foreign commerce (by computer); and knowingly possessing child pornography on land and in a building used by and {{under the control of}} the U. S. Government (in this case by possessing approximately fifty diskettes containing child pornography in buildings at the U. S. Army installation in Germany). All four specifications were based on the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996. Martinelli pleaded guilty and was convicted of all four. On appeal before the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), however, the defense challenged the jurisdictional basis for the convictions, arguing that the Child Pornography Prevention Act did not apply to Specialist Martinelli 2 ̆ 7 s conduct because it occurred overseas. The CAAF was certainly not the first court to face the issue of the extraterritorial application of a criminal statute [...] or even a criminal statute addressing child pornography or sexual exploitation of children. Likewise, Specialist Martinelli was not the first (nor will he be the last) to engage in such vile conduct abroad. In past years, federal courts had been contending with such offenders and slowly building a proper foundation by which laws criminalizing the sexual exploitation of children could reach pedophiles abroad. The weight of precedent and rationale was decidedly in favor of Martinelli’s conviction. But, instead, the CAAF found Specialist Martinelli’s conduct could not be prosecuted under 18 U. S. C. § 2252 A(a) because the statute did not apply extraterritorially. The holding in United States v. Martinelli was both disappointing and legally unsupportable. The CAAF had a constellation of reasons to apply 18 U. S. C. § 2252 A extraterritorially. Instead, it adopted a myopic view of implied extraterritorially, ignored the weight of federal precedent on this issue, ignored the multiple grants of extraterritorial jurisdiction allowed by international law, and misread (or failed to read) the legislative history of the statute in question. This Article will examine where the CAAF went wrong in the hope that its errors may be corrected at some later point and, at the very least, so that other federal courts might be dissuaded from emulating them...|$|E
