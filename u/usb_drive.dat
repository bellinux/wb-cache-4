Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a <b>USB</b> <b>drive</b> on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E

25|$|As highly {{portable}} media, USB flash drives {{are easily}} lost or stolen.

Its Maxtor One-Touch II external hard drive was marketed as convenient storage for the home user. Maxtor entered and became dominant in consumer business as result of a marketing strategy for the OneTouch line. The OneTouch is a high-capacity (500 GB to 1 TB) <b>USB</b> <b>drive</b> with a single-press button to back up and mirror the computer's hard drive. The line became the best-selling consumer device in the computer segment with several million devices distributed globally.|$|E
25|$|With wide deployment(s) of flash drives {{being used}} in various environments (secured or otherwise), the issue of data and {{information}} security remains important. The use of biometrics and encryption is becoming the norm {{with the need for}} increased security for data; on-the-fly encryption systems are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data. In some cases a secure <b>USB</b> <b>drive</b> may use a hardware-based encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. IEEE 1667 is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in Windows 7 and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).|$|E

500|$|During a Nine Inch Nails {{concert in}} Lisbon, Portugal, a USB flash drive {{was found in}} a {{bathroom}} stall containing a high-quality MP3 of the track [...] "My Violent Heart", a song from the then-unreleased album. [...] A second <b>USB</b> <b>drive</b> was found after a concert in Barcelona, containing the track [...] "Me, I'm Not". Following the release of Year Zero the focus of the tour shifted towards debuting and promoting tracks from the new album. While some of these songs were performed by all 5 band members as conventional guitar-driven rock songs, two of them ("Me, I'm Not" [...] and [...] "The Great Destroyer") were played by Reznor, guitarist North and keyboard player Cortini as a 3 piece, using a combination of live guitars and pre-programmed samples triggered onstage with computers and manipulated in real time using Ableton software.|$|E
500|$|Part of this promotional {{campaign}} involved USB drives {{that were left}} in concert venues for fans to find during Nine Inch Nails' 2007 European tour.

500|$|Nevertheless, in February 2008, a {{group of}} {{security}} researchers published details of a so-called [...] "cold boot attack" [...] that allows full disk encryption systems such as BitLocker to be compromised by booting the machine off removable media, such as a <b>USB</b> <b>drive,</b> into another operating system, then dumping the contents of pre-boot memory. The attack relies {{on the fact that}} DRAM retains information for up to several minutes (or even longer if cooled) after power has been removed. There is the Bress/Menz device described in US Patent 9,514,789 that can accomplish this type of attack. Use of a TPM alone does not offer any protection, as the keys are held in memory while Windows is running. Similar full disk encryption mechanisms of other vendors and other operating systems, including Linux and Mac OS X, are vulnerable to the same attack. The authors recommend that computers be powered down when not in physical control of the owner (rather than be left in a sleep mode) and that the encryption software be configured to require a password to boot the machine.|$|E
2500|$|FreeOTFE {{can be used}} in [...] "{{portable}}" [...] (or [...] "traveller") mode, {{which allows}} it to be kept on a <b>USB</b> <b>drive</b> or other portable media, together with its encrypted data, and carried around.

2500|$|The {{memory in}} flash drives is {{commonly}} engineered with multi-level cell (MLC) based memory {{that is good}} for around 3,000-5,000 program-erase cycles, but some flash drives have single-level cell (SLC) based memory that is good for around 100,000 writes. There is virtually no limit {{to the number of}} reads from such flash memory, so a well-worn <b>USB</b> <b>drive</b> may be write-protected to help ensure the life of individual cells.|$|E

50|$|In {{commercial}} environments, {{where most}} secure <b>USB</b> <b>drives</b> are used, a central/remote management system may provide organizations {{with an additional}} level of IT asset control, significantly reducing the risks of a harmful data breach. This can include initial user deployment and ongoing management, password recovery, data backup, remote tracking of sensitive data and termination of any issued secure <b>USB</b> <b>drives.</b> Such management systems are available as {{software as a service}} (SaaS), where Internet connectivity is allowed, or as behind-the-firewall solutions.|$|R
25|$|Counterfeit <b>USB</b> flash <b>drives</b> are {{sometimes}} sold with claims of having higher capacities {{than they actually}} have. These are typically low capacity <b>USB</b> <b>drives</b> which are modified so that they emulate larger capacity drives (for example, a 2GB drive being marketed as a 64GB drive). When plugged into a computer, they report themselves as being the larger capacity they were sold as, but when data is written to them, either the write fails, the drive freezes up, or it overwrites existing data. Software tools exist to check and detect fake <b>USB</b> <b>drives,</b> {{and in some cases}} it is possible to repair these devices to remove the false capacity information and use its real storage limit.|$|R
