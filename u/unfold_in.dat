5|$|The Reagan {{administration}} {{largely ignored}} the AIDS crisis, which began to <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> the United States in 1981, {{the same year}} Reagan took office. AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were routinely denied. By {{the end of the}} first 12 months of the epidemic, when more than 1,000 people had died of AIDS in the U.S., the CDC had spent less than $1 million on AIDS research. In contrast, funding had been made amply available to the CDC in their efforts to stop Legionnaires' disease after an outbreak in 1976; the CDC had spent $9 million in fighting Legionnaires' disease, though the outbreak had caused fewer than 50 deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{differs from}} Shakespeare's other plays in its {{observation}} of a stricter, more organised neoclassical style. The clearest indication {{of this is}} Shakespeare's respect for the three unities in the play: the Unities of Time, Place, and Action. Shakespeare's other plays rarely respected the three unities, taking place in separate locations miles apart and over several days or even years. The play's events <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> real time before the audience, Prospero even declaring in the last act that everything has happened in, more or less, three hours. All action is unified into one basic plot: Prospero's struggle to regain his dukedom; it is also confined to one place, a fictional island, which many scholars agree {{is meant to be}} located in the Mediterranean Sea. Another reading suggests that it takes place in the New World, as some parts read like records of English and Spanish conquest in the Americas. Still others argue that the Island can represent any land that has been colonised.|$|E

25|$|The U13 {{series was}} {{launched}} in Japan in September 1991 as a four-door sedan and four-door hardtop. The two models were visually distinct: the four-door sedan had curves where its U12 predecessor had edges, while the hardtop, called the Nissan Bluebird ARX, had more traditional styling. The Bluebird wagon {{was replaced by the}} new Nissan Avenir. This series replaced the Stanza/Auster/Violet platform expansion that enabled Nissan to sell a Bluebird-sized product at Nissan's Japanese dealership network, as the economic effects of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble began to <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> Japan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of the 1848 Romanticist and liberal {{revolutions}} across Europe, the events {{that took place in the}} Grand Principality of Transylvania were the first of their kind to <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> the Romanian-speaking territories. On the one hand, the Transylvanian Saxons and the Transylvanian Romanians (with consistent support on behalf of the Austrian Empire) successfully managed to oppose the goals of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, with the two noteworthy historical figures leading the common Romanian-Saxon side at the time being Avram Iancu and Stephan Ludwig Roth.|$|E

Of similar length and degree of {{condensation}} as the romance found in British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, this version differs {{in the structure of}} its verses and in the way the Old French story is made to <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> “a more linear sequence.” It is known as the Northern Octavian.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the reforms}} were not {{successful}} in preventing {{the energy crisis}} that was to <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> 2001. Installed capacity expanded by only 28 per cent during 1990-99, whereas electricity demand increased by 45 per cent. In 1999, as the power shortage was already foreseen, the President Cardoso Administration made efforts to increase private investment in the electricity sector through a Priority Thermal Power Program (PPT) that aimed at the expeditious construction of more than 40 gas-fired thermal plants. Unfortunately, the needed investment did not materialize and the crisis became unavoidable.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{scenario}} would <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> {{the very}} next match against Orlando City SC. Orlando had an advantage in ball possession and shots on goal, but Hamid's excellent saves would earn him another clean sheet. Silva, who finally returned from his preseason injury as a substitute, bent a direct free kick into the opposing net in stoppage time and secured a 1–0 victory for DC. When DC United returned home following the Orlando match, press reports emerged that Eddie Johnson's career was in jeopardy because of a heart defect. Although the team continued official radio silence on the issue, the Washington Post eventually reported that Johnson would no longer continue to be paid by the team. Outstanding issues remained to be negotiated before this would be officially confirmed. These issues included whether DC {{would be allowed to}} sign a replacement using the salary cap space budgeted to Johnson's contract.|$|E

25|$|Once {{a single}} loop-based {{arrangement}} has been generated, a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> time, {{and what the}} final structure of the piece will be. Some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix. Quite often, this is achieved by physically manipulating a mixer, sequencer, effects, dynamic processing, equalization, and filtering while recording to a multi-track device. Other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computer-based digital audio workstations. Techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with signal processing of one variety or another, frequency filtering being a commonly used process. A more idiosyncratic approach to production {{is evident in the}} music of artists such as Twerk and Autechre, where aspects of algorithmic composition are employed in the generation of material.|$|E
25|$|The 'effective control' {{test for}} {{attribution}} {{established in the}} Nicaragua case is not suitable to questions of State responsibility for international crimes committed with a common purpose. The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadić case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the established jurisprudence of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers {{in response to the}} massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to an admission of responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{producers}} {{decided to}} have Shortland Street undergo a cot death storyline and {{the decision was made}} for the character of Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm) to undergo it. Needing a suitable father character, writers paired Ellen with the relatively new character of David. Ellen and David had been dating for several months but the arrival of his ex-wife Isobel Kearney (Jennifer Ward-Lealand) lead to Ellen thinking the two had reconciled, causing her to flee to Fiji. In a specially shot episode in the country, David tracked her down and the two reconciled, only for Ellen to announce she was pregnant. The couple decided to get married to support the child and lured their friends to the ceremony under the pretense that it was Grace Kwan's (Lyentte Forday) birthday. Producers encountered a problem when developing the storyline, when they realized they had accidentally over run Ellen's pregnancy. A quick fill in story was devised where Ellen was nervous that the baby was so late. In the casting of Ellen and David's child, the daughter of the show's medical adviser was chosen. Having set the storyline up to <b>unfold</b> <b>in</b> 1998, crew members began to get cold feet due to the uneasiness of shooting the scene using one of their co workers own children and the fact that two of the storyliners had fallen pregnant. On screen, Ellen had an unscheduled birth, giving birth to Rose Crozier-Kearney (Georgia Bishop) in her bathroom, but help arrived in the form of Caroline Buxton (Tandi Wright) just in time. Due to the tenderness of the storyline, it was continuously pushed back until the stage where it was nearing the point of improbability. The plot was ultimately scheduled to air in the last possible week with the potential of cot death to occur. In February 1998, Ellen and David were shocked to discover her baby daughter Rose, had died in her sleep. The scene was shot with the baby's actress but Malcolm was directed to quickly pick her up and then the shot was changed to a close up, to avoid any movements from the child. The couple's devastation at Rose's death saw them break up and date other characters. However, over a year later they finally put Rose to rest and reconciled. The storyline landed Malcolm with her first ever television acting nomination. The subject of a child's death was dealt with once more in the soap, 5 years later in the death of Te Ngakau Hudson.|$|E
