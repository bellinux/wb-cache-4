40|$|In {{an effort}} to secure the comfort of all aspect of life and {{security}} through electricity production, research, nuclear weapons production and medical uses, radioactive waste is being generated throughout {{the world as a}} result. Without pro – active management and protection, the hazardous nature of radioactive materials can pose serious threats to human health and the environment. A waste containment or disposal facility is required to isolate the waste from man and the biosphere to avoid any <b>undue</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure.</b> Deep geological repository or disposal facility is considered as an effective way to isolate high level radioactive waste, HLW from the human environment, for which a multi – barrier system plays a very significant role.

Near surface disposal also rely on active institutional controls, such as monitoring and maintenance. The objective of radioactive waste disposal is to isolate waste so that it does not result in <b>undue</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> to humans and the environment. The required degree of isolation can be obtained by implementing various disposal methods, of which near surface disposal represents an option commonly used and demonstrated in several countries.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Computed Tomography (CT) is {{a widely}} used medical imaging {{technology}} that {{plays a crucial role}} in pathology diagnosis and treatment management. The growing use of CT imaging raises the risk of <b>undue</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure,</b> particularly for patients imaged multiple times. Thus, {{there is a need to}} maintain radiation exposure As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) while ensuring diagnostic quality images. In this study, we investigate data modeling strategies to quantify CT image quality (IQ), in order to guide protocol selection and attain ALARA. Speciﬁcally, we present a novel, Windowed Fourier-domain Distance Metric (WFDM) that is used to select regions-of-interest (ROI) by their degree of spatial variability. By selecting regions of low variation (ROI-LV), an estimate of the noise in that region can be made. CT IQ is deﬁned as the inverse of this additive noise. Against the phantom CT images, the WFDM model is shown to correlate strongly to image noise (r > 0. 76 (p 0. 001)). As a CT IQ classiﬁer, this model is comparatively analyzed against a ﬁxed-size ROI (baseline) model and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), using phantom and patient CT images. The WFDM model and the CNN are shown to classify the phantom images accurately, with a mean accuracy of αWFDM ≤ 100 %, and αCNN = 93. 8 %, respectively. The baseline model manages a mean accuracy of αB = 73. 6 % on the same phantom images. With the patient CT images, the baseline and WFDM accuracies drop to αB ≤ 49. 5 % and αWFDM ≤ 66. 1 %, respectively. The CNN, however, performs at 100 % accuracy when tested with images from the same CT stack as the training set, but below 1. 9 % otherwise. This indicates the CNN focus on structural rather than textural features. Finally, the WFDM model is used to predict high/low trends in 84 pairs of patient CT images. These trends are set against the trends in x-ray ﬂux at the time of acquisition, CTDIvol, which, for the same patient, directly correspond to CT IQ. The total percentage of image pairs with inverse trends is deﬁned as the total percent error, which is found to be 30. 95 % and 21. 43 % for the baseline and WFDM models, respectively. However, this error drops to 0 % for CTDIvol changes of at least 40. 0 % for the baseline model and 27. 5 % for the WFDM model, respectively. Thus, for every patient that has been previously imaged, the WFDM model can be used to predict optimal parameters for adequate CT image acquisition. Future work will investigate the impact of WFDM parameters, such as the window sizes and transformation technique, on CT image quality assessment. In addition, the WFDM model can also be applied to pre-process CT images followed by CNN data models for CT image texture identiﬁcation...|$|E

This prospective study was performed to {{determine the amount of}} <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> of anesthesiologists for the purpose of assessing whether or not dangerous levels of <b>radiation</b> <b>exposures</b> were being reached, and to identify factors that correlate with excessive risk. Participants and Methods: The <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> of all anesthesiology residents and the attending of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences during a 3 -month period (from June to August 2016) was measured using a film badge with monthly readings. Physicians were divided into two groups: group 1 (the ones assigned to ORs with <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure),</b> and group 2 (the ones assigned to ORs with no or minimal <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure).</b> Results: A total number of 10744 procedures were performed in 3 major university hospitals including 353 cases of pediatric angiography, 251 cases of percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 43 cases of chronic pain palliation and 672 cases of orthopedic surgeries with C-arm application. In all 3 months, there were statistically significant differences in the amount of <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> between the two groups.

The major purpose of fluoroscopy is correct needle placement to ensure target specificity and accurate {{delivery of the}} injectate. <b>Radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> {{may be associated with}} risks to physician, patient and personnel. While there have been many studies evaluating the risk of <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> and techniques to reduce this risk in {{the upper part of the}} body, the literature is scant in evaluating the risk of <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> in the lower part of the body. Methods <b>Radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> risk to the physician was evaluated in 1156 patients undergoing interventional procedures under fluoroscopy by 3 physicians. Monitoring of scattered <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> in the upper and lower body, inside and outside the lead apron was carried out. Results The average exposure per procedure was 12. 0 ± 9. 8 seconds, 9. 0 ± 0. 37 seconds, and 7. 5 ± 1. 27 seconds in Groups I, II, and III respectively. Scatter <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> ranged from a low of 3. 7 ± 0. 29 seconds for caudal/interlaminar epidurals to 61. 0 ± 9. 0 seconds for discography. Inside the apron, over the thyroid collar on the neck, the scatter <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> was 68 mREM in Group I consisting of 201 patients who had a total of 330 procedures with an average of 0. 2060 mREM per procedure and 25 mREM in Group II consisting of 446 patients who had a total of 662 procedures with average of 0. 0378 mREM per procedure. The scatter <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> was 0 mREM in Group III consisting of 509 patients who had a total 827 procedures. Increased levels of exposures were observed in Groups I and II compared to Group III, and Group I compared to Group II.

Results The total 9 -month <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> was 87 mrems for deep dose equivalent (DDE), 293 mrem for lens dose equivalent (LDE), and 282 mrem for shallow dose equivalent (SDE). Total fluoroscopy time was 252. 44 minutes for 64 ureteroscopies (URSs), 29 percutaneous nephrolithtomies (PNLs), 20 cystoscopies with ureteral stent placements, 9 shock wave lithotripsies (SWLs), 9 retrograde pyelograms (RPGs), 2 endoureterotomies, and 1 ureteral balloon dilation.

40|$|Background: Limited {{studies have}} {{reported}} on radiation risks of increased ionizing <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> to medical personnel in the urologic community. Fluoroscopy is readily used in many urologic surgical procedures. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> to all operating room personnel during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), commonly performed for large renal or complex stones. Materials and Methods: We prospectively collected personnel exposure data for all PNL cases at two academic institutions.

Predictors of increased <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> were determined using multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 91 PNL cases in 66 patients were reviewed. Median surgery duration and fluoroscopy time were 142 (38 – 368) min and 263 (19 – 1809) sec, respectively. Median attending urologist, urology resident, anesthesia, and nurse <b>radiation</b> <b>exposure</b> per case was 4 (0 – 111), 4 (0 – 21), 0 (0 – 5), and 0 (0 – 5) mrem, respectively.
