The patients consisted of 3 cases of suprapubic cystotomy (suprapubic lithotomy), 2 cases of ureteroneocystostomy, 5 cases of partial cystectomy, 5 cases of bladder neck plasty and 20 cases of subcapsular prostatectomy. Of these 17 patients were given CET alone and 18 given SB-PC plus CET. Ten (58. 8 %) patients receiving CET alone responded to therapy. Of them, 6 patients showed an excellent response. 17 (94. 5 %) patients receiving SB-PC plus CET, responded to therapy and 12 of them showed an excellent response. Bacterial cultures were obtained from 21 of the 35 cases, which consisted of 12 cases (57. 1 %) of Pseudomonas spp., 6 cases (28. 6 %) of E. coli, 4 cases (19 %) of Streptococcus faecalis, 3 cases (14. 3 %) of Klebsiella, 3 cases (14. 3 %) of Candida spp., 1 case (4. 8 %) of Enterobacter and 1 case (4. 8 %) of Citrobacter.

40|$|Abstract <b>Urinary</b> <b>passage</b> {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most frequent diseases in both children and adult populations. The UPI (<b>Urinary</b> <b>Passage</b> Infection) diagnostics is based on clinical data obtained from the sick, i. e. on anamnestic data, clinical current problems and examination of urine and blood. When examining urine, it is possible to detect infection markers, which show evidence of an acute or chronic infection. To ensure correct interpretation, it is necessary to comply with the required methodologies in both pre-analytic and actual analytic phases. The objective of this bachelor thesis is to prove that within the studies and preparation of the bachelor thesis, I mastered the laboratory methodology of examination of UPI markers in urine. I processed the biological material both independently and under expert supervision. I worked in biochemical and microbiological laboratories, where I myself performed the examination or participated in the examinations of inflammatory markers on devices. Within the preparation of the bachelor thesis, I examined samples of urine from children as well as adults. Altogether I examined 120 samples of urine chemically, microscopically and microbiologically. During the chemical examination, I worked under the expert supervision of a laboratory worker and used the automatic spectrophotometer Clinitek Atlas. I examined osmolality with the use of an osmometer. To identify important bacteriuria, the transport set Uricult was used. The reading was performed in compliance with the enclosed manuals. I assessed the results of the examination after a consultation with a doctor, namely in the clinical-biochemical department of the hospital Nemocnice Jindřichův Hradec a. s., and interpreted them after a consultation with Prof. MUDr. Miloš Velemínský, CSc.

We investigated on the results of twelve operations for congenital hydronephrosis chiefly by evaluating the intravenous pyelograms taken pre- and post-operatively. The results were classified into 4 grades, from excellent to poor, according to the degree of cali ectasis and delay in ureteral visualization. Good results were obtatined in 7 of 12 cases (58. 3 %). In order to evaluate the results of the operations, ureteral visualization as well as the pyelogram and intrapelvic pressure study through nephrostomy tube must be considered.

40|$|Ureteric {{peristalsis}} transports a urinary bolus {{from the}} renal pelvis to the bladder. We developed an intraluminal catheter with a pressure transducer {{on it to}} study intraluminal pressure changes and a twin bipolar electrode to record the ureteric EMG and impedance (Z) changes during a peristaltic wave. Five female New Yorkshire pigs (50 - 60 kg) were studied under light halothane anesthesia (5 % at induction/ 1 % for maintenance). A steady state of hydration was maintained using intravenous saline infusion. EMG spike burst activity was studied at a 10 -cm interval using low (0 - 30) Hz filters. Impedance between the same electrodes is measured simultaneously in higher frequencies (1 - 5 KHz) {{as a function of}} ureteric motor activity. Pressure generation in the ureteric lumen was also measured simultaneously by a transducer on the same catheter. A digital signal processing program (Poly 4. 9) was used for analysis. Parenteral furosemide was used to induce diuresis. Resting ureteric impedance (Z(R)) decreases to Z(B) (Z bolus) during the <b>passage</b> of the <b>urinary</b> bolus. <b>Passage</b> of a contractile zone during a peristaltic wave increases impedance from Z(B) to its Z(R) level and initiates a pressure rise. Bolus length (the length Z(B)) is not constant and decreases distally. EMG corresponds well in time to impedance. Z(R) disappears after infusion of furosemide because of increased urine load and changes of intraluminal ionic environment.

Eight distinct phage clones that bound specifically to filament surface antigens not expressed on blastoconidia were identified. Single-chain antibody variable fragments (scFv) derived from two of these phage clones (scFv 5 and scFv 12) were characterized in detail. Filament-specific antigen expression was detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. ScFv 5 reacted with C. dubliniensis filaments, while scFv 12 did not. Neither scFv reacted with C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. rugosa, C. tropicalis, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown under conditions that stimulated filament formation in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. Epitope detection by the two scFv was sensitive to proteinase K treatment but not to periodate treatment, indicating that the cognate epitopes were composed of protein. The antigens reactive with scFv 5 and scFv 12 were extractable from the cell surface with Zymolyase, but not with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2 -mercaptoethanol, and migrated as polydisperse, high-molecular-weight bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels.

A similar tendency was also demonstrated in the group of castration, being 68. 5 % (13 out of 19). However, in the group treated with female sexual hormone, 100 per cent occurrence of tumor was demonstrated from the earlier period of the study and a decrease in the incidence was seen after 6 months, being 85 % (17 out of 20). 3. Histological findings. No specific histo l o gical finding depending upon the sexual hormones given was demonstrated, and the majority of them showed squamous epithelial type in generally. With administration of male sexual hormone, development of cellular foci of relatively large squamous epitheliar cells as well as frequent occurrence of papilloma were demonstrated. In the group given female sexual hormone, the tumors, which are larger than that of in the other groups, showed marked evidence of undifferentiation with severe infiltration and vigorously active proliferation.
