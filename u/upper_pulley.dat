50|$|One of Thomson's {{designs for}} the calculating part of a tide-predicting machine {{is shown in the}} figure (right), closely similar to the third machine of 1879-81. A long cord, with one end held fixed, passed {{vertically}} upwards and over a first <b>upper</b> <b>pulley,</b> then vertically downwards and under the next, and so on. These pulleys were all moved up and down by cranks, and each pulley took in or let out cord according to the direction in which it moved. These cranks were all moved by trains of wheels gearing into the wheels fixed on a drive shaft. The greatest number of teeth on any wheel was 802 engaging with another of 423. All the other wheels had comparatively small numbers of teeth. A flywheel of great inertia enabled the operator to turn the machine fast, without jerking the pulleys, and so to run off a year's curve in about twenty-five minutes. The machine shown in the figure was arranged for fifteen constituents in all.|$|E
50|$|Open Pool Feeding: When casting other metals, such as copper, zinc and lead, an {{open pool}} feeding system is often used. In this case, the <b>upper</b> belt <b>pulley</b> is offset {{downstream}} {{from the bottom}} pulley. Metal flows through an open trough or tundish into a standing pool of molten metal formed at the convergence of the belts. Shrouding gases may be employed to protect against oxidation.|$|R
50|$|The {{friction}} between the <b>upper</b> driving <b>pulley</b> and the cable was insufficient to move the cars when the cars were unbalanced, i.e. the upper car was empty and the lower car was fully loaded. If the situation was reversed and the upper car was fully loaded, the cable slipped round the wheel so that {{the speed of the}} cars could not be controlled by braking the pulley.|$|R

Analysis of safety requirements for linear tractive unit is also accomplished. Eligible construction concept of frame of electromechanical linear tractive unit is chosen. Selection and calculation of ball {{screw and nut}} is made also with draft of its eligible support. Choose of eligible engine and clutch for gearing of engine torque from engine to the ball screw is done too.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematical}} model of loaded block pulley trolley movement was developed based on Lagrange equation {{of the second}} genus. The differential equations of loaded trolley motion were given along with the relations for viscoelastic block pulley characteristics based on empirical observations. It was shown that the modeling block pulley dynamics could be substantially simplified by means of universal program complexes when considering the mass variation and the rope rigidity of block pulley negligible by changing its length. It was demonstrated that the loaded block pulley model could be geared as a subsystem for the computer dynamic model of lifting crane, when executing the axial force of <b>upper</b> block <b>pulley,</b> the movement of exit rope section and the rope tension force at this section by means of subsystem output parameters. The example of trolley motion start model was given for the simultaneous load lifting with at a constant speed {{with the use of}} three-mass model...|$|R
40|$|DE 3213983 A UPAB: 19930925 The pallet {{carrying}} carriages for a warehousing or {{stacking system}} has a frame housing a motor and transmission elements for its driving wheels, and a load supporting platform {{which can be}} raised and lowered. Interconnected with the transmission elements is a chain which travels around four pulleys rotating about vertical axes and around two pulleys mounted on front and rear spindles. The rear spindle is the axle for the rear wheels and the <b>upper</b> four <b>pulleys</b> are mounted on the platform. This enables the platform to move for a short distance {{in the opposite direction}} to the direction of travel, so that the platform is lifted. The platform has supports carrying rollers which travel along sloping surfaces on the base frame are the lifting action results from the movement of the rollers along these surfaces. The carriage has smaller wheels behind the main wheels, so that jolts are reduced where gaps in the track occur...|$|R
50|$|In {{testimony}} of that Romanesque precursor, the Eselsturm tower still {{stands on the}} north side of the cathedral; it was used in the past and is still used to transport construction materials to the <b>upper</b> levels. A <b>pulley</b> remains in the west loft, and with it materials were lifted through an opening in the ceiling near the west portal. To the east of the cathedral is the state-run Dombauhütte (cathedral building workshop) which is responsible for the preservation of the structure. In contrast with many cathedral building works, neither modern machines nor exclusively old tools are used. Rather, tools are manufactured in the workshop itself.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>pulleys</b> of a rear derailleur {{is known as the}} cage length. Cage length, when combined with the pulley size, determines the capacity of a derailleur to take up chain slack. Cage length determines the total capacity of the derailleur, that is the size difference between the largest and smallest chainrings, and the size difference between the largest and smallest sprockets on the cogset added together. A larger sum requires a longer cage length. Typical cross country mountain bikes with three front chainrings will use a long cage rear derailleur. A road bike with only two front chainrings and close ratio sprockets can operate with either a short or long cage derailleur, but will work better with a short cage.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{about the process of}} {{converting}} a petrol-fuelled Honda GX 35 engine to run on methane gas. The future goal is to use the engine in the engineering competition Shell Eco-marathon, where the aim is to drive a vehicle as far as possible with a set amount of fuel. To enable methane fuelling, the carburator of the GX 35 was replaced with a gas fuel injector from the engine accessory company Ecotrons. This was attached to an aluminium intake pipe constructed by the project group. A new flywheel was constructed, equipped with twelve magnetic detection points instead of one for more accurate detection of the crankshaft position. A magnet was also attached to the <b>upper</b> cam <b>pulley</b> to enable position detection. The original exhaust system was replaced by a holder of a lambda sensor and a straight exhaust pipe. Together with the engine control unit (ECU) KATLA, developed earlier for a bachelor’s thesis at Chalmers, this enabled detailed control of ignition and fuel injection, as well as measurement of the air-fuel ratio. In order to test the engine with a load, a brake device was constructed. A moped was acquired, whose gearbox and rear brake was used to brake and gear down the output shaft of the methane engine. The flywheel of the methane engine was connected to the flywheel of the moped through a vibration reducing rubber disc and a steel adapter. The rear wheel of the moped was lifted from the ground with a support so that it could rotate freely. By doing this, the load of the engine could be controlled with the rear brake pedal of the moped. Methane was not available for the project group, so the engine was tested with liquefied petroleum gas instead, which is another gaseous fuel. Before the engine was started, the flow rate through the gas injector was measured. This data was used to set the fuel parameters in the ECU. With some minor adjustments the engine ran well during testing...|$|R
