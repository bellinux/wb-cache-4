The theory supporting the method is presented and illustrated with a systematic study of misspecification due to item response function estimation error. In these studies, two joint maximum likelihood estimation methods (LOGIST 2 B and LOGIST 5) and two marginal maximum likelihood estimation methods (BILOG and ForScore) were contrasted by measuring the difference between a simulation model and a model obtained by applying an estimation method to simulation data. Marginal estimation was found generally to be superior to joint estimation. The parametric marginal method (BILOG) was superior to the nonparametric method only for three-parameter logistic models. The nonparametric marginal method (ForScore) excelled for more general models. Of the two joint maximum likelihood methods studied, LOGIST s appeared to be more accurate than LOGIST 2 B.
