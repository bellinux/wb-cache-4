40|$|The {{microgravity}} {{environment of}} spaceflight influences growth, morphology and metabolism in etiolated germinating soybean. To determine if clinorotation will similarly impact these processes, we conducted ground-based studies {{in conjunction with}} two space experiment opportunities. Soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) seeds were planted within BRIC (Biological Research In Canister) canisters and grown for seven days at 20 degrees C under clinorotation (1 rpm) conditions or in a stationary <b>upright</b> <b>mode.</b> Gas samples were taken daily and plants were harvested after seven days for measurement of growth and morphology. Compared to the stationary upright controls, plants exposed to clinorotation exhibited increased root length (125 % greater) and fresh weight (42 % greater), whereas shoot length and fresh weight decreased by 33 % and 16 % respectively. Plants grown under clinorotation produced twice as much ethylene as the stationary controls. Seedlings treated with triiodo benzoic acid (TIBA), an auxin transport inhibitor, under clinorotation produced 50 % less ethylene than the untreated control subjected to the same gravity treatment, whereas a treatment with 2, 4 -D increased ethylene by five-fold in the clinorotated plants. These data suggest that slow clinorotation influences biomass partitioning and ethylene production in etiolated soybean plants...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original {{design for a}} multimodal hopping robot. The robot harnesses passive stability to reduce {{the complexity of the}} control problem required to keep upright during the hopping motion. The nominal <b>mode</b> is an <b>upright</b> rover <b>mode,</b> which behaves as an inverted pendulum. When the rover encounters an obstacle, it changes modes. The wheels are gimballed perpendicular to the robot body, and spin up to generate a stabilizing gyroscopic reaction torque. In this mode, the robot behaves like a spinning top. The robot enters a passively stable regime of steady precession at a constant nutation angle. By triggering a hop at a chosen point in the precession, the robot can traverse obstacles larger than its wheel diameter. The paper also examines the theoretical underpinnings of the dynamic system in both the rover and top modes. Lagrange equations and Routh's method are used to obtain the equations of motion for the top mode. The stability of the steady precession is examined, and a control scheme for maintaining a constant rotor speed is found. The equations and controls for the rover mode are found via state space analysis. The design process and current mechanical system of a physical prototype are explained. The control scheme is implemented using a minimal set of sensors. The robot is controlled by a Texas Instruments microprocessor, which allows for untethered control. All systems are powered by an onboard battery pack, allowing the robot to function as a standalone syste...|$|R
40|$|Based on numerically {{accurate}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically {{investigate the}} ground-state {{structure and the}} spin and orbital magnetism including the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of 3 d- and 4 d-transition-metal dimer benzene complexes (TM 2 Bz, TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd; Bz = C 6 H 6). These systems are chosen to model TM-dimer adsorption on graphene or on graphite. We find that Fe 2, Co 2, Ni 2, and Ru 2 prefer the <b>upright</b> adsorption <b>mode</b> above {{the center of the}} benzene molecule, while Rh 2 and Pd 2 are adsorbed parallel to the benzene plane. The ground state of Co 2 Bz (with a dimer adsorption energy of about 1 eV) is well separated from other possible structures and spin states. In conjunction with similar results obtained by ab initio quantum chemical calculations, this implies that a stable Co 2 Bz complex with C 6 v symmetry is likely to exist. Chemical bonding to the carbon ring does not destroy the magnetic state and the characteristic level scheme of the cobalt dimer. Calculations including spin- orbit coupling show that the huge MAE of the free Co dimer is preserved in the Co 2 Bz structure. The MAE predicted for this structure is much larger than the MAE of other magnetic molecules known hitherto, making it an interesting candidate for high-density magnetic recording. Among all the other investigated complexes, only Ru 2 Bz shows a potential for strong-MAE applications, but it is not as stable as Co 2 Bz. The electronic structure of the complexes is analyzed and the magnitude of their MAE is explained by perturbation theory. Comment: 35 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{molecules}} adsorbed on inorganic substrates are {{the topics}} {{of interest in this}} thesis. Interfaces of this kind are found in dye sensitized solar cells that convert solar energy to electricity, a promising environmentally friendly energy source which might provide a route to replace fossil fuels. Another field where these interfaces play a role is in molecular electronics, an approach to solve the down scaling in the ever increasing hunt for miniaturized electronic devices. The motivation for this work lies among other in these applications and surface science is a suitable approach to investigate the electronic and morphologic properties of the interfaces as it provides detailed knowledge on an atomic level. Phthalocyanines are the organic molecules investigated and the inorganic substrates range from wide band gap via narrow band gap semiconductors to metals. Photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy experiments are performed to shed light on the electronic properties of the adsorbed molecules and the substrate, as well as the chemical interaction between adsorbate and substrate at the interface. The ordering of the adsorbate at the interface is important as ordered molecular thin films may have other properties than amorphous films due to the anisotropic electronic properties of the organic molecules; this is investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the phthalocyanines are affected by adsorption when the substrate is TiO 2 or Ag, where charge transfer from the molecule occurs or an interface state is formed respectively. The molecules are adsorbed flat on these surfaces giving a large contact area and a relatively strong bond. On Ag, ordered structures appear with different symmetry depending on initial coverage. The reactivity of the TiO 2 surface is not ideal in the solar cell application and by modifying the surface with a thin organic layer, the negative influence on the adsorbed phthalocyanine is reduced. ZnO is not as reactive as TiO 2, thanks maybe to the <b>upright</b> adsorption <b>mode</b> of the phthalocyanines. The semiconductor InSb is less reactive leading to self-assembled molecular structures on the (001) surface, either homogenously distributed in a one monolayer thick film or in strands along the reconstruction rows. InAs on the other hand has a larger influence on the adsorbed molecules resulting in a metallic film upon thermal treatment. QC 2010081...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} bring new {{insights}} into the processing of 3 D spatial information, we conducted experiments on the capacity of human subjects to memorize 3 D-structured environments, such as buildings with several floors or the potentially complex 3 D structure of an orbital space station. We had subjects move passively in one of two different exploration modes, through a visual virtual environment that consisted of a series of connected tunnels. In upright displacement, self-rotation when going around corners in the tunnels was limited to yaw rotations. For horizontal translations, subjects faced forward in the direction of motion. When moving up or down through vertical segments of the 3 D tunnels, however, subjects facing the tunnel wall, remaining upright as if moving up and down in a glass elevator. In the unconstrained displacement mode, subjects would appear to climb or dive face-forward when moving vertically; thus, in this mode subjects could experience visual flow consistent with rotations about any of the 3 canonical axes. In a previous experiment, subjects were asked to determine whether a static, outside view of a test tunnel corresponded or not to the tunnel through which they had just passed. Results showed that performance was better on this task for the upright than for the unconstrained displacement mode; i. e. when subjects remained "upright" with respect to the virtual environment as defined by subject's posture in the first segment. This effect suggests that gravity may provide a key reference frame used in the shift between egocentric and allocentric representations of the 3 D virtual world. To check whether it is the polarizing effects of gravity that leads to the favoring of the <b>upright</b> displacement <b>mode,</b> the experimental paradigm was adapted for orbital flight and performed by cosmonauts onboard the International Space Station. For these flight experiments the previous recognition task was replaced by a computerized reconstruction task, which proved to be more efficient in terms of the time required to achieve reliable results. Suppressing gravity did not immediately affect relative performance between the two modes, indicating that on-line graviceptor information is not directly responsible for this differential effect. Trends in the evolution of responses {{over the course of a}} 10 -day mission, however, suggest that human subjects might adapt their ability to represent internally complex 3 D displacements...|$|R
