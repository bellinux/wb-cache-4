40|$|A stable high {{temperature}} gold nano-catalyst: synthesis, characterization and application The ability of supported gold nanoparticles to catalyse many reactions even {{at very low}} temperatures has spurred {{a great deal of}} research into the eld. Reactions such as CO oxidation and NOx reduction have many industrial applications as well as uses in the motor industry for catalytic converters. The interest is both for scienti c as well as economic reasons as gold supplies far exceed all PGM supplies. Scienti cally gold catalysts are able to catalyze reactions from below 0 °C, a feat that no PGM catalyst can achieve. The low temperature activity of gold catalysts will reduce the emission of pollutants during start up. Since the discovery and development of gold catalysts one of the most researched topics has been nding ways to stabilise the gold nanoparticles on the support surface. The importance of gold nanoparticle stability is crucial as the catalysts are only highly active if the gold nanoparticles are less than 5 nm in size. A number of companies have worked to develop gold catalysts that are stable for long durations at temperatures over 450 °C with no signi cant progress made {{over the last two decades}} other than a catalyst produced by Toyota. In this thesis, literature reviews of current support materials as well as synthesis methods are investigated in order to determine reasons for the instability of current gold catalysts. Further, the Mintek Aurolite catalyst is tested and its deactivation mechanisms probed using in-situ VT-PXRD, Rietveld re nement, TEM, HR-TEM, as well as CO oxidation tests. Testing revealed aws in the support structure of the catalyst which resulted in dramatic deactivation. As titania is such a common support material for many reactions in industry as well as being known to be one of the best supports for gold it was chosen as a support material. However, as is revealed, in its current forms and morphologies it is unable to provide the thermodynamically stable and high <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> that are required for a stable catalyst After the development of a robust and reproducible synthesis method for the deposition of gold and other PGM's a number of supports were tested. These include silica and zirconia as well as titania derivatives such as Degussa P 25 and commercial anatase. Initially these supports o er high <b>usable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> but after a relatively small amount of time complete deactivation occurs. Reasons for this deactivation are determined and the information gained is used to develop supports that can combat these deactivation processes. Phase pure nano anatase is synthesised which produced a support with an incredibly large <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> compared to the aforementioned supports. The catalyst was able to withstand temperatures over 450 °C for longer durations compared to other catalysts exposed to the same conditions. However, the phase conversion of the anatase to its thermodynamically stable form rutile once again deactivated the catalyst with time. Finally a rutile nanosupport is developed with the desired morphology and thermodynamic stability needed for {{high temperature}} applications. The catalyst is able to withstand temperatures over 550 °C for more than 200 hours as well as still being active after exposure to 810 °C. The industrial Aurolite catalyst showed complete deactivation after just 12 hours at 500 °C. The catalyst produced in this thesis has been shown to be one of the most stable and thermally resistant gold catalysts in the world...|$|R
40|$|We {{believe that}} design is {{innovative}} only when based on scientific knowledge. The ideas behind so-called “artistic” design, often {{seem to come}} from nowhere, without real quality control over the design choices and results. In our opinion, this kind of design might be novel, but not better. Vice versa, scientifically-controlled design uses knowledge; the outcome is a design similar to research based {{on the evolution of}} knowledge itself. In this case, the creative process can lead to a better idea-solution compared to previous ones. To be innovative, the end result of this kind of design should prove it is both new and better, and this is possible only through effective quality control. This modus operandi leads us to Leonardo, a great artist, but also a scholar who studied nature scientifically. When designing, Leonardo didn’t rely only on experience, he searched for new knowledge, characterising his design work as research and experimentation. Adopting these principles means assuming the scientific evolution of nature, developed today using generative and non reproductive epigenesis and followed by experimentation involving quality control. Modern architecture provides numerous examples, one of which is the innovative wooden structure of the Scottish Parliamentary Assembly Hall by Miralles. The architect has merged different traditional structures, making the Hall a natural evolution of those structures. Application in education The evolutionary process activated during a workshop including hands-on experimentation will allow the students to think innovatively about architecture. This work, proposed in several of our courses, initially focuses on the basic techniques and data/knowledge required to experiment with this evolution. The problem (topic of the course) is analysed by studying typical and model solutions. The student chooses both a “mother” and “father” technique or solution to study how to become smart creators of “offspring” solutions, experimenting with every possible combination. This approach stops creative paralysis in students during {{the early stages of the}} course. As the “offspring” solutions are considered as alternatives to something which already exists (and should naturally evolve from them), the student gets used to working with the overall and details, above all using certain tools such as content maps and simulation models. This stage is crucial so that the details develop gradually and their effect on the overall project be evaluated. The student will learn to carry out detailed quality control on the overall project (e. g., energy consumption, natural lighting, <b>usable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>areas,</b> construction deadlines, costs, etc.) which will be assessed as the result of the evolution of the details. The student will continue to work to develop simple and routine solutions which will gradually become more complex. They will also tackle special projects with several preconditions (e. g., using one kind of material, like a creative cook forced to use just what’s in the fridge). These tests are carried out to improve general quality (e. g. increasingly small houses, buildings with more glass, flexible buildings, automatisms, etc.) using different tools already employed by professionals and which students have to learn to use creatively (e. g., Vensim system or other modelling tools). The study will focus on details, bringing the student into the realm of his chosen profession while the teacher emphasises the link between this work stage and the abstractions required to create real innovation. Conclusion In architecture we often speak of design research. We believe that by referring to Leonardo and his work method we can combine artistic creativity and scientific rigour in a design characterised by research and experimentation, in other words, by precise procedures to elaborate and use dependable knowledge to achieve innovative design, harbinger of real quality results...|$|R
50|$|St. Mark's Church is 62 {{meters long}} and 45 meters wide, and {{the height of}} the main cupola {{to the base of the}} cross is 60 meters. The <b>usable</b> {{interior}} <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the church is about 1,150 square meters, and the naos (nave) of the church can accommodate over 150 singers. It has already been said that more than seventy years after the beginning of its construction, St. Mark's Church has not been completed. This relates primarily to its interior, decorating, fresco painting, appropriate lighting, acoustics, heating and ventilation. After World War II little was done in the church itself for objective reasons. Above the entrance door to the church on the external façade is an icon in mosaic of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, the work of Veljko Stanojević in 1961. The floor in the church is from 1974, while the floor of the soleia (area in front of the iconostasis and the altar (sanctuary) was done in marble in 1991. The iconostasis of the church, designed by architect and professor Zoran Petrović, dates back to 1991-92 and was done in marble, while the icons in it are done in mosaic, the work of academic painter Đuro Radulović from Belgrade from 1996-98. The altar table is also in marble with smaller mosaics on the front side. To the right of the altar is a smaller altar dedicated to the Holy Despot Stefan Lazarević (d. 1427), and the altar on the north side is dedicated to the feast day of the Transfiguration of the Lord. As one enters the church on the right side along the south wall of the church is the marble tomb of Emperor Stefan Dušan (r. 1331-55) designed by Dr. Dragomir Tadić where his holy relics rest after being transferred from his endowment, Monastery of the Holy Archangels near Prizren, a monastery that has lain in ruins for centuries. On the opposite, north side the tomb of Serbian Patriarch German II (d. 1991) has been built in the same style and of the same material. In the middle of the church underneath the central cupola is apolielei done in copper according to the design of Dragomir Tadić in 1969, and executed by academic sculptor Dragutin Petrović.|$|R

40|$|Most market-garden {{farms that}} have {{converted}} to organic farming (OF) {{in the last}} few decades in France are small and diversified. Larger farms usually specialize in a few vegetable species and frequently face technical and economic problems when they convert to organics. Diversifying production may be a means of increasing sustainability due to larger crop rotations and varied marketing outlets, but it has various implications on farm management, especially labour organization and marketing. In the present study, we examined how an acceptable degree of species diversification can act as a lever to develop organic vegetable production by combining sociologist and agronomist points of view. Multidisciplinary surveys of 30 market-garden farms varying in <b>usable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and degrees of crop diversification were carried out. Consequences on crop management, labour organization and skills, and marketing implications were described, and farm sustainability was assessed. Specialized farms of the sample had a rather industrial organization of labour and marketing and benefited from economy of scale to produce vegetables. But in the long term, they may suffer from low agronomical sustainability because of narrow crop rotations and intensive crop management. Diversified farms were more sustainable according the criteria studied, but they suffered from the extremely complex management of cropping systems. These results are discussed on both the farm and territorial levels.
