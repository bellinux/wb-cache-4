This is important for vector network analyzer measurements in the THZ range where waveguide tolerances become large compared the wavelength and to cross sectional dimensions.

40|$|AbstractQuantum dot materials, {{in which}} Si QDs are {{embedded}} in a dielectric matrix, offer the potential to tune the effective band gap, through quantum confinement, and allow fabrication of optimised tandem solar cell devices in one growth run in a thin film process. Such cells can be fabricated by sputtering of thin layers of silicon rich oxide sandwiched between a stoichiometric oxide that on annealing crystallise to form Si QDs of uniform and controllable size. For approx. 2 nm diameter QDs these result in an effective band gap of 1. 8 eV. Introduction of phosphorous or boron during {{the growth of the}} multilayers results in doping and a rectifying junction, which demonstrates photovoltaic behaviour with an open-circuit voltage of almost 500 mV. However, the doping behaviour of P and B in these QD materials is not well understood. In addition P and B have large but opposite effects on QD crystallisation, with P (B) doped material forming larger (smaller) QDs than for undoped material. Alternative materials for quantum dots are Ge and Sn. These allow lower processing temperatures to be used, more compatible with underlying layers. Alternative matrices to SiO 2 such as SiNx or SiC offer higher tunnelling probability and hence lower resistance. These alternative matrix materials can also be used as hetero interlayers to improve the transport in the growth direction whilst maintaining quantum confinement.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine, in some detail, the {{thermally}} induced changes in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) wood with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopies. These techniques were also utilised to identify lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts from heat-treated and native wood samples. Furthermore, the molecular structures of the extractable compounds characteristic for Scots pine wood were comprehensively studied with UVRR spectroscopy. Spectroscopic data revealed that the structure of thermally treated wood was extensively modified at temperatures above 200  °C. These modifications included the depolymerisation and condensation of lignin, degradation of hemicelluloses as well as the removal and/or decomposition of the wood resin components. UVRR and FT-IR spectral data indicated that thermally modified wood treated at temperatures above 200  °C had increased durability against fungal attack and damage. The structure of lignin on the surface of thermally treated wood was less vulnerable to weathering than that of untreated wood. A diminished content of hemicelluloses contributed, at least partially, to the improved fungal and weather durability of heat-treated wood, as did the lower equilibrium moisture content and swelling. It is likely that the modified structure of lignin in the heat treated wood partially retarded UV light-induced degradation reactions of lignin during natural weathering. All unsaturated model compounds of wood resin were resonance enhanced by UV excitation. Spectra recorded from solid heartwood, knotwood, and branchwood samples included medium to strong Raman signals due to the unsaturated structures of wood resin. Moreover, characteristic bands for particular extractable compounds were observed in the UVRR spectra of the lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts and solid wood samples.

Several new antennas have been developed and assessed for their suitable application to RoF systems. The antennas were: (i) a multiband PIFA developed previously in the ROSETTE project and modified here to exhibit an improved match when integrated with a ground plane for ceiling mounting. (ii) A cost effective microstrip array directive antenna for street illumination in the Manhattan Scenario. Beam coverage was controlled by electronic shaping and mechanical tilting. (iii) A new compact PIFA design for use in mobile equipment or sectorized base stations where a slotted structure is used to achieve a sharp edge defined operating bandwidth which allows the antenna to act as a filter, thus reducing component count and insertion loss in the transceiver front end. The antenna has been integrated with a larger handset sized ground plane and its insensitivity to this mounting has been demonstrated. (iv) the antenna in (iii) has been implemented in a 3 sector cluster and interference between sector beams by pattern overlap has been characterized.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} self-assembly, surface {{interactions}} and electronic properties of functional molecules that have potential applications in electronics. Three classes of molecules - organic ferroelectric, spin-crossover complex, and molecules that assemble into a 2 D semiconductor, {{have been studied}} through scanning tunneling microscopy and surfacesensitive spectroscopic methods. The scientific goal of this thesis is to understand the self-assembly of these molecules in low-dimensional (2 D) configurations {{and the influence of}} substrate on their properties. First, a H-bonded organic ferroelectric, the 3 -Hydroxyphenalenone, is studied on two noble metal substrates. It is demonstrated how a variety of different assemblies including 1 D chains, p-p stacked structures and chiral network can be fabricated using the substrate as a growth parameter. Especially 1 D chains are interesting as they still exhibit the structural motif that is the origin of their ferroelectric behavior in bulk, namely the coupling between the H-bonds and the molecular p electron system. Second, the self-assembly of Fe(II) spin crossover complex is studied on Au(111) substrate. This organic complex can be reversibly switched between paramagnetic high-spin (S= 2) and diamagnetic low-spin state (S= 0) in the bulk. The magnetic and electronic properties of this complex were found to be drastically influenced by the substrate. Interestingly, the reversible spin-state transition is suppressed in the interfacial molecules, likely due to a conformational change these molecules experience when in contact with the substrate. Third, the 2 D boron containing semiconductors were synthesized by covalent linking of boron based precursor molecules. Two molecules, bis-BN cyclohexane and m-carborane- 9 -thiol are studied on Ir(111) and Au(111) substrates, respectively. In the first case, the covalent bonding between de-hydrogenated bis-BN cyclohexane rings {{led to the formation of}} a new 2 D B, C, and N containing material. This material is isostructural to graphene and h-BN, but with the <b>useful</b> <b>band</b> gap of 0. 9 eV. In the second case, the m-carborane monolayer films were synthesized on Au(111). A microscopic study of the effect of the electroninduced crosslinking of the carborane cages and the resulting change in the HOMO-LUMO gap is presented. The significance of this study is in the relation it establishes between the structure and properties of these molecular systems on metal substrates through basic surface science, which will potentially enable multi-functional organic electronics applications.

40|$|The {{fragmentation}} in Earth orbits and {{the major}} collision events between large spacecraft systems {{in addition to the}} poor housekeeping in space for more than five decades has generated millions pieces of orbital debris at different altitude above the Earth. Space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are now sufficiently dense that it threatens our space assets in this band by runaway collision cascading. The critical density in this band has now reached the point where collisions between debris are the most dominant debris-generating mechanism; the number of orbital junk in this band is increasing exponentially with actual and potential collision events. The average relative velocity between orbiting objects in LEO is very high, between 9 - 10 km/s, with maximum values around 14 km/s and the number of debris with a size range bigger than 1 cm in this band is large. Therefore, due to their hypervelocity and the massive number of debris, the space debris situation requires significant mitigating measures to protect our assets in space as the debris can cause deadly harm to both manned and unmanned space missions in orbit and produce more space junk, which renders this very <b>useful</b> <b>band</b> difficult to use. The length of time small debris stays in, for example, 1000 km altitude orbit before re-entering the atmosphere is of the order of 100 years. Therefore, reducing the altitude of the orbital debris will reduce its lifetime in orbit. Recent studies have suggested a proposed solution uses a repetitively pulsed ground based laser to target space debris using the laser beam to slow them slightly and lower their perigee, by the amount necessary, to cause them to re-enter the atmosphere where they will burn up. However, only very few studies have been done using this approach. In this paper, we discuss and assess the treatment of space debris and the engagement between the laser pulses and different shapes and sizes of debris. Beyond that, we believe that understanding the most common on-orbit debris materials will help the design of the laser beam system and give a more accurate picture of this debris clearing strategy. Using a pulsed laser to mitigate orbital debris is a most feasible and cost-effective method to clean up space without adding extra debris. No other solutions have been suggested to solve this debris dilemma without launching a new satellite, which without doubt would be costly and produce new debris itself...|$|E

Martian polar ice caps hold most of the exposed water on the surface on Mars and yet their history and physical processed involved in their formation are unclear. We will attempt to contribute to {{our knowledge of the}} composition and stratigraphy of the polar deposits. In this work we present the latest imaging data acquired by the Mars Odyssey THermal EMission Imaging System (THEMIS) and place it into context of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) data. THEMIS provides capabilities for imaging in both thermal IR and visible color wavelengths. These observations are affected by atmospheric scattering and topography. The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) and Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) instruments on board of the MGS spacecraft can provide context information for THEMIS data. Of particular interest are Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images, which provide high resolution data. We are primarily interested in the seasonal evolution of ice cap temperatures during the first northern summer of THEMIS observations. Morphology, stratigraphy and composition of the layered deposits can be addressed by THEMIS VIS color images, along with MOC high resolution data and MOLA Digital Elevation Models (DEM). This work is intentionally descriptive. Based on the knowledge obtained by the orbiting spacecraft and described here, we will attempt to expose major directions for modeling and further understanding of of the physical processes involved {{in the formation of the}} polar layered terrain 2 Available data 2. 1 THEMIS IR The THEMIS IR camera has 10 bands from 6 to 15 m.

40|$|A {{composite}} chiral metamaterial (CCMM) {{is designed}} and studied both numerically and experimentally. The CCMM is {{constructed by the}} combination of a continuous metallic wires structure and a purely chiral metamaterial (CMM) that consists of conjugated Rosettes. For the CMM, only very small, <b>useful</b> <b>bands</b> of negative index can be obtained for circularly polarized waves. These bands are all above the chiral resonance frequencies because of the high value of the effective parameter of relative permittivity å. After the addition of the continuous metallic wires, which provide negative permittivity, the high value of å can be partially compensated. Thus, a negative index band for the left circularly polarized wave that is below the chiral resonance frequency is obtained for the CCMM. At the same time, a negative index band for the right circularly polarized wave that is above the chiral resonance frequency is also obtained. Furthermore, both negative index bands correspond to the transmission peaks and have high values of the figure of merit. Therefore, the CCMM design that is proposed here is more suitable than the CMM for the construction of chiral metamaterials with a negative index. © 2012 Optical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the results from}} {{simulations}} of a tandem intermediate band solar cell are presented and discussed. Renewable energy sources have become increasingly important, because of global environmental concerns. To make the solar cell technology more viable as an energy source, the study of how to increase the solar cell efficiency is important. The intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) has been introduced as a cell with potential to enhance {{the efficiency of the}} conventional single-junction cell. IBSCs have limiting efficiencies of 63. 3 %. This limit can be further increased by combining two different IBSCs in a tandem cell or combining an IBSC with a conventional single-junction cell. The principle of detailed balance is used to find the limiting efficiencies for possible band gap combinations. Similar analysis of the intermediate band tandem cell has been done previously for black-body radiation. In this thesis the reference AM 1. 5 spectra have been used, and concentration levels of 1, 100 and 1000 suns. During the work, a model of the intermediate band solar cell, single-junction cell and the complete tandem cell have been coded in Matlab. The tandem intermediate band solar cell will have six different band gaps and is hence comparable with a six single-junction tandem cell. Tandem cells with combinations of a single-junction cell and an intermediate band solar cell, having in total four different band gaps, have also been simulated. In addition to a higher maximum efficiency, the tandem IBSCs are found to have large ranges of <b>useful</b> <b>band</b> gap energies. Semiconductor materials not considered for the single-junction cell or the single intermediate band cells are viable for making tandem IBSCs. The main results in this thesis conclude that the four terminal tandem IBSC has a maximum efficiency of 54. 93 % for 1 sun, 62. 74 % for 100 suns, and 67. 23 % for 1000 suns. These maximum efficiencies are about 11 % higher than that of a single IBSC under the same conditions. The maximum efficiencies for the other tandem cells are all higher than that of a single IBSC, with an increase from 1. 50 % to 9. 05 %. A wide range of main band gap combinations for the four terminal tandem cells give high efficiencies, but the range is strongly reduced for the two terminal tandem cell. For variations in the band gaps away from their optimal values, the efficiency is affected mostly by variation of the sub-band gap of the top IBSC...|$|E
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand for bandwidth, {{led to the}} introduction of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) as one technique to increase capacity in the optical fibre networks. Initially 100 GHz was set as the standard channel separation by the ITU, but this spacing is due to capacity constraints, already being reduced to 50 GHz to accommodate extra data-traffic. Even 25 GHz channel separations are currently being discussed and may very well become the trend of the future on the moderate bit-rate of 10 Gbit/s, as an alternative to faster bit-rates whilst faster electronics is maturing. This trend therefore calls for filters that can perform filtering duties, that on top of a solid functionality, also act as passive ultra-selective filters that can maintain channel integrity at any cost. The technology of Fibre Bragg gratings {{has come a long way}} since the initial demonstrations in 1978 by Hill et al. at the CRC in Canada. Bragg gratings and in particular apodised Bragg gratings has previously been shown to exhibit near ideal characteristics for compact and high filling factor values on grid spacings as small as 25 GHz [1]. However, it has also been discussed how these filters, despite their near ideal spectral performance, suffer from non-linear phase attributes in the stop-band, that could limit their use in high bit-rate systems (10 Gbit/s and above) [2]. Linear-phase filters therefore have been proposed as a solution to this problem, but some previous demonstrations have suffered from low rejection values [2]. In this talk we show linear-phase (dispersion-less) Bragg grating square-filters for 25 GHz and 50 GHz channel separations that exhibit grid filling-factor values of 75 % and constant reflectivities in excess of 99. 9 % (> 30 dB transmission loss) over the full drop window. The linear phase and square spectral performance of the gratings are obtained by imposing a slowly varying envelope function (superstructure) (Fig. 1) on the rapidly varying refractive index modulation forming the Bragg grating. This envelope function is generated using apodisation and is imposed during writing using a grating manufacturing technique where full control of all vital grating parameters is available. A recently developed inverse scattering algorithm is used for the design of the envelope function [3]. The manufactured filters are tested at 10 Gbit/s NRZ and show that < 10 ^- 11 bit-error-rate (BER) is obtained for constant received power throughout the <b>useful</b> <b>band</b> (Fig. 2). Additionally, we will discuss the importance of these filters for dispersion-free filtering at high bit-rates, by comparing their performance with "traditionally" apodised Bragg grating filters. It will be demonstrated how this new family of gratings out-performs the standard apodised Bragg gratings for their linear-phase characteristics and that they allow for tuning and drift of the transmitter over the full bandwidth of the grating without being affected by dispersion at any point in the stopband...|$|E

The impact of growth rate of city size on topographic and geomorphologic units will be complicated, by increasing of urban expansion. Orientation of physical expansion in terms of effective factors must be {{in a way that}} less damages imposes on natural environment and can be preserved environment in a direction of preservation of sustainable Development. Changes in the earth’s surface can be related to natural dynamics or human activities and can occur either suddenly or gradually. Accelerated urban growth is usually associated with and driven by the population concentration in an area. The extent of urbanization or its growth drives the change in land use/cover pattern. Land use and land cover changes may have adverse impacts on ecology of the area, specially hydro-geomorphology and vegetation. As the characteristics of land cover have important impacts on climate, biogeochemistry, hydrology and species diversity, land cover change has been indicated as one of the high priority concerns for research and for the development of strategies for sustainable management. Although urban areas currently cover only 3 % of the Earth’s land surface, they have marked effects on environmental conditions at both local and global scales, including climate change. 2 - MethodologyRecently, remote sensing has been used in combination with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems to assess land cover change more effectively than by remote sensing data only. This paper presents an integrated study of land use/cover changes and urban expansion in Shiraz city, Fars province in Iran. The study explores the temporal and spatial characteristics of urban expansion and land use/cover changes from 1990 to 2009. Statistical classification approaches have been used for the classification of the remotely sensed images obtained from various sensors viz. Landsat TM, ETM+ and IRS PAN, LISS-III. 3 – DiscussionLand use/land cover changes (LUCC) are major cause of ecological environmental changes. Geometric correction was performed on all the images. At least 17 ground control points (GCPs) were used to register the images UTM zone 39. GCPs were dispersed throughout the scene, yielding a RMS error was around 0. 2 pixels. Geospatial data including municipal boundaries, road networks, geomorphic units and elevation units (DEM) were used to produce GIS layers by ArcGIS 9. 3. The most <b>useful</b> <b>band</b> combinations in Landsat for discrimination of land cover categories are bands 4 - 5 - 3, 4 - 3 - 2, and 3 - 2 - 1 assigned as red, green, and blue, respectively. All satellite data were studied using spectral and spatial profiles to ascertain the digital numbers (DNs) of different LULC categories prior to classification. Finally, classification has been done using the Knowledge Classifier Module of ERDAS. 4 – ConclusionFinally classification, five land cover categories exist in this area: (a) urban or built-up land; (b) agriculture; (c) water, (d) orchard, and (e) bare land. Results indicate that cropland, water, and orchard areas reduced by 37. 8 %, 5. 8 %and 45. 7 % continuously over the past 19 years, while built-up area increased by 37 %, respectively. The built-up area increased at the cost of decreased cropland, water and orchard. Lastly, the major factors influencing urban expansion and land use/cover change are also discussed. In general, the population, traffic conditions, industrialization, and policy are the major factors that influenced the urban expansion.

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} {{systems are}} prone to severe degradation in noisy environments due to mismatch between training and testing conditions. A multi-stream approach for keyword spotting is proposed to improve robustness in mismatched conditions. The assumption is that most real world noises are colored and do not affect the full spectrum equally, meaning {{certain parts of the}} spectrum can still provide reliable information characterizing the utterance. In the proposed method for keyword spotting, the full frequency band is split into several sub-bands, each of which contain both static and delta parameters. Robustness is achieved using only features from sub-bands with highest signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) during recognition, while ignoring sub-bands that are strongly affected by noise. The problem is how to correctly select and combine the <b>useful</b> <b>bands</b> for accurate recognition, without prior knowledge of the noise characteristics. In this paper we propose a new likelihood ratio, used both to select usable bands and provide a confidence measure for robust keyword spotting. Tests carried out using the TiDigits database show a significant improvement in keyword spotting performance compared to a product based approach. In addition, including a non-keyword test set from Resource Management results in a reduction of Equal Error Rate...|$|R

This {{can be distinguished}} from undeuterated ethylene {{by the use of}} Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Characteristic bands in the region from 800 to 3, 500 cm- 1 can be used to identify and quantitate levels of these products. This technique is applicable to field studies of nitrogen fixation where ethylene biosynthesis by plants or bacteria is occurring. We have verified the reaction stoichiometry by using Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bradyrhizobium japonicum in soybeans. The most <b>useful</b> <b>bands</b> for quantitation of substrate purity and product distribution are as follows: acetylene-d 0, 3, 374 cm- 1; acetylene-d 1, 2, 584 cm- 1; acetylene-d 2, 2, 439 cm- 1; cis-ethylene-d 2, 843 cm- 1; trans-ethylene-d 2, 988 cm- 1; ethylene-d 1, 943 cm- 1; ethylene-d 0, 949 cm- 1. (The various deuterated ethylenes and acetylenes are designated by a lowercase d and subscript to indicate the number, but not the position, of deuterium atoms in the molecule.) Mass spectrometry coupled to a gas chromatograph system has been used to assist in quantitation of the substrate and product distributions. Significant amounts of trans-ethylene-d 2 were produced by both wild-type and nifV mutant K. pneumoniae. Less of this product was observed with the soybean system...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. A {{composite}} chiral metamaterial (CCMM) is designed and studied both numerically and experimentally. The CCMM is {{constructed by the}} combination of a continuous metallic wires structure and a purely chiral metamaterial (CMM) that consists of conjugated Rosettes. For the CMM, only very small, <b>useful</b> <b>bands</b> of negative index can be obtained for circularly polarized waves. These bands are all above the chiral resonance frequencies because of the high value of the effective parameter of relative permittivity epsilon. After the addition of the continuous metallic wires, which provide negative permittivity, the high value of epsilon can be partially compensated. Thus, a negative index band for the left circularly polarized wave that is below the chiral resonance frequency is obtained for the CCMM. At the same time, a negative index band for the right circularly polarized wave that is above the chiral resonance frequency is also obtained. Furthermore, both negative index bands correspond to the transmission peaks and have high values of the figure of merit. Therefore, the CCMM design that is proposed here is more suitable than the CMM for the construction of chiral metamaterials with a negative index. (C) 2012 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} {{of synthetic}} hydroxyapatite {{have been examined}} by orientational micro-Raman spectroscopy. The observed Raman bands include the PO 43 -/OH- internal and external. modes over the spectral range from 180 to 3600 cm(- 1). The Raman-active symmetry tensors (A, E(1), and E(2)) of crystal-class C- 6 have been assigned to these bands. Intensities of the Raman bands are invariant to {{the orientation of the}} a- or b-axis of a single crystal, but depend solely on the c-axis orientation. Changes in the spectral profile thus reflect changes in the c-axis orientation, which, with respect to the known excitation/observation coordinates, can be determined through the angular dependencies of Raman bands due to A and E(2) symmetries. The <b>useful</b> <b>bands</b> are those of the PO 43 - v(4) vibrational mode, which contains relatively well-defined bands due to E(2) (581 cm(- 1)) and A (593 cm(- 1)) symmetries. A preliminary Raman study on crystallites near the intact outer surface of human enamel has also been carried out. Strong orientational dependencies similar to those of hydroxyapatite single crystals have been observed among the bands in enamel spectra. This suggests that the crystallites in the region investigated are highly oriented. The results were consistent with an averaged orientation of the crystallite c-axis being perpendicular to the outer surface...|$|R
