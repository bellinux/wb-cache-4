25|$|The accident, at 10:01a.m. Singapore Standard Time (02:01 UTC), {{was caused}} by an <b>uncontained</b> <b>failure</b> of the port inboard (No.2) engine, while en route over Batam Island, Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 {{flying from}} London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an <b>uncontained</b> <b>failure</b> in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure {{was found to}} have been caused by a {{misaligned}} counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|E
500|$|On October 28, 2016, American Airlines Flight 383, a 767-300ER with 161 {{passengers}} and 9 crew members, aborted takeoff at Chicago O'Hare Airport following an <b>uncontained</b> <b>failure</b> {{of the right}} GE CF6-80C2 engine. The engine failure, which hurled fragments over a considerable distance, caused a fuel leak resulting in a fire under the right wing. Fire and smoke entered the cabin. All {{passengers and}} crew evacuated the aircraft, with 20 passengers and one flight attendant sustaining minor injuries using the evacuation slides.|$|E

50|$|The {{containment}} requirement {{and testing}} requirement were imposed after {{review of the}} history of <b>uncontained</b> engine <b>failures</b> which caused serious damage to aircraft. The rule did not apply to engines which were already in service, and an <b>uncontained</b> engine <b>failure</b> of the Number 2 (tail) General Electric CF6 engine of United Airlines Flight 232 on July 19, 1989, caused the hydraulic failure and crash landing of that aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2010, The NTSB {{warned that}} the {{low-pressure}} turbine rotor disks could fail. Four <b>uncontained</b> <b>failures</b> of CF6-45/50 engines in the preceding two years prompted it to issue an [...] "urgent" [...] recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on U.S. aircraft : none of the four incidents of rotor disk imbalance and subsequent failure resulted in an accident, but parts of the engine did penetrate the engine housing in each case ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the cause of the accident was a fatigue fracture leading to the <b>uncontained</b> <b>failure</b> of the 2nd stage disk of the low-pressure compressor of engine number four. [...] This resulted in an in-flight fire and damage to adjacent areas of the right wing and flaps to the extent that flight could not be sustained. The fatigue fracture formed due to the operation of the engine beyond its manufacturer’s assigned lifespan without assessment and lifespan enhancement by the manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014 {{there was}} an <b>uncontained</b> <b>failure</b> [...] of a fan rotor while the {{aircraft}} was preparing for take-off. The parts passed through a fuel tank and caused a fire, grounding the F-35 fleet. During high g-force maneuvering three weeks before flight, there was excessive rubbing at the seal between the fan blisk and the fan stator causing the failure. The engine [...] "flex" [...] generated a temperature of over 1,000°C (1,900°F) in materials designed to fail at 540°C (1,000°F). Micro cracks appeared in third-stage fan blades, according to program manager Christopher Bogdan, causing blades to separate from the disk. The failed blades punctured the fuel cell and hot air mixing with jet fuel caused the fire. As a short term fix, each aircraft is flown on a specific flight profile to allow the rotor seal to wear a mating groove in the stator to prevent excessive rubbing.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning {{had several}} {{distinctive}} design features, {{the principal of}} these being the twin engine arrangement, notched delta wing, and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimizing frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the drag equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin engine installations. The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. However, because the engines were close together, an <b>uncontained</b> <b>failure</b> of one engine was likely to damage the other engine. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance; although this was rarely done operationally because {{there would be no}} hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed [...]|$|E
40|$|Rare {{anomalies}} may {{be introduced}} during the metallurgical or manufacturing processes {{that may lead}} to <b>uncontained</b> <b>failures</b> of aircraft gas turbine engines. The risk of fracture associated with these anomalies can be quantified using a probabilistic fracture mechanics approach. In this paper, a general probabilistic framework is presented for risk assessment of gas turbine engine components subjected to either inherent or induced material anomalies. A summary of efficient computational methods that are applicable to this problem is also provided...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} thrust in NASA s {{space exploration}} vision {{is to improve}} the safety and reliability of future launch vehicles. A quantitative reliability model is an essential technical tool to evaluate launch vehicle reliability and to enhance launch vehicle configuration down selection and detailed designs. A quantitative reliability model that supports NASA's thrust has been developed and implemented in an MS Excel spreadsheet. The model addresses key reliability parameters, and provides for sensitivity analysis of various vehicle designs. This paper presents the specific elements of the model and examples of selected sensitivity analysis results. Reliability input parameters in the model include the following: 1. Main propulsion element failure probability; 2. Propulsion element catastrophic failure fraction (Cf). This is defined as the ratio of probability of <b>uncontained</b> <b>failures</b> over sum of probability of <b>uncontained</b> <b>failures</b> and contained failures); 3. Engine-out design vs. no-engine-out design; 4. Engine with redlines vs. no redlines; 5. Different levels of health management system implementation; 6. Launch Escape System (LES) reliability; and 7. Power level correlation with reliability. The sensitivity results will illustrate the impact of each of the above parameters on several reliability metrics: Loss of Mission (LOM), LOV (Loss of Vehicle) and Loss of Crew (LOC) ...|$|R

5000|$|On 4 November 2010, a Trent 900 {{experienced}} an <b>uncontained</b> <b>failure</b> on Qantas Flight 32 over Singapore. After investigation, Rolls-Royce announced {{the problem was}} specific to the Trent 900, and in particular unrelated to failure of a Trent 1000 under test.

50|$|Investigators {{examined}} engine {{debris from}} the wreckage, transporting both of the airplane's engines and their principal accessories to Brussels for examination at a specialized SNECMA laboratory. There they were torn down, showing no evidence of <b>uncontained</b> <b>failures</b> and no indication of fire. However, the rotating parts of the cold section of both engines showed deformations, significant on the right engine, less so on the left engine. This means {{that at the moment}} of impact with the ground, the left was rotating at a lower rpm, developing less thrust. The hot section of the left engine also had damaged components, corresponding to those found on the runway.|$|R
