[...] When he woke <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> the entire composition was written in 20 minutes.|$|E

[...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E

What would happen if the women had all the power and all the advantage, and the men had what the women normally would have?” ...|$|E
500|$|Cuomo {{was embarrassed}} by Pinkerton's {{reception}} and the confessional {{nature of its}} songs. In August 1997, he wrote: [...] "This has been a tough year.

[...] In 2001, he told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's a hideous record... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won't go away.

[...] He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: [...] "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire."

60|$|We were <b>up</b> early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as {{we wanted}} to be in Oxford by the afternoon. It is {{surprising}} how early one can get up, when camping out. One does not yearn for “just another five minutes” nearly so much, lying wrapped up in a rug on the boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag for a pillow, as one does in a featherbed. We had finished breakfast, and were through Clifton Lock by half-past eight.|$|R
