One such difficulty is that mechanical treatments of jamming focus on pressure, force, stress, and strain, which are identically zero below jamming, {{making it hard to}} differentiate systems whcih which are near or far from the transition. Instead, I introduce a geometric framework based on the Voronoi tesselation which treats all of phase space on an equal footing. This work will show that the jamming transition can be seen entirely through the geometry of the local environment of particles encoded in the Voronoi tesselation, and it will build the framework for an as yet <b>undefined</b> <b>field</b> theory for jamming...|$|E
30|$|A tuple space {{can be seen}} as {{a shared}} memory object that allows {{distributed}} processes to interact [4]. In this space, generic data structures called tuples can be inserted, read, and removed. A tuple t in which all fields have a defined value is called an entry. A tuple with one or more undefined fields is called a template (usually denoted by a bar, e.g., t). A tuple space can only store entries, never templates. Templates are used to allow content-addressable access to tuples in the tuple space. An entry t and a template tmatch if they have the same number of fields and all defined field values of t are equal to the corresponding field values of t. For example, template 〈JISA-Journal, 2011,∗〉 matches any tuple with three fields in which JISA-Journal and 2011 are the values of the first and second fields, respectively (the wild-card (“*”), represents a <b>undefined</b> <b>field).</b>|$|E

30|$|Notice that, {{according}} to the fingerprint definitions, searches are possible only in public and comparable fields, i.e., private fields cannot be used to verify if a tuple matches a template and are always used as <b>undefined</b> <b>fields</b> on the template. This limitation brings at least two consequences. On the one hand, a tuple with many private fields makes the search very restricted, losing the flexibility {{in the development of}} applications because a template with many <b>undefined</b> <b>fields</b> does not allow a fine-grained match at the servers. On the other hand, a tuple with many public and/or comparable fields is susceptible to many attacks, like correlation and preimage attacks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. JavaScript {{ranks among}} the most popular {{programming}} languages for the web, yet its highly dynamic type system and occasionally unintuitive semantics make programming particularly error-prone. This paper presents Javanni, a verifier for JavaScript programs that can statically detect many common programming errors. Javanni checks the absence of standard type-related errors (such as accessing <b>undefined</b> <b>fields)</b> without requiring user-written annotations, and it can also verify full functional-correctness specifications. Several experiments with JavaScript applications reported in the paper demonstrate that Javanni is flexibly usable on programs with non-trivial specifications. Javanni is available online within the CloudStudio web integrated environment. ...|$|R
30|$|Conceptually, a tuple space {{can be seen}} as {{a shared}} memory object that {{provides}} operations to store and to retrieve ordered data sets, called tuples. Processes in a distributed system can then interact through this shared memory abstraction. A tuple is an ordered sequence of fields, where a field that contains a value is said to be defined. A tuple t where all the fields are defined is called entry (or tuple). A tuple t is called template if any of its fields does not have a defined value. A tuple t and a template t combine (or match) if, and only if, both has the same numbers of fields and all the values and types of the defined fields in t are identical to the values and types of the corresponding fields in t. For example, a tuple 〈JISA, 2017,SBC〉 combines/matches with the template 〈JISA,∗,∗〉 (’ ∗’ denotes a <b>undefined</b> <b>field,</b> called wildcard).|$|E
40|$|The {{systemic}} {{origins of}} many accidents {{have led to}} heightened interest {{in the way in}} which organisations identify and manage risks within the airline industry. The activities which are thought to represent the term "organisational accident", "safety culture" and "proactive approach" are documented and seek to explain the fact that airlines differ in their willingness and ability to conduct safety management. However, an important but yet relatively undefined task in the airline industry is to conceptualise the safety mechanism in proactive safety, and its influential factors. What is required is a model of a proactive safety mechanism which builds upon existing knowledge of what is thought to contribute to safety by adding an increased knowledge of the organisational factors. These factors not only serve to influence the safety mechanism, but also serve to be the predictors of the performance of safety management system. This thesis aims to fill that gap. It firstly conducts an overview of the current airline safety management system literature and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the current system. Given the need to explore the important but <b>undefined</b> <b>field,</b> a proactive safety mechanism model is then developed and tested to identify the organisational factors which exert an influence upon the safety mechanism. Four hypotheses were set out to be tested in an attempt to justify the multi-dimensional and complex nature of the safety mechanism model. The model is then tested by applying it to a past accident (case study) and a survey of opinions with questionnaire. The results of this research work show that the safety mechanism model is a model of the evolution of safety management system in the context of proactive safety management. Further study can apply the proposed model to the re-organisation of an airline safety management system and evaluate the impact upon the company's system. It leads to the suggestion that an airline's safety health and performance needs the co-ordination of both retroactive and proactive safety management, and concludes that the ultimate contribution of this research is to provide airlines with reliable data, applicable references and a practicable methodology to enable their safety management system to evolve at a fundamentally "genetic" level.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the study is {{situated}} in a context of psychological personality research and medical training and thus falls into an <b>undefined</b> <b>field</b> between psychology, medicine and educational science. Personality structures, social support systems and the attitudes of medical students towards their curricula at the Charité in Berlin have all been examined. The objective {{of the study is}} it to shed light on the fundamental requirements placed on students in the form of personality profiles, which could have a bearing on the choice of curriculum, and, based on the curriculum, to examine the development of student personalities during their course of studies. The period under examination extends over three years {{from the start of the}} studies to the midway point. This examination was completed in the context of a project on socio-economic status, dispositions and learning habits of medical students at the Charité. First semester doctoral students completed the survey during the winter semester 2001 / 2002. A random sample covered 155 students from the re-formed and regular curriculum tracks in medicine. Participants completed a questionnaire at two predetermined times (T 1 &# 8211; three weeks after the official start of studies [November 2001] and T 2 &# 8211; during the sixth semester [April to May 2004]). The results of the examination could not confirm the selection hypothesis. Students of both medical curricula do not differ in their personality profiles. However, significant differences in the evaluation of the curriculum came to light. Both at the start of the studies and at the midway point, students of the reformed curriculum experienced more support and less pressure than their colleagues in the regular curriculum, even though contrary developments are also suggested for both groups. A correlation with increased personal resources could not be verified. However, the students&# 8217; social re-sources seemed to suffer &# 8211; which could mainly be a result of the medical degree per se than of the specific curriculum. The medical degree per se, even though it represents the desired course of study for most, carries an enormous stress load for many students. The evaluation of pilot or reform projects that are currently underway is not only important for quality control. As a &# 8220;means of reflection&# 8221;, such an evaluation also offers the opportunity to recognize deficits, understand criticism as an incentive for positive change and search for implementation possibilities and solutions. Given the current background of reform efforts in the field of medical training, this work, as an initial evaluation study in Germany, could contribute fundamental insights on the personality development of medical students. In light of the diverse range of requirements and expectations placed on doctors, the student personality carries particular importance in a discussion on the professionalization of medical training: doctors must be capable of critically reflecting on their actions (Engel, 1997). Furthermore, they are required to develop values and attitudes concerning their various roles, e. g. as physicians, as teachers, as colleagues or also as directors. Moreover, they must be able to recognize their personal and &# 8220;professional&# 8221; limits (General Medical Council, 2003). It remains to be seen whether and to what extent the medical training reforms, introduced under the 9 th Amendment of the Medical Licensure Act, will live up to the requirements and expectations placed on physicians. Further long-term studies covering the complete course of study are recommended; in an ideal case scenario, these would provide base data for nationally comparative evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Poetry Quotations in Swedish {{early modern}} {{academic}} Dissertations (Antika poesicitat i tidig­moderna svenska dissertationer) Academic texts from the 17 th and 18 th centuries often contain quotations of poetry, {{the great majority}} from the classical antiquity. Even if this is well known, {{it appears to be}} little studied. This paper accounts for a study of the presence and function of such quotations in academic dissertations from Uppsala University 1625 – 1850. The study includes a survey {{of the extent to which}} poetry is quoted in the dissertations in various subjects and periods between the years 1625 – 1850. Further the study explores which poets are most quoted in the material and what arguments poetry quotations usually support. The survey shows that among the periods stud­ied poetry is quoted most frequently in period 2 (1685 – 1710), whereas it is hardly quoted at all in the following period 3 (1760 – 1785). The paper discusses reasons for the "rise and fall" of the poetry quotation and makes comparisons to other tendencies in academic writing, changes in the academic milieu and changes in poetics with regard to what should be consid­ered the right use and purpose of poetry, in society and in university education. The use of the poetry in period 2 for argumentative purposes corresponds roughly to the poetical theory of the time. Solely decorative purposes appear to be rare, while poetry appears generally to have been quoted in its capacity of being specialist literature in various disciplines. Alongside the disciplines studied here, medicine and political science, poetry quotations represented fields of knowledge such as history, ethics and philosophy, as well as in then <b>undefined</b> <b>fields</b> such as psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology and ethnology...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Technological {{advances}} {{are changing}} the way that advanced air traffic control automation should be developed and assessed. Current standards and practices of system development place field testing {{at the end of}} the development process, during system production and deployment. This delays our understanding of the true characteristics of the system; that is, its emergent properties as a consequence of implementation in the operational environment, how the tool is used and the myriad interactions and interdependencies between system components. While such practices may have been suitable for manual control systems, where requirements for hardware and personnel can be neatly separated and defined, they are becoming quickly outdated for systems that are harnessing advanced information technology. Current understanding of such systems is limited and criteria for safe and effective system performance are largely <b>undefined.</b> If <b>field</b> testing is delayed until the late stages of dev...|$|R
40|$|High power diode lasers {{have become}} an {{established}} source for numerous direct applications like metal hardening and polymer welding due to their high efficiency, small size, low cost and high reliability. These laser sources are also used for efficient pumping of solid state lasers as Nd:YAG lasers. To increase the output power of diode lasers up to several kilowatts, the emitters are scaled laterally by forming a diode laser bar and vertically by forming a diode laser stack. For most applications like hardening and illumination, though, the <b>undefined</b> far <b>field</b> distribution of most commercially available high power diode laser stacks states a major drawback of these devices. As single emitters and bars can fail during their lifetime, the near field distribution does not remain constant. To overcome these problems, the intensity distribution can be homogenized by a waveguide or by microoptic devices. The waveguide segments the far field distribution by several total internal reflections, and these segments are overlaid at the waveguide's exit surface. By the microoptic device, the near field is divided into beamlets which are overlaid by a field lens. Both approaches are presented, and realized systems are described...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEd (Curriculum Studies) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Culinary {{studies is}} a {{relatively}} young and unfamiliar field of study which engages the application of life and natural sciences, business and technology in a food-specific environment. The growth in the demand for training, re-training and continuing professional development in the culinary arts {{can be attributed to}} factors such as enhanced culinary programmes at high school level, an increased level of education and expectation about food in general, growth in culinary tourism and highly polished food magazines or other publications. The celebrity status of high-profile chefs and a stronger economy that enables more people to explore fine dining and gourmet food can be added to the list of factors that influence the interest in culinary arts as a profession. The number of qualified culinary professionals has increased over the last 10 years in South Africa, providing a large corps of people with a good understanding of this field of study and a need for continuing professional development opportunities. This study was a response to the challenges of the demand for continuing professional development opportunities from this growing body of culinary professionals. The demand for continuing professional development opportunities in culinary studies is becoming more complex and challenging for both learner and teacher. Although institutions that provide training in hospitality are also in the business of culinary education, their perspectives and focus are quite diverse. Culinary education can therefore be improved through {{a deeper understanding of the}} curriculum development process combined with the expectations of both the industry and the individual. A fundamental shortcoming in the field of culinary education is often that persons with limited expertise in the field of curriculum studies bear the primary responsibility for addressing curriculum challenges. The development of curricula for professional development in culinary studies subsequently happens at the expense of understanding the curriculum. The primary aim therefore of this study was to identify and propose a curriculum framework for continuing professional development in culinary arts. This framework might contribute to providing a curriculum foundation, credibility to the broad hospitality industry and specifically to culinary studies, as well as to the securing of some uniformity of standards over the spectrum of culinary qualifications. A scientifically validated situational analysis was executed by means of focus group discussions, personal interviews, curriculum comparisons and an electronic mail questionnaire survey, which mainly generated qualitative data. These techniques were used in triangulation as research instruments to investigate the needs for continuing professional development in culinary arts and the availability of curricula to address these needs. The greatest challenges in culinary studies were reflected in the complexity and multidisciplinary nature of this relatively <b>undefined</b> industry and <b>field</b> of study. The intricate relation, interaction, collaboration and contexts between secondary schools, various culinary training institutions, industry and culinary professionals were investigated. The data generated confirmed the need for training and development opportunities to improve the professional status of culinary professionals in South Africa The promotion of a change in direction for culinary studies development in South Africa could ensure future growth as a discipline cognitively and professionally, in line with international standards, procedures and practices. The range of challenges and changes facing the industry varies from social issues to the educational issues of qualifications and credible accreditations, which are addressed in the proposed curriculum framework. The lack of more empirical research in this field of study is an indication that both students and professionals should be encouraged to do the relevant research and that higher education institutions should provide the opportunities and structures for such research...|$|R
