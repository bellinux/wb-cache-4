5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>industry.</b> Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>industry,</b> especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>industry</b> to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.|$|E

25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power {{is transferred to}} the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An {{induction motor}} resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side.

25|$|MTBE is {{extensively}} <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>industry</b> as a safer {{alternative to}} diethyl ether (which {{is commonly used}} in academic research) as the tert-butyl group prevents MTBE from forming potentially explosive peroxides.
