Liveness requires the assumption of weak fairness and holds only for executions with not more than finitely many fault steps per process.

Second, this perspective can reveal the victims, as well as identifying the social and environmental harms surrounding the exploitation of natural resources. Finally, a green criminological approach also focuses on the ‘rights’ that are being violated (whether constitutional, human, environmental, social, etc.), the social initiatives to defend them (communities affected, NGO’s), and the measures and interventions taken (or not) by private, state or international actors to guarantee, protect and enforce them.
