25|$|Sir Terry Farrell, CBE, RIBA, FRSA, FCSD, MRTPI (born 12 May 1938) is a British {{architect}} and <b>urban</b> <b>designer.</b> In 1980, after working 15 years {{in partnership with}} Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, Farrell founded his own firm, Farrells. He garnered a strong reputation for contextual urban design schemes, as well as exuberant works of postmodernism such as the MI6 Building. In 1991 his practice expanded internationally, opening an office in Hong Kong. In Asia his firm designed KK100 in Shenzhen, the tallest building ever designed by a British architect, as well as Guangzhou South Railway Station, once the largest railway station in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to <b>urban</b> <b>designer</b> and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 <b>urban</b> <b>designer</b> {{and social}} theorist Michael E.

[...] A prototype, Tiger Bay Village, was proposed for near Daytona Beach, FL. He claims {{that this would be}} superior for treating the psychological as well as psychiatric needs of both temporarily and permanently homeless adults, and would cost less than the current approach. It would also provide a lower cost alternative to jail, and provide a half-way station for those getting out of prison.

This agreement existed for almost 100 years until the city decided to allow skyscrapers taller to be built. In March 1987, the completion of One Liberty Place was the first building to do that.

2500|$|As {{an ancient}} trading centre, Aleppo's {{impressive}} souqs, khans, hammams, madrasas, mosques and churches {{are all in}} need of more care and preservation work. After World War II, the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton {{had a number of}} wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954 and 1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Jinan). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and <b>urban</b> <b>designer</b> Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of [...] "preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo" [...] paving the way for UNESCO to declare the Old City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} considers Carmona’s Place-shaping Continuum in {{the context}} of Cairns in tropical north Australia to explore the model’s applicability across different cultures and contexts. Drawing from context analysis and interviews with knowing and unknowing <b>urban</b> <b>designers,</b> this research uses a critical policy lens to consider how the process of designing the city for use might apply in Cairns, a regional, tropical city quite different from where Carmona’s model of urban design was developed from. Results indicate that in Cairns, the geopolitical, economic, environmental and cultural contexts continue to influence how things are done in the city; there is little to distinguish knowing and unknowing <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> from one another; and that whilst <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> consider themselves to have a role in the urban design process, few assume ownership of the process. The paper concludes that Carmona’s context elements of place, polity and power are fundamentally important in the application of the model in research practice...|$|R
40|$|While {{previous}} research on urban design processes has largely treated urban design practice as the public regulation of private activities, the increasing role of private consultants in public policy and design activities brings this into question. Looking at two cities with differing public capacities, Toronto and Los Angeles, this research assesses the relationships between private and public sector <b>urban</b> <b>designers,</b> the relative power that they have over urban design processes, and how this is influenced by public sector capacity. Professional expertise is shown here to {{be a form of}} political power, {{in the sense that it}} allows for influence over decision-making processes. In negotiating design processes, the professional expertise of private sector <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> was constructed, and for the most part, perceived as "more expert" or legitimate compared to that of public sector <b>urban</b> <b>designers.</b> The establishment of a creative-technical division between public and private sector professionals was enforced in both Los Angeles and Toronto, often limiting the role of municipal <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> in substantive decision-making. The research also demonstrates that professional <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> have political identities. One aspect of this is the portrayal of outside experts as politically neutral and unbiased in a way that public employees were not. Consultants used the construction of political neutrality to bolster the perception that they were able to provide "more expert" advice than their public sector counterparts, arguing that they didn't face the same political and bureaucratic constraints. The public sector urban design capacity of the city was also found to be important in constructions of municipal expertise. Without a public sector that saw itself at least partially in conflict with private <b>urban</b> <b>designers,</b> confrontation about the substantive issues related to design practices and goals rarely occurred. Importantly, these constructions and deployments of professional and political practices were used in the shaping of urban design processes in a way that can be broadly understood as "setting the agenda". This notion of setting the agenda, or having control not only over the outcome of decision-making processes but also the range of possibilities that are considered, demonstrates the relative power of private sector actors in urban design practices...|$|R

40|$|Architects and <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> are {{increasingly}} using computers in {{their attempt to}} improve decision making in urban design. Most existing systems emphasize hard data such as statistics, land use data, etc. In recent years with the use of more powerful computers we have seen a greater emphasis on managing visual data. Computer systems are being used to generate urban models and simulations of the various kinds of impact new developments have on the existing cityscape.   This project emphasizes the use of visual data. The purpose of the research has been to develop a computer system for <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> to use in analyzing urban architectural qualities. Therefore this project focuses on applying traditional methods and theories of <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> rather than developing new computer techniques.   The traditional methods and theories of <b>urban</b> <b>designers</b> fall within the category which the French theorist Francoise Choay calls Pre-urbanism and Urbanism - the Cultural Model. Theorists within this category include Camillo Sitte, Gordon Cullen, Kevin Lynch, Leon Krier, Aldo Rossi, Michael Trieb, Roger Tranzick and Thiis-Evensen.   This computer system has been developed as a prototype in order to gain experience and knowledge for future development of a large system. Later development will be based upon a vectorized threedimensional model of a whole city using texture mapping and tracing techniques to annotate important architectural features.   The computer system consists of the basic analysis module supplied with a simulation unit and a theory unit. With this analytical tool, analysis is conducted on three different urban scales. The prototype has been developed on the Macintosh computer with SuperCard as the authoring tool.   The computer system was developed as a prototype for Danish <b>Urban</b> <b>Designers</b> and is currently being tested in conjunction with the city of Viborg, Denmark. (population 55, 000). Located in Jutland, Viborg was the capital of Denmark around the year 1000. It now functions as a center for regional government.
