50|$|Female eroticism in {{literature}} has been another tactic used to reinforce feminine subjectivity, even {{as early as}} the beginning of the 20th century, although the views of such literature, as well as the views expressed within it, have changed. Until as recently as the 1980s, topics such as female sexuality (especially if it was homosexual or happened outside of marriage) as well as female sexual desire were considered taboo. Women writers have attempted to empower themselves by expressing a woman’s sexual desire, and showing her as an assertive and sometimes aggressive sexual partner. In Marilyn Bobes short story “Somebody Has to Cry,” for which she won the 1995 Casa de las Américas Prize, differing points of view are <b>utilized</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the stories of multiple characters. These characters deal with real problems, such as the tragedy of unwanted pregnancy from rape, or adultery. The story buzzes with sexual consciousness, focusing on women’s views of their bodies, as well as the objectification that comes with beauty. Renowned poet Nancy Morejon is known for, among many other things, her depictions of lesbian love, further reorienting the perspective and asserting the right to agency.|$|E

The three basic social and philosophical principles that they <b>utilize</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the troubled youths are [...] "treatment, deterrence, and normalization rationales." [...] Treatment is the adjustment of emotional {{problems that are}} present in the behaviors of status offenses of the troubled youth. Deterrence is the act of control and punishment towards status offenses to prevent further delinquencies. Normalization rationales is the recognition that status offenses are normal behaviors present in the youth population. They examine these three principles in status offenders at seven different cities and their activities in the cities' youth service agencies based on their data from surveys and experiments. Additionally, the authors analyze the legislative aspect of status offenses, particularly in state laws, policies, approaches, and ideologies that are implanted in the legislation that deals with status offenses. Towards the end of the book, Klein and Maxson head into youth runaways by describing the patterns in characteristics, family histories, living conditions, and causes of runaway youths and also different services that are available to runaway youths.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Current {{approaches}} for proving the correctness of business processes focus on either soundness, weak soundness, or relaxed sound-ness. Soundness states that each activity {{should be on}} a path from the initial to the final activity, that after the final activity has been reached no other activities should become active, {{and that there are}} no unreach-able activities. Relaxed soundness softens soundness by stating that each activity should be able to participate in the business process, whereas weak soundness allows unreachable activities. However, all these kinds of soundness are not satisfactory for processes containing discriminator, n-out-of-m-join or multiple instances without synchronization patterns that can leave running (lazy) activities behind. As these patterns occur in interacting business processes, we propose a solution based on lazy soundness.

40|$|Mode I {{fracture}} {{experiments were}} conducted on brittle bulk metallic glass (BMG) samples and the fracture surface features were analyzed in detail to understand the underlying physical processes. Wollner lines, which result from {{the interaction between the}} propagating crack front and shear waves emanating from a secondary source, were observed on the fracture surface and geometric analysis of them indicates that the maximum crack velocity is similar to 800 m s(- 1), which corresponds to similar to 0. 32 times the shear wave speed. Fractography reveals that the sharp crack nucleation at the notch tip occurs at the mid-section of the specimens with the observation of flat and half-penny-shaped cracks. On this basis, we conclude that the crack initiation in brittle BMGs is stress-controlled and occurs through hydrostatic stress-assisted cavity nucleation ahead of the notch tip. High magnification scanning electron and atomic force microscopies of the dynamic crack growth regions reveal highly organized, nanoscale periodic patterns with a spacing of similar to 79 nm. Juxtaposition of the crack velocity with this spacing suggests that the crack takes similar to 10 (- 10) s for peak-to-peak propagation. This, and the estimated adiabatic temperature rise ahead of the propagating crack tip that suggests local softening, is <b>utilized</b> <b>to</b> critically <b>discuss</b> possible causes for the nanocorrugation formation.
