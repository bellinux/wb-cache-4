5|$|On 24 August 1975, Catholic civilians Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer {{were stopped}} {{in their car}} at another fake British Army {{checkpoint}} at Altnamachin (near Newtownhamilton). They were driving home from a Gaelic football match in Dublin. The two men were found shot dead nearby. Earlier that night, three RUC officers in an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> had been stopped at the same checkpoint but allowed through. However, the officers suspected that the checkpoint was fake. After receiving radio confirmation {{that there were no}} authorised checkpoints in the area that night, they reported the incident and requested help from the British Army to investigate it, but no action was taken. RUC officer John Weir claims that UDR corporal Robert McConnell was involved in the attack.|$|E
25|$|Ayman Nour, {{the founder}} of the liberal {{opposition}} El-Ghad Party, tweeted that his son was taken by an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car.</b> Security forces arrested Guardian reporter Jack Shenker in Cairo, who secretly recorded his subsequent journey in a police van. After stopping near a government security headquarters outside the city, a policeman searched for Ayman Nour's son, however, the detainees overpowered him and escaped. Mohammed ElBaradei was also reported to be under house arrest.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April, in {{the run-up}} to the {{scheduled}} 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix, a car used by Force India mechanics had been involved in a petrol bombing, though there were no injuries or damage. The team members had been travelling in an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> and were held up by an impromptu roadblock which they were unable to clear before a petrol bomb exploded nearby. Protests and protesters sharply increased in the spotlight of international press for the Grand Prix, and to condemn the implicit endorsement of the government by Formula One.|$|E
25|$|Many forces also operate <b>unmarked</b> <b>cars,</b> {{in any of}} {{the roles}} shown above, but most {{frequently}} for the use of traffic enforcement or detectives. They have the advantage of not being immediately recognizable, and are a valuable tool in catching criminals while the crime is still taking place. In the United States, <b>unmarked</b> <b>cars</b> are also used by federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and the Secret Service, but can be recognized by their U.S. government plates. However, not all <b>unmarked</b> police <b>cars</b> have government license plates. Many U.S. jurisdictions use regular civilian issued license plates on <b>unmarked</b> <b>cars,</b> especially gang suppression and vice prevention units. Also see Q-car.|$|R

25|$|Minutes {{before the}} {{shooting}} at the checkpoint, two other Catholic civilians had been shot nearby by another MRF team. The two young men—Aidan McAloon and Eugene Devlin—had gotten a taxi home from a disco and were dropped off at Slievegallion Drive. As they began walking along the street, {{in the direction of}} a vigilante barricade, the MRF team opened fire on them from an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car.</b> The MRF team told the Royal Military Police that they had shot a man who was firing a rifle. Witnesses said there was no gunman on the street, and police forensics experts found no evidence that McAloon or Devlin had fired weapons.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days after}} the Milltown killings, one of Stone's victims, Caoimhín Mac Brádaigh, was being buried when two plain-clothes British Army Corporals (Derek Wood and David Howes) in an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> drove {{into the path of}} the funeral cortège, {{apparently}} by mistake. Some of those present, believing the soldiers to be loyalist gunmen, surrounded and attacked their car. Corporal Wood drew his service pistol and fired a shot in the air. The two men were then dragged from the car before being taken away, beaten and shot dead by republicans. The incident {{is often referred to as}} the corporals killings and, like the attack at Milltown, much of it was filmed by television news cameras. The Browning pistol Stone used was seized on the day of the attack and was eventually used by an IRA unit to ambush a combined RUC/British Army patrol in Belfast on 13 October 1990. A constable was shot dead and another badly injured.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach {{drove to}} the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, they {{drove to the}} Evans' {{apartment}} at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were {{surprised to discover that}} the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern {{that he was going to}} be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E

2500|$|A radio {{broadcast}} over the police radio alerted the second surveillance vehicle to the shots {{fired at the}} tow truck. It turned back, traveling east on Beulah. When it came within view of the tow truck, police say, they saw the tow truck driver running from the armed man. [...] Then two snipers behind the tow truck fired on the <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> (hitting its hood, grill, and windshield). The police returned fire, emptying their weapon ammunition magazines. [...] The police vehicle then fled north on E. 123rd Street, all four of its tires shot out.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday night, May 10, Texarkana, Texas City Police {{officers}} chased a car {{for three}} miles that had been following a city bus. The police shot out the tires and arrested a high school star athlete named C. J. Lauderdale, Jr. When the officers questioned the teen at the station, {{he explained that he}} did not know they were officers because they were driving an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car.</b> He said that he was following the bus because he was suspicious of an occupant who had gotten on from a private car. On Sunday, May 12, Captain Gonzaullas gave a warning to [...] "teen age sleuths" [...] in the Gazette, saying that [...] "it's a good way to get killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|An MRF team in an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> {{approached}} a checkpoint manned {{by members of}} the Catholic Ex-Servicemen's Association (CESA) at the entrance to Riverdale Park South. The CESA was an unarmed vigilante organization set up to protect Catholic areas. The car stopped, and then reversed. One of the MRF men opened fire from the car with a sub-machine gun, killing Catholic civilian Patrick McVeigh (44) and wounding four others. [...] The car continued on, turned, and then drove past the scene of the shooting. All of the men were local residents and McVeigh, who was shot through the back, had stopped to chat to the CESA members as he walked home. He was a married father of six children. The British Army told journalists that gunmen in a passing car had fired indiscriminately at civilians and called it an [...] "apparently motiveless crime". The car had come from a Protestant area and had returned the same way. This, together with the British Army statement, implied that loyalists were responsible.|$|E

2500|$|... 24 August 1975: {{killing of}} Catholic civilians Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer, who were found shot dead at Altnamachin, near Newtownhamilton, County Armagh. They were driving {{home from a}} Gaelic {{football}} match in Dublin when they were apparently stopped at a fake military checkpoint by men in British Army uniform. They were found shot dead a short distance away. Earlier that night, three RUC officers in an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> had been stopped at the same checkpoint but had been allowed through. However, the officers suspected that the checkpoint had been fake. After receiving radio confirmation {{that there were no}} authorized checkpoints in the area that night, they reported the incident and requested help from the British Army to investigate it, but no action was taken. The HET said the original police investigation [...] "barely existed", describing the police's failure to interview eyewitnesses as [...] "inexplicable". Weir claims that an RUC officer confessed to partaking in the attack, alongside a UDR soldier and UVF members. The [...] "Protestant Action Force" [...] claimed responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June 1972, the Provisional IRA {{announced}} that it would begin a ceasefire in four days, as a prelude to secret talks with the British Government. That afternoon, MRF members in an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> shot and wounded three Catholic men standing by a car at Glen Road bus terminus. A man in a nearby house was also wounded by the gunfire. Shortly afterward, the MRF unit's car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the occupants were arrested. Inside the car was a Thompson sub-machine gun, [...] "for years the IRA's favourite weapon". One of the MRF members—Clive Graham Williams—was charged with attempted murder. He told the court that two of the men had been armed, and one had fired at the MRF car. He claimed he was returning fire. Witnesses said that none of the civilians were armed, and that it was an unprovoked attack. Police forensics experts found no evidence that the civilians had fired weapons. However, key witnesses were not called to give evidence in person, and Williams was acquitted on 26 June 1973. He was later promoted and awarded the Military Medal for bravery.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 1975, McConnell was alleged by Weir to {{have been}} part of a UVF group that ambushed two Gaelic {{football}} supporters at a bogus vehicle checkpoint set up in the Cortamlet Road at the townland of Altnamachin, near Tullyvallen close to the Irish Republic border. At about 11.30 pm, Colm McCartney (aged 22) and Sean Farmer (aged 32), both from Derry, were returning home from the Derry versus Dublin All-Ireland semi-final football match at Croke Park in Dublin when the group stopped the car they were travelling in. Upon their discovery that the two men inside were Catholics, the UVF gunmen ordered them {{out of the car and}} a short distance away turned their guns on Farmer, killing him instantly. McCartney attempted to escape on foot, but his pursuers caught up with him and he was also fatally gunned down. McCartney and Farmer had been shot four times and six times respectively. McConnell was wearing his British Army uniform at the time the attack occurred. A local resident who had been in the vicinity walking his dog saw the stopped vehicle; he then heard the sounds of gunfire, someone running along the road, a male voice shouting [...] "stop, stop", which was then followed by [...] "wild screaming" [...] and another series of gunshots. He also saw another car drive away from the scene afterwards. Less than an hour before the shootings, a three-man RUC patrol in an <b>unmarked</b> <b>car</b> had been stopped by the same UVF unit after one soldier had waved a red torch in a circular motion indicating that it was a military vehicle checkpoint. Another soldier was lying in a ditch with a rifle. The RUC immediately suspected that it was a bogus checkpoint despite the men having worn full military combat uniforms. After the RUC men were passed through the checkpoint, they requested by radio, clarification as to whether there were any authorised regular Army or UDR checkpoints in the area that night, and received the confirmation that there were none. Although the RUC patrol reported the unauthorised checkpoint to the Army and requested their help in investigating the incident, no action had been taken. The killings were claimed by the Protestant Action Force, one of the cover names used by the Glenanne gang. The fake vehicle checkpoint manned UVF men in full British Army uniform was the same modus operandi which the UVF had employed when they waylaid the Miami Showbanda popular Irish cabaret bandthe previous month at Buskhill, County Down; however, McConnell was not implicated in that incident.|$|E
