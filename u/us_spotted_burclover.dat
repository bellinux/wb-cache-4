40|$|A {{basic premise}} behind {{the study of}} large {{networks}} is that interaction leads to complex collective behavior. In our work we found very interesting and counterintuitive patterns for time evolving networks, which change {{some of the basic}} assumptions that were made in the past. We then develop models that explain processes which govern the network evolution, fit such models to real networks, and use them to generate realistic graphs or give formal explanations about their properties. In addition, our work has a wide range of applications: it can help <b>us</b> <b>spot</b> anomalous graphs and outliers, forecast future graph structure and run simulations of network evolution. Another important aspect of our research is the study of “local ” patterns and structures of propagation in networks. We aim to identify building blocks of the networks and find the patterns of influence that these blocks have on information or virus propagation over the network.

40|$|Graphs {{appear in}} several settings, like social networks, {{recommendation}} systems, and numerous more. A deep, recurring question is “How do real graphs look like? ” That is, {{how can we}} separate real graphs from synthetic or real graphs with masked portions? The main contribution {{of this paper is}} ShatterPlots, a simple and powerful algorithm to tease out patterns of real graphs that help <b>us</b> <b>spot</b> fake/masked graphs. The idea is to shatter a graph, by deleting edges, force it to reach a critical (“Shattering”) point, and study the properties at that point. One of our most discriminative patterns is the “NodeShatteringRatio ”: that can almost perfectly separate the real from the synthetic graphs of our extensive collection. Additional contributions of this paper are (a) the careful, scalable design of the algorithm that needs only O(E) time, (b) extensive experiments on a large collection of graphs (19 in total), with up to hundred of thousand of nodes and million edges; and (c) a wealth of observations and patterns, which show how to distinguish synthetic or masked graphs from real ones...|$|R
5000|$|During D-Day, Spitfires were {{operated}} as Spotters by U.S. Navy Cruiser Scouting Squadron Seven (VCS-7) {{in support}} of United States Navy and Royal Navy cruisers and battleships bombarding land targets. In this role the Spitfires would locate targets and guide the fire of the ships onto the target. <b>US</b> <b>spotting</b> units normally used floatplanes, either SOC Seagulls or OS2U Kingfishers but because of their vulnerability against fighters, {{it was decided that}} 17 Cruiser Spotter (VCS) and Battleship Observation (VO) pilots aboard the heavy cruisers Augusta (CA 31), Tuscaloosa (CA 37) and Quincy (CA 71) and the battleships Arkansas (BB 33), Texas (BB 35) and Nevada (BB 36), would be trained to fly RAF Spitfire Mk Vbs and Seafire IIIs. This unit, along with two RAF squadrons, 26 and 63, also flying Spitfire Vbs and four FAA squadrons 808, 885, 886 and 897 flying Seafire IIIs and forming no. 3 Wing, provided valuable target coordinates and fire control during 20 days of operations.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} some of {{the economic}} effects associated with the elimination of single desk marketing on Canadian feed barley exports. It focuses on the interactions between Canadian and <b>US</b> <b>spot</b> feed barley markets in transition after this policy change in Canada. A brief introduction about world and regional barley markets is provided. The role of the CWB single desk {{and its role in}} Canadian barley marketing are discussed to motivate analysis about the effects of its absence. This study postulates there should be no significant change in Canada–US regional feed barley markets, based on conclusions from previous studies. This postulate is broken down into three testable hypotheses under the framework of spatial price analysis. With respect to the Canada–US regional feed barley market as single desk marketing was eliminated in Canada; (1) There should not be a significant structural break in the feed barley prices; 	(2) There should not be a significant change in market integration; 	(3) There should not be a significant change in the direction of price transmission. To test these hypotheses, the study employs econometric tests on Canadian and <b>US</b> prices <b>spot</b> prices for substitutable feed barley. The hypotheses are tested using a structural break test, a cointegration test, a Granger causality test, and associated impulse response functions. Since structural break tests do not find significant breakpoints in the data, the first hypothesis cannot be rejected. Next, the sample is split into two subsamples at the date when single desk was eliminated. An Engle-Granger procedure and the Johansen procedure are used to test cointegrating relationships between the variables. The results do not allow us to reject the second hypothesis of no significant change in market integration. In contrast, the third hypothesis is rejected, as a significant change is uncovered using the Granger causality test. Simulated impulse responses are also consistent with this finding...|$|R

40|$|Combining several {{theories}} concerning {{individual and}} group behaviour within social networks could help <b>us</b> <b>spot</b> unacceptable behaviour, such as insider trading. Social Network Analysis (SNA) helps us understand how people interact. Behaviour theory explains how individual humans behave {{and how we can}} differentiate usual and unusual behaviour. Co-ordination theory helps us understand the flow of control and group behaviour. Combining them can help us answer important questions, such as how actors in a social structure behave, co-ordinate and connect. But how can we spot abnormal behaviour by a group or an individual? Sumit Gupta and Liaquat Hossain suggest one way of achieving this in the fight against insider trading. The monitoring of capital frauds and malicious trading behaviours, and implementing changes to correct traders' and firms' behaviour, is increasingly seen as a priority in today's financial markets. Many governments and financial institutions are investing capital and resources to maintain the integrity of their markets and promote fair-trade practices. Of all the capital scams, insider trading is one of the hardest to detect and therefore the most difficult to prove in a court of law. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
