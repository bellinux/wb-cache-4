Hansen collaborated with Larry Travis and other colleagues in a 1979 Science article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum. They conclude that {{there are at least}} three different cloud materials that contribute to the images: a thin haze layer, sulfuric acid clouds, and an unknown <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorber</b> below the sulfuric acid cloud layer. The linear polarization data obtained from the same mission confirmed that the low- and mid-level clouds were sulfuric acid with radius of about 1 micrometer. Above the cloud layer was a layer of submicrometre haze.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Wood–plastic {{composites}} {{are being}} increas-ingly examined for nonstructural or semistructural building applications. As outdoor applications become more wide-spread, durability becomes an issue. Ultraviolet exposure {{can lead to}} photodegradation, which results in a change in appearance and/or mechanical properties. Photodegrada-tion can be slowed through the addition of photostabilizers. In this study, we examined the performance of wood flour/ high-density polyethylene composites after accelerated weathering. Two 24 factorial experimental designs {{were used to determine}} the effects of two hindered amine light stabilizers, an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorber,</b> a colorant, and their in-teractions on the photostabilization of high-density polyethyl-ene blends and wood flour/high-density polyethylene com-posites. Color change and flexural properties were determined after 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 h of accelerated weathering.

Though various kinds of non-polar capillary columns are commercially available, the equality of their performance has not been verified. Herein, ninety-six additives for food contact plastics were analyzed using fifteen kinds of columns, and the peak separation, retention times, and peak areas of each additive were compared. The additives, with various chemical properties, comprised forty four plasticizers, twenty lubricants, twenty antioxidants, nine <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbers,</b> and three other compounds. 10 μg. mL - 1 test solutions were prepared in acetone, and injected to the GC/MS. The fifteen columns were classified into five categories based on the chromatogram pattern and peak separation. To facilitate comparison of the retention time and detection sensitivity of the columns for the additives, the relative retention time (RRT) and relative peak area (RPA) were calculated by using dibutylphthalate or 4 - tert -butylphenylsalicylate as an internal standard. The RRTs of the additives on each column were essentially similar. However, the RRT of the additives which were detected in the later stages differed slightly. Although the RPA of the plasticizers and lubricants were roughly similar, column-to-column differences were observed for certain additives, such as antioxidants and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbers.</b> Furthermore, certain fatty acids, antioxidants, two plasticizers, and two benzophenone type <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbers</b> were not detected in the chromatograms of two columns. </p...|$|R

The ultra-violet spectrometer experiment was de-signed primarily to determine the com-position {{and structure of the}} Mars upper atmosphere (1). The experiment was successful in determining the properties of the lower atmosphere and surface because of two characteristics of the Mars surface. First, the ultraviolet re-flectivity of the Mars surface in the desert region is low; and, second, the reflectivity of the polar cap in the ultra-violet is high. The first property means that any ultraviolet light reflected by the planet over desert regions is the result of scattering by atmospheric constitu-ents; thus, ultraviolet intensity {{is a measure of the}} number of atmospheric scatterers.

Polydimethylsiloxanes show material exhaustion after long-term exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. Consequently, solutions are required to increase their thermo- and photostability under solar irradiation. Three different families of additives, namely <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbers,</b> hindered amine light stabilizers, and a carbazole derivative are investigated. Those ultraviolet stabilizers were mixed with polydimethylsiloxane, then a cross-linking process was run by hydrosilylation.

Using visible near-infrared spectroscopy and after 450 equivalent solar hours of ultraviolet irradiation, an average increase of 2. 6 % in the ultraviolet stability was also obtained in the wavelength range from 250 to 400 nm.

40|$|Wood-plasticlumber is {{promoted}} as a low-maintenance high-durability product. After weathering, however, wood-plasticcomposites (WPCs) often fide and lose mechanical properties. In {{the first part}} ofthis study, 50 % wood-flour-filled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composite samples were injection molded or extruded. Composites were exposed to two accelerated weathering cycles in a xenon-arc type weathering apparatus; either ultraviolet (UV) light only or UV light and water spray. The composites lightened less when they were exposed to only UV light compared with exposure to UV light and water spray. The change in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and strength was also much less when the composites were exposed to UV light only. The {{second part of the}} study involved stabilizing the WPCs with an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorber</b> and or pigment. The stabilized composites were also exposed to the two weathering cycles. Again the amount of lightening and loss in mechanical properties was less when the composites were exposed to UV light only compared with exposure to UV light and water spray. The pigment was more effective than the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorber</b> retaining composite properties. The pigment had a larger impact on property retention when the composites were exposed to UV light and water spray. The results of this study demonstrate that exposing WPCs to water spray in combination with UV light is more severe than exposing WPCs to only UV light.

40|$|When seen in {{ultraviolet}} light, Venus has contrast {{features that}} arise from the non-uniform distribution of unknown absorbers within the sulphuric acid clouds and seem to trace dynamical activity in the middle atmosphere. It has long been unclear whether the global pattern arises from differences in cloud top altitude (which was earlier estimated to be 66 – 72 km), compositional variations or temperature contrasts. Here we report multi-wavelength imaging that reveals that the dark low latitudes are dominated by convective mixing which brings the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbers</b> up from depth.

In low and middle latitudes, the visible cloud top is located at a remarkably constant altitude of 72 ± 1 km in both the ultraviolet dark and bright regions, indicating that the brightness variations result from compositional differences caused by the colder environment rather than by elevation changes.

In this study, we attempted to characterize the modulus-of-elastic-ity (MOE) loss of photostabilized high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and composites of wood flour and high-density polyethylene (WF/HDPE) with accelerated weathering. We then examined how weathering changed the surface chem-istry of the composites and looked at whether or not the surface changes were related to the MOE loss. By examining surface chemistry changes, we hoped to begin to understand what caused the weathering changes. The materials were left unstabilized or were stabilized with either an <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorber</b> or pigment. After 1000 and 2000 h of accelerated weathering, the samples were tested for MOE loss.

It was determined that structural changes in the samples (carbonyl group formation, terminal vinyl group formation, and crystallinity changes) could not be reliably used to predict changes in MOE with a simple linear relationship. This indicated that the effects of crosslinking, chain scission, and crystallinity changes due to ultraviolet exposure and interfacial degradation due to moisture exposure were interrelated factors for the weath-ering of HDPE and WF/HDPE composites. © 2004 Wile...|$|E
