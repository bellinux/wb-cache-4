It gives <b>us</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds {{to the life of}} Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.|$|E

Anyway we can tie things together, we’re {{going to try to do}} it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Ultimately, the opening scene of [...] "Shadows" [...] serves as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter with the inclusion of Atwell as Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including the then unconfirmed involvement of Howard Stark, who is mentioned in the scene, as well as Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

[...] Several scenes in [...] "Shadows" [...] and [...] "The Things We Bury" [...] are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D.

2500|$|In 2009, {{in light}} of the growth of Twenty20 cricket with the Twenty20 Cup, Indian Premier League and ICC World Twenty20, the ECB {{realised}} that the Pro40 and Friends Provident Trophy were attracting less interest. Plans began to consolidate the List A competitions into a single 40-over trophy. The competition began in the 2010 English cricket season with Clydesdale Bank, previously sponsor of the Twenty20 Cup, agreeing to a three-year sponsorship. John Perera, ECB commercial director, stated that [...] "We are delighted to welcome Clydesdale Bank as the title sponsor for the 40-over competition particularly as it gives <b>us</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> build on an already strong working relationship. The Clydesdale Bank 40 is an exciting new competition and the format is designed to comfortably fit into the busy family weekend." [...] Ireland and Scotland, were asked to compete, following their entry in the Friends Provident Trophy, but Ireland declined in order to concentrate on their growing international commitments; The Netherlands took their place. A new team, the Unicorns cricket team, was formed of contractless county players to compete, unpaid, alongside the 18 first-class counties, Scotland and the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics have}} been less kind however, arguing that if the later plays show a skilled and {{confident}} writer exploring serious issues of the human heart, Two Gentlemen represents the initial, primarily unsuccessful attempt to do likewise. In 1921, for example, J. Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller-Couch, in their edition of the play for the Cambridge Shakespeare, famously stated that after hearing Valentine offer Silvia to Proteus [...] "one's impulse, upon this declaration, is to remark that there are, by this time, no gentlemen in Verona." [...] H.B. Charlton, writing in 1938, argues that [...] "clearly, Shakespeare's first attempt to make romantic comedy had only succeeded {{so far as it}} had unexpectedly and inadvertently made romance comic." [...] Another such argument is provided by Norman Sanders in 1968; [...] "because the play reveals a relatively unsure dramatist and many effects managed with a tiro's lack of expertise, it offers <b>us</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> see more clearly {{than anywhere else in the}} canon what were to become characteristic techniques. It stands as an 'anatomie' or show-through version, as it were, of Shakespeare's comic art." [...] Kurt Schlueter, on the other hand, argues that critics have been too harsh on the play precisely because the later plays are so much superior. He suggests that when looking at Shakespeare's earlier works, scholars put too much emphasis on how they fail to measure up to the later works, rather than looking at them for their own intrinsic merits; [...] "we should not continue the practice of holding his later achievements against him when dealing with his early beginnings." ...|$|E

60|$|Now a man's {{view of the}} {{universe}} is mostly a view of the civilised society in which he lives. Other men and women are so much more grossly and so much more intimately palpable to his perceptions, that they stand between him and all the rest; they are larger to his eye than the sun, he hears them more plainly than thunder; with them, by them, and for them, he must live and die. And hence the laws that affect his intercourse with his fellow-men, although merely customary and the creatures of a generation, are more clearly and continually before his mind than those which bind him into the eternal system of things, support him in his upright progress on this whirling ball, or keep up the fire of his bodily life. And hence it is that money stands in the first rank of considerations and so powerfully affects the choice. For our society is built with money for mortar; money is present in every joint of circumstance; it might be named the social atmosphere, since, in society, it is by that alone men continue to live, and only through that or chance that they can reach or affect one another. Money gives us food, shelter, and privacy; it permits us to be clean in person, opens for us the doors of the theatre, gains us books for study or pleasure, enables us to help the distresses of others, and puts us above necessity so that we can choose the best in life. If we love, it enables us to meet and live with the loved one, or even to prolong her health and life; if we have scruples, it gives <b>us</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> be honest; if we have any bright designs, here is what will smooth the way to their accomplishment.
