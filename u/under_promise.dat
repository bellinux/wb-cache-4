2500|$|The {{issue of}} the defendants' intent when {{entering}} the McLoren property and during the events at the fort was critical and hotly contested throughout the trial. [...] The defendants said {{they had gone to}} the fort to buy, not steal, marijuana that day, so there was no burglary or attempted robbery. [...] McLoren, testifying as a prosecution witness <b>under</b> <b>promise</b> of immunity from prosecution on drug charges, said there had been no prior arrangement for the sale of marijuana.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the start}} of the {{following}} Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Lamont was sent a charter by King Charles I to crush the rebels, the Campbells. Even though the Lamont chief was a Royalist sympathizer and wished to obey Charles, {{he had no choice but}} to join forces with the superior Marquess of Argyll. After the Covenanter loss at the Battle of Inverlochy, Sir James was released by the Royalist victors and was able to side with the Marquess of Montrose and actively support the Royalist cause. Lamont then joined forces with Alasdair MacColla and invaded the lands of the Campbells. Sir James' brother, Archibald, led a force of Lamonts across Loch Long and, together with MacColla's Irish contingent, landed at the Point of Strone. Their force then laid waste to large areas under Campbell control. The Lamonts were particularly brutal in North Cowal, and singled out Dunoon because of its sore history as a Lamont stronghold that was unlawfully seized by the power-hungry Campbells. During the destruction their forces wrought on the Campbells, MacColla's men committed many atrocities, and even the Lamonts themselves took part in the brutal slaughter when they attacked the Tower of Kilmun. Once the tower had surrendered <b>under</b> <b>promise</b> of their lives being spared, the prisoners were then [...] "taken thrie myles from the place and most cruelly put to Death, except one who was in the hot fever". Sir James Lamont ravaged the lands of Strachur, killing thirty-three men, women and children. His force destroyed much grain and drove off 340 cattle and horses.|$|E

60|$|According to the British Museum MS., Gowrie now {{told the}} jury {{that he was being}} accused on the {{strength}} of his own letter, treacherously extorted <b>under</b> <b>promise</b> of life, by Montrose, Doune, Maitland, Melville, Colonel Stewart, and the Captain of Dumbarton, not by Arran. In Gowrie’s letter of confession, to the King, as printed by Spottiswoode, he does not mention Godscroft, but another intriguer, Erskine. However, in this letter he certainly confesses his concern with the conspiracy. But, says the MS., the nobles charged by Gowrie with having betrayed him <b>under</b> <b>promise</b> of life denied the accusations on oath. Gowrie himself, according to another copy of the MS., denied knowing Hume of Godscroft; if he did, he spoke untruly, teste Godscroft.|$|E

He then issued edicts {{to the entire}} empire, {{promising}} to allow Xin local officials who submitted to him to keep their posts. For a brief period, nearly the entire empire showed at least nominal submission—even including the powerful Chimei general Fan Chong (樊崇), who, indeed, went to stay in Luoyang <b>under</b> <b>promises</b> of titles and honors. However, this policy was applied inconsistently, and local governors soon became apprehensive about giving up their power. Fan, in particular, left the capital {{and returned to his}} troops.|$|R

I have but little doubt that the worst acts that were attributed to Sherman's army were committed by these convicts, and by other Southern people who ought to have been under sentence--such people as could be found in every community, North and South--who took advantage of their country being invaded to commit crime. They were in but little danger of detection, or of arrest even if detected.|$|E
