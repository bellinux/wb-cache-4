5|$|In 1887, Narendra {{compiled}} a Bengali song anthology named Sangeet Kalpataru with Vaishnav Charan Basak. Narendra collected and arranged {{most of the}} songs of this compilation, but could not finish {{the work of the}} book for <b>unfavourable</b> circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{respective}} {{forces of}} the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong. Montfort, facing such <b>unfavourable</b> numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive a wedge through the line. Though the tactics were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point. The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort confronted by a force twice the size of his own, on <b>unfavourable</b> ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide <b>unfavourable</b> environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the <b>unfavourable</b> season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gasparo's {{reputation}} {{fell into}} oblivion caused by <b>unfavourable</b> secular criticism. His complex artistic personality and catalog of works were only reconstructed {{from the end}} of the twentieth century, thanks to targeted critical studies that have for the first time allowed a thorough analysis and rediscovery of his works.|$|E
5|$|At first Citroën {{decided not}} to offer their new {{automatic}} EGS6 gearbox version in the UK due to the <b>unfavourable</b> exchange rate and costs, although this changed after a small number were privately imported for insurance classification purposes. The EGS6 gearbox became an option for the 1.6 L VTi engine models shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Ellen Southard plied {{international}} trade routes from her homeport in Bath, Maine, with visits documented in ports {{as far away}} as Sydney, Australia. In 1864, she recorded the longest duration voyage of any ship transporting railway locomotives from the east to the west coast of the United States. The ship took 205 days to complete the passage after she was delayed for 48 days by <b>unfavourable</b> winds off Cape Horn.|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} on Appendix II {{as it has}} an <b>unfavourable</b> {{conservation}} status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. In addition, the fin whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered <b>unfavourable,</b> but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight {{made it possible for}} him to spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 3 {{received}} positive reviews, garnering an 85/100 rating at Metacritic for the PlayStation 2 version, and a 72/100 {{rating for}} the PC version. The PC version fared less well, with some reviewers drawing <b>unfavourable</b> comparisons to other combat-based games {{found on the}} PC platform, while others highlighted some technical issues, such as poor gamepad controller support.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} attempt, {{sponsored by}} Paul Allen and using his yacht Octopus, was abandoned after ten days in September 2012 due to <b>unfavourable</b> weather conditions. In 2015, {{the same team}} attempted a second recovery operation and the Hoods bell was finally retrieved on 7 August 2015. After conservation work, it was put {{on display in the}} museum in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies of the {{boatswain}} Cole, {{the carpenter}} Purcell, and the sailing master John Fryer were not <b>unfavourable</b> towards Heywood. However, Thomas Hayward's declared belief that Heywood {{was with the}} mutineers was damaging, as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood's alleged insolence in laughing and {{turning away from the}} captive Bligh—though Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Aagadu debuted with a {{positive}} response {{at the box office}} by crossing the US$1 million mark in two days including its paid previews at the United States box office. It collected 180.2 million in two days, which according to Indo-Asian News Service, was Mahesh's career best opener. By collecting a distributor share of 276 million in its first weekend globally, Aagadu became the second highest Telugu film with highest opening weekend figures. Due to <b>unfavourable</b> word of mouth, the film's business witnessed a drop and it collected 312 million in its first week, ending the week on an average note.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely <b>unfavourable</b> view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Cilla {{affected}} several {{islands in}} the South Pacific. The cyclone developed from a monsoon trough on January 26 northwest of Fiji, and initially moved to the east in conditions <b>unfavourable</b> for cyclones. After wind shear lessened, Cilla reached its peak intensity on January 28, attaining maximum winds of 75km/h (45mph) sustained over 10minutes. After slightly weakening, Cilla was able to intensify again to match this intensity on January 29. Strong vertical wind shear conditions then returned, and Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce <b>unfavourable</b> effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur's Operation Cartwheel {{began with}} {{spectacular}} {{victories in the}} landing at Lae and the landing at Nadzab but then faltered {{in the face of}} inclement weather, <b>unfavourable</b> terrain, and—above all—tenacious and aggressive Japanese opposition on land and in the air. The initiative passed to Major General Hatazō Adachi's Eighteenth Army which launched a series of counter-attacks against Major General George Wootten's 9th Division in the Battle of Finschhafen. At the Battle of Sattelberg, Wootten finally inflicted a crushing defeat on Adachi.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures <b>unfavourable</b> to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{elections}} for the Chamber of Deputies returned <b>unfavourable</b> results for Talleyrand. The ministry wished for moderate deputies, but the electorate voted almost exclusively for ultra-royalists, resulting in the so-called Chambre introuvable. The Duchess of Angoulême and the Count of Artois pressured King Louis for the dismissal of his obsolete ministry. Talleyrand tendered his resignation on 20 September. Louis XVIII chose the Duke of Richelieu to be his new Prime Minister. Richelieu was chosen because he was accepted by Louis's family and the reactionary Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could be a result of <b>unfavourable</b> observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in <b>unfavourable</b> conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E
5|$|Released on 19 September 2014 in 2000 screens globally, Aagadu {{opened to}} decent {{critical}} reception and debuted {{with a positive}} response at the box office. Due to <b>unfavourable</b> word of mouth and competition from new releases, Aagadu ended up collecting a distributor share of 342.5 million globally and was declared a box office bomb due to the high costs involved. However, Aagadu crossed the US$1 million mark at the United States box office in two days including its previews, which was considered a remarkable feat. The film was dubbed into Hindi as Encounter Shankar and into Tamil as Idhudhaanda Police.|$|E
5|$|The Congress governments under Reddy placed {{emphasis}} on rural development, agriculture and allied sectors. The shift towards industrialisation remained limited and was largely {{driven by the}} central government's investments in large public sector enterprises in the state. Reddy's first term as Chief Minister ended in 1960 after he resigned on being elected President of the Indian National Congress. In 1964, he resigned voluntarily following <b>unfavourable</b> observations made against the Government of Andhra Pradesh by the Supreme Court in the Bus Routes Nationalisation case.|$|E
5|$|The Irish {{complaint}} against Wood {{was not that}} they had enough copper coins, but that this would introduce too many coins of inferior quality into the Irish economy. These coins would remove valuable silver and gold coins from circulation in the Irish economy, and since the new copper coins would not be minted under Irish authority, {{there was no way}} for the Irish to control the quality and amount. Also, Wood's coin was only one example of allegedly <b>unfavourable</b> economic practices that hurt Ireland; the Irish wanted to have their own national bank and authority to mint their own coinage, and Wood's coin became a way to express their economic-nationalist desires.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark {{the supreme}} and {{dominating}} power in Northern Europe, yet failed {{to restore the}} Kalmar Union. <b>Unfavourable</b> conditions for Sweden led {{to a series of}} conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan's point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, now that they were no longer fighting each other.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{force was}} placed on alert to launch what had been {{designated}} Operation Paravane on 8 September. Good weather was vital for the operation, and the airmen waited at their home bases {{for the next two}} days as forecasts proved <b>unfavourable.</b> Meanwhile, the Air Ministry, No. 5 Group and British military liaison officers in the USSR continued to work with the relevant Soviet headquarters to finalise the arrangements for Force A's flight from Norway to Yagodnik.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story {{was certainly the}} church proper and the place of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the <b>unfavourable</b> rocky terrain, or it may have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E
5|$|The larval period {{can vary}} widely. A fungus feeding staphylinid Phanerota fasciata {{undergoes}} three moults in 3.2 days {{at room temperature}} while Anisotoma sp. (Leiodidae) completes its larval stage in the fruiting body of slime mold in 2 days and possibly represents the fastest growing beetles. Dermestid beetles, Trogoderma inclusum can remain in an extended larval state under <b>unfavourable</b> conditions, even reducing their size between moults. A larva {{is reported to have}} survived for 3.5 years in an enclosed container.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy German defence {{during the}} Battle of Narva denied the Soviets {{the use of}} Estonia as a {{favorable}} base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. Stavka's hopes of assaulting Finland from Estonia and forcing it into capitulation were diminished. Finnish Chief of Defence Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim repeatedly reminded the German side that in the event their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland {{would be forced to}} make peace even on extremely <b>unfavourable</b> terms. Thus, the prolonged Battle of Narva helped Finland avoid a Soviet occupation, sustained its capacity for resistance and enabled them to enter negotiations for the Moscow Armistice on their own terms.|$|E
5|$|The only warship {{reported}} wrecked on the Doom Bar was , a 12-gun schooner. The Whiting {{was originally}} a cargo ship named Arrow, which travelled from the United States to France; she {{was captured by}} the Royal Navy on 8 May 1812 and renamed. On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing and the wind was from an <b>unfavourable</b> direction offering little assistance. According to court-martial transcripts, an attempt to move her was made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and {{it was impossible to}} save her.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the loyalists, but Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it {{difficult}} to make further progress. John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country. Henry's government encouraged the rebel barons {{to come back to}} his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the 1215 Charter, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those <b>unfavourable</b> to the Papacy and clause 61, which had set up the council of barons. The move was not successful, and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.|$|E
5|$|William mustered {{his forces}} at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, {{and was ready}} to cross the English Channel by about 12 August. But the {{crossing}} was delayed, either because of <b>unfavourable</b> weather or to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships were blown off course and landed at Romney, where the Normans fought the local fyrd. After landing, William's forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.|$|E
5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when <b>unfavourable</b> weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 118Category4 hurricanes have been {{recorded}} in the eastern and central Pacific basins since 1900. Only two Category4 hurricanes {{have been recorded}} in May, in addition to 12in June, 22in July, 29in August, 32in September, 18in October, and two in November. No Category4 storms have developed during the off-season. It is theorized that global warming was responsible for an increase of 13Category4 and 5 storms that developed in the eastern Pacific, from 36in the period of 1975–1989 to 49in the period of 1990–2004. It was estimated that if sea-surface temperatures ascended by 2 to 2.5degrees, the intensity of tropical cyclones would increase by 6–10% internationally. During years with {{the existence of an}} El Niño, sea-surface temperatures increase in the eastern Pacific, resulting in an increase in activity as vertical wind shear decreases in the Pacific; the opposite happens in the Atlantic basin during El Niño, when wind shear increases creating an <b>unfavourable</b> environment for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. Contrary to El Niño, La Niña increases wind shear over the eastern Pacific and reduces it over the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so <b>unfavourable</b> to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E
5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being <b>unfavourable</b> to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very <b>unfavourable</b> conditions, notably that {{he would need to}} finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match, and he would need to win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E
