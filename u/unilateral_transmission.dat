40|$|AbstractLANS with {{confidential}} information are always being separated physically from internet to avoid hacker's attack, Trojan and virus. It is in high security, but also difficult to exchange among different security levels of networks synchronously. A new <b>unilateral</b> <b>transmission</b> {{system based on}} multiple channels & 2 D Code encoding and decoding technology has been put forward. The system uses light as the transmission carrier to insure its unilateralization from one network to others. Transmission speed reaches 10 KB/S. It is not costly, but being manipulated conveniently. In a word, the system is in high security and utility...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLateralization {{of motor}} control {{refers to the}} ability to produce pure {{unilateral}} or asymmetric movements. It is required for a variety of coordinated activities, including skilled bimanual tasks and locomotion. Here we discuss the neuroanatomical substrates and pathophysiological underpinnings of lateralized motor outputs. Significant breakthroughs {{have been made in the}} past few years by studying the two known conditions characterized by the inability to properly produce unilateral or asymmetric movements, namely human patients with congenital “mirror movements” and model rodents with a “hopping gait”. Whereas mirror movements are associated with altered interhemispheric connectivity and abnormal corticospinal projections, abnormal spinal cord interneurons trajectory is responsible for the “hopping gait”. Proper commissural axon guidance is a critical requirement for these mechanisms. Interestingly, the analysis of these two conditions reveals that the production of asymmetric movements involves similar anatomical and functional requirements but in two different structures: (i) lateralized activation of the brain or spinal cord through contralateral silencing by cross-midline inhibition; and (ii) <b>unilateral</b> <b>transmission</b> of this activation, resulting in lateralized motor output...|$|E
40|$|We present {{preliminary}} measured {{responses of}} a planar superconducting on/off switch operating at millimeter wavelengths. The superconducting switch, comprising three niobium nitride (NbN) bridges, is deposited across the slotline {{section of a}} back-to-back <b>unilateral</b> finline. The <b>transmission</b> characteristics of the superconducting switch illuminated by a millimeter source was measured using a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunnel junction as direct detector. The NbN bridges were switched from the superconducting state to the normal state by passing current through the bridges with magnitude that exceeds its critical current value. With this arrangement, we have measured a typical switching dynamic range of approximately 10 dB across the 205 – 240 GHz band, with the highest dynamic range of $sim$ 20 dB at 230 GHz. This demonstrated the successful operation of the multiple NbN bridges as a planar superconducting on/off switch...|$|R
