5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
25|$|Like the Indian Army, the Sri Lanka Army {{has largely}} {{retained}} the British-style regimental system that it inherited upon independence. The individual regiments (such as the Sri Lanka Light Infantry and the Sinha Regiment) operate independently and recruit their own members. Officers tend {{to remain in}} a single battalion throughout their careers. The infantry battalion, the basic <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> in field operations, includes five companies of four platoons each. Typical platoon have three squads (sections) of ten personnel each. In addition to the basic infantry forces, a commando regiment was also established in 1986. Support for the infantry is provided by an armoured regiment, five reconnaissance regiments, three mechanized infantry regiments, five field artillery regiments, a rocket artillery regiment, three commando regiments, three special forces regiments, six field engineering regiments, five signals battalions, a medical corps, {{and a variety of}} logistics units.|$|E
2500|$|The {{smallest}} <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> {{for both}} Plains and Subarctic people {{was what the}} European-Canadian explorers called a [...] "lodge". [...] A lodge was an extended family or other close-knit group who slept {{together in the same}} teepee or other dwelling. [...] Lodges travelled together in groups which anthropologists call [...] "bands". [...] In the case of the Blackfoot during the historic era this would include 10 to 30 lodges, or roughly 80 to 240 persons. [...] The band was the fundamental <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> on the Plains for both hunting and warfare. [...] Bands were loose associations that could be formed and dissolved depending on circumstances, which gave their member lodges much freedom, but also less certainty. [...] Therefore, people would also be socially bound to others in variety of other groups, such as common descent (a clan), common language and religion (a tribe), or a common age or rank (a ritual society or a warrior society).|$|E

2500|$|The basic <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> in the Church of the Nazarene is {{the local}} church congregation, which may be either an {{organized}} church or church-type mission (often known as [...] "New Starts"). At the end of September 2014, there were 21,425 organized churches and a further 7,970 church-type missions, {{for a total of}} 29,395 congregations. [...] The average Nazarene congregation globally has 78 members, and an average weekly worship attendance of 51. The largest congregation in the denomination as measured by average weekly attendance each Sunday morning (as of February 2009) was the Central De Campinas church on the Paulista Sudeste district in Brazil, which reported 8,216 members and an average weekly Sunday morning worship attendance of 7,237. During 2009 it received 873 new Nazarenes. The next four largest congregations were the Casa De Oracion Paso Ancho church in Colombia (4,600 members; 7,000 worship); the Americana church in Brazil; Grove City Church of the Nazarene in Grove City, Ohio; and College Church of the Nazarene in Olathe, Kansas.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of contact with Euro-Canadian observers, all of the {{indigenous}} peoples in Alberta belonged to several overlapping groups: lodges, bands, tribes, and confederacies. [...] The smallest unit was the lodge, which is what observers called an extended family or any other group {{living in the same}} dwelling such as a teepee or wigwam. [...] Several lodges living together formed a band. [...] Bands were highly mobile small groups consisting of a respected (male) leader sometimes called a chief, possibly his extended family, and other unrelated families. [...] The band was a fundamental <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>organization,</b> as a band was large enough to defend itself and engage in communal hunts, yet small enough to be mobile and to make decisions by consensus (leaders had only charismatic authority and no coercive power). [...] Lodges and individuals were free to leave bands, and bands regularly split in two or merged with another, yet no one would want to be without the protection of living in a band for very long. [...] Bands among the Peigan people in southern Alberta ranged in size from 10 to 30 lodges, or about 80 to 240 persons.|$|E
2500|$|As hunter-gatherers, {{the basic}} <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>organization</b> for Cree peoples was the lodge, {{a group of}} perhaps eight or a dozen people, usually the {{families}} of two separate but related married couples, [...] who lived {{together in the same}} wigwam (domed tent) or tipi (conical tent), and the band, a group of lodges who moved and hunted together. [...] In the case of disagreement lodges could leave bands, and bands could be formed and dissolved with relative ease, but as there is safety in numbers, all families would {{want to be part of}} some band, and banishment was considered a very serious punishment. [...] Bands would usually have strong ties to their neighbours through intermarriage and would assemble together at different parts of the year to hunt and socialize together. [...] Besides these regional gatherings, there was no higher-level formal structure, and decisions of war and peace were made by consensus with allied bands meeting together in council. [...] People could be identified by their clan, which is a group of people claiming descent from the same common ancestor; each clan would have a representative and a vote in all important councils held by the band (compare: Anishinaabe clan system).|$|E
