5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick Horne of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states {{that she was}} a maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes {{that she was a}} keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, and that her <b>uncle</b> (<b>who</b> officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was an expression of his grief.|$|E

During these meetings, Sarah tells Charles of her history, and asks for his emotional and social support. During the same period, he learns of the possible loss of place as heir to his elderly <b>uncle,</b> <b>who</b> has become engaged to a woman young enough to bear a child. Meanwhile, Charles's servant Sam {{falls in love with}} Mary, the maid of Ernestina's aunt.|$|E
5|$|Oswald of Worcester (died 29 February 992) was Archbishop of York from 972 to {{his death}} in 992. He was of Danish ancestry, but brought up by his uncle, Oda, who sent him to France to the abbey of Fleury to become a monk. After {{a number of years}} at Fleury, Oswald {{returned}} to England at the request of his <b>uncle,</b> <b>who</b> died before Oswald returned. With his uncle's death, Oswald needed a patron and turned to another kinsman, Oskytel, who had recently become Archbishop of York. His activity for Oskytel attracted the notice of Archbishop Dunstan who had Oswald consecrated as Bishop of Worcester in 961. In 972, Oswald was promoted to the see of York, although he continued to hold Worcester also.|$|E
5|$|Although Æthelwig {{was known}} for his loyalty to King William, he had an <b>uncle</b> <b>who</b> held land at Witton who died {{fighting}} for King Harold Godwinson, probably at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. While abbot, even after the Conquest, Æthelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the Anglo-Saxon style, not the Norman Romanesque which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys. Besides his administrative and legal duties, Æthelwig {{was known for}} his care for the sick and the poor, as well as lepers. After the Harrying of the North by King William in 1069–1070, Æthelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas. The Chronicon states that Æthelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, but it is possible that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.|$|E

5|$|Having {{finished}} his school career, Crawford joined the first MCC tour of South Africa in the 1905–06 season. The team {{was not particularly}} strong—before the tour, critics judged it to possess the equivalent strength of a moderate county side. The MCC was criticised by the press in both England and South Africa for omitting many of the strongest players. As {{the youngest member of}} the team, Crawford was given the traditional role of writing press reports to be sent back home during the tour. When the team played in Worcester during the tour, the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in South Africa. The 1906 Wisden carried the same story; in a comment on his success in 1905, it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play, and questioned whether, if he played Test cricket, he would do so for England or South Africa. The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why Wisden mentioned South Africa; Crawford's only known connection came through his <b>uncle,</b> <b>who</b> had left South Africa five years before.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth {{had been}} spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, {{and his first}} act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all {{official}} position. In mid 1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, {{his relationship with his}} <b>uncle,</b> <b>who</b> was living a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext of meeting the new emperor, had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay Weston Phipps was {{the second}} son of Pownoll Phipps and Phipps' third wife, the Irish-born Anna Charlotte Smith. Born at the family estate, Oaklands, in Tipperary, Ireland, he was named Ramsay in honor of an <b>uncle</b> <b>who</b> pioneered slave {{emancipation}} in the West Indies, and Weston after another uncle, a scientific clergyman. By 1841, his father had returned to England, to reside in Kent, where the family lived in Yalding. They lodged at the Parsonage with a local farmer, Ramsey Warde; Ramsey Warde was also a relative of Phipps' mother. The family of four included three-year-old Ramsay, his older brother, Pownoll (age five), his mother (age 30) and his father. Eventually, two more children joined the family: Henrietta Sophia and Robert Constantine, twins born 23 September 1841. The boy died 9 October, but Henrietta lived into adulthood, marrying Lieutenant-Colonel William Smith. After suffering a bout of measles in spring 1847, Ramsay Phipps attended Mr. Barron's School at Stanmore with his older brother, Pownoll, {{with the intent to}} following his brother {{in a year or two}} to Rugby in Warwickshire.|$|E
