40|$|In {{the early}} Therav›da Buddhist view, the bhavaºga, literally, the “ground of becoming, ” may be {{characterized}} as a relative vacuum state of consciousness, voided of all manner of mental activity known as javana. This appears to be identical to the substrate consciousness (›layavijñ›na) asserted in the later Great Perfection (Dzogchen) school of Tibetan Buddhism. This state of consciousness is presented not simply as a philosophical speculation but as an experienced mental phenomenon that can be accessed through the achievement of meditative quiescence (Ÿamatha).

40|$|Cryosorption pump is {{the only}} {{solution}} for pumping helium and hydrogen in fusion reactors. It is chosen because it offers highest pumping speed {{as well as the}} only suitable pump for the harsh environments in a tokamak. Towards the development of such cryosorption pumps, the optimal choice of the right activated carbon panels is essential. In order to characterize the performance of the panels with indigenously developed activated carbon, a cryocooler based cryosorption pump with scaled down sizes of panels is experimented. The results are compared with the commercial cryopanel used in a CTI cryosorption (model: Cryotorr 7) pump. The cryopanel is mounted on the cold head of the second stage GM cryocooler which cools the cryopanel down to 11 K with first stage reaching about similar to 50 K. With no heat load, cryopump gives the <b>ultimate</b> <b>vacuum</b> of 2. 1 E- 7 mbar.

40|$|AbstractOGMS, the OutGassing Measurement System, is a {{facility}} {{to measure the}} outgassing rates of materials. The rate is highly important factor in vacuum science dealing with systems working at pressures below 10 - 6 mbar. In ultra- high vacuum range it plays role in system pressure at given pumping speed. For standard materials the data is available in literature but at times not under condition of specific application. Many application use very specific materials under vacuum conditions. Cryoadsorption Cryopump a project at Institute for plasma Research uses steel samples coated with activated carbon as sorbents. Various kinds of sorbents were used. Necessity to measure the outgassing rate of such unique materials established the OGMS.

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{describes}} {{experimental study}} and performance improvement of 2 stage Gifford-McMahon (G-M) type pulse tube cryocooler for cryopump. The {{objective of this}} study is to improve the efficiency of 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler for substituting 2 stage G-M cryocooler used in cryopump. The target cooling capacities are 5 W at 20 K and 35 W at 80 K for the 1 st and the 2 nd stage, respectively. These values are good cooling capacities for vacuum level in medium size ICP 200 cryopump. Design of the 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler is conducted by FZKPTR(Forschungs Zentrum Karlsruhe Pulse Tube Refrigerator) program. In order to improve the performance of 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler, U-type pulse tube cryocooler is fabricated and connecting tubes are minimized for reducing dead volumes and pressure losses. Also, to get larger capacities, orifice valves and double inlet valves are optimized and the compressor of 6 kW is used. On the latest unit, the lowest temperatures of 2 stage pulse tube cryocooler are 42 K (1 st stage) and 8. 3 K (2 nd stage) and the cooling capacities are 40 W at 82. 9 K (1 st stage) and 10 W at 20. 5 K (2 nd stage) with 6. 0 kW of compressor input power. This pulse tube cryocooler is suited for commercial medium size cryopump.

An industrial installation "Nikolay " for vacuum arc deposition of decorative and protective coatings is presented.

It allows to deposit titanium nitride coatings having natural golden colour and titanium dioxide coatings having highly uniform interference colours.

Both accelerated tests on atmospheric corrosion and electrochemical tests of itanium nitride and titanium dioxide coatings on the stainless steel substrates were carried out. Hard coatings of refractory metal compounds (Ti, Zr, Cr, Mo, etc.) have more noble properties than steel substrates in an electrochemical sense. Therefore, the deposition of highly-porous nonuniform coatings can even accelerate the corrosion process caused by the formation of a galvanic couple of coating and substrate. It has been shown that the deposited coatings are very dence and have only very scarce individual pores due to the remaining Ti droplets. As a result, the highly decorative and biocompatible TiN and TiO 2 coatings do not deteriorate the corrosion resistance of stainless steel substrates...|$|E

40|$|Real time gas sensing is {{paramount}} to numerous applications in industry {{as well as}} in the consumer sector. Many gas sensing applications such as fossil energy production require low-cost, multi-species sensors that are able to operate in high-temperature, high-pollution environments under the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. Optical remote gas sensing using tunable lasers is regarded as the best sensing technology for hostile environments. However, optical technology often suffers from high component and operational costs. In this thesis, a tunable external-cavity fiber Bragg grating (FBG) diode laser was developed for spectroscopic chemical sensing. Although FBG lasers have been reported upon, previous works have focused primarily on telecommunications applications. This thesis reports the first application, to our best knowledge, of an FBG laser in chemical sensing. This fiber Bragg grating laser was comprised of an InGaAs/InP ridge-waveguide laser diode coupled to a length of SM- 28 fiber bearing an FBG. The FBG is stretched via a piezo-electric actuator to allow rapid fine tuning of the output wavelength of the laser. This tunable external-cavity semiconductor laser was demonstrated with over 10 nm of tuning range. The measured spectral width of the laser was instrument-limited at less than 50 pm over the entire tuning range. The application of such low-cost tunable FBG lasers to spectroscopic chemical sensing was demonstrated in acetylene (C 2 H 2) gas with a wavelength modulation spectroscopy technique. Both static and wavelength modulation absorption spectra of acetylene gas were observed by the tunable laser in acetylene partial pressures from 0. 1 mbar to 100 mbar; the lowest detectable pressure being limited by the <b>ultimate</b> <b>vacuum</b> pressure and length of our gas cell. In terms of other optical gas sensing devices such as Distributed FeedBack lasers, FBG lasers offer much lower manufacturing costs and better temperature stability (13 pm/ºK) over DFB lasers (> 100 pm/ºK). The low manufacturing cost, good temperature stability, wide tuning range, and high output power make FBG lasers excellent candidates for the application of chemical sensing in the near IR band...|$|E
