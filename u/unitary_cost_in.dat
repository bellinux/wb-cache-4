40|$|The {{traditional}} approach {{for the problems}} of sorting permutations by rearrangements is to consider that all operations have the same <b>unitary</b> <b>cost.</b> <b>In</b> this case, {{the goal is to}} find the minimum number of allowed rearrangements that are needed to sort a given permutation, and numerous efforts have been made over the past years regarding these problems. On the other hand, a long rearrangement (which is in fact a mutation) is more likely to disturb the organism. Therefore, weights based on the length of the segment involved may have {{an important role in the}} evolutionary process. In this paper we present the first results regarding problems of sorting permutations by length-weighted operations that consider rearrangement models with prefix and suffix variations of reversals and transpositions, which are the two most common types of genome rearrangements. Our main results are O (lg(2) n) -approximation algorithms for 10 such problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} ethanol cost- effectiveness with regards to carbon dioxide emissions. Actually, bio-fuel production is only viable thanks to the tax credit policy resulting in economic ‘deadweight’ loss. The environmental performance is assessed under the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework. Economic burden to society to support the activity divided by avoided CO 2 equivalent emissions indicates the bio-ethanol cost effectiveness. Agricultural feedstock supply that comprises of sugarbeets, grains and industrial processing sub-models are articulated in a regional sector model. The maximization of total welfare determines optimal crop mix for farmers and the best configurations for industry. This is illustrated for bio-ethanol produced by the ex-sugar industry in Thessaly, Greece. Life cycle activity analysis showed that, at the optimum, CO 2 emission is reduced between 1 and 1. 5 t of carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of ethanol. The <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> falls <b>in</b> the range of 100 to 250 euro per ton of CO 2 and it is remarkably dependent on the agricultural policy scenario.

40|$|In {{line with}} the {{continuous}} improvement theory, the learning phenomenon is often incorporated into models for predicting {{the evolution of the}} <b>unitary</b> quality <b>costs.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, the quality metric predicted is the rate of supplied non-conforming units through a learning process with autonomous and induced sources of experience. The former is simply learning by doing, i. e. supplying, whilst the latter is driven by the allocation of training hours to suppliers. A revised learning model with time-varying learning rates is proposed for embracing both these effects into a multistage assembly/production setting. A single-period prevention–appraisal–failure cost function is achieved, and the sample inspection rates adopted among suppliers are also considered in order to evaluate their effect. If these sample rates are given, the goal of allocating the training hours among suppliers is pursued by means of integer linear programming. Otherwise, a mixed-integer quadratic problem arises for the concurrent allocation of training hours and inspection sample rates among suppliers. A case study is finally carried out for demonstrating the applicability of the model, as well as for providing managerial insights...|$|R
40|$|The cost of {{production}} absorbs expenses which behave differently {{in relation to the}} activity level (variable expenses), whatever the level of activity (fixed or structure expenses) is. The influence of these two categories of expenses is felt on the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost.</b> Cost variation is determined only by changes in activity, because the same fixed costs will be distributed to a greater or smaller number of products. Therefore, if the activity level increases, the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> tends to fall and vice versa, if the activity level decreases, the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> tends to increase. To avoid the inconvenience of the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> variation when the activity level changes, a cost above the normal activity was decided to be set.

30|$|A {{simplified}} method {{has been used}} for quantifying the impact of the insulation material characteristics of the manufacture process on the economic, energetic and environmental optimum insulation thicknesses. The large influence of the parameters associated with the manufacturing phase of the insulation materials on the determination of the optimum thickness has been clearly shown. For all the optimization points of views studied, the insulation thickness depends in a large way on the <b>unitary</b> <b>costs</b> associated to the fabrication of the materials. The biggest differences in thickness between two different isolation materials correspond to the highest difference <b>in</b> the <b>unitary</b> <b>costs.</b> As a consequence, the differences for energetic or environmental optimization assessments are larger than for the economic one.

Microalgae has huge potential {{for the production of}} biodiesel suitable for application as transportation fuel thereby mitigating emission of harmful and greenhouse gases. The present work provides conceptual process design and economic feasibility analysis for microalgae cultivation and extraction of oil and conversion of microalgal oil into biodiesel using Aspen plus. In the present work, the nannochloropsis salina was considered as microalgae species with chemical formula of C 50 H 50 O 30 N 7. The microalgae were cultivated in a tubular photo bioreactor [...] In the present work, microalgal oil was considered as a mixture of triglycerides containing three same fatty acid groups in the structure. The physicochemical properties of these triglycerides and microalgae were included in Aspen Plus to regress the property methods. The regressed property method was then used for techno-economic analysis for various plant capacities. The <b>unitary</b> production <b>cost</b> of biodiesel decreased slightly with increasing plant capacity. 0. 125 MMT microalgal oil/annum was considered as the optimum plant capacity.

40|$|The {{proposed}} paper aims {{first to}} evaluate the full <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> of the grape production in different condition of soil position and targeting different quality objectives. In addition, the paper evaluate analytically {{the composition of the}} production cost and the opportunities to optimise the single <b>cost</b> items <b>in</b> the different conditions. As the grape production cost is becoming and increasing competitive factors in the wine business, the general purpose of the paper is to make available for the scientific and professional community a set of production cost analytically demonstrated and clearly related to specific contexts. This information about cost can be useful to orient research and extension efforts and to develop consistent budget in the firms. Data are obtained in restricted areas but the results of the analysis can be generalised to other areas with similar climatic conditions. Four cases are discussed. One case in very sloped conditions: production of grape for superpremium wine in Ischia Island; three cases with a ordinary soil position: production of grape for top basic (or popular premium), premium and ultrapremium wines in the Taburno area. In the selected areas has been collected information about the standard cultural practices (trellis systems and canopy management, soil management, pest control, nutrition, harvest) and yields concerning the different qualitative objectives and on the base of this information, has been defined the set of representative production processes. The cost investigation has been applied to these processes. Data analysis allowed to compute the threshold price able to completely remunerate the initial and current cost of the cultivation in the different studied cases and shown that the canopy management represent always a very critical cost item, varying from 35 to 60 % in the different cases. Data therefore indicates {{that it is necessary to}} optimise canopy management in order to reduce as much as possible his aggregate cost and to maximise his efficiency, targeting to obtain the planned yield. The comparison between the computed full <b>unitary</b> <b>costs</b> and the current paid grape prices reveals that grape producers obtain a price able to cover all costs only producing standard grape; the production of value and high value grape in non completely remunerated and only the annual cost are covered. The technical analysis of the studied processes shown that is possible to define in the different cases specific path to optimise the cropping practices (canopy management and other cultural practices), maximising the crop efficiency, moving in some cases from manual to mechanized operations or optimising the manual operations; the economic analysis allowed to quantify the cost reduction that can be obtained following the defined improvement path and to develop a set of optimised <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> for the different studied cases. With regard to the introduction of mechanical operations, the proposed paper considers the constraints in terms of farm dimension or area served by a single machine and, in addition, analyses in detail the consequences in terms of vineyard operations organisation and risk management of the different improvement path. Finally, the analysis demonstrate that also in an optimised situation in terms of cropping practices the production cost for grapes destined to premium and superpremium wines remain very high and emerge the urgency to understand completely the trade-off between grape quality and yield in order to explore the possibility to increase the target yield determining a relevant positive effect on the <b>unitary</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an evolutionary}} two-country model to characterize long run location {{patterns of the}} manufacturing activities of competing multinational enterprises. Firms located in country 1 can decide to offshore their manufacturing activities to country 2. The profitability of production in a country depends on several factors: <b>unitary</b> <b>costs</b> of production, the number of firms that are located in each country, within-country spillovers, and cross-border spillovers. Furthermore, profits in country 2 are influenced by congestion costs. Country 1 {{is assumed to be}} technologically advanced and has an advantage in terms of internal spillovers. In contrast, country 2 offers lower production unit cost which, however, may be offset by congestion costs. The firms’ (re) location choices are based on a simple comparison of current production <b>costs</b> obtained <b>in</b> the two countries and the dynamics of switching is modeled by a simple replicator dynamics. The global analysis of the resulting one-dimensional dynamical system reveals that a large advantage in terms of <b>unitary</b> production <b>costs</b> encourages the firms to off-shore manufacturing activities to country 2. This off-shoring process stops when congestion costs offset this advantage of country 2, even though congestion costs do not cause all manufacturing activities to be re-shored to country 1. The re-shoring process can be accelerated by an increase of within-country spillovers in country 1, while cross-border spillovers tend to favor a geographic dispersion of manufacturing activities and make location patterns that lead to suboptimal long run outcomes less likely...|$|R

Investigations were carried out both by experiments and by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at different Reynolds numbers, ranging from creeping flow to turbulent flow regimes. Experiments (for intermediate to high Re) made use of thermochromic liquid crystals along with digital image processing. Computational results (for low to intermediate Re) were obtained via steady state (low Re) or direct numerical simulations (intermediate Re) along with the unit cell approach. A good agreement between experiments and CFD results was obtained in the range of superposition. Results showed that woven spacers guarantee a better mixing than overlapped ones, especially in the low to intermediate Re range, thus resulting in Nusselt numbers 2. 5 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 33 times higher.

Against traditional estimation methods, that needs to wait until the technical description of the product is completed, there exist new methods allowing to estimate the cost quickly and with an acceptable accuracy. Complementarily to cost management methods (for example, standard cost management analytic or Activity-Based Costing techniques), such new cost estimation methods may shorten the design phase when the rapidity of the conception is needed. This way may be valid when there is a huge number of models, and/or high level of new design rate.

Traditional and innovative on-demand transport services, such as taxi and carsharing respectively {{can provide the}} level of flexibility to the public transport needed for providing both a better service while reducing the exploitation <b>costs.</b> <b>In</b> this context, the study aims to improve the efficiency of on-demand transport systems, mainly taxi and carsharing {{through the development of}} analytical models and their application to the city of Barcelona. The optimization of the fleet management and the allocation of resources aim to ensure both the level of service of public transport users and the agency’s productivity and profitability. The decision variables are the fleet size (number of vehicles) as well as the number and capacity of the depots or stands. Two models are presented, one for the provision of taxi stand services and one for the provision of one way carsharing services. Both models are applied to the demand for taxi services of the city of Barcelona, presenting for each model the optimum number of vehicles and depots, the depots’ capacity, the system <b>unitary</b> <b>costs</b> and the level of service. Although the results show that the performance of both systems is very similar, the taxi service is up to 3 times more expensive due to the extra cost from the need for having a driver.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{understand}} some of the processes involved in the selection of appropriate tasks, and in the selection of correct responses to those tasks. The main focus of the following experiments will be on how interference and conflict occurs during these processes, either at the perceptual or action selection stages when switching task. It should be possible to demonstrate with increases to the number of attributes, the experience of tasks associated with non-target attributes, and in varying the number of trials before switching tasks, that task selection consists of several stages or processes, and that these processes do not necessarily interact. This will show that the switch cost is not an <b>unitary</b> <b>cost</b> associated with changing a single response-stimulus setting, task parameter, or an overall task set, but a composite of various costs associated with different task selection processes.

40|$|The {{conclusions}} of the Bertrand model of competition are substantially altered {{by the presence of}} either differentiated goods or asymmetric information about rival’s production <b>costs.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we consider a Bertrand competition, with differentiated goods. Furthermore, we suppose that each firm has two different technologies, and uses one of them according to a certain probability distribution. The use of either one or the other technology affects the <b>unitary</b> production <b>cost.</b> We show that this game has exactly one Bayesian Nash equilibrium. We do ex-ante and ex-post analyses of firms’ profits and market prices. We prove that the expected profit of each firm increases with the variance of its production costs. We also show that the expected price of each good increases with both expected production costs, being the effect of the expected production costs of the rival dominated by the effect of the own expected production costs...|$|R
30|$|The {{downside}} {{of such a}} strategy is that increasing the kind and number of functions to be performed in-house {{is not at all}} trivial, especially for small farms. Farms that wish to engage in the final product market necessarily need, at least to some extent, to perform more tasks and reorganize the whole process and set of functions. The challenges involved in the process are frequently neglected or undervalued. First, dealing with the final consumer is complex, takes time, and requires appropriate facilities and specific competences. Producers are usually not trained to this end and tend to underestimate competences and investments that may be necessary. The lack of awareness not only pertains to the marketing sphere but also the other tasks that will be performed internally. Referring again to the previous section, it is clear how operating the different tasks at scales that may not be optimal adds causes of inefficiencies that influence <b>unitary</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|R
