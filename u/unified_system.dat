5|$|The {{measure and}} weight {{systems for the}} large {{mainland}} part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the <b>unified</b> <b>system</b> was {{essentially the same as}} that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10drachms, rather than the usual8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike {{in the rest of the}} Romance region, was divided into 20grains. The existence of a unit called aureo, the equivalent of 1½ dramme, is interesting because 6 aurei were 9 dramme. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an aureo would have been ⅙ of an ounce.|$|E

Simulation results, obtained by using MATLAB, show that the proposed sliding mode has employed an appropriate approach against uncertainties and to reduce the chattering phenomenon that often occurs with sliding mode controllers...|$|R

25|$|Among Galen's major {{contributions}} to medicine was {{his work on}} the circulatory system. He was the first to recognize that there are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single <b>unified</b> <b>system</b> of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus. Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later shown to be incorrect by Ibn al-Nafis.|$|E
40|$|Adaptive neural {{stabilization}} {{control for}} <b>unified</b> chaotic <b>systems</b> with full state constraints Dong-Juan Li This paper presents an adaptive control strategy for a <b>unified</b> chaotic <b>system</b> with unknown functions and full state constraints. The unknown {{functions in the}} <b>unified</b> chaotic <b>system</b> are approximated by using the radial basis function neural networks. At present, {{a great many of}} the results for chaotic system neglect the situation of full state constraints. In the proposed scheme, we successfully utilize the barrier Lyapunov function approach to prevent the full state from violating constraint condition. In addition, when the full state constraints are considered, the computation online burden is very large in the previous works. In contrast with the existing results for <b>unified</b> chaotic <b>system,</b> the number of the adaptation laws has only two. The state feedback controllers and the adaptive laws for estimating the uncertainties were derived based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, it is proved that all the signals in the <b>unified</b> chaotic <b>system</b> are bounded and the constraints are not violated. The performance of the proposed scheme was validated by using a simulation example...|$|R

500|$|The pipe roll for 1155–1156 {{has several}} entries which declare that Nigel was making {{decisions}} about monetary affairs and issuing writs, but later pipe rolls do not contain any such entries. It appears likely that after the initial reorganization of the Exchequer, Nigel's involvement lessened. He continued to be active, though, and obtained tax exemptions and other privileges {{until his death in}} 1169. His son, Richard fitzNeal, who is the main source for information about Nigel's career in the Exchequer, stated that he fulfilled Nigel's treasury duties when Nigel was ill. Nigel continued to spar with Robert, the Earl of Leicester, and Richard fitzNeal relays a story about Nigel and Robert confronting each other at the Exchequer over traditional exemptions of the barons of the Exchequer, or judges of the Exchequer. Among the reforms carried out by Nigel were the restoration of the [...] "blanch farm" [...] system, whereby a random sample of coins was assayed and any shortage was collected from the sheriff, and the restoration of collections from a swath of counties that had quit paying taxes during Stephen's reign. The most substantial change was the return to a <b>unified</b> <b>system</b> of finances, which in turn required a reconciliation of the two different systems in use by Stephen and Matilda. Despite Nigel's reinstatement to the Exchequer, and the nomination of his son as treasurer, Nigel did not enjoy the power that his uncle had wielded under Henry I. The exact date of Richard's appointment as treasurer is obscure, but it was sometime between 1158 and 1160, as he is securely attested as treasurer in 1160. The Liber Eliensis states that Nigel paid the king £400 to secure the office for Richard. Some historians have seen Nigel as Henry II's [...] "minister of finance".|$|E
