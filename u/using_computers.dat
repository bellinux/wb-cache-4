5|$|Theorists {{have worked}} to {{understand}} these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated <b>using</b> <b>computers.</b> Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than {{the details of how}} they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this survey study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of teachers on the usage of computers in elementary schools of two countries (Turkey and TRNC). The data for this study was collected through a survey from the teachers in Erzurum and Lefkoşa (Nicosia). A total of 250 elementary school teachers from the schools of two cities participated in the research. The survey results indicated that teachers in both countries had a positive attitude toward the <b>use</b> of <b>computers</b> in schools. They commonly thought that computers may develop student motivation, skills, interest and achievement if they were used effectively. They also think that the future will be based on the knowledge of information technology. Turkish Cypriot teachers <b>use</b> <b>computers</b> mostly for correspondences, preparing exam questions and course materials. On the other hand Turkish teachers mainly <b>used</b> <b>computers</b> for preparing course materials, exam questions, calculating student grades and lesson plans.

Notwithstanding, {{numerous studies have}} indicated that teachers do not <b>use</b> <b>computers</b> in teaching mathematics to a sufficient extent. This study was aimed at exploring the reasons for insufficient <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> by teachers, i. e. at examining the variables which may affect the acceptance of innovative <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> in teaching mathematics. Hence, the intention to <b>use</b> <b>computers</b> in teaching mathematics in primary school was explored on the sample of 455 pre-service class teachers and mathematics teachers from Serbia. The technology acceptance model was extended by external variables and the following were observed as the predictors of intention to <b>use</b> <b>computers</b> in teaching mathematics: students’ attitudes towards computers, their perception of usefulness of computers in teaching mathematics, perceived ease of use, technological pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics, experience with use, subjective norms, technological complexity and content knowledge in mathematics. Structural equation modelling has shown that the proposed model had a good fit and that the selected variables were significant predictors of the intention to <b>use</b> <b>computers.</b> The proposed model explained 23. 7 % of variance in the intention to <b>use</b> <b>computers.</b> It has been shown that the intention to <b>use</b> <b>computers</b> is directly predicted by dominant technological pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics, students’ attitudes towards computers and their experience, while it is indirectly predicted by perceived usefulness, subjective norm, technological complexity and content knowledge in mathematics. In accordance with the presented findings, the final part provides recommendations that may be beneficial for advancing the education of pre-service class teachers and mathematics teachers...|$|R
