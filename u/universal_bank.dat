Under conditions we describe, allowing banks to take equity positions in firms strengthens their ability to extract surplus, and exacerbates problems of moral hazard.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the U.

This paper analyzes the cost and profit efficiency of European financial conglomerates and <b>universal</b> <b>banks.</b> We find that conglomerates are more revenue efficient than their specialized competitors and {{that the degree of}} both cost and profit efficiency is higher in <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> than in non-universal banks. These results indicate that the current trend towards further de-specialization may lead to a more efficient banking system. An investigation of the equity betas under varying business cycle conditions supports the hypothesis of superior monitoring capabilities on the part of <b>universal</b> <b>banks.</b> Finally, profit regressions suggest that operational efficiency has become the major determinant of bank profitability and that oligopolistic rents have become less prevalent in European banking.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{descriptive}} research aimed at accessing and describing customers’ expectation and perception of service quality in the banking industry of Ghana, and subsequently identifying the dimensions of service quality that drives customer perceived service quality in the banking industry of Ghana. The target population {{of the study was}} customers of <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> in Ghana. In all 1000 customers of <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> in Ashanti region were selected as the sample size of the study. The findings of the study revealed that the critical factors of service quality among <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> in Ghana are five factors which are named: Physical Environment, Reliability, Responsive, Assurance and Empathy. Customers’ perception of the level of excellence of service quality of the <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> was found to be below their expectation. However, customers’ perception of the level of excellence of physical environment dimension and the reliability dimension were found to be of customers’ expectations. The findings of the study revealed that the most influential dimension that drives customers perception of overall service quality is the empathy dimension. It was found that background characteristics such as gender, age, income level, and academic qualifications of customers of <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> have significant influence on customers’ perception and expectation of service quality. It is recommended that greater emphasis should be placed on empathy since it is found to be the most influential factor of overall service quality perception of customers of <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> in Ghana. Policy makers of <b>universal</b> <b>banks</b> should factor in customers’ background characteristics when formulating policies on improving service quality.
