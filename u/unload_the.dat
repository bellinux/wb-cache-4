5|$|Timothy Bloodworth was {{withdrawn}} from the Reserve Fleet on 6 July 1954. It is not reported where the ship went {{or whether it was}} under her own power, but she reentered the fleet on 17 July, loaded with grain. On 29 October 1956, after {{a little more than two}} years, she was again {{withdrawn from the}} reserve fleet to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> grain, and was returned empty on 6 November.|$|E
5|$|Tinian's harbor {{suffered}} from congestion due to extensive base development work, and ships sometimes took months to <b>unload.</b> <b>The</b> {{director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., went to Purnell, who arranged for an order from King to Nimitz stating that all shipments related to the Manhattan Project and the 509th Composite Group had to be unloaded immediately on arrival, regardless of the consequent disruption to the port's operations.|$|E
5|$|When Amato breaks his {{telephone}} in a rage, he finds {{one of the}} surveillance devices. Tubbs quickly calls him, claiming to have been bugged as well, and the two arrange to move the buy to that evening. Amato is noticeably on-edge during the meet, and is desperate to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> missiles. The buy is set to {{take place at the}} docks, and the remainder of the Metro-Dade vice squad arrive with federal agents to complete the bust, taking Amato into custody safely.|$|E

30|$|Although we have skipped {{dealing with}} <b>the</b> <b>unloading</b> process, control {{methodology}} of the robot {{in this process}} may be more complicated than in the loading process. Here, <b>the</b> <b>unloading</b> position is sometimes {{in the corner of}} the work environment and it is not easy to consider how the handcart transport robots move to avoid <b>the</b> <b>unloaded</b> object at <b>the</b> corner of <b>the</b> environment after <b>unloading</b> <b>the</b> object.|$|R
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock. After only two days the site had to be {{abandoned}} as a storm swept in from the Atlantic. It was a further six days before they could resume the punishing schedule of 16 hours a day work between 4am and 8pm. Fearing sea sickness, many of the man preferred to attempt {{to sleep on the}} damp rocks than on the ever-rolling Pharos.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, the Terra Nova {{arrived at}} the {{beginning}} of February, and Atkinson decided to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered. When Atkinson belatedly left for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he encountered the scurvy-ridden Edward ("Teddy") Evans who needed urgent medical attention. Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to send the short-sighted Cherry-Garrard on 25 February, who was not able to navigate, only as far as One Ton depot (which is within sight of Mount Erebus), effectively cancelling Scott's orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March.|$|E
5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and <b>unload,</b> <b>the</b> hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E

5|$|As an {{insufficient}} number of transport aircraft were {{allocated to the}} brigade, it was only possible to transport the 3rd Parachute Battalion by air. The rest of the brigade arrived at Algiers on 12 November, with some of its stores arriving slightly later. By the evening, reconnaissance parties had travelled to the airfield at Maison Blanche, with {{the remainder of the}} brigade following on the morning of 13 November; it was quartered in Maison Blanche, Maison Carree and Rouiba. After several ambitious airborne operations were planned but then cancelled by British First Army, on 14 November it directed that a single parachute battalion would be dropped the next day near Souk el-Arba and Béja; the battalion was to contact French forces at Beja to ascertain whether they would remain neutral, or support the Allies; secure and guard the crossroads and airfield at Soul el Arba; and patrol eastwards to harass German forces. 1st Parachute Battalion was selected for the task, to which Hill objected. The battalion had been forced to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> vessel carrying its supplies and equipment itself, and had also to arrange its own transportation to Maison Blanche as no drivers were provided at Algiers; when it had arrived at Maison Blanche, it had been subjected to several Luftwaffe air raids that targeted the airfield. Hill argued that as a result his men were exhausted, and he did not believe all of the battalion's equipment could be sorted out within twentyfour hours; as such he asked for the operation to be postponed for a short period, but this was denied.|$|E
5|$|As {{day three}} dawned, the Staffords, and the 1st Parachute Battalion {{attacked}} at 04:00, their first objective being {{to link up}} with the 3rd Parachute Battalion trapped around St Elizabeth's Hospital. The attack failed but allowed Major-General Urquhart to rejoin the division from {{a position where he}} had been trapped by the Germans. This allowed Brigadier Hicks to resume command of the brigade, whereupon Urquhart dispatched Colonel Barlow to take over command of 1st Parachute Brigade and co-ordinate the attack in Arnhem. He left in a jeep and was killed in a mortar barrage just outside Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade, still holding landing zone 'L' for the expected Polish and resupply gliders, then came under attack from the west and north-west. During the night the KOSB had tried to take the high ground at Koepel, but were stopped by heavy machine gun fire and instead dug in. The remainder of 4th Parachute Brigade advancing north of the railway line also encountered a strong German defence line and were unable to progress any further. All three battalions were ordered to withdraw south of the railway line towards Wolfheze. Although the northern most battalion of the KOSB had thus far enjoyed a quiet morning, in the two hours it took them to advance south of the railway, two companies were now cut off and the entire battalion transport lost. Still under fire from the pursuing Germans, the battalions crossed landing zone 'L' just as the third lift gliders were landing. While attempting to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> gliders the Poles came under fire. Assuming the approaching men were Germans, they opened fire and caused some casualties.|$|E

25|$|During World War II the crane's heavy {{capacity}} {{came into}} its own. A Landing Craft Flotilla Unit was stationed on Princes Wharf, and over 1000 new assault landing craft were delivered by road for adaptation {{for use in}} the Far East. The crane was used to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> lorries and to launch the craft after completion, a total of over 2000 lifts in three years.|$|E
25|$|One {{practice}} not {{encouraged by}} management was disconnecting helper locomotives on the fly. The engineer of the helper would back {{off on the}} throttle to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> coupler, and the fireman would pull the pin to separate the two engines. The helper would then sprint ahead to the siding, throw the switch, pull off the line, and reset the switch, preferably all before the train arrived at the turnout.|$|E
25|$|Ports in the Persian Gulf were {{overwhelmed}} {{by the amount of}} cargo arriving from allied countries, and so John W. Brown was forced to lie at anchor for a month until she could begin to unload at Abadan, Iran, where she dropped off the two P-40s and some of the tanks in late January 1943. It took another month and a half until she could enter port at Khorramshahr, Iran, and <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> rest of her cargo in March 1943.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} force, the rubber band was harder to stretch {{when it was}} being loaded than when it was being unloaded. In terms of time, when <b>the</b> band is <b>unloaded,</b> <b>the</b> effect (the length) lagged behind the cause (the force of the weights) because the length has not yet reached the value it had for the same weight during the loading part of the cycle. In terms of energy, more energy was {{required}} during the loading than <b>the</b> <b>unloading,</b> <b>the</b> excess energy being dissipated as heat.|$|R

25|$|The 8 × 10 cameras he {{preferred}} were large and heavy, {{and due to}} the weight {{and the cost of}} the film he never carried more than twelve sheet film holders with him. At the end of each day, he had to go into a darkroom, <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> film holders and load them with new film. This was especially challenging when he was traveling since he had to find a darkened room somewhere or else set up a makeshift darkroom made from heavy canvas.|$|E
25|$|The dabbawala {{then takes}} them to a sorting place, where he and other {{collecting}} dabbawalas sort the lunch boxes into groups. The grouped boxes are put in the coaches of trains, with markings to identify the destination of the box (usually there is a designated car for the boxes). The markings include the railway station to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> boxes and the destination building delivery address. Some modern infrastructure improvements such as the Navi Mumbai Metro are not used in the supply chain, as cabins {{do not have the}} capacity for hundreds of tiffins.|$|E
25|$|At this time, Allied {{forces were}} working {{to push the}} Ottoman Troops back from the Canal and deep into the desert. To get their {{supplies}} in, {{it was decided that}} a railway would be built by the engineers. There was however a slight problem. There was no way to get the locomotives needed onto these rails. The Bridging Train was therefore tasked with building new wharves to <b>unload</b> <b>the</b> locomotives that would be needed for the desert trains, which they did by converting two small vessels into floating pile drivers.|$|E
