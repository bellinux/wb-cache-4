40|$|Since {{the advent}} of low {{friction}} arthroplasty by Sir John Charnley, total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been proven {{to be an effective}} treatment for advanced hip disease. There has been a {{rise in the number of}} cases of THA, particu-larly in younger, active individuals over the past decade. Therefore, the search for an ideal <b>bearing</b> <b>surface,</b> which is important for the longevity of THA, is receiving more attention. The <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> should have superior wear One of the most important issues in the modern total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the <b>bearing</b> <b>surface.</b> Extensive research on bear-ing surfaces is being conducted to seek an ideal <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> for THA. The ideal <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> for THA should have superior wear characteristics and should be durable, bio-inert, cost-effective, and easy to implant. However, <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> that are currently being implemented do not completely fulfill these requirements, especially for young individuals for whom implant lon-gevity is paramount. Even though various new <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been investigated, research is still ongoing, and only short-term results have been reported from clinical trials. Future <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be developed in the following ways: (1) change in design, (2) further improvement of polyethylene, (3) surface modification of the metal, (4) improvement in the ceramic, and (5) us...|$|R

We reviewed the first 126 patients (131 hips) who had a large-head (36 -mm) MOM <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> to report the early clinical outcome and especially to determine the occurrence of dislocation and wear-related concerns. The minimum followup was 5  years (mean, 5. 6  years; range, 5 – 7  years). We found a 98 % survivorship free of component revision. No hips had been revised for dislocation. Three hips (2 %) had small femoral osteolytic lesions. Because this series of patients did not completely represent our experience with this <b>bearing</b> <b>surface,</b> we queried our database for the 828 patients (945 hips) that had the same <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> from April 2001 to December 2008.

Results of analysis of wear on industrial dies were combined with results obtained in laboratory wear tests. The main influential parameters in this study refer to contact pressure, die design, length of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface,</b> quality of nitrided layer, surface preparation prior coating and maintenance. It was found that lower quality of nitrided layer in combination with short <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> and occurrence of increased contact pressure close to exit edge of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> can considerably decrease die service time and that appropriate shaping of die contours around inlet and outlet areas of <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> has decisive influence on die service time...|$|R
40|$|Diameter and {{diametral}} clearance of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of metal-on-metal hip implants {{and structural}} supports have been recognised as key factors {{to reduce the}} dry contact and hydrodynamic pressures and improve lubrication performance. On the other hand, application of aspherical <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> can also significantly affect the contact mechanics and lubrication performance by changing the radius of the curvature of a <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> and consequently improving the conformity between the head and the cup. In this study, a novel metal-on-metal hip implant employing a specific aspherical <b>bearing</b> <b>surface,</b> Alpharabola, as the acetabular surface was investigated for both contact mechanics and elastohydrodynamic lubrication under steady-state conditions. When compared with conventional spherical <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> a more uniform pressure distribution and a thicker lubricant film thickness within the loaded conjunction were predicted for this novel Alpharabola hip implant. The effects of the geometric parameters of this novel acetabular surface on the pressure distribution and lubricant thickness were investigated.

In this study of 53 retrieved LH-MOM hip replacements, we sought to determine the relative contributions of the <b>bearing</b> and taper <b>surfaces</b> to the total wear volume. Prior to revision, we recorded the relevant clinical variables, including whole blood cobalt and chromium levels. Volumetric wear of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> was measured using a coordinate measuring machine and of the taper surfaces using a roundness measuring machine. The mean taper wear volume was lower than the combined <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> wear volume (p = 0. 015). On average the taper contributed 32. 9 % of the total wear volume, and in only 28 % cases was the taper wear volume greater than the <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> wear volume.

A number of unique mechanisms of failure, including fracture, squeaking, and adverse tissue reactions, {{have been reported}} with these hard <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, the incidence varies among the published studies. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To confirm the incidences, we identified the etiologies of early failures of hard-on-hard <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> for ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal THAs. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 2907 THAs with hard-on-hard <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> implanted between 1996 and 2009; 1697 (58 %) had ceramic-on-ceramic and 1210 (42 %) had metal-on-metal <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We recorded bearing-related complications and compared them to nonspecific reasons for revision THA. The minimum followup of the ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal cohorts was 6 months (mean, 48 months; range, 6 - 97 months) and 24 months (mean, 60 months; range, 24 - 178 months), respectively. RESULTS: The overall revision rate for ceramic-on-ceramic THA was 2. 2 % (38 of 1697), with aseptic loosening accounting for 55 % of revisions (femur or acetabulum). The bearing accounted for 13 % of the revisions in the ceramic-on-ceramic THA cohort. The overall metal-on-metal revision rate was 5. 4 % (65 of 1210), 17 involving adverse tissue reactions related to the metal-on-metal <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> (17 of 1210, 1. 4 % of cases; 17 of 65, 26 % of revisions). CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six percent of the revisions from metal-on-metal and 13 % of ceramic-on ceramic were bearing related. The overall short- to medium-term revision rate was 2. 2 % and 5. 4 % for ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-metal, respectively.
