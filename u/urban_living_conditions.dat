40|$|Research into eastern European housing reform {{indicates}} that privatization {{has been accompanied}} by processes of social and physical exclusion and segregation. Has the Chinese housing reform been accompanied by similar problems? This paper addresses this question by examining the early evidence on the social and spatial consequences of housing reform. It begins with a discussion of the particular social and spatial patterns of Chinese cities developed {{during the early years of}} Communist control and then examines the social and spatial impacts of housing reform. It is argued that although housing reform has brought significant changes to the housing provision system and improved many <b>urban</b> residents' <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> it has not entirely broken the traditional system. Reform was to a large extent carried out within work-unit establishments and has had very different impacts for different social and economic groups.

There was significant construction and renovation of rural housing. The number of new housing units available to cooperative members rose dramatically in the 1960s and then leveled off, although the number fluctuated from year to year. The general improvement in the amenities did not benefit agricultural workers alone; in the early 1970s, over 40% of all industrial workers lived in the countryside.|$|R

These sociological and political foundations are interesting when considered against the various applications and permeations of neighbourhood planning (see Urban Application).|$|E

40|$|Urban {{places and}} health equity {{are two of}} the most {{challenging}} concepts for 21 st century environmental health. More people live in cities {{than at any other time}} in human history and health inequities are increasing. Health inequities are avoidable differences in the social, environmental and political conditions that shape morbidity and mortality, and disproportionately burden the poor, racial, ethnic and religious minorities and migrants. By linking urban place and health inequities, research and action brings into sharp relief the challenges of achieving urban environmental justice. This article briefly reviews the complex definitions of urban places and how they can shape health equity in cities. I suggest that a more relational or integrated approach to defining urban places and acting on health equity can complement other approaches and improve the ability of public health to meet 21 st century challenges. I close with suggestions for research and practice that might focus environmental public health on healthy urban place making. The practices include community driven map making, Health in All Policies (HiAP), promoting urban ecosystem services for health, and participatory and integrated approaches to urban slum upgrading. I conclude that if the global community is serious about the sustainable development goals (SDGs), greater attention must be paid to understanding and acting to improve <b>urban</b> places, <b>living</b> <b>conditions</b> and the social and economic conditions that can promote health equity...|$|R

But in farming households agricultural income has so far remained a very major part of overall income, a principal reason why the majority of the population has stayed in agriculture and rural villages became better off. We argue that this occurred primarily because of agricultural breakthroughs after the adoption of the glutinous rice variety RD 6, with the non-glutinous variety KDML 105 playing a complementary commercial role. Increased agricultural income helped make the villages more attractive settings for residence, joint investments and remittances, all of which ramified beyond the villages to help lift the economy of the region, and of the nation...|$|R

The paper tells about the general sense of insecurity in the city during wartime, the usual war motives (the wounded in the streets, life under war regulations, forced charity events) and the consequences of the war situation (shortage of living supplies and poverty, begging and vagrancy, neglected children and war orphans).

40|$|The {{growth of}} urban {{squatter}} settlements {{is a common}} problem in developing countries. They are a particular challenge to small island developing states such as Fiji, where with increasing urbanisation, {{there has been an}} unprecedented growth in their numbers. In Fiji, a squatter is defined as ‘a person who is in illegal occupation of state, freehold or native land or without any form of security of tenure or without any consent from the landowner’ (Lingam 2005 : 2). Common characteristics of squatter settlements are lack of basic <b>urban</b> infrastructure, poor <b>living</b> <b>conditions,</b> poverty, and low energy consumption per capita. They usually provide unhealthy living environments and can give rise to crime and other social problems. An understanding of the livelihood strategies poor squatters adopt is crucial to understanding how the poor cope in urban environments. Squatters usually have extremely limited resources, no assets and very few livelihood choices. Most get absorbed into the urban informal sector and it is through the process of ‘informalisation’ that poverty can be alleviated and the poor make a living.
