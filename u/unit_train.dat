5|$|Under British Rail, many {{passenger}} services on the Amlwch branch operated through to Bangor, removing {{the need to}} change trains at Gaerwen. An early three-coach British United Traction (A.E.C.) diesel multiple <b>unit</b> <b>train</b> was trialled {{on the line in}} May 1953. The train was economical in fuel use, and did not require a fireman, but train passengers and crew complained at the very rough ride - rattling windows a particular complaint. As part of British Rail's Modernisation Plan, Derby Lightweight DMUs were introduced three years later. A 1956 brochure advertised day return tickets from Bangor to Amlwch for 4s.4d, or Llangefni for 11d. Steam engines continued to be used for freight trains, and for extra workings such as Saturday trains. Steam returned for all passenger trains in the summers of 1963 and 1964 due to a shortage of DMUs.|$|E

25|$|Freight trains that {{consist of}} {{isolated}} cars {{must be made}} into trains and divided according to their destinations. Thus the cars must be shunted several times along their route {{in contrast to a}} <b>unit</b> <b>train,</b> which carries, for example, cars from the plant to a port, or coal from a mine to the power plant. This shunting is done partly at the starting and final destinations and partly (for long-distance-hauling) in classification yards.|$|E
25|$|Modern unloaders use rotary dump devices, which {{eliminate}} {{problems with}} coal freezing in bottom dump cars. The unloader includes a train positioner arm that pulls the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper. The dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down {{to dump the}} coal. Swiveling couplers enable the entire operation to occur while the cars are still coupled together. Unloading a <b>unit</b> <b>train</b> takes about three hours.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Tropicana {{orange juice}} was shipped in bulk via {{insulated}} boxcars in one weekly round-trip from Bradenton, Florida, to Kearny, New Jersey. By the following year, {{the company was}} operating two 60-car unit trains a week, each carrying around [...] of juice. On June 7, 1971, the [...] "Great White Juice Train" [...] (the first <b>unit</b> <b>train</b> in the food industry, consisting of 150 [...] insulated boxcars fabricated in the Alexandria, Virginia, shops of Fruit Growers Express) commenced service over the [...] route. An additional 100 cars were soon added, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant. Tropicana saved $40 million in fuel costs during the first ten years in operation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903 24 {{motor cars}} and 33 {{trailers}} {{were provided by}} Westinghouse. The stock was of an American design, with a clerestory roof and open gated ends. Unheated accommodation was in saloons and the wooden bodies were British built, and the bogies {{had been made by}} Baldwin Locomotive Works in America. First and third class cars were provided, the first class seats being natural rattan and the third class seats being moulded plywood. The livery was maroon with white roofs and [...] "Mersey Railway" [...] in gold leaf on the upper fascia panels. Air brakes were provided with storage reservoirs that were recharged from static compressors at the terminal stations. The motor cars were powered with Westinghouse motors controlled by the Westinghouse low voltage multiple <b>unit</b> <b>train</b> control system.|$|E

2500|$|Work on {{preparing}} the station {{for the first}} race meeting of the year on Saturday 27 February 1960 was well in hand early that year. [...] On 26 January, the District Engineer requested that the Foreman of Works proceed {{with the construction of}} a platform at Hutt Park. [...] The installation of a telephone and a walk-in shelter to house it were approved on 3 February, and a public address system for the platform was approved on 26 February. [...] Two days before this meeting, on 25 February, an electric multiple <b>unit</b> <b>train</b> was run to Hutt Park to test the new facilities, including the recently finished platform. [...] Other work completed for the first meeting included the installation of new access gates and the repair of old ones, and the installation of four pole-mounted electric platform lights.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{style of}} <b>unit</b> <b>train</b> {{is a local}} trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of Derwood and Dickerson. The train runs daily except on Sundays; on {{holidays}} it sometimes runs twice a day. Trash is carried from Montgomery County's Shady Grove Transfer Station to a waste-to-energy plant located off the PEPCO lead to Mirant's Dickerson Generating Station. The trip is roughly , and the train {{is made up of}} National Steel Car Company-built well cars, hauling [...] containers. The first NEMX equipment was built when the D765 first started operations in 1995. In recent years, the fleet has been somewhat upgraded, repainted, and new cars have been constructed. In the early days, the locomotives powering the train were a GP40-2/RDMT slug set, but currently the train can be upwards of 47cars. The locomotives that now routinely power the train are a pair of EMD SD50s.|$|E
2500|$|... 725 Squadron is a naval {{aviation}} {{squadron of}} the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Fleet Air Arm. The squadron was originally created in August 1943 {{as part of}} the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy. It initially served as a fleet requirements unit, was rerolled in August 1945 as a target towing unit, then was disbanded in December 1945. In January 1958, the squadron was re-formed, as a fleet requirements and communications unit of the RAN, operating a variety of fixed-wing aircraft. The squadron was redesignated as an anti-submarine warfare training squadron in May 1959, then was decommissioned in May 1961 and absorbed into 724 Squadron. 725 Squadron was recommissioned in November 1962 as an operational anti-submarine helicopter squadron, flying the Westland Wessex. During this commission, the squadron was involved in the [...] troop transport voyages, the rescue of personnel following the Melbourne-Voyager collision, and the Operation Navy Help Darwin relief effort post-Cyclone Tracy. The squadron was decommissioned in December 1975. 725 Squadron was commissioned for the fourth time in June 2015, this time as a training unit for MH-60R Seahawk Romeo helicopters: the squadron had been reactivated two years prior as a non-commissioned <b>unit</b> <b>train</b> on and accept into service the Romeos.|$|E
