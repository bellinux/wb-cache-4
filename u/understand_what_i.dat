He said, “If I {{make any}} {{statement}} {{it will be}} in a way the people can hear me and <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have to say, and not have to depend on some parts of the press which might fail to report all I have to say.” ...|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E
500|$|In August, del Potro won {{his third}} {{consecutive}} title at the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, beating Andy Roddick in straight sets in the final. After the match, Roddick praised his opponent. [...] " [...] hits {{this way and}} this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it, {{which is a good}} thing for him, bad for the rest of us". A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run. [...] "He changed my game. He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and I see him in the stands, it gives me confidence. I can play relaxed." ...|$|E

500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{took more}} than two years to develop. Sierra {{officials}} said this was because it was so different from anything that had been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: [...] "It took a full year just to get people to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do." [...] The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, Phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not ready yet.|$|E

Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy.

It was about people who couldn't communicate, so they talked in {{greeting}} cards. They bought greeting cards in the form of songs, and they sang songs 'cause they didn't {{know what to say to}} each other. It wasn't really a musical in the conventional sense, which is why we did everything live. I didn't care so much about the musical part of it. I wanted it to seem like people talking, only they were singing. [...] " ...|$|R

The lady also purportedly revealed to {{the children}} a vision of hell, and entrusted a secret to them, described as [...] "good for some and bad for others". Fr.

"A {{people that}} {{suffered}} for 2,000 years, {{that went through}} the Holocaust, arrives at its patrimony but is thrust into a renewed round of bloodshed, that is perhaps the road to annihilation.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the 2005 SPM results in March 2006, the Education Ministry {{announced}} it was considering reforming the SPM system due to what was perceived as over-emphasis on As. Local educators appeared responsive to the suggestion, with one professor at the University of Malaya deploring university students who could not write letters, debate, or understand footnoting. He complained that [...] "They don't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am saying. ... I cannot communicate with them." [...] He claimed that [...] "Before 1957 (the year of independence), school heroes were not those with 8As or 9As, they were the great debaters, those good in drama, in sport, and those leading the Scouts and Girl Guides." [...] A former Education Director-General, Murad Mohd Noor, agreed, saying that [...] "The rat race now begins at Standard 6 with the UPSR, with the competition resulting in parents forcing their children to attend private tuition." [...] He also expressed dismay at the prevalence of students taking 15 or 16 subjects for the SPM, calling it [...] "unnecessary".|$|E

2500|$|After Bell and Watson {{discovered}} on June 2, 1875, that {{movements of the}} reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate {{in front of the}} pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter. This was the [...] "gallows" [...] phone. A few days later they were tried together, one {{at each end of the}} line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath. Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell spoke into his instrument, [...] "Do you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say?" [...] and Mr. Watson answered [...] "Yes". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane.|$|E
2500|$|Zhang Wen {{was from}} Wu County (吳縣), Wu Commandery (吳郡), {{which is in}} present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. His father, Zhang Yun (張允), was famous in Wu Commandery for valuing {{friendship}} and having a low regard for material wealth. Zhang Yun also served as an Official in the East Bureau (東曹掾) under the warlord Sun Quan, who became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu later. At a young age, Zhang Wen was already known for his good moral conduct and for having a dignified appearance. When Sun Quan heard about him, he asked his subjects, [...] "As of now, who is Zhang Wen comparable to?" [...] Liu Ji, the Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令), said, [...] "He is comparable to Quan Cong." [...] However, Gu Yong, the Minister of Ceremonies (太常), had a different opinion, [...] "Liu Ji doesn't know him well enough. No one is comparable to Zhang Wen as of now." [...] Sun Quan said, [...] "If it is so, Zhang Yun must be still alive." [...] When Zhang Wen was summoned to the Wu court to meet Sun Quan and his subjects, he impressed them with his demeanour and his eloquent responses to their questions. As {{he was about to}} leave, Zhang Zhao held his hand and said, [...] "I entrust my plans to you. You should <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean." [...] Zhang Wen was then appointed as a Consultant (議郎) and Master of Writing in the Selection Bureau (選曹尚書).

Being imprisoned {{encouraged}} her to leave Nigeria, if she could not have left, the other option was to finally succeed in ending her life. She remembered her experiences in this poignant piece she wrote for Gay Star News on Transgender Day of Remembrance on 20 November 2013, which was re-published by some online news outlets:I wish I could tell the younger me who tried to commit suicide twice that life gets better and dreams do honestly come through. [...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going through. I found solace in music and dreams. I dreamt of being free to be myself, free of insults, free of judgment and free from harassments.

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
