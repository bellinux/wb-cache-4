We use them to train programs that learn the repeating <b>unit</b> <b>string</b> of a given regular binary pattern string and can reproduce the learnt pattern to an arbitrary size, specified by a parameter N.

40|$|Classical {{solutions}} describing strings {{endowed with}} an electric charge and carrying a constant electromagnetic current are constructed within the bosonic sector of the Electroweak Theory. For any given ratio of the Higgs boson mass to W boson mass and for any Weinberg's angle, these strings comprise a family that can be parameterized by values of the current through their cross section, I_ 3, by their electric charge per <b>unit</b> <b>string</b> length, I_ 0, and by two integers. These parameters determine the electromagnetic and Z fluxes, {{as well as the}} angular momentum and momentum densities of the string. For I_ 0 → 0 and I_ 3 → 0 the solutions reduce to Z strings, or, for solutions with I_ 0 =± I_ 3, to the W-dressed Z strings whose existence was discussed some time ago.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for investigating lens phenomenology of cosmic strings in order to elaborate detection strategies in galaxy deep field images. To account for {{the complexity of the}} projected energy distribution of string networks we assume their lens effects to be similar to those of a straight string carrying a random lineic energy distribution. In such a model we show that, unlike the case of uniform strings, critical phenomena naturally appear. We explore the properties of the critical lines and caustics. In particular, assuming that the energy coherence length along the string is much smaller than the observation scale, we succeeded in computing the total length of critical lines per <b>unit</b> <b>string</b> length and found it to be 4 /√(3) E(3 / 4). The length of the associated caustic lines can also be computed to be 16 /(π√(3)) E(3 / 4). The picture we obtain here for the phenomenology of cosmic string detection is clearly at variance with common lore. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures. Minor correction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-A throughput-driven {{approach}} to the performance analysis of direct access storage devices (DASD's), i. e., disks, is presented for {{a model of a}} block-multiplexor channel system with multiple transfer paths. The approach relies on a step-wise analysis of shared components within the data transfer path: head of <b>string,</b> control <b>unit,</b> channel, referred to as blocking points. In order to derive the service time of an I/O request, each blocking point is analyzed separately, using essentially a classical loss-system model. The advantages of the method are its relative simplicity and applicability to a large number of configurations. Transient and boundary effects, including the miss probability on second and subsequent reconnection attempts, and the device reconnection window (lead time), are also discussed. The inclusion of the approach in a larger system model, as well as its relationship with previous work on DASD analysis is considered. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the method.

40|$|We find de Sitter {{and flat}} space {{solutions}} with all moduli stabilized in four dimensional supergravity theories {{derived from the}} heterotic and type II string theories, and explain how all the previously known obstacles to finding such solutions can be removed. Further, we argue that if the compact manifold allows a large enough space of discrete topological choices then {{it is possible to}} tune the parameters of the four dimensional supergravity such that a hierarchy is created and the solutions lie in the outer region of moduli space in which the compact volume is large in <b>string</b> <b>units,</b> the <b>string</b> coupling is weak, and string perturbation theory is valid. We show that at least two light chiral superfields are required for this scenario to work, however, one field is sufficient to obtain a minimum with an acceptably small and negative cosmological constant. We discuss cosmological issues of the scenario and the possible role of anthropic considerations in choosing the vacuum of the theory. We conclude that the most likely stable vacuua are in or near the central region of moduli space where string perturbation theory is not strictly valid, and that anthropic considerations cannot help much in choosing a vacuum.

The overlap number of G is defined similarly, except that G is required to be an overlap graph of F. In this paper we show two algorithmic aspects concerning both these graph invariants. On the one hand, we show that the corresponding optimization problems associated with these numbers are both APX-hard, where for the intersection number our results hold even for biconnected graphs of maximum degree 7, strengthening the previously known hardness result. On the other hand, we show that the recognition problem for any specific intersection graph class (e. g. interval, <b>unit</b> disc, <b>string,</b> [...] .) is easy when restricted to graphs of fixed bounded intersection or overlap number. ...|$|R
