40|$|We {{previously}} described that immunopotentiators, CVCVA 5, increased {{the efficacy of}} H 5 and H 9 subtype avian influenza vaccines in chickens, ducks, and geese. In this study, we further investigated {{the effects of the}} CVCVA 5 for improving the efficacy of other univalent or multivalent inactivated vaccines. The immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus CVCVA 5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without immunopotentiators as measured by levels of antibodies from serum, tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and cytokines of IFNγ and IL- 4 from serum. Vaccines included the <b>univalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> of Newcastle Disease virus (ND), Egg Drop Syndrome virus (EDS), Infectious Bronchitis virus (IB), and Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBD). The CVCVA 5 also improved the immune response of both ND and IBD vaccines with less dosage. The sterile protective immunity was monitored with one- or a half-dose of adjuvanted ND vaccine or one dose of adjuvanted IBD vaccine, respectively. The improved immune efficacy was observed in a half-dose of adjuvanted bivalent vaccines compared to one dose of vaccines without CVCVA 5 as measured by the antibody levels, including bivalent vaccine of ND-H 9, ND-IB, and ND-IBD. The CVCVA 5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine (ND-IB-EDS-H 9). A half-dose of adjuvanted commercial vaccine or 75 % antigen-sparing adjuvanted vaccine elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines. The CVCVA 5 improved the effect of a booster vaccination as measured by the antibody levels against H 5 or H 9 virus antigens, in which chickens primed with the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines given a booster with H 5 –H 9 bivalent vaccines without CVCVA 5 using 5 -day intervals. The inflammatory response may contribute to these additional effects by increasing the levels of IFNγ and IL- 4 after the injection of the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines. Results indicated that the CVCVA 5 improved the serum and mucosal antibody levels, cytokine levels of the chickens given the <b>univalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> and also improved serum antibody titers in bivalent and tetravalent vaccines. This has a potential as an improve vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We studied immune {{resistance}} {{efficiency of}} vaccination against influenza A/California/ 7 / 2009 (H 1 N 1) v in women at second trimester of physiological pregnancy in a blind, placebocontrolled study. The first group included thirty pregnant {{women who were}} injected by univalent subunit “MonoGrippol plus” vaccine. The second group consisted of thirty-seven pregnant women immunized by trivalent “Grippol plus” vaccine. Thirty-one pregnant women (III group) received placebo treatment. Non-pregnant women (IV group) were injected with “MonoGrippol plus”. We {{did not find any}} differences in clinical features of vacccine-challenged time period in pregnant women from groups I-III. Notably, sufficient numbers of women were found to be seroprotected 1 month post-vaccination (I group, 80. 0 %; II group, 75. 7 %; IVgroup, 80. 6 %) with high levels seroconversion (I group, 46. 6 %; II group, 51. 4 %; IV group, 53. 3 %). Within 9 - 10 months after vaccination, a decreased seroprotection was revealed in II group of pregnant women. More stable specific immunity levels were detected for the groups immunized with <b>univalent</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Hence, the local subunit adjuvant “MonoGrippol plus” and “Grippol plus” vaccines were shown to exibit a high immune resistance efficiency profile and clinical safety, when used in pregnant women, thus presuming an extended application field for these biological drugs in public health service. State of pregnancy seems not to be a limiting condition for induction of specific immune resistance...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of a divalent fusion DNA vaccine encoding both the Brucella abortus L 7 /L 12 protein (ribosomal protein) and Omp 16 protein (outer membrane lipoprotein), designated pcDNA 3. 1 -L 7 /L 12 -Omp 16. Intramuscular injection of this divalent DNA vaccine into BALB/c mice elicited markedly both humoral and cellular immune responses. The specific antibodies exhibited a dominance of immunoglobulin G 2 a (IgG 2 a) over IgG 1. In addition, the dual-gene DNA vaccine elicited a strong T-cell proliferative response and induced a large amount of gamma interferon-producing T cells upon restimulation in vitro with recombinant fusion protein L 7 /L 12 -Omp 16, suggesting the induction of a typical T-helper- 1 -dominated immune response in vivo. This divalent DNA vaccine could also induce a significant level of protection against challenge with the virulent strain B. abortus 544 in BALB/c mice. Furthermore, the protection level induced by the divalent DNA vaccine was significantly higher than that induced by the <b>univalent</b> DNA <b>vaccines</b> pcDNA 3. 1 -L 7 /L 12 or pcDNA 3. 1 -Omp 16. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} verify for the first time that the Omp 16 gene can be a candidate target for a DNA vaccine against brucellosis. Additionally, a divalent genetic vaccine based on the L 7 /L 12 and Omp 16 genes can elicit a stronger cellular immune response and better immunoprotection than the relevant <b>univalent</b> <b>vaccines</b> can...|$|R
40|$|Epitope-based {{vaccine is}} a {{promising}} strategy for therapeutic vaccination against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. A multivalent subunit vaccine containing various antigens from H. pylori {{is superior to}} a <b>univalent</b> subunit <b>vaccine.</b> However, whether a multivalent epitope-based vaccine is superior to a <b>univalent</b> epitope-based <b>vaccine</b> in therapeutic vaccination against H. pylori, remains unclear. In this study, a multivalent epitope-based vaccine named CWAE against H. pylori urease, neutrophil-activating protein (NAP), heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60) and H. pylori adhesin A (HpaA) was constructed based on mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), Th 1 -type adjuvant NAP, multiple copies of selected B and Th cell epitopes (UreA 27 – 53, UreA 183 – 203, HpaA 132 – 141, and HSP 60189 – 203), and also the epitope-rich regions of urease B subunit (UreB 158 – 251 and UreB 321 – 385) predicted by bioinformatics. Immunological properties of CWAE vaccine were characterized in BALB/c mice model. Its therapeutic effect was evaluated in H. pylori-infected Mongolian gerbil model by comparing with a <b>univalent</b> epitope-based <b>vaccine</b> CTB-UE against H. pylori urease that was constructed in our previous studies. Both CWAE and CTB-UE could induce similar levels of specific antibodies against H. pylori urease, and had similar inhibition effect of H. pylori urease activity. However, only CWAE could induce high levels of specific antibodies to NAP, HSP 60, HpaA, and also the synthetic peptides epitopes (UreB 158 – 172, UreB 181 – 195, UreB 211 – 225, UreB 349 – 363, HpaA 132 – 141, and HSP 60189 – 203). In addition, oral therapeutic immunization with CWAE significantly {{reduced the number of}} H. pylori colonies in the stomach of Mongolian gerbils, compared with oral immunization using CTB-UE or H. pylori urease. The protection of CWAE was associated with higher levels of mixed CD 4 + T cell (Th cell) response, IgG, and secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies to H. pylori. These results indic ate that a multivalent epitope-based vaccine including Th and B cell epitopes from various H. pylori antigens could be a promising candidate against H. pylori infection...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} under commercial feedlot conditions at 2 sites in western Canada to determine the relative effects of a <b>univalent</b> viral <b>vaccine</b> (MLV 1) program versus a multivalent viral vaccine (MLV 4) program on animal health; feedlot performance; and carcass characteristic variables of fall-placed, auction market derived, feedlot calves. Five thousand one hundred and sixty-three calves were processed and randomly allocated to 1 of 2 experimental groups as follows: MLV 1, which received a modified live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus vaccine upon arrival at the feedlot and again at approximately 70 days on feed (DOF); or MLV 4, which received a modified live IBR virus, parainfluenza- 3 virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine upon arrival at the feedlot and again at approximately 70 DOF.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} archaeosomes, prepared from the total polar lipids extracted from Methanobrevibacter smithii, as adjuvants for combination (multivalent) vaccines. Groups of Balb/c mice were immunized subcutaneously at day 0 and 21 {{with one of the}} following vaccines: a trivalent vaccine formulated by the simultaneous co-encapsulation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin (OVA) and hen egg lysozyme (HEL) into archaeosomes (CEC vaccine); an <b>univalent</b> archaeosome <b>vaccine</b> (UVE vaccine) containing either BSA, OVA or HEL; or an admixture vaccine (AMC vaccine) consisting of the three UVE vaccines. Serum specific antibody (IgG + M) responses were determined at day 32, 112 and 203, and specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 a responses were determined at day 112. Mice immunized with the CEC or AMC vaccine developed strong and sustained specific antibody responses to all three antigens at a magnitude similar to those seen in control mice immunized with UVE vaccines. Moreover, the serum BSA-, OVA-, and HEL-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 a levels in the CEC and AMC immunized mice were overall comparable to those of the UVE immunized control mice. Boosting CEC and AMC vaccinated mice with antigens alone at day 203 elicited strong antibody memory responses, comparable to those in the UVE vaccinated groups. These results show that archaeosomes could be used as adjuvants in developing combination vaccines. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{estimated}} seroprevalence and {{correlates of}} selected infections in {{pregnant women and}} blood donors in a resource-limited setting. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of laboratory seroprevalence data from pregnant women and voluntary blood donors from facilities in Cameroon in 2014. Rapid tests were performed to detect hepatitis B surface antigen, syphilis treponemal antibodies, and HIV- 1 / 2 antibodies. Blood donations were also tested for hepatitis C and malaria. Results. The seroprevalence rates and ranges among 7069 pregnant women were hepatitis B 4. 4 % (1. 1 – 9. 6 %), HIV 6 % (3. 0 – 10. 2 %), and syphilis 1. 7 % (1. 3 – 3. 8 %) with significant variability among the sites. Correlates of infection in pregnancy in adjusted regression models included urban residence for hepatitis B (aOR 2. 9, CI 1. 6 – 5. 4) and HIV (aOR 3. 5, CI 1. 9 – 6. 7). Blood donor seroprevalence rates and ranges were hepatitis B 6. 8 % (5. 0 – 8. 8 %), HIV 2. 2 % (1. 4 – 2. 8 %), syphilis 4 % (3. 3 – 4. 5 %), malaria 1. 9 %, and hepatitis C 1. 7 % (0. 5 – 2. 5 %). Conclusions. Hepatitis B, HIV, and syphilis infections are common among pregnant women and blood donors in Cameroon with higher rates in urban areas. Future interventions to reduce vertical transmission should include universal screening for these infections early in pregnancy and provision of effective prevention tools including the birth dose of <b>univalent</b> hepatitis B <b>vaccine...</b>|$|R
