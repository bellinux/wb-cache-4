5000|$|Crawford {{picked up}} an <b>un-packaged</b> BB/pellet air rifle inside the store's {{sporting}} goods section and continued shopping in the store. Another customer, Ronald Ritchie, called 911. According to Ritchie at the time, Crawford was pointing the gun at people and at children walking by, and messing with the gun. Ritchie has since stated “At no point did he shoulder the rifle and point it at somebody”, while maintaining that Crawford was [...] "waving it around". Two officers of the Beavercreek Police arrived at the Walmart shortly after their dispatcher informed them of a [...] "subject with a gun" [...] in the pet supplies area of the store and Crawford was shot. He was later pronounced dead at Dayton's Miami Valley Hospital.|$|E
40|$|Capacitive {{pressure}} sensors {{have lots of}} potential for commercial applications. However, successful commercial exploitation of highly miniaturized capacitive sensors is often inhibited {{by the presence of}} parasitic effects such as environmental noise and parasitic capacitances. Therefore, to alleviate the problems encountered in the capacitive pressure sensor approach, it is important to integrate the sensors and the circuitry as directly as possible. This paper builds on preliminary work reported previously by us [Sens. Actuators A 101 (2002) 231] and focuses on direct integration of read-out circuitry with microfabricated microsensors. These capacitive {{pressure sensors}} with three-candidate diaphragm materials (Kapton polyimide film, stainless steel, and titanium) are demonstrated the integration with read-out circuitry on stainless steel substrate. Several approaches for the demonstration of integration have been taken and their various degrees of successes are examined. As the final stage of this study, a commercially available MS 3110 Universal Capacitive Read-out IC from Microsensors Inc. in its <b>un-packaged,</b> die-type was used. This chip in its die-form was integrated via wirebonding to the microfabricated sensors. The sensors that are tested using the IC have only the metal diaphragms of stainless steel. The measured value of relative voltage change is 2. 85 % over the applied pressure range from 0 to 75 kPa. This sensor contains a gap of 21 m and has a sensitivity of 0. 92 mV/kPa...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effectiveness}} of pulsed UV {{light on the}} microbial load of boneless chicken breast was in-vestigated. Unpackaged and vacuum-packaged samples inoculated with an antibiotic-resistant strain of Salmo-nella Typhimurium on the top surfaces were treated with pulsed UV light for 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s at 5, 8, and 13 cm distance from the quartz window in the pulsed UV light chamber. The log 10 reductions of Sal-monella (cfu/cm 2) on unpackaged samples varied from 1. 2 to 2. 4 after a 5 -s treatment at 13 cm and a 60 -s treatment at 5 cm, respectively. The log 10 reductions on vacuum-packaged samples varied from 0. 8 to 2. 4 after the 5 -s treatment at 13 cm and the 60 -s treat-ment at 5 cm, respectively. The optimum treatment conditions were determined to be 5 cm- 15 s for <b>un-packaged</b> samples and 5 cm- 30 s for vacuum-packaged samples, both of which resulted in about 2 log 10 re-duction (~ 99 %). The total energy and temperatures of samples increased with longer treatment time and shorter distance from the quartz window in the pulsed UV light chamber. The changes in chemical quality and color of samples were determined after mild (at 13 cm for 5 s), moderate (at 8 cm for 30 s), and extreme (at 5 cm for 60 s) treatments. Neither malonaldehyde con-tents nor color parameters changed significantly (P> 0. 05) after mild and moderate treatments. Mechanical properties of the packaging material were analyzed be-fore and after pulsed UV light treatments. The elastic modulus at both along-machine and perpendicular-to-machine direction and yield strength at perpendicular-to-machine direction changed significantly (P < 0. 05) after extreme treatment. Overall, these results clearly indicate that pulsed UV light has a potential {{to be used for}} decontamination of unpackaged and vacuum-packaged poultry. Decontamination of unpackaged and vacuum-packaged boneless chicken breast with pulsed ultraviolet ligh...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the rapidly growing empirical research area {{in the field of}} operations management. It contains two essays, tackling two different sets of operations management questions which are motivated by and built on field data sets from two very different industries [...] - air cargo logistics and retailing. The first essay, based on the data set obtained from a world leading third-party logistics company, develops a novel and general Bayesian hierarchical learning framework for estimating customers' spillover learning, that is, customers' learning about the quality of a service (or product) from their previous experiences with similar yet not identical services. We then apply our model to the data set to study how customers' experiences from shipping on a particular route affect their future decisions about shipping not only on that route, but also on other routes serviced by the same logistics company. We find that customers indeed borrow experiences from similar but different services to update their quality beliefs that determine future purchase decisions. Also, service quality beliefs {{have a significant impact on}} their future purchasing decisions. Moreover, customers are risk averse; they are averse to not only experience variability but also belief uncertainty (i. e., customer's uncertainty about their beliefs). Finally, belief uncertainty affects customers' utilities more compared to experience variability. The second essay is based on a data set obtained from a large Chinese supermarket chain, which contains sales as well as both wholesale and retail prices of <b>un-packaged</b> perishable vegetables. Recognizing the special characteristics of this particularly product category, we develop a structural estimation model in a discrete-continuous choice model framework. Building on this framework, we then study an optimization model for joint pricing and inventory management strategies of multiple products, which aims at improving the company's profit from direct sales and at the same time reducing food waste and thus improving social welfare. Collectively, the studies in this dissertation provide useful modeling ideas, decision tools, insights, and guidance for firms to utilize vast sales and operations data to devise more effective business strategies.
