5000|$|In China, it {{is known}} that ground <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> is a common {{adulterant}} in feed for non-ruminants. [...] Domestically it is often sold under the euphemism [...] "protein essence" [...] (蛋白精) and is described as [...] "one kind of new proteinnitrogen feed additive". [...] However, <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> itself has been suggested as appropriate for use in feed for some non-ruminants in at least one UN FAO report, suggesting its use as a binder in feed pellets in aquaculture.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1884 by Hölzer, {{who was working}} with Bernhard Tollens. [...] In 1919, Hanns John (1891-1942) of Prague, Czechoslovakia obtained the first patent for <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b>|$|E

50|$|In August 1983, {{the company}} {{produced}} the first shipment of liquid carbon nitrogen. In 1985 the first <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> production unit was commissioned. Four {{of the seven}} current ammonia plants at Tolyatti were constructed by Chemico.|$|E
5000|$|Thermoplastics: Isopress: Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-StyreneW, PolyoxymethyleneW, PolystyrolW, PolycarbonateW, PolyethylenW, PolypropyleneW (also {{with glass}} fibers). In the {{thermosetting}} range: phenol-formaldehyde resinW, melamine-formaldehyde resinW, <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin,</b> unsaturated polyester resins, phenolic resins Pehnol resin, epoxy resinW. Some of these thermosetting resins {{had to be}} refrigerated [...]|$|E
5000|$|<b>Urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> {{adhesives}} {{feature a}} low effective cost, low cure temperatures, resistance to microorganisms and abrasion, and light color. It does not creep, {{and can be}} repaired with epoxy. It can rapidly deteriorate in hot, moist environments, releasing formaldehyde (a carcinogen).|$|E
25|$|Urea is a raw {{material}} for the manufacture of two main classes of materials: <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> and urea-melamine-formaldehyde used in marine plywood.|$|R
50|$|Bis(hydroxymethyl)urea is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula OC(NHCH2OH)2. This white water-soluble solid is an intermediate {{in the formation}} of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b> It forms upon treatment of urea with an excess of formaldehyde.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, the Union Carbide {{plant was}} sold to Rohm and Haas to create acrylic plastic and such products. In 1979, Borden Chemical Inc. opened a {{building}} to produce formaldehyde, <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins,</b> phenolic resins, and adhesives.|$|R
50|$|When {{the veneer}} is {{prepared}} for an order, a pressing tool is incorporated into a press. The pressing tools can be made of two parts (for seats, backrests and shells) or several parts, e.g. for U-shaped moldings that also require pressure from the side. The pressing begins with glue being spread onto the veneer. The glue is made of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> with a hardener that becomes thermosetting during the pressing process.|$|E
50|$|A pattress {{may be made}} {{of metal}} or plastic. In the United Kingdom, surface-mounted boxes in {{particular}} are often made from <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin,</b> or alternatively PVC, and usually white. Wall boxes are commonly made of thin galvanised metal. A pattress box is made to standard dimensions and may contain embedded bushings (in standard positions) for the attachment of wiring devices (switches and sockets). Pattress boxes themselves {{do not include the}} corresponding faceplates.|$|E
5000|$|Fiberglass {{shingles}} have a {{base layer}} of glass fiber reinforcing mat. The mat {{is made from}} wet, random-laid fiberglass bonded with <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> The mat is then coated with asphalt which contains mineral fillers and makes the fiberglass shingle waterproof. Fiberglass shingles typically obtain a class [...] "A" [...] fire rating as the fiberglass mat resists fire better than organic/paper mats. Fiberglass reinforcement was devised as the replacement for asbestos paper reinforcement of roofing shingles and typically ranges from 1.8 to 2.3 pounds/square foot.|$|E
40|$|The curing {{mechanism}} of furfuryl alcohol and <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> furan <b>resins</b> was investigated using infrared spectroscopy (IR) technique. The curing productions of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> furan <b>resins</b> modified with different agents (i. e. sorbitol, polyester polyol, phenol and acetone) and the productions of incomplete curing {{were characterized by}} differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermal gravity analysis (TG). The results indicate that except for polyester polyol, the other modifiers have {{little effect on the}} thermal strength of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> furan <b>resin.</b> Furthermore, the thermal strength can be improved at a temperature of higher than 550 ℃...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the original Bakelite material, these companies eventually made {{a wide range of}} other products, many of which were marketed under the brand name [...] "Bakelite plastics". [...] These included other types of cast phenolic resins similar to Catalin, and <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins,</b> which could be made in brighter colors than polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride.|$|R
5000|$|Amino resins {{are another}} class of {{thermoset}} prepolymers formed by copolymerisation of amines or amides with an aldehyde. <b>Urea-formaldehyde</b> and melamine-formaldehyde <b>resins,</b> although not {{widely used in}} high performance structural composite applications, are characteristically used as the polymer matrix in molding and extrusion compounds where some use of fillers and reinforcements occurs. <b>Urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> are widely used as the matrix binder in construction utility products such as particle board, wafer board, and plywood, which are true particulate and laminar composite structures. Melamine-formaldehyde resins are used for plastic laminating.|$|R
5000|$|Ruminant {{animals can}} obtain protein {{from at least}} some forms of non-protein {{nitrogen}} (NPN) through fermentation by their rumen bacteria, hence NPN is often added to their diet to supplement protein. Nonruminants such as cats, dogs and pigs (and humans) cannot utilize NPN. NPN are given to ruminants {{in the form of}} pelleted urea, ammonium phosphate and/or biuret. [...] Sometimes slightly polymerized special <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> or a mixture of urea and formaldehyde (both are also known as formaldehyde-treated urea) is used in place of urea, because the former provides a better control on the nitrogen release. This practice is carried out in China and other countries, such as Finland, India and France.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the term}} MDF {{has become a}} generic name for any dry process fibre board. MDF is {{typically}} made up of 82% wood fibre, 9% <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> glue, 8% water and 1% paraffin wax. and the density is typically between 500 kg/m3 (31 lb/ft3) and 1,000 kg/m3 (62 lb/ft3). The range of density and classification as light, standard, or high density board is a misnomer and confusing. The density of the board, when evaluated {{in relation to the}} density of the fibre that goes into making the panel, is important. A thick MDF panel at a density of 700-720 kg/m3 may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels, whereas a panel of the same density made of hard wood fibres is not regarded as so. The evolution of the various types of MDF has been driven by differing need for specific applications.|$|E
30|$|In {{previous}} studies [1 – 3], air injection increased the IB of <b>urea–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> bonded boards manufactured from high-moisture particles. The <b>urea–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> is hydrophilic, prone to excessive penetration into high-moisture particles, and thus inhibits curing under high-moisture conditions [4]. The air injection prevented such penetration and inhibition, thereby improving the IB of the boards. This was {{opposite of the}} results obtained for isocyanate resin.|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic-tanned leather is tanned using {{aromatic}} polymers {{such as the}} Novolac or Neradol types (syntans, contraction for synthetic tannins). This leather {{is white}} in color and was invented when vegetable tannins were in short supply during the Second World War. Melamine and other amino-functional resins fall into this category, as well, and they provide the filling that modern leathers often require. <b>Urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> were also used in this tanning method before people realized the hazards that formaldehyde presents to tanners and consumers.|$|R
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde <b>resins</b> (commonly <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins).</b>|$|R
40|$|The hydrolytic {{degradation}} of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> (UF) has gained new relevance since {{the development of}} procedures for reuse of particle- and fibreboards based on steam hydrolysis. In Germany, today 100. 000 tons of used particleboards are recycled by thermo-hydrolytical processes annually. This work points out the role of resin hydrolysis in these recycling processes. Therefore, the behaviour of ground particleboards as well as pure, hardened UF resin under hydrolytic conditions was investigated. Influences of temperature and pH value were assessed to estimate their effect on the hydrolysis process...|$|R
30|$|Particles {{produced}} from wood waste {{were used for}} manufacturing the core layers of the particleboard (Japan Novopan Industrial Co., Ltd.). The moisture content of these particles was approximately 10  %. <b>Urea–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> {{was used as the}} binder (solid content of 65  %, viscosity of 0.21  Pa s; TB- 86 from Oshika Co. Ltd.). A 10  % aqueous ammonium chloride solution was used as the hardener. The amount of the ammonium chloride solution accounted for 10  % of the <b>urea–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> by weight. The amount of the <b>urea–formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> {{on the basis of the}} solid content accounted for 10  % of the oven-dried weight of the particles. The binder was sprayed on the particles, and the moisture content of the particles was approximately 15  %.|$|E

40|$|The {{urea-formaldehyde}} resin/reactive montmorillonite composites {{were prepared}} by in situ polymerization. The reactive montmorillonite was prepared firstly by being ion exchanged with organic molecules and secondly by being grafted with silane coupling agent, {{which could be}} demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the morphology of the urea-formaldehyde resin/reactive montmorillonite composites were ellipsoid or columnar particles. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) confirmed that the reactive montmorillonite was encapsulated by <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that curing process of the urea-formaldehyde resin/reactive montmorillonite composites consumed more energy than pure <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the thermal stability of the urea-formaldehyde resin/reactive montmorillonite composites improved compared to pure <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> Furthermore, the reactive montmorillonites reduced the formaldehyde emission of the composites and increased the water resistance. Finally, the mechanism to prepare the urea-formaldehyde resin/reactive montmorillonite composites was proposed...|$|E
50|$|Urea-formaldehyde, {{also known}} as urea-methanal, so named for its common {{synthesis}} pathway and overall structure, is a non-transparent thermosetting resin or plastic. It is produced from urea and formaldehyde. These resins are used in adhesives, finishes, particle board, MDF, and molded objects. UF and related amino resins are a class of thermosetting <b>resins</b> of which <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> make up 80% produced globally.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} it is {{presented}} results of detailed laboratory and field tests of fine alluvial sand stabilized with multi-molecular organic solutions. Such properties of solutions have been investigated: density, viscosity, pH (alka-linity level), evaporation of components from solution in water and air. Comparison was done of properties of con-ventional multi-molecular organic solutions on basis of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> with properties of modified with active component solutions. During another stage of investigations properties of alluvial fine sand stabilized with conventional and modified solutions have been compared. Such properties of reinforced soil have been investigated: compressed strength, evaporation of formaldehyde from stabilized sand, time dependent strength of stabilized sand in air and water medium. Third stage of investigations {{has been done in}} field. During field tests two modified solutions have been grouted in fine alluvial sand. After one week stabilized soil was excavated and investigated. Results of field tests confirmed the results of laboratory tests. Addition of active components to multi-molecular organic solu-tions on basis of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> increases density and pH, decrease viscosity. Compressed strength of sands stabilized with multi-molecular organic solutions is time dependent and increased from 2. 2 MPa after 7 days to 2. 9 MPa after 3 months. 12 to 19 times less formaldehyde is liberated into the air from soil stabilized with the modi-fied solutions than from the soil stabilized with the conventional solutions...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of studies of treatment of wastewater at woodworking companies which is formed during manufacture and application of adhesives based on <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b> There presented a method of wastewater purification from pollutants such as dissolved components of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> and free formaldehyde. This paper describes a method of pre-stabilization of wastewater for further treatment, which is achieved by precipitation of the condensation products of urea and formaldehyde. Stabilised wastewater is further subjected to processing by UV-radiation. In-vestigations were carried out with the wastewater, which were selected at the wood-processing enterprises of Belarus and wastewater has the following composition: formaldehyde content − 1. 0 − 5. 0 g/dm{ 3 }, chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the liquid phase – 15. 0 − 60. 0 g O[2]/dm{ 3 } of components UFR − 50. 0 − 80. 0 g/dm{ 3 }. Various treatment options of stabilized wastewater by UV-radiation are investigated. It was established that UV-treatment of wastewater containing formaldehyde in the presence of powder composite material comprising TiO 2, at a dose of irradiation of 10. 8 J/cm{ 2 } and and pH value being equal to 11 to reduced the formaldehyde content to 97 % formal dehyde at concentrations ranging from 10 to 150 mg/dm{ 3 }.

50|$|Water gels {{usually have}} many {{different}} ingredients. They contain a gelatinizing agent, {{also known as}} a thickener, that modifies their consistency, ranging from easily pourable gels to hard solids. Polyvinyl alcohol, guar gum, dextran gums, and <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> are the typical gelling agents. Guar, specifically, is a gelling agent used for the aqueous portion of the water gel explosives. The primary component of water gels is monomethylamine nitrate. Monomethylamine nitrate is made from monomethyl amine (MMA) and nitric acid. Water gel explosives are also made of ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, aluminum, ethylene glycol and TNT. The proportions of these components vary depending on the desired explosiveness of the water gel.|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the variants of reagent stabilization, which is an essential stage of sludge treatment of sewage treatment facilities There are many variants of stabilization, {{which are based on}} the mineralization of organic matter, the impact on microorganisms (heating, treatment with chemicals, which have a bactericidal effect, adjustment of pH and humidity) to suppress their activity. In comparison with biological methods reagent stabilization requires minimal capital costs and provides carrying out the process in a short time. Promising method is to be used while stabilizing of waste containing organic substances with microstatic and microbocide action, and which do not change the composition of sediments. In this paper as reagents to stabilize was used the liquid waste and wastewater generated in the production and application of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> (UFR), which are characterized by high levels of formalde-hyde. Flow rate of liquid waste (formaldehyde content of 14. 2 g/dm 3) was changed in the ranges from 1 : 100 to 20 : 100, the flow of wastewater (formaldehyde content of 0. 5 − 7. 0 g/dm 3) in the varies from 1 : 10 to 1 : 2. Investigations were carried out on the excess activated sludge (solids content 18. 1 − 27. 7 g/dm 3). In the investigated ranges the flow of stabilizing agent, that provides long-term stability, depends linearly on both the solids content of the excess ac tivated sludge, {{as well as on the}} content of formaldehyde in the stabilizing agent. Processing of excess activated sludge with waste from production and use of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> reduces the resistivity to filtering more than 7 times...|$|R
