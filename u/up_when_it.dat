During antagonistic behavior, individuals maintain spacing with wrists/thumbs sparring, bites, and loud vocalizations. When moving to a suitable resting place after landing, an individual may fight with conspecifics along the way. A roosting flying fox is positioned upside down with its wings wrapped <b>up.</b> <b>When</b> <b>it</b> gets too warm, a flying fox fans itself with its wings.

Jeff Thomson and Alvin Kallicharan had their contracts torn <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was discovered that they had binding agreements with a radio station requiring them to play for Queensland. Packer moved quickly to shore up support, meeting with the players and taking legal action to prevent third parties from inducing players to break their contracts. To clarify the legal implications (including the proposed bans), Packer backed {{a challenge to the}} TCCB in the High Court by three of his players: Tony Greig, Mike Procter and John Snow.|$|E

25|$|Hone {{arrived to}} the clinic in May 1992 {{following}} a stint in Guatemala and instantly clashed with several of the staff due to his unorthodox methods. Hone's fiancé Claire Lloyd (Annie Stanford) soon arrived but the couple broke <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> turned out she had been sleeping with both Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) and Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins). Hone grew close to co-worker Meredith Fleming's (Stephanie Wilkin) son Andrew (Ezra Woods) and became a father figure to him, eventually drawing him into a relationship with Meredith. In 1993 Meredith dumped Hone after several months and he flatted with Jenny (Maggie Harper) and Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) and later, Chris Warner. Following an appearance on a current affairs show, Hone began to be harassed by an unseen assailant. Hone soon discovered it was a fellow doctor, Te Aniwa Ryan (Moana Maniapoto-Jackson) who disagreed with his medical views. Nonetheless, the two overcame their issues and became a couple. In 1994 Hone cheated on Te Aniwa with Hillary (Susan Brady), ending his relationship for an affair that was short lived.|$|E
25|$|On March 26 3rd-seeded Notre Dame faced {{off against}} Wichita State for a berth to the Elite Eight. Notre Dame {{defeated}} Wichita State 81 to 70 {{to set up}} a meeting with Kentucky two nights later. On March 28 Kentucky and Notre Dame met for a berth to the Final Four. In a game that was considered one of the greatest in NCAA Tournament history, Kentucky defeated Notre Dame 68 to 66. Kentucky needed its players to step up in a big game with such high stakes. Towns was foremost among players stepping <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> mattered most. The 6-foot-11 forward played through foul trouble to score nine of his career-best 25 points over that final stretch, including the game-tying basket in the post with 1:12 left.The big 3 came with 3:15 on the clock. The Cats, {{in the midst of a}} rally after previously trailing by six points with 6:14 to go, trailed by just two when Aaron Harrison pulled up from the right wing. With six seconds left in an Elite Eight matchup with Notre Dame, Andrew Harrison drove and drew a foul on Notre Dame's Demetrius Jackson. Following a timeout called by the Fighting Irish, he toed the line in a 66-66 game and sank two free throws to give Kentucky a 68 to 66 lead. The margin remained intact as Notre Dame's Jerian Grant missed a contested 3-pointer as time expired. The game between Kentucky and Notre Dame was the highest rated college basketball game on cable of all-time.|$|E

500|$|The {{focal point}} of reviewers' {{criticism}} was Dead Head Fred's gameplay, specifically the combat. [...] It was generally considered tedious and repetitive. [...] Australia's PAL Gaming Network described the combat as [...] "one of the poorest elements of the game", and Game Informer called the combat mechanics [...] "awful". [...] The performance of the camera was also criticized, with IGN noting [...] "Considering that the camera will sometimes choose some horrible angles for you in battle or during puzzles, it's annoying to have to fight {{it as well as}} mutants that want you dead." [...] GameZone said [...] "I just wish the camera wouldn’t be such a hindrance sometimes." [...] Reviewers were also unhappy with Dead Head Fred's loading times; Eurogamer considered them [...] "excessively high", and IGN said [...] "The only downside that crops <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> comes to the visuals are the continual loading times on just about every single area." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Iron Clad Lover: [...] "Dick makes love to Bessie while Tom plays a game {{of chess}} with her father. Tom, {{naturally}} nervous, plays such a poor game {{that he and the}} old man quarrel and Tom is ordered from the house. Next day is Bessie's birthday. Tom brings a bouquet and a box of candy. But he is turned away from the house and has the gifts thrown at his head by Bessie's father. Dick arrives and is welcomed. Tom, in desperation, buys a suit of armor, puts it on and has himself delivered to the house as a present to Bessie. Dick finds out that Tom is inside the armor and makes life miserable for him, blowing cigar smoke through the visor and making love to Bessie. Tom, unable to stand this, tries to announce himself, but only succeeds in stumbling over and breaking a valuable vase. Bessie's pa has the 'armor' thrown out. Dick's conscience makes him tell Bessie that Tom was in the armor and they started the rescue. They were horrified to learn that the old man has sold the armor to a junk dealer; and Dick and Bessie have an exciting chase before the junk man is rounded <b>up,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> takes combined efforts of a policeman, locksmith, and plumber to release Tom from his iron suit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Library Cave was walled off {{sometime}} {{early in}} the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed {{as the reason for}} sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed perhaps when the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the Tripitaka became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away. [...] Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> became full.|$|E

2500|$|Cinemation's {{advertising}} {{style and}} the film's rating led many to believe that Fritz the Cat was a pornographic film. When it was introduced as such at a showing at the University of Southern California, Bakshi stated firmly, [...] "Fritz the Cat is not pornographic." [...] In May 1972, Variety reported that Krantz had appealed the X rating, saying [...] "Animals having sex isn't pornography." [...] The MPAA refused to hear the appeal. The misconceptions about the film's content were eventually cleared <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> received praise from Rolling Stone and The New York Times, and the film was accepted into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival.

2500|$|Phobos' grooves {{were long}} {{thought to be}} {{fractures}} caused by the impact that formed the Stickney crater.

Hypers Daniel Wilks comments that the anime is [...] "for most part rather formulaic but the series does really pick <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> comes to the action scenes which are fast, frenetic, highly creative and beautifully animated".|$|E

Group sex, public sex... homosexuality {{under the influence of}} drugs, all the taboos went out the window. This doesn't mean that straight sex... or monogamy were unknown, quite the contrary. Nevertheless, the open relationship became an accepted part of the hippy lifestyle. This meant that you might have a primary relationship with one person, but if another attracted you, you could explore that relationship without rancor or jealousy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Typically, the Roche limit {{applies to}} a satellite's {{disintegrating}} due to tidal forces induced by its primary, the body about which it orbits. [...] Parts {{of the satellite}} that are closer to the [...] primary are attracted more strongly by gravity from the primary than parts that are farther away; this disparity effectively pulls the near and far parts of the satellite apart from each other, and if the disparity (combined with any centrifugal effects due to the object's spin) {{is larger than the}} force of gravity holding the satellite together, it can pull the satellite apart. [...] Some real satellites, both natural and artificial, can orbit within their Roche limits because they are held together by forces other than gravitation. Objects resting on the surface of such a satellite would be lifted away by tidal forces. [...] A weaker satellite, such as a comet, could be broken <b>up</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> passes within its Roche limit.|$|E
