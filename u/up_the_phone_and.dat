Shocked by what she has just seen, Sue Ellen then picks up a gun from the floor and shoots J.R. three times.

Another said that when he told Bvute he wanted to consult with friends, Bvute picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> called Kenyon Ziehl, the head of selection, and told him he wanted the player replaced in the squad.

25|$|There were {{optional}} {{systems to}} dial {{the phone or}} pick it up, but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used {{on one end of}} the connection or the other. For instance, the autodialler was a system that automated the action of picking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> dialing a number, and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer. Such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks, who might use one to send an end-of-day file to branch offices.|$|E

25|$|Lola hangs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> starts running (in an {{animated}} sequence) down the staircase of her apartment, past a punk with a dog, and (back in live action) {{through the streets}} of Berlin towards her father's bank and she collides with a woman pushing a baby carriage, who is shown to later steal a baby after having lost custody of her own. Continuing, Lola runs alongside a cyclist who offers to sell her his bike, which she refuses; a flash-forward shows him being robbed on his bike but later marrying a nurse from the hospital in which he recovered. Lola then causes a car crash, which involves her father's colleague, Mr. Meier, and three men in a white BMW. As Lola arrives at the bank, she passes a banker shown later to be paralyzed in a car accident, then killing herself shortly after. She meets her dad, who dismisses her request for help; he reveals that he's not her biological father and that he plans to elope with his pregnant mistress, and then has Lola escorted out of the bank. A security guard who consoles her is shown to later suffer a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked {{to the front of the}} property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

5000|$|Usually on a Wednesday night, Spoony {{will open}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> take {{calls from people}} who have {{recurring}} dreams, but are unable to work out what they mean. His job as the [...] "dreamweaver" [...] was to work out what the dreams mean, and suggest a way for the person to remove the dream or change the dream, when it occurs again. Spoony says that recurring dreams are usually our subconscious trying to alert us to something in our life. Spoony informs the listeners that he has had successful experience with colleagues etc. Spoony says that not being able to see the caller's body language or facial expressions when he was talking to them on the air, makes it more difficult to examine people's dreams.|$|R

On May 7, after reading an article from The Seattle Times, Rodman sent out a tweet asking Kim to release American prisoner Kenneth Bae, who had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea. Kim released Bae the following year.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the players}} were {{cooperative}} except for Jose Canseco, who was intimidating. He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly made him as heroic as possible. He was originally slated {{to wake up in}} bed with Edna Krabappel and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected. He disliked his caricature, stating that [...] "the animation looked nothing like ," [...] but that he found the acting was very easy. When asked in 2007 about his part by the San Jose Mercury News, he responded, [...] "that was 100 years ago," [...] hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls for an interview about his guest spot.|$|E

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'."

Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts.

500|$|Each {{release of}} [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{included}} {{one or more}} B-sides. [...] "Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2)", included on the CD1, 7-inch vinyl, and Japanese releases of the single, were a multi-section piece formatted much like [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] itself. The {{first part of the}} song consists of Yorke's vocals over acoustic guitar; the second part contains distorted guitar and organ and uses complex time signature changes. [...] "Pearly*", featured on the CD1 and Japanese releases of the single, was described by Yorke as a [...] "dirty song for people who use sex for dirty things". [...] "A Reminder", which appears on the CD2 release, features fuzzed guitar, thumping drums, and electric piano. According to Yorke, this song was inspired by [...] "this idea of someone writing a song, sending it to someone, and saying: 'If I ever lose it, you just pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> play this song back to remind me.'" [...] "Melatonin", also on the CD2 release, is a synthesiser-based song with lyrics similar to that of a lullaby, but with an undercurrent of menace in lines like [...] "Death to all who stand in your way". The OK Computer track [...] "Let Down" [...] is also included on the Japanese single.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E

He was sometimes sought for behind-the-scenes political advice. As a talk show host, Lapierre was free to speak his mind.

Myrtle made one brief on-air appearance on June 22, 1943, when she visited the McGees to wish them a good summer—the McGees did not recognize her in person.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970's {{and early}} 1980's, 1199011 was {{a number that}} when called {{would result in a}}nother dial tone.

Hanging <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> after this would result in a ring back. When the ring back was answered, the ring back process could be repeated by hanging <b>up</b> <b>and</b> lifting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> quickly again, <b>and</b> then hanging up.|$|R
40|$|In high school, {{music videos}} were more {{valuable}} {{to me than}} the mix tape. Finding and sharing a music video was an event, more prestigious and meaningful than even the most thoughtful mix tape (or more commonly by that stage, the MP 3 CD-R). Though {{we were in the}} early age of the internet, there was no YouTube, no Vimeo, and no streaming services, so finding that exact music video meant trawling through hundreds of false leads on AltaVista or Limewire, only to spend hours downloading the multi-megabyte files over a 56 k modem, tying <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line <b>and</b> irritating family members.

Epstein turned up at James' office with an acetate of [...] "Please Please Me", but was reluctant to let James publish it without any proof of his publishing power. James immediately picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> called Philip Jones, the producer of the prestigious TV show, Thank Your Lucky Stars, playing him the acetate over the phone, and saying the song was [...] "a guaranteed future hit".
