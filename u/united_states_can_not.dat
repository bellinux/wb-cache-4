6000|$|England {{may have}} seven {{different}} grades of productiveness in her [...] iron and coal supplies, of which her grades 1, 2, and 3 are [...] {{superior to the}} best grade of the United States, while grades 1, [...] 2, 3, and 4 in the United States may compare only with grades 4, [...] 5, 6, 7 of England. So long as England can supply herself and the [...] United States also with coal and iron from the three superior [...] grades, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> work grade 1 at home. But if the [...] supply for England and the world requires grade 5 to be worked, [...] then the United States can begin the industry on her best grade, [...] although that is far inferior to the best grade in England. [...] Likewise, if the United States has three grades of wheat-land [...] superior to England’s best grade, the ability of England to grow [...] wheat depends on whether the United States can, or can not, supply [...] both herself and England from grades 1, 2, and 3. If we must [...] resort to grade 4, then England can begin to grow wheat as well as [...] we. In short, under a system of free exchange, as great a [...] diversity as under protection is probably possible, but only in [...] {{such a way that}} the best possible advantages in each particular [...] industry are employed. Smaller amounts in some branches, and [...] greater amounts in others, may be produced under a free than under [...] a restrictive system, but with all the greater gain which arises [...] from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade. The most poorly [...] endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up, but not [...] the whole industry itself. No class of persons feel the [...] competition of rivals more than English farmers since American [...] wheat has come into English markets, and yet it does not follow [...] that England can not grow a bushel of wheat. The fact is, merely, [...] that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation, and a [...] readjustment made, to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food. [...] So with us: we should not, by the free exchange, be forced to give [...] up the iron and coal industries entirely; for the best mines would [...] still keep that occupation in existence to “diversify” the others.|$|E

40|$|For a long time, America and Britain {{have been}} keeping a kind of special relations. Britain {{has always been the}} {{follower}} of America in many international issues, and paced with America accordingly. When 9. 11 Event broke out, Britain still was the first one who wanted to cooperate with America to fight against terrorism. In the process of European integration, Britain was relatively isolated, known as “Europe’s orphan”. Strengthening the special relations with the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only enhance the status of the United Kingdom in Europe, but also can enhance Britain's standing in international affairs. Therefore, Britain seized the very opportunity to maintain consistency with the United States. However, there were some serious conflicts of interest between Britain and the United States {{in other parts of the}} world. It seemed that there are no so-called special relations between them. From time to time, the United States was dragged on the British interest edge, mainly because Britain wanted the United States to bear some responsibilities for it, while Britain did not want itself to be the most powerful country as to bear the responsibility of maintaining the present situation...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the opinion}} of the Japanese government, if Japan accepts the demand of the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Japan will perish. However, even if Japan fights against the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Japan may perish. That is, {{accepting}} the request of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> will destroy Japan without fighting the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Even if we fight against the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> if Japan <b>can</b> <b>not</b> avoid the danger of extinction, if Japan defeats without fighting with the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the Japanese people will truly disappear from the earth. However, if Japanese people can fight and show the spirit of defending Japan, even if Japan fights against America, our descendants will always rebuild Japan. We hope to solve problems in diplomatic negotiations. But unfortunately we will be fighting if we are to be commanded to wage war.（September 6, 1941,Osami　Nagano） ...|$|R
60|$|Let us {{suppose that}} the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> is the country which has the depreciated paper. Suppose that some American {{production}} could be bought, while the currency was still metallic, for $25, and sold in England for $27.50, the difference covering the expense and risk, and affording a profit to the merchant. On account of the depreciation, this commodity will now cost in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> $30, and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be sold in England for more than $27.50, and yet it will be exported as before. Why? Because the $27.50 which the exporter can get for it in England is not depreciated paper, but gold or silver; and since in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> bullion has risen in the same proportion with other things—if the merchant brings the gold or silver to the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> he <b>can</b> sell his $27.50 [in coin] for $33 [in paper], and obtain as before 10 per cent for profit and expenses.|$|R
5000|$|Opponents {{of slavery}} {{fiercely}} attacked the Dred Scott decision. The Evening Journal of Albany, New York, combined two themes and denounced {{the decision as}} both an offense {{to the principles of}} liberty on which the nation was founded, and a victory for slave states over the free states: The three hundred and forty-seven thousand five hundred and twenty-five Slaveholders in the Republic, accomplished day before yesterday a great success — as shallow men estimate success. They converted the Supreme Court of Law and Equity of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> of America into a propagandist of human Slavery. Fatal day for a judiciary made reputable throughout the world, and reliable to all in this nation, by the learning and the virtues of Jay, Rutledge, Ellsworth, Marshall and Story!The conspiracy is nearly completed.
