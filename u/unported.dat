In December 2007, Nature Publishing Group introduced the Creative Commons attribution-non commercial-share alike <b>unported</b> licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism's genome for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The city of Munich, Germany, has forked Kubuntu 10.04 LTS {{and created}} LiMux {{for use on}} the city's computers. After {{originally}} planning to migrate 12,000 desktop computers to LiMux, it was announced in December 2013 that the project had completed successfully with the migration of 14,800 out of 15,500 desktop computers, but still keeping about 5000 Windows clients for <b>unported</b> applications. In February 2017 the city decided to evaluate the migration back to Windowssome stated reasons were missing compatibility, bad user acceptance and complexity. In March 2012, the government of Iceland launched a project to get all public institutions using free and open-source software. Already, several government agencies and schools have adopted Ubuntu. The government cited cost savings as a big factor for the decision, and also stated that open source software avoids vendor lock-in. A 12-month project was launched to migrate the biggest public institutions in Iceland to using open-source software, and help ease the migration for others. US president Barack Obama's successful campaign for re-election in 2012 used Ubuntu in its IT department. In August 2014, the city of Turin, Italy, announced its migration from Windows XP to Ubuntu for the 8,300 desktop computers used by the municipality, becoming the first city in Italy to adopt Ubuntu.|$|E
