5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. In brown adipose tissue, regulated proton channels called <b>uncoupling</b> proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and {{is particularly important}} {{as a way of}} maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an <b>uncoupling</b> of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases <b>uncoupling</b> proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the mitochondria. <b>Uncoupling</b> then increases oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria is uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E
5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial <b>uncoupling</b> and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown adipose tissue is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown adipose tissue is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear normal {{modes of}} a fixed-fixed buckled beam about its first post-buckling {{configuration}} are investigated. The cases of three-to-one and one-to-one internal resonances are analyzed. Approximate {{solutions for the}} nonlinear normal modes are computed by applying the method of multiple scales directly to the governing integral-partial-differential equation and associated boundary conditions. Curves displaying variation of the amplitude {{of one of the}} modes with the internal-resonance-detuning parameter are generated. It is shown that, for a three-to-one internal resonance between the first and third modes, the beam may possess one stable <b>uncoupled</b> mode (high-frequency mode) and either (a) one stable coupled mode, (b) three stable coupled modes, or (c) two stable and one unstable coupled modes. For the same resonance, the beam possesses one degenerate mode (with a multiplicity of two) and two stable and one unstable coupled modes. On the other hand, for a one-to-one internal resonance {{between the first and second}} modes, the beam possesses (a) two stable <b>uncoupled</b> modes and two stable and two unstable coupled modes; (b) one stable and one unstable <b>uncoupled</b> modes and two stable and two unstable coupled modes; and (c) two stable <b>uncoupled</b> and two unstable coupled modes (with a multiplicity of two). For a one-to-one internal resonance between the third and fourth modes, the beam possesses (a) two stable <b>uncoupled</b> modes and four stable coupled modes; (b) one stable and one unstable <b>uncoupled</b> modes and four stable coupled modes; (c) two unstable <b>uncoupled</b> modes and four stable coupled modes; and (d) two stable <b>uncoupled</b> modes and two stable coupled modes (each with a multiplicity of two) ...|$|R
40|$|In this note, we {{consider}} repeated play of a finite game using learning rules whose period-by-period behavior probabilities or empirical distributions converge to some notion of equilibria {{of the stage}} game. Our primary focus is on <b>uncoupled</b> and com-pletely <b>uncoupled</b> learning rules. While the former relies on players being aware of only their own payoff functions and able to monitor the action taken by the others, the latter assumes that players only know their own past realized payoffs. We highlight the border between possible and impossible results using these rules. We also overview several <b>uncoupled</b> and completely <b>uncoupled</b> learning rules, most of which leverage notions of regret as the solution concept to seek payoff-improving action profiles. ...|$|R
40|$|Coupled interceptive {{actions are}} {{understood}} {{to be the result}} of neural processing—and visual information— which is distinct from that used for <b>uncoupled</b> perceptual responses. To examine the visual information used for action and perception, skilled cricket batters anticipated the direction of balls bowled toward them using a coupled movement (an interceptive action that preserved the natural coupling between perception and action) or an <b>uncoupled</b> (verbal) response, in each of four different visual blur conditions (plano, + 1. 00, + 2. 00, + 3. 00). Coupled responses were found to be better than <b>uncoupled</b> ones, with the blurring of vision found to result in different effects for the coupled and <b>uncoupled</b> response conditions. Low levels of visual blur did not affect coupled anticipation, a finding consistent with the comparatively poorer visual information on which online interceptive actions are proposed to rely. In contrast, some evidence was found to suggest that low levels of blur may enhance the <b>uncoupled</b> verbal perception of movement. ...|$|R
25|$|Browning of WAT, also {{referred}} to as “beiging”, occurs when adipocytes within WAT depots develop features of BAT.

40|$|Using {{polycrystalline}} pure hematite at {{frequencies of}} 100 Hz- 100 kHz and temperatures of 190 - 350 K impedance spectroscopy {{was employed to}} investigate the electrical conductance transition and correlate it with magnetic transition occurring within this temperature range. A background of slight impurity donor or acceptor semiconductivity was observed above which a peak of conductivity appeared in the temperature range of magnetic transition. The results suggested that the transition from antiferro-magnetically to weak ferromagnetically coupled Fe 3 + and vice versa takes place through their transformation to <b>uncoupled</b> Fe 3 + and an equilibrium between these types of coupled and <b>uncoupled</b> pairs of Fe 3 + is established. A model, thermodynamically sustained, involving bulk concentration of both types of coupled and of <b>uncoupled</b> Fe 3 + was formulated precisely predicting the dependence of magnetic transition on temperature {{and the appearance of}} peaks in both the <b>uncoupled</b> Fe 3 + concentration and conductivity within the transition temperature range. The conductivity, mainly due to intrinsic semiconductance coming from the activation of <b>uncoupled</b> Fe 3 +, depends on both temperature and concentration of <b>uncoupled</b> Fe 3 +.

While power cars can be removed from trains by standard <b>uncoupling</b> procedures, specialised depot equipment is needed to split carriages, by lifting the entire train at once.

40|$|Based on 10 year {{climatological data}} and {{simulations}} from a regional atmosphere-ocean coupled model (FVCOM-RegCM 3), {{this study examined}} the coupled seasonal and intraseasonal variability of atmospheric-oceanic variables [sea surface temperature (SST), winds, rainfall and heat fluxes] and important roles of coupling in the South China Sea. It is showed that even though both coupled and <b>uncoupled</b> models in general are able to capture observed seasonal and intraseasonal variability, the coupled model demonstrates stronger coupling relationship than the <b>uncoupled</b> model. For seasonal variability, the atmosphere-ocean relationship is presented as SST forcing atmosphere. Atmospheric variables are significantly influenced by strong seasonally-varied SST. The coupled model very accurately reproduced the observed SST variation with a stable equilibrium state, while SST from the <b>uncoupled</b> model gradually drifted away from the equilibrium state lacking of the so-called negative SST-heat flux feedback. Lead-lag analysis showed that the coupled variables demonstrated stronger SST-atmosphere relationship than the <b>uncoupled</b> and even observed variables. For intraseasonal variability, the atmosphere-ocean relationship is presented as atmosphere forcing SST. Wind becomes a dominant forcing and demonstrates robust negative relationship with SST and positive relationship with rainfall/LHF. Both coupled and <b>uncoupled</b> models are able to reproduce this observed relationship. In wind-SST relationship, compared to <b>uncoupled</b> and observed variables, the coupled model produced the smallest SST variances and therefore the strongest negative coupling feedback. Sensitivity experiments were also carried out to examine the roles of coupling by directly comparing differences between the coupled and <b>uncoupled</b> experiments with initial temperature perturbations. It is showed that the differences can be up to 50 % of the standard deviations of the variables. Root-mean-square errors of the <b>uncoupled</b> model can be effectively reduced by similar to 65 % in the coupled model...|$|R

25|$|Usual {{practice}} {{was to have}} a drawhook fitted to only one of the mating couplers and train crews therefore carried spare drawhooks and drawhook pins on the locomotive. While automatic coupling is possible, this rarely happens and manual assistance is required during coupling. <b>Uncoupling</b> is done manually by lifting the drawhook by hand to release it. The coupler could be adapted to be compatible with the Johnston coupler by replacing the drawhook with a U-shaped adapter link, which was attached using the same drawhook pin.|$|E
