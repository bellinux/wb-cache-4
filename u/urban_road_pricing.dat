40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The issue of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> is currently receiving {{a great deal of}} attention. The subject matter has a long history, stretching back to the economic literature of the mid- 19 th century with a significant renewal of academic interest during the 1960 's. Whilst the theoretical basis for <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> has been cogently put forward, an apparent sound economic rationale does not, of itself, ensure political and public acceptanceH. ow then should decision-makingp roceed if the aim is ultimately one of implementing an <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme in the UK? As such, the aim of this thesis is to analyse the process of decision-making with respect to <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing,</b> to develop a theoretical framework for the subsequent empirical research undertaken on road pricing, and to suggest policy options, thus informing the development of policy and furthering the debate among policy-makers. In effect, an incremental approach to <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> decision-making is proposed, which stresses that decisions are generally taken in small adjustments from the existing state of affairs and invariably necessitatet he attainment of agreementb etweent he various stakeholders. Two empirical methods are used in order to analyse this framework. First, a national survey of key stakeholder groups (most notably decision-makers), who have an interest in urban road pricing; and, second, a local case study based on face-to-face interviews with decision-makers who had first-hand experience of the first ever trial of an <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme in the UK - namely congestion metering in the city of Cambridge. This research finds that an incremental approach to <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> decisionmaking is the most appropriate. In order to increase the acceptance of <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing,</b> schemes should be designed so that the various interest groups can gradually adjust to the changes in an incremental way by starting with policies that are currently in force and then considering only step-by-step change. It is still possible however, for change to take place beyond that envisaged by the incremental approach. For this to occur, it would require factors such as the existence of a policy entrepreneur, in situ, who is able to drive the process forward...|$|E

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> {{involves}} direct charging {{of drivers}} {{for the use}} of the road network, usually during peak periods. The main objectives for the introduction of a road pricing scheme, in a congested city network, include reduction of delays, environmental improvement and revenue increase. These objectives are closely associated with the concepts of sustainable mobility in urban areas with respect to social equity, economic effi ciency and environmental responsibility.

40|$|In {{recent years}} several European cities have {{introduced}} <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> {{as a tool}} for managing transport demand, especially to reduce traffic congestion and rebalance the modal split between private vehicles and mass-transit systems. Indeed, user behaviour brings about a User Equilibrium condition which does not correspond to the overall utility maximisation and does not take account of external costs. Hence, in order to achieve the efficient use of transportation systems (System Equilibrium), tolls can be charged on <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> so that the social surplus is maximised. For several reasons (theoretical, political, social acceptability) it is impossible to charge 'efficient tolls' (first-best solutions) proposed in the literature; therefore in real networks sub-optimal tolls (second-best solutions) are applied. <b>Road</b> <b>pricing</b> application involves many political and social issues to be solved by policy makers, such as what to do with <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> revenues.

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>road</b> {{networks}} in Hong Kong are highly congested, particularly during peak periods. Long vehicle queues at bottlenecks, {{such as the}} harbor tunnels, have become a daily occurrence. At present, tunnel tolls are charged in Hong Kong as one means to reduce traffic congestion. In general, flow pattern and queue length on a road network are highly dependent on traffic control and <b>road</b> <b>pricing.</b> An efficient control scheme must, therefore, {{take into account the}} effects of traffic control and <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> on network flow. In this paper, we present a bi-level programming approach for determination of road toll pattern. The lower-level problem represents a queueing network equilibrium model that describes users' route choice behavior under conditions of both queueing and congestion. The upper-level problem is to determine road tolls to optimize a given system's performance while considering users' route choice behavior. Sensitivity analysis is also performed for the queueing network equilibrium problem to obtain the derivatives of equilibrium link flows with respect to link tolls. This derivative information is then applied to the evaluation of alternative <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> policies and to the development of heuristic algorithms for the bi-level <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> problem.

But no comparable highways {{have been established}} in Canada since then. Of the 415, 600 lane-kilometers of paved public roads in Canada, only 385 kilometers are tolled. 1 Except on Highway 407, the tolls do not vary over time, and no area-based road-pricing scheme exists. Moreover, Highway 407 is privately owned and operated.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> as a demand {{management}} policy {{that is often}} regarded as radical and generally unacceptable. Road pricing often gets delayed or abandoned due to low acceptability. This {{may be due to}} the fact that complex interactions and drivers of change affect road transport management and require cooperation within implementation networks. The implementation network is a group of people (referred to as partners and actors) who co-ordinate the introduction of policy tools. The drivers of change include any internal or external influences that have an effect on the time, place, or ‘shape’ of the policy measures being introduced. Demand management measures that focus on 'sustainable transport' usually address a limited set of objectives and are often implemented alone i. e. are not necessarily combined with other policy measures. When combined with other measures, it is not always clear whether the multiple interactions between policy tools and implementation networks have been sufficiently considered. Examples of ongoing implementation of policy package in the UK are the support of road pricing initiatives combined with public transport improvements by the Transport Innovation Fund. The objectives of the paper are twofold. First, we present a review of the UK <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> situation.

40|$|The {{gradually}} accelerating pace {{at which}} tolls are being implemented or actively considered {{around the world}} suggests that <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> is {{an idea whose time}} may finally have come.
