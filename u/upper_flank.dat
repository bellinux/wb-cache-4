40|$|During the gravitropic response, auxin-sensitivity of {{the lower}} flanks of leaf-sheath pulvini of Avena sativa (oat) is at least 1000 -fold {{higher than those of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>flanks</b> and non-gravistimulated pulvini. When the pulvini are treated with 1 mM Ca 2 +, a 10 -fold {{increase}} in auxin-sensitivity of the pulvini is observed. Related to this difference in auxin-sensitivity, in vitro activation of the vanadate-sensitive H(-) -ATPase by IAA was observed. Results show that the activation of the H(+) -ATPase by IAA is probably mediated by soluble protein factors and that the H(+) -ATPase prepared from the lower flanks is activated by IAA with a 1000 -fold higher auxin-sensitivity as compared with that from the <b>upper</b> <b>flanks</b> of the graviresponding pulvini. Ammonium sulfate fractionation experiments show that these soluble protein factors are in the 30 to 60 % fraction. Auxin-binding assays reveal that lower flanks contain more high-affinity soluble auxin-binding sites (kD; on the order of 10 (- 9) M) and less low-affinity soluble auxin-binding sites (kD; on the order of 10 (- 6) M) than <b>upper</b> <b>flanks.</b> It is concluded that differential auxin-sensitivity of graviresponding oat-shoot pulvini is achieved by the modulation of affinities of auxin-binding sites in <b>upper</b> and lower <b>flanks</b> of the pulvini, that Ca 2 + is involved in such modulation, and that one of the probable cellular functions of these auxin binding sites is the activation of the proton pump on the plasma membranes...|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{submersible}} dives across Mauna Loa's submarine western flank {{suggest the}} flank has {{been influenced by}} a number of interacting processes, including large-scale sector collapses, deep volcanic spreading, and hydrothermal alteration.

The distribution of rock types, deformation structures, and alteration phases within the volcaniclastic rocks suggest the mid-slope bench is constructed of a series of thrust sheets formed by seaward sliding of the western flank. Volcaniclastic sediments within the bench have been locally altered by circulation of hot hydrothermal fluids along the faults. The remnant landslide scar, from which much of the clastic debris within the bench derived, has largely been concealed by a flood of new lava flows, many of which crossed the shoreline and were deposited on the <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> as pillow basalts...|$|E

40|$|Seismic and sonar {{data have}} been used to {{evaluate}} the extent and characteristics of giant landslides on the flanks of El Hierro in the Canary Islands. As the youngest and most southwesterly of the Canary Islands, El Hierro has experienced rapid growth and destructive events in its 1. 12 million year history. At least four giant landslides (El Golfo, El Julan, San Andres, and Las Playas) have modified ~ 450 km 3 of El Hierro during the last 200 – 300 thousand years, with each landslide event removing around 3 % of the total edifice volume. The extent of landsliding indicates that it is the main process of decay. We characterise flank morphology around El Hierro and distinguish between rugged, unfailed flank, failed flank and steep gullied ridge. Flanks affected by landsliding have downslope long profiles with distinctive b coefficients and exponential forms. The El Golfo landslide is the most recent (15 ka), best described and clearly defined landslide in the Canary Islands. The El Julan landslide (SW flank) has an estimated volume of 130 km 3, an age of > 200 ka and is characterised by gravitational slumping. On the SE flank, two new landslide events are reported. The younger landslide (Las Playas) occurred 145 – 176 ka, has a narrow, steep-sided embayment and a corresponding blocky debris avalanche deposit. The older landslide (San Andres) is recognised {{on the basis of a}} highly chaotic seismic facies offshore and reduced <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> gradients. Its lack of an <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> embayment and offshore blocky debris avalanche lead us to interpret that the landslide involved gravitational slumping, possibly a series of events, which reduced <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> gradients, but did not catastrophically collapse to produce a debris avalanche...|$|E
40|$|Tip {{cells of}} dark-grown protonemata of the moss Ceratodon purpureus are {{negatively}} gravitropic (grow upward). They possess a unique longitudinal zonation: (1) a tip group of amylochloroplasts in the apical dome, (2) a plastid-free zone, (3) {{a zone of}} significant plastid sedimentation, and (4) a zone of mostly non-sedimenting plastids. Immunofluorescence of vertical cells showed microtubules distributed throughout the cytoplasm in a mostly axial orientation extending through all zones. Optical sectioning revealed a close spatial association between microtubules and plastids. A majority (two thirds) of protonemata gravistimulated for > 20 min had a higher density of microtubules near the lower flank compared to the <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> in the plastid-free zone. This apparent enrichment of microtubules occurred just proximal to sedimented plastids and near {{the part of the}} tip that presumably elongates more to produce curvature. Fewer than 5 % of gravistimulated protonemata had an enrichment in microtubules near the <b>upper</b> <b>flank,</b> whereas 14 % of vertical protonemata were enriched near one of the side walls. Oryzalin and amiprophos-methyl (APM) disrupted microtubules, gravitropism, and normal tip growth and zonation, but did not prevent plastid sedimentation. We hypothesize that a microtubule redistribution plays a role in gravitropism in this protonema. This appears to be the first report of an effect of gravity on microtubule distribution in plants...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{theory for}} modes in a non-uniformly stratified, semi-infinite shear flow demon-strates that Rayleigh waves (stable waves {{propagating}} in fluid with spatially varying shear) couple with evanescent internal waves. If the bulk Richardson number (the squared ra-tio of the buoyancy frequency and shear), lies between 1 / 4 and 1, the waves have infinite e-folding depth for waves with critical relative horizontal wavenumbers. Fully nonlinear nu-merical simulations examine {{the effect of}} Rayleigh-internal wave coupling when the shear layer is localised and so is Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable. Diagnostics examining profiles of the wave-induced mean flow show that if the bulk Richardson number is order unity, significant momentum is extracted from a shear layer as a consequence of transport by waves. The work is extended to the study of unstable jet flows and applications of this work for internal wave generation by dynamic instability of the <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> of the Jet Stream are discussed. ...|$|E

The large volume of foreign material in the P 1 layers, derived from the shelf and <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> of the island, suggests massive slumping off the shelf feeding the turbidity currents, possibly triggered by entrance of the hot ash flows into the sea. Ash flow-seawater interaction along the deeply incised northern coast differed from that in the low-relief south by producing peculiar microcrystalline fragments abounding at Site 953 but absent from the southern sites and without equivalent on land. Volcaniclastic turbidite beds above the P 1 layers also contain P 1 material but are separated by pelagic fossil claystone beds representing periods of order 102 years.

40|$|A project {{concerning}} {{the application of}} new technology has been developed {{within the framework of}} the activities of the “Environment and Climate ” EC program. The principal aim of the project has been to propose a new high precision technology for continuous ground deformation monitoring, able to investigate, at the same site, both the horizontal and the vertical strain field components. The goal has been achieved by the construction of an innovative integrated device for the continuous monitoring of ground deformation consisting of a long base tilt and a horizontal strain gauge. In particular, the instrumentation is made up of: i. a mercury tube tiltmeter (installed in November ‘ 96), whose vertical changes at the extremities are measured by laser sensors; ii. a wire strainmeter realised by employing high precision load cells for measuring the strain of a tungsten wire (installed in June ’ 97).

40|$|Mars Orbiter Camera image (5. 23 m/pixel) and {{topographic}} {{data from}} the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data are used to analyze a channel on the upper northern flank of the Elysium Mons volcano, Mars. We show that this channel is best explained {{as the product of}} the thermal erosion of the preexisting surface by a high-speed, turbulent lava flow fed from a fissure eruption. We deduce the volume eruption rate (∼ 3400 – 13, 000 m 3 /s dense rock equivalent), the total volume of erupted lava (∼ 29 – 39 km dense rock equivalent), and the duration of the activity (40 – 130 days). Perhaps significantly, the erupted lava volume is essentially identical, given the uncertainties in the analysis, to the volume of the observed caldera (∼ 31 km 3), which has implications for volume-limited eruptions on Mars and potentially for the unusual steep upper slopes of the volcano. The eruption that produced the channel appears to have been typical for Elysium Mons and implies that the other lava channels on the <b>upper</b> <b>flank</b> of the volcano may also have taken ∼ 1 – 4 months to have formed...|$|E
