25|$|On some of {{the busiest}} routes, the {{convenience}} of the low floor is lost because of the anomalies caused by the hesitant upgrade of tram to metro. The city has four heavy metro lines and three stretches of premetro or underground tram. The premetro tunnels have been built to allow for eventual upgrade to heavy metro, {{so most of the}} platform is high, and is connected to the street (at least in the <b>upward</b> <b>direction)</b> by escalator. At some stations lifts have been installed, but there is a cutout section taking the level down to one foot above ground to board the trams. The three steps this entails make life difficult for passengers with baby buggies or suitcases, even though the new low-floor trams are accessible to wheel-chair users. To get around this last barrier to mobility, an experimental ramp was installed in 2009 at Parvis de St-Gilles/St-Gillis Voorplein.|$|E

We found that the degree of openness in communication was higher in F 2 F conversations than through IM; however, this relationship differed in the two cultures.

40|$|Two {{normal to}} reverse (N to R) {{geomagnetic}} polarity transitions {{were obtained from}} a Southern Hemisphere deep-sea sediment core (35. 91 °S, 59. 97 °E). The upper Jaramillo reversal was continuously sampled by taking 0. 5 cm thick samples across 55 cm of section, and the upper Olduvai reversal was sampled {{in a similar manner}} across 60 cm. Both records are characterized by full normal and reverse polarity directions which are in very good agreement with those predicted by axial dipole fields for the core site latitude. Each record also exhibits a zone yielding intermediate directions. Because of a large increase in both the within-level and the between-level scatter in the upper Jaramillo transition zone, it is not considered to represent an accurate record of the geomagnetic field. The upper Olduvai transition, however, appears to be a more coherent record. It is characterized by directions that shallow early in the reversal but then rapidly steepen to nearly vertical, <b>upward</b> <b>directions.</b> The declinations do not change until the inclinations have passed through the vertical. The total directional change occurs within a broad NRM intensity minimum. The virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) path calculated for this record is not longitudinally constrained but instead exhibits a westward progression through the reversal. When considered together with the lower Jaramillo transition previously reported from this core, these records constitute a set of sequential Southern Hemisphere transitions. A number of striking similarities exist in the two records such as steep, <b>upward</b> <b>directions</b> and a shallowing which occurs between the near vertical and the full polarity directions. The results of zonal harmonic modeling of these records are consistent {{with the idea of a}} standing field which persisted across both the upper Olduvai and lower Jaramillo reversals...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{are using}} {{directions}} of magnetization {{to determine how the}} 60 my old Quottoon pluton (Coast Mountains, British Columbia) has deformed. In May 1998, 119 oriented core samples from 17 sites were collected. In general, the remanence of the samples was very resistant to alternating field demagnetization up to 100 mT and thermal demagnetization to 610 deg C, strongly suggesting hematite as the carrier of the magnetization. Of 17 sites, 9 show downward magnetization directions (normal polarity) and 8 have <b>upward</b> <b>directions</b> (reverse polarity). When compared to a reference direction for stable North America, all reverse sites have shallow inclinations and apparent counter-clockwise rotations. On the other hand, most normal sites lie close to the expected direction. Apparently, the Quottoon pluton has undergone considerable deformation at temperatures below 680 deg C...|$|R
2500|$|Cnoidal waves can {{be derived}} {{directly}} from the inviscid, irrotational and incompressible flow equations, and {{expressed in terms of}} three invariants of the flow, as shown by [...] in their research on undular bores. In a frame of reference moving with the phase speed, in which reference frame the flow becomes a steady flow, the cnoidal wave solutions can directly be related to the mass flux, momentum flux and energy head of the flow. Following —using a stream function description of this incompressible flow—the horizontal and vertical components of the flow velocity are the spatial derivatives of the stream function Ψ(ξ,z): +zΨ and −ξΨ, in the ξ and z direction respectively (ξ=x−ct). The vertical coordinate z is positive in the <b>upward</b> <b>direction,</b> opposite to the direction of the gravitational acceleration, and the zero level of z is at the impermeable lower boundary of the fluid domain. While the free surface is at z=ζ(ξ); note that ζ is the local water depth, related to the surface elevation η(ξ) as ζ=h+η with h the mean water depth.|$|E
2500|$|Seepage in an <b>upward</b> <b>direction</b> {{reduces the}} {{effective}} stress within the soil. When the water pressure {{at a point}} in the soil is equal to the total vertical stress at that point, the effective stress is zero and the soil has no frictional resistance to deformation. For a surface layer, the vertical effective stress becomes zero within the layer when the upward hydraulic gradient is equal to the critical gradient. At zero effective stress soil has very little strength and layers of relatively impermeable soil may heave up due to the underlying water pressures. [...] The loss in strength due to upward seepage is a common contributor to levee failures. The condition of zero effective stress associated with upward seepage is also called liquefaction, quicksand, or a boiling condition. Quicksand was so named because the soil particles move around and appear to be 'alive' (the biblical meaning of 'quick' – as opposed to 'dead').

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to elucidate {{the role of the}} nucleus of the optic tract and the dorsal terminal nucleus of the accessory optic system (NOT-DTN) for slow eye movements other than horizontal. Retinal slip neurons in the NOT-DTN in the awake behaving cat respond direction selectively to the ipsiversive component of horizontal and oblique image motion. They are, however, influenced neither by pure vertical stimulus movement nor by eye movements in the dark. Electrical stimulation of the NOT-DTN leads to pure horizontal optokinetic nystagmus with ipsiversive slow phases and does not influence vertical eye position. In addition, unilateral reversible inactivation of the NOT-DTN with muscimol elicits spontaneous contraversive horizontal nystagmus without vertical component. During oblique optokinetic stimulation, the ipsiversive OKN component is significantly decreased in all directions. After bilateral NOT-DTN inactivation, OKN can only be elicited in a narrow range of <b>upward</b> <b>directions.</b> These data indicate that the NOT-DTN is the only source to drive the horizontal component of OKN...|$|R

The viscosity of the core is assumed to be so large that it behaves as a rigid solid. A wave is present at its surface. The shape of the wave is based on experimental results published earlier in the open litera- ture. Due to the eccentricity the centre line of the core is shifted in the <b>upward</b> vertical <b>direction</b> with respect to the centre line of the tube. The vertical force on the core was found to be dependent on the Reynolds number: at small values of the Reynolds number the force is in the <b>upward</b> vertical <b>direction,</b> at large values the force is downward.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{vertical}} throughflow and internal heating effects on fluid saturated porous medium under gravity modulation is investigated. The amplitude of modulation {{is considered to}} be very small and the disturbances are expanded in terms of power series of amplitude of convection. A weakly nonlinear stability analysis is proposed to study stationary convection. The Nusselt number is obtained numerically to present the results of heat transfer while using Ginzburg–Landau equation. The vertical throughflow has dual effect either to destabilize or to stabilize the system for downward or <b>upward</b> <b>directions.</b> The effect of internal heat source (Ri> 0) enhances or sink (Ri< 0) diminishes heat transfer in the system. The amplitude and frequency of modulation have the effects of increasing or diminishing heat transport. For linear model Venezian approach suggested that throughflow and internal heating have both destabilizing and stabilizing effects for suitable ranges of Ω. Further, the study establishes that heat transport can be controlled effectively by a mechanism that is external to the system throughflow and gravity modulation...|$|R
