When, therefore, she had quit Byzantium and had reached the suburb (the one called Rufinianae which was the private possession of Belisarius), there John should come as if to salute her and to escort her forth on the journey, and they should confer regarding matters of state and give and receive their pledges.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the PRC’s post-Cultural Revolution project of legal development, the largest such undertaking in world history. It commences with {{a review of the}} achievements and shortcomings of legal construction in the PRC over the past two decades. The article then probes the rationale for and nature of this project, in so doing endeavoring to situate it historically. In its final section, the article suggests ways in which we might think of assessing China’s efforts at constructing a legal system within a single generation. Key Words e autonomy e convergence e human agency e instrumentalism e legal development The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) post-Cultural Revolution project of legal development is an event of epic historic proportions. No other major modern society has endeavored in so short a time to reconstruct its legal system in so extensive and novel a fashion. Indeed, one might say that in its magnitude, this <b>undertaking</b> <b>offers</b> something of a contemporary soci-etal analogue to another unparalleled Chinese construction project—the building, during the 3 rd century BCE, of the Great Wall. As with the Wall, the project of post-Cultural Revolution law reform has the potential to recast China’s internal dynamic, even as it seeks to shape China’s interac-tion with the world beyond its borders. Will it, as some suggest has been the case with the Wall, prove an enduring structure, playing a key role in bringing definition and order to China over time, or will it, as others contend about the Wall, be no more than a porous edifice that not only fails to provide the protection it purports to offer but fosters a false security masking internal decay? 1 This question is one that, of course, defies a ready or definitive answer...|$|R

When the deadline range is large, however, the Paterakis CRA performs slightly better than the SP CRA.

40|$|Recent large {{flooding}} {{events have}} reinforced {{the need for}} prudent flood risk management. The July 2007 floods in Yorkshire and the Midlands and the November 2009 floods in the Lake District have highlighted the current vulnerability of key infrastructure and the built environment in the UK to flooding. This existing flood risk is coupled with concerns over the potential impacts of future climate change on flood regimes. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop tools and methodologies to assess the potential impact of likely climate change on flood risk. The link between large rainfall and flow events is first examined, as well as an assessment of the seasonality of these events. This reveals a distinct east-west split in the seasonal concentration of flooding. This work provides a basis for the development of a statistical modelling technique which estimates a catchment flood record on an event basis. The model uses estimates of the flood generating storm and the antecedent conditions to estimate a flow magnitude. The modelled flood record is then transformed into a flood frequency curve using an appropriate statistical method. Extensive testing of the model has assessed its robustness to the length of flood record used in fitting and its sensitivity to the input climate data. Several case studies using the UKCP weather generator show how the method works as well as providing an indication of how future climate changes may affect the flood frequency curve. The frequency curve mapping method developed here performs best on catchments whose flood regime is driven by rainfall. The use of a simple antecedent rainfall accounting method has been shown to perform as well as a quasi-physical soil moisture estimation method. The research <b>undertaken</b> <b>offers</b> several possibilities to develop understanding of flood frequency curves in catchments with short gauged records. This new methodology has the potential for further development and can be used to explore a wide range of future scenarios.

40|$|This three-stage study {{led to the}} {{development}} of a delineation model of occupational therapy practice for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Stage one explored the current practice of occupational therapy in the United Kingdom (UK) by conducting a national survey of 282 paediatric occupational therapists. Results indicated that there were only a small number of occupational therapists (8. 5 %) working in a designated service for children with ADBD. This result suggested that occupational therapy for children with ADHD is a small field of practice. Stage two involved the consensus development on the role of occupational therapy for children with ADHD. Seventy-two paediatric occupational therapists participated in the study. The therapists' top six priorities of assessment and five priorities of intervention were identified. An occupational therapy delineation model of practice was developed by integrating data generated from this research, information from the literature review, and the author's clinical experience. In order to apply the model to clinical practice, a family-centred occupational therapy care package was developed. The third stage evaluated the process and outcome of the devised care package by conducting a multi-centred efficacy study. Twenty occupational therapists from the four countries in the UK attended a 3 -day course to learn to implement the care package. Following their training, they submitted data on a sample of 20 children with ADHD. The majority of these children (85 %) showed improvement in their behavioural patterns after the implementation of the care package. Over half of the cases (65 %) had statistically significant changes of scores in the ADHD Rating Scales. Parents also reported experiencing good family-centred care delivered by the research therapists. The whole study makes a significant contribution to occupational therapy knowledge by creating a new delineation model of practice for which the research <b>undertaken</b> <b>offers</b> some validation.
