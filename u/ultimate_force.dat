The tendons were tested in a tensile testing machine to assess the mechanical performance of the repairs. Outcome measures included gap formation and <b>ultimate</b> <b>forces.</b> The gap strengths of the double-modified Kessler technique (30. 85 N, SD 1. 90) and double-modified Kessler technique with inner cruciate configuration (33. 60 N, SD 4. 64) were statistically signifi-cantly greater than that of the two-strand modified Kessler (22. 56 N, SD 3. 44) and modified Kessler with additional purchase configuration (21. 75 N, SD 4. 03; Tukey honestly significant difference test, P< 0. 000). There were statistical-ly significant differences in failure strengths of the all groups (analysis of variance, P< 0. 000). With an identical number of strands, the gap formation and <b>ultimate</b> <b>forces</b> of the repairs were not changed by additional locking purchase point in modified Kessler repair or changing the inner strand configuration in double-modified Kessler repair.

40|$|Degenerative lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} {{is the most}} common reason for lumbar surgery in patients in the age of 65  years and older. The standard surgical management is decompression of the spinal canal by laminectomy and partial facetectomy. The effect of this procedure on the shear strength of the spine has not yet been investigated in vitro. In the present study we determined the <b>ultimate</b> shear <b>force</b> to failure, the displacement and the shear stiffness after performing a laminectomy and a partial facetectomy. Eight lumbar spines of domestic pigs (7  months old) were sectioned to obtain eight L 2 –L 3 and eight L 4 –L 5 motion segments. All segments were loaded with a compression force of 1, 600  N. In half of the 16 motion segments a laminectomy and a 50 % partial facetectomy were applied. The median <b>ultimate</b> shear <b>force</b> to failure with laminectomy and partial facetectomy was 1, 645  N (range 1, 066 – 1, 985) which was significantly smaller (p =  0. 012) than the <b>ultimate</b> shear <b>force</b> to failure of the control segments (median 2, 113, range 1, 338 – 2, 659). The median shear stiffness was 197. 4  N/mm (range 119. 2 – 216. 7) with laminectomy and partial facetectomy which was significantly (p =  0. 036) smaller than the stiffness of the control specimens (median 216. 5, 188. 1 – 250. 2). It was concluded that laminectomy and partial facetectomy resulted in 22 % reduction in <b>ultimate</b> shear <b>force</b> to failure and 9 % reduction in shear stiffness. Although relatively small, these effects may explain why patients have an increased risk of sustaining shear force related vertebral fractures after spinal decompression surgery...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a research of pullout behavior of geogrid embeded in red clay. An experimental investigation is conducted under eight different moisture {{content of the}} soil. Tests {{results indicate that the}} geogrid mainly represents pullout failure embedded in clay, and the ultimate resistance is water-sensitive. It decreased with the rise of the moisture content firstly, and then tended to a constant around the plastic limit where the <b>ultimate</b> pullout <b>force</b> is independent of the normal pressure. The display of strain demonstrates that the decrease of the <b>ultimate</b> pullout <b>force</b> is due to the reduction of the friction capability between the soil and geogrid. Besides this, the moisture content influenced the process of the pullout behavior as well. The load-displacement curve can be separated into three parts: linear ascending segment, nonlinear ascending segment and ultimate segment, the increase of moisture content shortened the second segment, which means that the <b>ultimate</b> pullout <b>force</b> will be reached soon {{after the end of the}} first segment. A numerical analysis was conducted on the predicting of the pullout resistance, which shows that predicted and measured pullout resistance have a good agreement for the moisture content lower than plastic limit, and the contribution of friction took up more than 90 % of the total resistance. For this kind of frictional geogrid, clay is a viable fill in reinforced structures...|$|R
