40|$|Effect of supplementation with non-conventional agro-industrial {{by-products}} on rumen fermentation {{pattern and}} microbial nitrogen supply was studied in sheep fed grass hay for 9 days. Diets consisted of hay alone (control); hay supplemented with tela atella (traditional brewery residue); katikala atella (liquor residue); lentil hull; <b>rough</b> <b>pea</b> hull and field pea hull. Thirty indigenous rams weighing 22. 6 Â± 0. 97 kg, were stratified into weight groups and {{randomly assigned to}} dietary treatments independently. Supplementation reduced (P 0. 05) rumen fermentation and microbial nitrogen supply, but showed difference (P< 0. 001) for propionate and butyrate concentrations. Type of atella supplements showed variation, whereby rumen pH was low (P< 0. 05), but rumen ammonia, VFA, molar proportions of acetate, propionate and butyrate were high (P< 0. 001) for katikala atella compared to tela atella. Lentil hull had higher (P< 0. 01) rumen ammonia concentration, microbial nitrogen supply and microbial efficiency than other pulse hull supplements. It was concluded that both atella and pulse hulls have potential as supplements for ruminants. More specifically lentil hull and katikala atella seemed to be superior in their diverse nutritive characteristics among the supplements studied...|$|R
40|$|In vitro and in vivo {{evaluation}} of non-conventional feed resources {{was carried out}} in the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Debre Zeit Station, Ethiopia, using shee 10 non-conventional feed types commonly used by urban and peri-urban livestock farmers were obtained from the farming system and evaluated in vitro following standard procedures. Following in vitro studies, five non-conventional feed types were selected for in vivo studies based on the in vitro result, availability, and wide use by farmers. 30 indigenous rams weighing 22. 6 +- 0. 97 (mean +- SD) kg initially were stratified into weight groups and assigned randomly to treatments. Treatments included Tela atella (traditional brewery residue), Katicala atella (traditional liquor residue), lentil (Lens culinaris) hull, <b>rough</b> <b>pea</b> (Lathyrus sativa) hull, and field peas (Pisum sativum) hull based on the basal diet of native grass hay (control). In vitro study indicated that Tela and K. atella had higher organic matter (97 - 98 %), crude protein (CP) (21 %), and gross energy (GE) (21 - 22 MJ/kg DM), and lower fibre fractions (neutral detergent fibre, NDF= 41 - 60 %; acid detergent fibre, ADF= 11 - 21 %). Pulse hulls (lentil, <b>rough</b> <b>pea,</b> and field pea hulls) had medium to high CP (8 - 16 %), lower GE (17 - 19. 5 MJ/kg DM), and higher fibre fractions (NDF= 49 - 71 %; ADF= 49 - 62 %). Among the pulse hulls considered, lentil hull had the highest CP (16 %), and lowest NDF (49. 4 %) and ADF (48. 6 %). Poultry litter and orange peel had the highest CP (30 %) and GE (28 MJ/kg DM), respectively. Results of the in vivo study indicated that both T. atella and K. atella and pulse hulls improved total dry matter, organic matter, nitrogen, energy, and NDF intakes. The improvement was higher for T. atella and K. atella compared to pulse hull groups. Basal diet intake was reduced when pulse hulls were fed. T. atella, K. atella, and lentil hull had higher nitrogen and energy digestibility compared to pulse hulls and the control. Supplementation improved nitrogen retention, with T. atella, K. atella, and lentil hull. Therefore, given the increasing competition with monogastric animals and increasing price of conventional byproducts coupled with the deteriorating quality of tropical forages, T. atella, K. atella, and lentil hull have potentials {{to be used as a}} protein and energy (except lentil hull) supplements on low quality based diet under small holder livestock production systems. Further research is warranted to lower the concentration of tannins and fibre in pulse hulls and improve the feeding system to enhance the utilization of T. atella and K. atella...|$|R

Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated {{to be able to}} support each other.

Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the <b>U.S.</b> <b>rough</b> parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones.

40|$|A new coding/decoding scheme {{based on}} the {{properties}} and operations of rough fuzzy sets is presented. By normalizing pixel values of an image, each pixel value {{can be interpreted as}} the degree of belonging of that pixel to the image foreground. The image is then subdivided into blocks which are partitioned and characterized by a pair of approximation sets. Coding uses a codebook, created with a quantization algorithm, to find the best approximating pair for each block, while decoding exploits specific properties of rough fuzzy sets to rebuild the blocks. The method, called by <b>us</b> <b>rough</b> fuzzy vector quantization (RFVQ) relies on the representation capabilities of the vector to be quantized and not on the quantization algorithm, to determine optimal codevectors. A comparison with other fuzzy-based coding/decoding schemes and with DCT and JPEG methods is performed by means of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) values. Results show that for low compression rates the proposed method performs well and, in some cases, the PSNR obtained with RFVQ is close to the JPEG's PSNR...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} robust and {{automated}} algorithm to segment lung nodules in three dimensional (3 D) Computed Tomography (CT) volume dataset. The nodule is segmented out in slice–per–slice basis, that is, we first process each CT slice separately to extract two dimensional (2 D) contours of the nodule which can then be stacked together to get the whole 3 D surface. The extracted 2 D contours are optimal as we utilize dynamic programming based optimization algorithm. To extract each 2 D contour, we utilize a shape based constraint. Given a physician specified point on the nodule, we blow a circle which gives <b>us</b> <b>rough</b> initialization of the nodule from where our dynamic programming based algorithm estimates the optimal contour. As a nodule can be calcified, we pre–process a small region–of–interest (ROI), around the physician selected point on the nodule boundary, using the Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithm to classify and remove calcification. Our proposed approach can be consistently and robustly used to segment not only the solitary nodules but also the nodules attached to lung walls and vessels...|$|R

Further, the classification error is computed, which gives the percentage of data points belonging to the wrong cluster.

60|$|The first foot regiment, if so rudely {{formed a}} band {{could be so}} called, {{consisted}} of men of the sea, fishers and coastmen, clad in the heavy blue jerkins and rude garb of their class. They were bronzed, weather-beaten tarpaulins, with hard mahogany faces, variously armed with birding pieces, cutlasses, or pistols.

As to discipline, they had no notion of it, but rolled along in true blue-water style, with many a shout and halloo to each other or to the crowd. From Star Point to Portland Roads there would be few nets for many weeks to come, and fish would swim the narrow seas which should have been heaped on Lyme Cobb or exposed for sale in Plymouth market. Each group, or band, of these men of the sea bore with it its own banner, that of Lyme in the front, followed by Topsham, Colyford, Bridport, Sidmouth, Otterton, Abbotsbury, and Charmouth, all southern towns, which are on or near the coast.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} new method for {{unveiling}} the possible blazar AGN nature among the numerous population of Unassociated Gamma-ray sources (UGS) in the Fermi catalogues. Our tool relies on positional correspondence of the Fermi object with X-ray sources (mostly from Swift-XRT), correlated with other radio, IR and optical {{data in the}} field. We built a set of Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) templates representative of the various blazar classes, and we quantitatively compared them to the observed multi-wavelength flux density data for all Swift-XRT sources found within the Fermi error-box, {{by taking advantage of}} some well-recognised regularities in the broad-band spectral properties of the objects. We tested the procedure by comparison with a few well-known blazars, and tested the chance for false positive recognition of UGS sources against known pulsars and other Galactic and extragalactic sources. Based on our spectral recognition tool, we find the blazar candidate counterparts for 14 2 FGL UGSs among 183 selected at high galactic latitudes. Further our tool also allows <b>us</b> <b>rough</b> estimates of the redshift for the candidate blazar. In a few cases in which this has been possible (i. e. when the counterpart was a SDSS object), we verified that our estimate is consistent with the measured redshift. The estimated redshifts of the proposed UGS counterparts are larger, on average, than those of known Fermi blazars, a fact that might explain the lack of previous association or identification in published catalogues.
