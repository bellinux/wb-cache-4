5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a few degrees to the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs up a steep slope into the mid-course brake run.|$|E
5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term gun {{is often used}} incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and a flat trajectory, useful for hitting the sides of targets such as walls, as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and fire indirectly, lobbing shells <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> obstacles to hit the target from above.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildup of}} {{vehicles}} and men {{trying to use}} the crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose to head <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E

5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E
25|$|Pole: The {{fiberglass}} {{equipment used}} to propel the vaulter <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the bar. One side is more stiff {{than the other}} to facilitate the bending of the pole after the plant. A vaulter may rest the pole on their arm to determine which side is the stiff side.|$|E
25|$|Anatomically, the {{wolverine}} is {{a stocky}} and muscular animal. With short legs, broad and rounded head, small eyes and short rounded ears, it more closely resembles a bear {{than it does}} other mustelids. Though its legs are short, its large, five-toed paws with crampon-like claws and plantigrade posture enable them to climb <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> steep cliffs, trees and snow-covered peaks with relative ease.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, after a fatal crash {{between the}} Delaware and Lackawanna {{railroad}} and a car, the railroad grade was lowered (and {{it is at}} that level today) and the Morris Canal had to make an electric driven incline plane to bring boats <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the railroad and Orange street, and then {{back down into the}} canal, with a pipe to carry the water across the break.|$|E
25|$|In an {{emergency}} {{it is often}} best to try to climb {{on top of a}} strainer {{so as not to be}} pinned against the object under the water. In a river, swimming aggressively away from the strainer and into the main channel is recommended. If it is impossible to avoid the strainer, one should swim hard towards it and try to get as much of one's body <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> it as possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper on the passenger side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the wipers.|$|E

25|$|As designed, the {{armament}} was comprehensive. The {{pilot was}} in control of a 37mm cannon, four fixed Lewis guns fired forward and down, and a machine gun fired forward and upward over the wings. A further two Lewis guns fired to the rear and downwards (through a fuselage tunnel) and a single machine gun <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the wings. A gunner's position was in the nose. The armor covered the front half of the fuselage and the engine housings.|$|E

Only the black painted {{versions}} included gold body side stripes that continued <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the roof band, as well as gold paint accents for the standard slot-styled wheels. A carryover 1977 Hornet AMX decal was available for the rear deck and hood, in either gold with orange or black with gold. Polished forged aluminum 5-spoke road wheels were optional.|$|E

25|$|Various {{attempts}} for refloating {{the ship}} were suggested. University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor Rob Wheen suggested liquefying the sand under the ship by pumping seawater into it. This liquefaction should reduce the friction between {{grains of sand}} and in turn, friction between the ship and sand. Whether {{this would have been}} effective in this case is unknown as Pasha Bulker was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship would have had to be pulled <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the rocks.|$|E
25|$|A scoop shot (also {{known as}} a ramp shot, paddle scoop, Marillier shot or Dilscoop) {{has been used by}} a number of {{first-class}} batsmen, the first being Dougie Marillier. It is played to short pitched straight balls that would traditionally be defended or, more aggressively, pulled to the leg side. To play a scoop shot, the batsman is on the front foot and aims to get beneath the bounce of the ball and hit it directly behind the stumps, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the wicket-keeper.|$|E
25|$|A variant {{known as}} the Bizon-3 was also developed, and {{features}} a flip-up rear peep sight moved further to the rear on the receiver cover and a stock that folds <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver top cover. The weapon's barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon's tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, compensators and flash hiders.|$|E

25|$|Noise {{barriers}} {{force the}} pollution plumes {{coming from the}} road to move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the barrier creating the effect of an elevated source and enhancing vertical dispersion of the plume. The deceleration and the deflection of the initial flow by the noise barrier force the plume to disperse horizontally. A highly turbulent shear zone characterized by slow velocities and a re-circulation cavity is created {{in the lee of}} the barrier which further enhances the dispersion; this mixes ambient air with the pollutants downwind behind the barrier.|$|E

25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> the obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make {{as good a job}} as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E
