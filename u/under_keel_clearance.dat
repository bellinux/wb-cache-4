40|$|Hydrographic {{surveying}} is an enabling activity supporting {{virtually all}} marine pursuits, but critically {{it provides the}} information used {{in the production of}} nautical charts which are essential to safe navigation. In recent years the trend towards larger ships navigating with limited <b>under</b> <b>keel</b> <b>clearances</b> in ever more congested waterways, particularly in ports and coastal waters places higher demands on hydrographic surveyors. Hydrographic surveying enables port infrastructure development and also underpins the offshore oil, gas and resource industries which transcend State and National borders.

For these reasons it is essential that hydrographic surveys are carried out by competent professionals to consistent and appropriate standards. The Australasian Hydrographic Surveyors Certification Panel (AHSCP) provides a pathway for certification of hydrographic surveyors to international standards.

40|$|The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), {{introduced}} by the IMO [1] is applicable for various types of new-built ships since January 2013. Despite the release of an interim guideline [2], concerns regarding the sufficiency of propulsion power and steering devices to maintain manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions were raised. This was the motivation for the EU research project SHOPERA (Energy Efficient Safe SHip OPERAtion, 2013 - 2016 [3 - 6]). The aim of the project {{is the development of}} suitable methods, tools and guidelines to effectively address these concerns and to enable safe and green shipping. Within the framework of SHOPERA, a comprehensive test program consisting of more than 1, 300 different model tests for three ship hulls of different geometry and hydrodynamic characteristics has been conducted by four of the leading European maritime experimental research institutes: MARINTEK, CEHIPAR, Flanders Hydraulics Research and Technische Universität Berlin. The hull types encompass two public domain designs, namely the KVLCC 2 tanker (KRISO VLCC, developed by KRISO) and the DTC container ship (Duisburg Test Case, developed by Universität Duisburg-Essen) as well as a RoPax ferry design, which is a proprietary hull design of a member of the SHOPERA consortium. The tests have been distributed among the four research institutes to benefit from the unique possibilities of each facility and to gain added value by establishing data sets for the same hull model and test type at different <b>under</b> <b>keel</b> <b>clearances</b> (ukc). This publication presents the scope of the SHOPERA model test program for the two public domain hull models – the KVLCC 2 and the DTC. The main particulars and loading conditions for the two vessels as well as the experimental setup is provided to support the interpretation of the examples of experimental data that are discussed. The focus lies on added resistance at moderate speed and drift force tests in high and steep regular head, following and oblique waves. These climates have been selected to check the applicability of numerical models in adverse wave conditions and to cover possible non-linear effects. The obtained test results with the KVLCC 2 model in deep water at CEHIPAR are discussed and compared against the results obtained in shallow water at Flanders Hydraulics Research. The DTC model has been tested at MARINTEK in deep water and at Technische Universität Berlin and Flanders Hydraulics Research in intermediate/shallow water in different set-ups. Added resistance and drift force measurements from these facilities are discussed and compared. Examples of experimental data is also presented for manoeuvring in waves.

40|$|Introduction In {{navigation}} locks levelling is executed under free flow. The net {{flow from}} the upper section into the lower section of the waterway is considered as a water loss. An innovative water saving concept is an IRS Lock. IRS stands for inflatable rubber structure. The concept consists of an air filled IRS applied in a lock chamber. In this way part of the water loss is substituted by an ‘air loss’. It was not clear {{whether or not the}} IRS Lock concept is a feasible water saving solution. IRSs are formed by a rubber sheet connected to a foundation. The sheet is so flexible that it is considered to have no bending stiffness. The shape of the IRS results from the loads acting on the sheet. During the use of an IRS, four phases are distinguished; the inflation, the inflated, the deflation and the deflated phase. In each phase, the internal pressure is different and thus a different shape results. In case of the IRS Lock, the IRS is completely submerged and the hydrostatic load is the main load. Also loads occur by flows from lock operations and vessel movements. The different phases of use, shapes and the new application area make the design of the IRS Lock a complex process. Design A first design of the IRS Lock has been developed. The Eastern Lock, located in the Terneuzen Lock complex, was used as an environment for the design. In the design the sheet of the IRS is connected to the lock chamber walls. In navigation locks a minimum <b>keel</b> <b>clearance</b> is required between the vessel and the lock chamber bottom. The IRS is located above the bottom of the lock chamber. The water level in the lock chamber, and therefore also the available depth and <b>keel</b> <b>clearance,</b> varies by the tide. The first design of the IRS is optimized {{in such a way that}} the design results in a large water saving while maintaining the minimum required <b>keel</b> <b>clearance.</b> The designed IRS has a crest height of 2, 5 meter and still allows the draught of the design vessel. In total three IRSs are applied in the length of the Eastern Lock. Additionally, several elements of the IRS Lock have been elaborated. Among others the strength of the rubber sheet has been verified. Functional performance The functional performance of the first design of the IRS Lock has been assessed. Per Lock cycle the designed IRSs will save 9056 m 3 of water. Because of the tidal fluctuations in the water levels, and the limitations in available depth and <b>keel</b> <b>clearance,</b> the IRS can only be used for 6 of the 18 lock cycles per tidal period. The total amount of water that is saved per tidal period is on average 25 % of the total water loss. As part of a RAMS-analysis, a Failure Mode Effect Analysis has been performed. Measures have been taken to keep the risk of failure at an acceptable level. From the functional performance it follows that the designed IRS Lock is technically feasible. An alternative for the IRS Lock is a pumping station that pumps the lost water back into the upper section of the waterway. It has been found that in all possible situations the IRS Lock will use more energy per unit of saved volume than a pumping station. Also the Life Cycle Costs are higher. This makes the IRS Lock economically less attractive. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|As in many {{coastal and}} estuary areas, {{navigation}} to {{and in the}} Belgian harbours takes place in environmental and operational conditions which differ from the design conditions of sea-going ships: water depth to draft ratios vary between 2. 0 and 1. 1 {{which means that the}} <b>under</b> <b>keel</b> <b>clearance</b> is often restricted to 10 % of the ship’s draft. In addition, low ship velocities have to be considered as manoeuvring in harbour areas is characterised by a wide range of speed - propeller rpm combinations. Based on the results of captive model tests executed in the Towing Tank for Manoeuvres in Shallow Water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics Research - Ghent University, Antwerp, Belgium) with a 6000 TEU containership and the tanker Esso Osaka, an optimized test program has been developed for the determination of a mathematical manoeuvring model in later-ally unrestricted water. Contrary to deep water and service speed the selected test types and test parameters will influence the measured contributions of the modules hull, propeller and rudder in shallow water: as an example, stationary oblique towing and harmonic sway tests may lead to dif-ferent results, while the reliability of the test results is much more sensitive to the selected test pa-rameters during PMM tests.

Special attention is paid to the effect of the constant growth of ship dimensions, especially in the container trade, on the safety of shipping traffic. Access to and manoeuvring in harbours are characterised by a great diversity of kinematical and control parameters. In 2004 - 2005 a captive model test program has been executed with a 4. 3 m model of an 8000 TEU containership (scale 1 : 81) combining three distinguished drafts and three under keel clearances from deep to very shallow water. This test program covering all possible combinations of ship velocities and propeller telegraph positions has been used to evaluate hull, propeller and rudder forces to be incorporated in a manoeuvring simulation model applicable in the four quadrants of operation. The influence of combinations of draft and <b>under</b> <b>keel</b> <b>clearance</b> on the first quadrant of operation (forward motion, propeller ahead) will be discussed based on the characteristic dimensions of a turning circle. Sinkage and trim are remarkably influenced by the ship’s draft and increase generally with decreasing <b>under</b> <b>keel</b> <b>clearance.</b> The increasing straight-line stability with decreasing ship’s draft, especially observed in very shallow water, is probably caused by this squat dependence and the velocity dependent hull force components.

40|$|Growing {{transportation}} {{rates and}} the subsequent growth in inland waterway transport have led {{to an increase in}} inland vessel sizes and draught. Due to the fluctuating water levels on rivers and these increasing draughts, the distance between the river bed and the ships are decreasing. Rijkswaterstaat wants to know the effects of sailing at these small underkeel clearances on river beds and ship manoeuvrability. In order to quantify these effects, more knowledge about the flow field beneath sailing vessels is required, as well as the effect of the flow field on erosion of bed material. Currently no methods exist to determine the flow field beneath vessels, only a few formulations for a single maximum velocity value are available, but these are not applicable at small underkeel clearances (h / T < 1. 25). Also the effect on the river bed is fairly unknown. To quantify the different effects of small underkeel clearances on the flow field physical model tests (with a length scale of 30) have been performed at Deltares. During these experiments a ship was towed through the flume, and flow velocities and pressures on the bed were measured, as well as forces on the ship. Additional experiments have been performed to investigate the effect on a moveable bed with different bed forms. From the experiments, {{it was found that the}} most important parameters that influence the flow field beneath the keel are the bow shape and the underkeel clearance. Barge bows force more flow underneath the keel than conventional bows, and this results in higher bed velocities. Decreasing <b>keel</b> <b>clearances</b> also result in significantly higher velocities at the bed. However, for very small underkeel clearances the boundary layer on the ship will interact with the boundary layer on the bed. This results in flow blockage underneath the keel. As a result, the flow needs to divert to the sides, and the velocities underneath the keel decrease. The diversion of the flow to the sides is also known as the fanning-out effect. This effect has definitely been proved by the measurements from the experiments. The effect (transverse velocities) increases with decreasing <b>keel</b> <b>clearance</b> (due to boundary layer interaction) and also increases with increasing ship widths. During the experiments, erosion of bed material was clearly observed, and its effect increased with decreasing <b>keel</b> <b>clearance.</b> However, the underkeel clearance needs to be very small (h /UKC < 1. 1) to give significant bed erosion. Due to the fanning-out effect and turbulence fluctuations, most sediment transport occurred immediately alongside the vessel, rather than underneath the keel. With bed forms such as dunes the erosion increased, due to erosion at the dune tops and deposition in the troughs (10 passages of a conventional vessel over a dune resulted in a decrease in dune height of 20 %). For the removal of small shoals this might be interesting, although a small underkeel clearance is necessary. Barges are preferred over conventional vessels due to the higher velocities and increased turbulence intensity. From the measured velocities during the physical model tests a model has been developed to predict the flow field underneath sailing inland navigation vessels. There are separate models for conventional vessels and for barges. The model is able to accurately predict maximum velocities (in sailing direction as well as in transverse direction), as well as a transverse velocity distribution. Compared to the previous prediction methods, the newly developed model is preferable. The results are more accurate, and the model is more extensive, due to the inclusion of transverse velocities and velocity distributions. More validation is required however, due to the lack of other data sets. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
