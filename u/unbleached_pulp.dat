In unbleached and oxygen-delignified eucalyptus kraft pulps containing both lignin and HexA, only HexA, or only lignin reacted with chlorine dioxide, ozone, and sulfuric acid under typical bleaching conditions. The maximum reaction rates of chlorine dioxide with lignin and HexA were 57. 2 and 26 mmol/kg/min, respectively, for <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp,</b> and 26. 7 and 13 mmol/kg/min, respectively, for oxygen-delignified pulp. The maximum reaction rates of ozone with lignin and HexA were 58. 6 and 132 mmol/kg/min, respectively, for <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp,</b> and 56. 8 and 134 mmol/kg/min, respectively, for oxygen-delignified pulp. The maximum reaction rates of sulfuric acid with lignin, and HexA were 1. 11 and 0. 93 mmol/kg/min, respectively, for <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp,</b> and 1. 95 and 0. 80 mmol/kg/ min, respectively, for oxygen-delignified pulp. Chlorine dioxide reacts faster with HexA {{in the presence}} of the residual lignin. The kinetic results suggest that pulp treatment with ozone, when justifiable, should follow but not precede chlorine dioxide oxidation. <b>Unbleached</b> <b>pulp</b> residual lignin and HexA react twice as fast with chlorine dioxide than the lignin and HexA present in oxygen-delignified pulp, while the pulp type has no significant effect on lignin and HexA reactivity toward ozone.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to evaluate {{the effects of the}} surface properties of unrefined eucalyptus pulp fibres concerning their performance in cement-based composites. The influence of the fibre surface on the microstructure of fibre-cement composites was evaluated after accelerated ageing cycles, which simulate natural weathering. The surface of <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp</b> is a thin layer that is rich in cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses, and extractives. Such a layer acts as a physical and chemical barrier to the penetration of low molecular components of cement. The unbleached fibres are less hydrophilic than the bleached ones. Bleaching removes the amorphous lignin and extractives from the surface and renders it more permeable to liquids. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) helps in understanding the fibre-cement interface. Bleaching improved the fibre- cement interfacial bonding, whereas fibres in the <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp</b> were less susceptible to the re-precipitation of cement hydration products into the fibre cavities (lumens). Therefore, unbleached fibres can improve the long-term performance of the fibre-cement composite owing to their delayed mineralization.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{structural}} modifications of the lignin of flax and sisal during the pulping (soda/AQ) and bleaching (TCF and ECF) processes. The residual lignins were isolated by acidolysis and subsequently characterized by Py-GC/MS and 2 D-NMR. Flax residual lignins have a predominance of G-lignin and low amounts of S-lignin units in the <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp,</b> which are also present in similar abundances in the residual lignin after TCF bleaching. After ECF bleaching, lignin was still present, {{with the presence of}} G- and H-lignin units, the latest being prominent now, and the complete absence of S-moieties. In the case of sisal, the residual lignin isolated from <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp</b> was enriched in S-lignin units, although the S/G ratio decreases to 2 indicating a preferential removal of the S-lignin during cooking. In the TCF bleached pulp, the residual lignin also presented a predominance of S-units, similar to that found in the <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp,</b> indicating that TCF bleaching did not affect in great extent the lignin composition. However, the analysis of the ECF bleached pulp indicated the complete removal of lignin markers. The NMR data gave also additional information on the lignin linkages. The main linkages observed in flax residual lignins were β-O- 4 ' alkyl-aryl ether, β-β' resinol and β- 5 ' phenylcoumaran, while in sisal residual lignins the main linkages were β-O- 4 ' and β-β' resinol, with only small amounts of β- 5 ' phenylcoumarans.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of process conditions (time, pH, temperature and consistency) on the optical properties of mechanical pulps during storage in a clean system as a reference for further work. Laboratory storage trials were performed with unbleached and hydrogen-peroxide bleached well-washed Norway spruce pulps. In general, the pulp darkened during storage due {{to an increase in}} light absorption, especially at shorter wavelengths. After long storage times, the light absorption coefficient, k had increased also at longer wavelengths. No specific peaks were seen in Delta k-spectra. The increase in light absorption was most rapid initially, during the first four hours, for all pulps when stored at high temperature (80 degrees C), and then proceeded more slowly. The corresponding change in colour, measured as a* and b*, was shifted towards red and somewhat towards yellow, and over longer periods of storage, the shift towards yellow became greater. Time and temperature were found to have the largest impact. The effects were similar regardless of the starting pH (4. 3 - 9. 7) and pulp consistency (5 %- 25 %). The hydrogen-peroxide bleached pulps were more sensitive to storage compared to the <b>unbleached</b> <b>pulp</b> at temperatures above 50 degrees C.
