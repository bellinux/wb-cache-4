40|$|We {{present a}} method for calculating the {{electronic}} structure of correlated materials based on a truly first-principles LDA+U scheme. Recently we suggested how to calculate U from first-principles, using a method which we named constrained RPA (cRPA). The input is simply the Kohn-Sham eigenfunctions and eigenvalues obtained within the LDA. In our proposed self-consistent LDA+U scheme, we calculate the LDA+U eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and use these to extract <b>U.</b> The <b>updated</b> <b>U</b> is then used in the next iteration to obtain {{a new set of}} eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and the iteration is continued until convergence is achieved. The most significant result is that our numerical approach is indeed stable: it is possible to find the effective exchange and correlation interaction matrix in a self-consistent way, resulting in a significant improvement over the LDA results, regarding both the bandgap in NiO and the f-band exchange spin-splitting in Gd, but some discrepancies still remain.

We first show that the use of regular tree patterns federates most of the known approaches for expressing XML functional dependencies while allowing to capture some of constraints not so far expressible. Then we show that in general the addressed problem is PSPACE-hard, but we exhibit a sufficient condition testable in polynomial time ensuring the independence of a functional dependency with respect to a class of updates...|$|R

ONMF has been widely applied for clustering, but it often suffers from high computational cost due to the orthogonality constraint. In this paper, we propose a method, called Nonlinear Riemannian Conjugate Gradient ONMF (NRCG-ONMF), which <b>updates</b> <b>U</b> and V alterna- tively and preserves the orthogonality of U while achiev- ing fast convergence speed. Specifically, in order to <b>update</b> <b>U,</b> we develop a Nonlinear Riemannian Conjugate Gradi- ent (NRCG) method on the Stiefel manifold using Barzilai- Borwein (BB) step size. For updating V, we use a closed- form solution under non-negativity constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets show consistent superiority of our method over other approaches in terms of orthogonality preservation, convergence speed and clustering performance.

30|$|We {{remark that}} {{although}} there exists other pre-computation-based approaches, our approach is unique as its pre-computation {{does not depend}} on users set. For example, the technique proposed in [12] pre-computes, for each user u_i, its k-th closest facility f_k and creates a circle C_i centred at u_i with radius dist(u_i,f_k). All such circles are indexed by an R-tree, and a RkNN query q is answered using the circles containing q. A disadvantage of it is that any change w.r.t. user set <b>U</b> requires <b>updating</b> or reconstructing the index. On the other hand, our guardian sets do not depend on U and do not require update with the change in U. This is a desirable property especially because in many real-world applications the updates in the locations of facilities (e.g. restaurants) are less common as compared to the locations of users (e.g. people).|$|R

In the boolean version, one only wants to know wheter Q(U(D)) is empty or not. In order to quickly answer this question, we are allowed {{to maintain a}}n auxiliary data structure, and the complexity of the maintenance algorithms is measured in (i) the size of the auxiliary data structure, (ii) the worst-case time per update needed to compute Q(U(D)) and (iii) the worstcase time per update needed to bring the auxiliary data structure up to date. We allow three kinds of updates: node insertion, node deletion, and node relabeling. Our main results are that downward XPath queries can be incrementally maintained in time O(depth(D) · poly(|Q|)) per update and conjunctive forward XPath queries in time O(depth(D) · log(width(D)) · poly(|Q|)) per update, where |Q | is the size of the query, and depth(D) and width(D) are the nesting depth and maximum number of siblings in the database D, respectively.
