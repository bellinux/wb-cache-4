40|$|Abstract- Safety {{has always}} {{been one of the most}} {{important}} topics of discussion within chemical, oil and gas industry organizations. Recent developments aiming to improve the safety of electrical machines <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas</b> include the adoption of risk assessment requirements for increased safety and non-sparking motors by the IEC 60079 - 7 : 2001 /: 2006 and IEC 60079 - 15 : 2005 standards. These requirements oblige manufacturers to prove their designs by testing, or to equip their products with special accessories if the risk levels exceed acceptable limits. As the risk assessment procedure requires input from both the manufacturer and end user, it also promotes collaboration in the interest of safety.

50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The gauge's Bourdon tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas.</b> Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|E
50|$|The first open-path {{detector}} {{offered for}} routine industrial use, {{as distinct from}} research instruments built in small numbers, was the Wright and Wright 'Pathwatch' in the US, 1983. Acquired by Det-tronics in 1992, the detector operated in the 3.4 μm region with a powerful incandescent source and a mechanical chopper. It did not achieved large volume sales, mainly because of cost and doubts about long-term reliability with moving parts. Beginning in 1985, Shell Research in UK was funded by Shell Natural Gas to develop an open-path detector with no moving parts. The advantages of the 2.3 μm wavelength were identified, and a research prototype was demonstrated. This design had a combined transmitter-receiver with a corner-cube retroreflector at 50 m. It used a pulsed incandescent lamp, PbS photoconductive detectors in the gas and reference channels, and an Intel 8031 microprocessor for signal processing. In 1987 Shell licensed this technology to Sieger-Zellweger (later Honeywell) who designed and marketed their industrial version as the 'Searchline', using a retro-reflective panel made up of multiple corner-cubes. This was the first open-path detector to be certified for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas</b> and to have no moving parts. Later work by Shell Research used two alternately pulsed incandescent sources in the transmitter and a single PbS detectors in the receiver, avoiding zero drifts caused by the variable responsivity of PbS detectors. This technology was offered to Sieger-Zellweger, and later licensed to PLMS. a company part-owned by Shell Ventures UK. The PLMS GD4001/2 in 1991 were the first detectors to achieve a truly stable zero without moving parts or software compensation of slow drifts. They were also the first infrared gas detectors of any kind to be certified intrinsically safe. The Israeli company Spectronix (also Spectrex) made an important advance in 1996 with their SafEye, {{the first to use}} a flash tube source, followed by Sieger-Zellweger with their Searchline Excel in 1998. In 2001 the PLMS Pulsar, soon afterwards acquired by Dräger as their Polytron Pulsar, was the first detector to incorporate sensing to monitor the mutual alignment of the transmitter and receiver during both installation and routine operation.|$|E

40|$|In gas {{extraction}} sites, the incidents of gas leaking poses a damage to workers on site. The {{protection for the}} workers is essential. However, due to the colorless and odorless nature of natural gas, {{it is difficult for}} humans to identify leaks. This paper proposes a quadrotor based gas tracking robot to be <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>hazardous</b> gas localization <b>areas,</b> and specifically, to detect methane leak from {{gas extraction}} sites. For the quadrotor to fulfill this purpose, it requires the ability to detect wind direction and speed, an endowment that commercial quadrotors lack. The need to detect wind direction and speed {{stems from the fact that}} gas plumes travel downwind, but the quadrotor needs to find the source of the leak, and hence, must determine the upwind direction to locate the source. In order to equip the quadrotor with the above skills, a wind direction and speed estimation algorithm based on Euler angles-velocity vectors has been proposed. For comparison purposes, we compared the proposed method with a generic ultrasonic wind sensor. We concluded that the proposed method achieves an error percentage as low as 10. 73 % for wind speed, and 9. 09 % for wind direction estimation. Thus, the algorithm is a significant addition to the quadrotors’ capabilities, enabling the quadrotor to trace upwards, against the traversal of the gas plume, and carry out accurate calculation...|$|R

40|$|Average annual losses {{caused by}} {{geologic}} hazards in Oregon {{are difficult to}} determine, owing to incomplete and scattered data. Preliminary considerations, however, indicate that losses to landslides may total between $ 4 million and $ 40 million per year. As many as nine persons {{have been killed by}} one landslide in Oregon in recent years. Losses through coastal retreat have totaled millions of dollars as large parts of major communities have been destroyed. Tsunami damage totals approximately $ 1 million and would probably be far greater {{were it not for the}} fortunate timing of the 1964 tsunami. Flood losses will average $ 36 million per year by the year 2000. Because this hazard is so large and complex, it is dealt with by several state and Federal agencies. Volcanic and earthquake hazards constitute long-range threats, with the potential for catastrophic consequences. Specific identifications of these hazards and long-range mitigative efforts can reduce the risk considerably. It is the aim of a good hazards investigation to regard not only the historic distribution of hazards but also the causes and the distribution of hazardous antecedent conditions. The net result is the generation of information that is more than purely a descriptive account of past events, but which is also a predictive tool for evaluating the impacts of contemplated changes <b>in</b> land <b>use.</b> <b>In</b> this way, the information becomes a powerful land-management tool. Effective mitigation and planning can only proceed on a firm foundation of accurate hazards analysis and mapping.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are expected to}} play an increasingly important role in data collection <b>in</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas.</b> However, the physical fragility of a sensor node makes reliable routing <b>in</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas</b> a challenging problem. Because several sensor nodes <b>in</b> a <b>hazardous</b> <b>area</b> could be damaged simultaneously, the network {{should be able to}} recover routing after node failures over large areas. Many routing protocols take single-node failure recovery into account, but it is difficult for these protocols to recover the routing after large-scale failures. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol, referred to as ARF (Adaptive routing protocol for fast Recovery from large-scale Failure), to recover a network quickly after failures over large areas. ARF detects failures by counting the packet losses from parent nodes, and upon failure detection, it decreases the routing interval to notify the neighbor nodes of the failure. Our experimental results indicate that ARF could provide recovery from large-area failures quickly with less packets and energy consumption than previous protocols...|$|R
