40|$|WHAT?S THE TAKEAWAY? The Texas {{franchise}} tax burdens taxpayers without generating sufficient tax revenue. The tax is particularly hostile to smaller businesses {{and the business}} services industry. Revenue would be better raised by replacing the {{franchise tax}} with either a value added tax (VAT) or a broader sales tax that includes consumer services. In 2006, Texas faced a fiscal double whammy. Not only had the Texas Supreme Court ordered the state to pick <b>up</b> more of <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> K- 12 education, but the legislature promised voters significant property tax relief. To achieve both goals simultaneously, the Texas Legislature expanded the state?s franchise tax (a form of corporate income tax) to include businesses other than corporations.

In 2000, though Degnan estimated that 300 day laborers could be found on the streets of Brewster in a given day, he again opposed a proposal by the Putnam County executive to construct a day laborer hiring center in Brewster for similar reasons. In time, Degnan would come to view a hiring center as a way to reduce the loitering and crime which many village associated with day laborers.But in 2000, he remained opposed.|$|E

40|$|Associations {{of mutual}} {{interest}} between {{the university and}} the corporations were natural, inevitable, and widely accepted. According to the state legislature, they were to be actively pursued. The legislature, in fact, was already counting the "resources " that could be "allocated " elsewhere in state government when corporations began picking <b>up</b> more of <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> higher education, so success in finding this money would certainly convince them that further experiments in driving the university into the arms of the private sector would be warranted, that actually paying for the university out of state funds was irresponsible, or even immoral, or even criminal (robbing widows and children, etc., to fatten sleek professors who couldn’t find real employment, etc.). – Moo, Jane Smiley In this chapter, we investigate a rather simple technique for partitioning a geometric domain. We randomly shift a (say unit) grid in IR d, and consider each grid cell resulting from this grid. The shifting is done by adding a random vector, chosen uniformly from [0, 1] d, so the grid to has the new point as its origin. Points that are close together have good probability to fall into the same cell. This idea can be extended to shifting multi resolutions grids over IR d. That is, we randomly shift a quadtree over a region of interest. This yields some simple algorithms for clustering and nearest-neighbor search. 10. 1 Partition via Shifting 10. 1. 1 Shifted partition of the real line Consider a real number ∆> 0, and let b be a uniformly distributed number in the interval [0, ∆]. This defines a natural partition of the real line into intervals, by the function x − b hb,∆(x) =. Lemma 10. 1. 1 For two numbers x, y ∈ IR, we have that Pr [hb,∆(x) � hb,∆(y) ] = min (|x−y...|$|R

5000|$|We {{liked that}} airplane, and found {{almost nothing to}} pick at. However, owners soon {{discovered}} to their horror that it didn't fly or land exactly like a strutless Skyhawk, and some heavy-handed Super-Car drivers managed to smash the Cardinal tail into the pavement on landing, knock-off a few nose-wheels, etc. (apparently, this was possible if one closed his eyes, used full back-pressure on the wheel at the flare and then sat rigidly waiting for the crashing noises to subside). Cessna accepted the blame gracefully. That was proper because, after all, they had lulled a generation of Cessna pilots into near-effortless flying with the extremely forgiving 172 series, and it probably wasn't ethical to suddenly offer, to many of those same customers, a Cessna that didn't handle exactly like a Cessna.

50|$|Bloodless {{medicine}} {{appeals to}} many doctors because it carries low risk of post-operative infection {{when compared with}} procedures requiring blood transfusion. Additionally, it may be economically beneficial in some countries. For example, the cost {{of blood in the}} US hovers around $500 a unit, including testing. These costs are further increased as, according to Jan Hoffman (an administrator for the blood conservation program at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania), hospitals must pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> the first three units of blood infused per patient per calendar year. By contrast, hospitals may be reimbursed for drugs that boost a patient's red blood cell count, a treatment approach often used before and after surgery to reduce the need for a blood transfusion. However, such payments are highly contingent upon negotiations with insurance companies. Geisinger Medical Center began a blood conservation program in 2005 and reported a recorded savings of $273,000 in its first six months of operation. The Cleveland Clinic lowered their direct costs from US$35.5 million in 2009 to $26.4 million in 2012—a savings of nearly $10 million over 3 years.|$|E
50|$|As {{it turned}} out, {{this would be}} the last game Harrick would coach in Westwood. Shortly {{before the start of the}} 1996-97 season, he was accused of falsifying {{receipts}} at a student-athlete recruiting dinner when two current players, Cameron Dollar and Charles O'Bannon, joined the table. Since Harrick paid for the entire meal, it amounted to an improper extra benefit for Dollar and O'Bannon. To cover up their presence, Harrick included the names of his wife and the wife of newly hired assistant Michael Holton on the expense report. When the school investigated, Harrick told Holton to tell athletic director Peter Dalis that Holton's wife was at the meal. However, a day later, Holton confessed that wasn't true. On November 6, 1996, Dalis and school chancellor Chuck Young gave Harrick an ultimatum: resign by the next morning or be fired. Harrick opted to take the firing. Although picking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> Dollar and O'Bannon was a secondary violation at best, Young and Dalis felt Harrick's attempted cover-up was unforgivable. However, Harrick claims that the NCAA has cleared him of wrongdoing.|$|E

5000|$|During the French Enlightenment, {{the theatre}} became {{a place where}} {{political}} and social ideas were considered myths and superstitions were tested. As more Enlightenment thinkers began to question the tenets of religion, many eighteenth-century citizens began to replace the pulpit with the stage, and looked to the theatre for their moral instruction as well as entertainment. [...] The nobility {{had a lot to}} do with the uprising of theatre during this time. Louis XIV, who is known as the [...] "Sun King" [...] for playing the allegorical character of the sun in [...] "The Ballet of the Night" [...] in 1653, moved his royal court from the capital, Paris, to Versailles, aspiring to get more control of the government. The Opera, which was built for Louis XV, however, was not built until later. His mistress, Marie de Pompadour, patronized artists, actors, and musicians while bankrupting France. Meanwhile, the aristocracy and church paid no taxes, and the bourgeoisie picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> the monarchy's tastes and fun.

5000|$|The {{international}} {{swine flu}} pandemic of 2009-10 did not occasion {{the need for}} air-transport under isolation of any CDC personnel. Consequently, the ABCS—which comprised three isolation units (but only one aircraft) by late-2011—was to some extent mothballed. That changed abruptly in late-July 2014 when Phoenix Air was {{asked if they could}} support a patient with a “bloodborne pathogen” (namely Ebola virus) as well as it could an “airborne pathogen” (such as TB or flu, for which it had been designed). Physicians from Phoenix, along with CDC experts, spent {{a day and a half}} reviewing the system, after which they all agreed it was suitable for Ebola patients. [...] "In fact, it's probably over-engineered for Ebola, because it's designed for airborne pathogens," [...] the Phoenix director stated. On 2 August 2014, the ABCS carried the first Ebola patient (Dr. Kent Brantly, an employee of Samaritan's Purse) ever to be evacuated to the United States; three days later, it transported another, Nancy Writebol. To date, Phoenix Air and the ABCS have flown five Ebola patients out of West Africa (four Americans—Brantly, Writebol, Dr Rick Sacra, and an unidentified American on September 9 -- and a German doctor from Sierra Leone to Hamburg, Germany).After the first two missions, Phoenix Air—which says it considered them successful [...] "proof-of-concept flights"—decided that it would only undertake future missions under the aegis of the U.S. government. Challenges such as dealing with U.S. customs officials, obtaining permission to transit foreign airspace, and the selection of specific destination medical centers had become too onerous. Since then, the U.S. Department of State has coordinated all such flights, including those for foreigners returning to their own countries. U.S. taxpayers pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> official government patients, but reimbursement is required for all others. (Brantly and Writebol each cost about $200,000, including the cost of equipment decontamination, which their organization paid.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Beginning around 2000, the Magic {{began to}} push the City of Orlando for a brand new arena, {{replacing}} the TD Waterhouse Centre. Since the city, as well as Orange County, were not keen on picking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> <b>for</b> a second facility in {{a little over a}} decade, the Magic stated they would contribute to the cost of building it. They did not, however, say how much. They also indicated they expected public dollars to be used, too. Discussions became contentious in 2001, as the team threatened to look elsewhere if Orlando would not build a new arena, or contribute a significant amount to a renovation. At the time, the team was losing $8 million annually. Magic President Bob Vander Weide stated, [...] "If we can't break even in the long term and we can't stay competitive, maybe this isn't the best place for us." [...] The Magic outlined where an arena should be built, the potential cost, what type of tax should pay for it and what could be done with the existing building once it was abandoned by the team. In a meeting with county and city officials, team owner DeVos said he was seeking $200 million in public money, including $121.5 million from the tourist tax collected by the county, $50 million from the city of Orlando and $28.5 million from the state. Officials were staunchly opposed. Any plans for renovation or replacement relied on tourist-tax revenue, and after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the numbers of tourists in the area declined sharply. Then-Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty were close to a deal for a major renovation, but talks were broken off for several years due to the sagging tourist tax dollars. At the grand opening of the Amway Center on October 1, 2010, Crotty remarked [...] "When I look around this building, I think to myself, 'Boy, am I glad that didn't work.' Sometimes good comes out of bad." ...|$|E
