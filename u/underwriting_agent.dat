5000|$|Lloyd's of London, an {{insurance}} market, is organized in syndicates - groups {{who share the}} business, risk, and reward, of underwriting insurance policies and similar projects. The syndicate acts as a market which offers insurance {{on the one hand}} and investment opportunity on the other. The active business of a syndicate is run by <b>underwriting</b> <b>agents.</b> The liability of an investor (known as a [...] "name") is unlimited - names share the profits but are also exposed to unlimited liability in the event of losses.|$|R
50|$|Lord Levene is Chairman of Starr <b>Underwriting</b> <b>Agents</b> Limited. Previously, {{he served}} as Chairman of Lloyd's of London, the world's leading {{specialist}} insurance and reinsurance market, from 2002-2011, after having been Vice Chairman of Deutsche Bank. Prior to this, he held the position of Chairman of Bankers Trust International and was formerly with both Morgan Stanley and Wasserstein Perella. He joined United Scientific Holdings in 1963, a small company which grew into a substantial supplier to UK and overseas Ministries of Defence. He eventually rose to the post of chairman of that group, in 1981.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{accepted}} that the <b>underwriting</b> <b>agents</b> had {{a duty to}} exercise due care and skill (see for instance, s 13 Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982). The question was whether the agents could be liable to the indirect investors (the names behind in the syndicate which had formed another syndicate). The problem {{was that there was}} a contractual relationship between the head syndicate managers and its direct members, but not necessarily a contractual relationship between the head syndicate managers {{and the members of the}} sub-syndicate. This led to the question of whether a duty could arise in tort, raising the matter of [...] "assumption of responsibility".|$|R
2500|$|In adjudicating {{questions}} of legitimate expectations, {{the court has}} two essential roles. First, it has {{to determine whether a}} legitimate expectation exists, and the nature of this expectation. Secondly, it has to determine whether sufficient justification is present to allow the public authority to depart from its expected obligations. The court is the sole judge of these questions. In Ex parte Coughlan the Court of Appeal observed that this role is defined by the requirement for procedural and substantive fairness in public law. The court plays a role of ensuring that such fairness is observed in dealings between public authorities and members of the public, since [...] "reneging without adequate justification, by an otherwise unlawful decision on a lawful promise or practice adopted towards a limited number of individuals" [...] can be considered an abuse of power by an authority.

50|$|Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) {{is a term}} {{commonly}} used in the insurance business. It describes the practice of deferring the cost of acquiring a new customer over {{the duration of the}} insurance contract. Insurance companies face large upfront costs incurred in issuing new business, such as commissions to sales <b>agents,</b> <b>underwriting,</b> bonus interest and other acquisition expenses.|$|R
25|$|Insurers {{will often}} use {{insurance}} agents to initially market or <b>underwrite</b> their customers. <b>Agents</b> can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, {{meaning that they}} can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to improved and personalized service. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like Self Help Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs etc.) to market their products.|$|R
