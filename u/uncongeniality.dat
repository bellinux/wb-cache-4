6000|$|Oliver {{levelled}} his keen eyes on him, {{as though}} noting down observations, {{while he was}} burning for tidings of Mary, yet held back by reserve and sense of the <b>uncongeniality</b> of the man. His aunt, however, {{in the midst of}} her own joy, marked his restless eye, and put the question, whether Mary Ponsonby had arrived? ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the same}} way, to Reginald Mohun, {{who had been}} obliged to retire as full Colonel, Mr. White was so {{absolutely}} distasteful {{that it was his}} sister's continual fear that he would encourage the young people's surreptitious jokes about their marble uncle. Sir Jasper, always feeling accountable for having given the first sanction, did his best for the brother-in-law; but in spite of regard, there was no getting over the <b>uncongeniality</b> that would always be the drop in Adeline's cup. The perfect ease and confidence of family intercourse would alter on his entrance! ...|$|E
60|$|And {{thus they}} looked forth upon this life. Neither {{was so young}} {{as not to be}} aware of its trials. She knew the sorrows of suspense, bereavement, and family disunion; and he, before his twenty-fourth year, had made {{experience}} of adversity, <b>uncongeniality,</b> disappointment, and severe--almost hopeless--everyday labour. It was not in the spirit of those who had not braced on their armour, but of those who had made proof of it, that they looked bravely and cheerfully upon the battle, feeling their strength doubled as faithful companions-in-arms, and willing in that strength and trust to bear patiently with the severest trial of all--the delay of their hopes. The cold but bracing wind, the snow driving and whirling round them in gusts, could not daunt nor quench their spirits--nay, rather gave them additional vigour and enjoyment, while even the tokens of the tempest that they bore away were of perfect dazzling whiteness.|$|E
60|$|So thought Mr Dombey, when he {{was left}} alone at the dining-table, and mused upon his past and future fortunes: finding no <b>uncongeniality</b> in an air of scant and gloomy state that pervaded the room, in colour a dark brown, with black hatchments of {{pictures}} blotching the walls, and twenty-four black chairs, with almost as many nails in them as so many coffins, waiting like mutes, upon {{the threshold of the}} Turkey carpet; and two exhausted negroes holding up two withered branches of candelabra on the sideboard, and a musty smell prevailing as if the ashes of ten thousand dinners were entombed in the sarcophagus below it. The owner of the house lived much abroad; the air of England seldom agreed long with a member of the Feenix family; and the room had gradually put itself into deeper and still deeper mourning for him, until it was become so funereal as to want nothing but a body in it to be quite complete.|$|E
6000|$|Rousseau {{was born}} with an {{organisation}} of extreme sensibility. This predisposition was further deepened by the application in early youth of mental influences specially calculated to heighten juvenile sensibility. Corrective discipline from circumstance and from formal instruction was wholly absent, and thus the particular excess in his temperament became ever more and more exaggerated, and encroached {{at a rate of}} geometrical progression upon all the rest of his impulses and faculties; these, if he had been happily placed under some of the many forms of wholesome social pressure, would then on the contrary have gradually reduced his sensibility to more normal proportion. When the vicious excess had decisively rooted itself in his character, he came to Paris, where it was irritated into further activity by the <b>uncongeniality</b> of all that surrounded him. Hence the growth of a marked unsociality, taking literary form in the Discourses, and practical form in his retirement from the town. The slow depravation of the affective life was hastened by solitude, by sensuous expansion, by the long musings of literary composition. Well does Goethe's Princess warn the hapless Tasso:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met {{her first}} five years ago--the wife of another man. Don't misjudge me, it was no lawless passion; it was a friendship, I believed, due to her {{intellectual}} qualities as much as to her womanly fascinations; for I was a young student, lodging {{in the same house}} with her, in an academic town. Before I ever spoke to her of love, she had confided to me her own unhappiness--the <b>uncongeniality</b> of her married life, the harshness, and even brutality, of her husband. Even a man less in love than I was could have seen the truth of this--the contrast of the coarse, sensual, and vulgar man with an apparently refined and intelligent woman; but any one else except myself would have suspected that such a union was not merely a sacrifice of the woman. I believed her. It was not until long afterwards that I learned that her marriage had been a condonation of her youthful errors by a complaisant bridegroom; that her character had been saved by a union that was a mutual concession. But I loved her madly; and when she finally got a divorce from her uncongenial husband, I believed it less an expression of her love for me than an act of justice. I did not know at the time that they had arranged the divorce together, as they had arranged their marriage, by equal concessions.|$|E
60|$|For in {{his first}} feverish flow of thought--the {{reaction}} to his benumbed will within and the beating sleet without--he believed Demorest as treacherous as his wife. He recalled his sudden and unexpected intrusion into the buggy {{only a few hours}} before, his mysterious confidences, his assurance of Joan's favorable reception of his secret, and her consent to the Californian trip. What had all this meant if not that Demorest was using him, the husband, to assist his intrigue, and carry the news of his presence in the town to her? And this boldness, this assurance, this audacity of conception was like Demorest! While only certain passages of the guilty meeting he had just seen and overheard were distinctly impressed on his mind, he remembered now, with hideous and terrible clearness, all that had gone before. It was part of the disturbed and unequal exaltation of his faculties that he dwelt more upon this and his wife's previous deceit and manifest hypocrisy, than upon the actual evidence he had witnessed of her unfaithfulness. The corroboration of the fact was stronger to him than the fact itself. He understood the coldness, the <b>uncongeniality</b> now--the simulated increase of her aversion to Demorest--her journeys to Boston and Hartford to see her relatives, her acquiescence to his frequent absences; not an incident, not a characteristic of her married life was inconsistent with her guilt and her deceit. He went even back to her maidenhood: how did he know this was not the legitimate sequence of other secret schoolgirl escapades. The bitter worldly light that had been forced upon his simple ingenuous nature had dazzled and blinded him. He passed from fatuous credulity to equally fatuous distrust.|$|E
5000|$|In his lifetime, Constable {{sold only}} 20 {{paintings}} in England, but in France he {{sold more than}} 20 {{in just a few}} years. Despite this, he refused all invitations to travel internationally to promote his work, writing to Francis Darby: [...] "I would rather be a poor man England than a rich man abroad."In 1825, perhaps due partly to the worry of his wife's ill-health, the <b>uncongeniality</b> of living in Brighton ("Piccadilly by the Seaside"), and the pressure of numerous outstanding commissions, he quarrelled with Arrowsmith and lost his French outlet.|$|E
30|$|As noted earlier, one {{finding of}} the Kaplan and Su (2016) paper was that {{correlations}} among the PVs and imputed CQ scales were biased. Kaplan and Su speculated that this bias was due, in part, {{to the fact}} that the PVs themselves were not included in the imputation models that they explored. Omitting the PVs as part of the imputation process leads to <b>uncongeniality</b> between the imputation model and the analysis model. This is a particular problem for secondary analyses of large-scale assessments insofar as the PVs of the cognitive assessments are, arguably, of primary policy importance.|$|E
3000|$|... “...uncongeniality... {{essentially}} {{means that}} the analysis procedure does not correspond to the imputation model. The <b>uncongeniality</b> arises when the analyst and the imputer have access to different amounts and sources of information, and have different assessments (e.g., explicit model, implicit judgement) about both responses and non-responses. If the imputer’s assessment is far from reality, then, as Rubin (1995) 2 wrote, “all methods for handling nonresponse are in trouble” based on such an assessment; all statistical inferences need underlying key assumptions to hold at least approximately. If the imputer’s model is reasonably accurate, then following the multiple-imputation recipe prevents the analyst from producing inferences with serious nonresponse biases.” [...]...|$|E
40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} assessed whether {{exposure to}} information {{is guided by}} defense or accuracy motives. The studies examined information preferences in relation to attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in situations that provided choices between congenial information, which supported participants ’ pre-existing attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors, and uncongenial information, which challenged these tendencies. Analyses indi-cated a moderate preference for congenial over uncongenial information (d 0. 36). As predicted, this congeniality bias was moderated by variables that affect the strength of participants ’ defense motivation and accuracy motivation. In support {{of the importance of}} defense motivation, the congeniality bias was weaker when participants ’ attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were supported prior to information selection; when participants ’ attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors were not relevant to their values or not held with conviction; when the available information was low in quality; when participants ’ closed-mindedness was low; and when their confidence in the attitude, belief, or behavior was high. In support of the importance of accuracy motivation, an <b>uncongeniality</b> bias emerged when uncongenial information was relevant to accomplishing a current goal...|$|E
40|$|Several {{statistical}} {{agencies have}} started to use multiply-imputed synthetic microdata to create public-use data in major surveys. The purpose of doing this {{is to protect the}} confidentiality of respondents’ identities and sensitive attributes, while allowing standard complete-data analyses of microdata. A key challenge, faced by advocates of synthetic data, is demonstrating that valid statistical inferences can be obtained from such synthetic data for non-confidential questions. Large discrepancies between observed-data and synthetic-data analytic results for such questions may arise because of uncongeniality; that is, differences in the types of inputs available to the imputer, who has access to the actual data, and to the analyst, who has access only to the synthetic data. Here, we discuss a simple, but possibly canonical, example of <b>uncongeniality</b> when using multiple imputation to create synthetic data, which specifically addresses the choices made by the imputer. An initial, unanticipated but not surprising, conclusion is that non-confidential design information used to impute synthetic data should be released with the confidential synthetic data to allow users of synthetic data to avoid possible grossly conservative inferences...|$|E
