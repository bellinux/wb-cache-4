5|$|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis paired <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> slapstick comedy for {{the first}} time at the 500 Club on July 25, 1946. While Martin was trying to get gigs as a singer, Lewis {{performed}} as a comedian at the club. One night a different act failed to show up and Lewis suggested to the owner that he hire Martin to do comedy with him. The owner was skeptical, but the two went ahead and tried to devise an act on paper in their hotel room, which did not work. The next night, they went on stage and improvised for three hours, bringing the house down. The comedy duo of Martin and Lewis was popular in nightclubs and in film from 1946 to 1956.|$|E

Sir Alan doubted any pitch of hers could have been worse than Kevin's, after noting that the theme had doomed the team, but advised her to step up if a similar situation arose again.|$|E

25|$|A popular locally {{produced}} children's television show, Happy Herb & Froggy Doo, features magician Happy Herb (Henry Winkler) and his wisecracking marionette sidekick, Froggy Doo. Froggy Doo is stolen {{and held}} for ransom, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is {{called in to}} investigate. Elliott Plumm (Chris Massoglia) used to watch the show, but now feels he is too grown <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so any longer. His five-year-old brother, Rocky, is a Froggy Doo fan, however. Their father, Mick Plumm (William Baldwin), is a recovering alcoholic and unemployed ex-boxer who believes Elliott's birth prevented him from going to the Olympic Games 12 years earlier. Mick's emotionally distant relationship with Elliott is causing Elliott to become emotionally troubled. Their mother, Roxie Plumm (Lisa Guerrero), is the only breadwinner in the family, and keeping her husband sober and attending to her job means she has little time for her children.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{had similar}} sentiments toward {{the quality of}} the lyrics to some songs in the album. Saraceno said that Lavigne [...] "still has some growing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> lyrically", asserting [...] "Sk8er Boi" [...] shows her [...] "lyrical shortcomings" [...] and calling the phrasing in [...] "Too Much to Ask" [...] "awkward and {{sometimes}} silly".

Dawson said, about the couple's future: [...] "Darren might stray if Nancy continues to push him away, but I think he's more paranoid about her leaving him. He's been a good boy far too long - I want him to man up and get his head together".|$|E

[...] All {{marketing to}} the typical Christian music stations used by his first solo album and his albums with Caedmon's Call was stopped, though the album still has explicitly Christian lyrics. [...] In comparison to Webb's previous work, this album has what's {{been referred to as}} an [...] "experimental" [...] style to it, and has been compared to the music of Wilco in that respect. Webb has stated that the album [...] "was doing away with people's expectations in order to free me <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what I wanted." [...] Following the release of I See Things Upside Down, Webb released a live concert DVD, How to Kill and Be Killed (2005).|$|E

Lisa begins to wear a beret to help her fit in better.|$|E
500|$|O'Malley was {{characterized}} a [...] "hapless naif". On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting to see is what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E
500|$|Princeton University Press {{received}} {{a copy of}} the typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from Smyth on August 17, 1945. The typographers had already started work from another copy. Maple Press of York, Pennsylvania, was lined <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the printing. Because of wartime shortages, one of a publisher‚Äôs biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper. Smith approached Manny and Leonard Relles from Central Paper, told them about the Smyth Report and its significance, and asked them if they could deliver [...] of paper to Maple Press in twelve days. They found a carload of paper on a siding in New England and sent it to York, providing enough paper for 30,000 copies, only half what Princeton University Press wanted. [...] The first edition of 30,000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30,000 copies. The presses were held for three hours while the train made its way to a siding in York, where the paper was unloaded and brought to the printing plant by trucks.|$|E

500|$|Flo & Eddie (singers Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman) {{arrived at}} the end of {{recording}} time when the band thought all the tracks were finalised. When they learned of the vocal duo's purpose, [...] "they weren't really up for it," [...] said Kaylan: the two veterans [...] "represented establishment... e literally felt like, {{for the first time as}} session guys, we were proving ourselves". In the end, however, the band members warmed to the pair, and concluded a successful session. [...] "We did the three or four cuts that Todd had brought us <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and we shook hands with everybody," [...] Kaylan recalled, but as they were preparing to leave, Rundgren asked them to listen to the album's planned single. After [...] "Love My Way" [...] played, Kaylan and Volman excitedly insisted that they be allowed to record some vocals for it. [...] "We have got to sing on this one," [...] Kaylan recalls thinking. [...] "If we don't sing on this one, we're not gonna sing on the hit. This is the fucking hit!" [...] The background vocals that Flo & Eddie ultimately contributed ended up being considered one of the highlights of their lengthy career.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce {{said the}} story in [...] "Christmas Scandal" [...] was so busy that it risked running awry, but was kept together {{by a number of}} strong comedic moments and subplots. Pierce particularly enjoyed watching the parks department scrambling to do Leslie's work, and the chemistry between both April and Andy, and Leslie and Dave. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said he [...] "thoroughly enjoyed" [...] the episode, especially the subplot of the parks department employees realizing how much work Leslie does due to her absence. However, he said way the sex scandal consumed the entire town and local media countered the central conceit of the series, [...] "that Leslie treats her mundane, small-town civil service job {{as if it were a}} high-stakes national politics job, while everyone else sees their world for what it is". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was [...] "a sweet and clever way to celebrate the holiday season", but that the media frenzy in [...] "Christmas Scandal" [...] was [...] "a little out of place in an episode filled with a ton of subtler, character-building moments". Fowler said the parks department employees splitting <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Leslie's work was [...] "a great element" [...] that helped develop Leslie's character.|$|E
500|$|There was broad {{agreement}} {{regarding the}} scene where Will asks Finn to be his best man: not one reviewer approved. Lynch called it [...] "questionable" [...] and said it crossed a [...] "line of weirdness", Slezak and TV Guide Kate Stanhope felt it was inappropriate, if not unethical, and Bell said the actual request was the episode's [...] "biggest WTF?! moment". Will's statement that Finn had taught him [...] "more about being a man" [...] was met with incredulity. Slezak declared [...] "Finn {{has a lot of}} growing <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before he's really a man", and Sullivan wrote that since Finn acted [...] "like a petulant man-boy" [...] on the show, Will must have been referring to events in [...] "a season of Glee that didn't air". Finn did receive some praise from Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter, however; she called the sequence where he discovers the truth about his father [...] "one of Cory Monteith's best scenes yet", and Slezak described it as [...] "beautifully handled" [...] by Monteith. Finn's marriage proposal to Rachel {{at the end of the}} episode was controversial. Reviewers thought it was a bad idea‚ÄîKubicek declared, [...] "No one in high school should get engaged"‚Äîbut Poniewozik wrote that it [...] "made a lot of sense for Finn" [...] as a character, and VanDerWerff said the scene [...] "worked" [...] for him.|$|E
