5|$|Designed for {{overseas}} service protecting Germany's maritime trade, Hansa {{spent the first}} nine years of her career abroad. In 1884, {{it was found that}} her hull was badly corroded; this stemmed from the lengthy construction period, during which the iron had already begun to corrode. As a result of the poor shape of her hull, Hansa was removed from active service in 1884 and used as a guard ship in Kiel. While in Kiel, she was also used as a training ship for engine-room personnel and stokers. She was formally stricken from the naval register on 6 August 1888. She was then used as a floating barracks in Kiel, until 1905. Hansa was then moved to Mönkeberg, hulked, and used to train stokers. The ship did not last long in this service, and was sold in March 1906 for 96,000marks. Hansa was broken <b>up</b> <b>later</b> that year in Swinemünde.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki raced in fourNASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) {{races in}} 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was {{considered}} NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers {{who wished to}} step up to the organization's premiere circuit, the Winston Cup. Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished in second place at his first career NASCAR race, which took place at the Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew <b>up.</b> <b>Later</b> that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several Winston Cup events.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1905, President Roosevelt further {{consolidated}} {{power in}} Panama by appointing Magoon Minister to Panama, to replace John Barrett. This put Magoon in the unique {{position of being}} both a governor of a U.S. territory and a diplomat to the country of which that territory was an enclave. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double appointment would ensure that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon would draw two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come <b>up</b> <b>later</b> to haunt him. With influential posts in both Panama proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiserin sank at 14:00; she was subsequently raised on 14 May 1936 and broken <b>up</b> <b>later</b> that year in Rosyth.|$|E
5|$|Though {{bitter about}} being sidelined, Stanford {{continued}} to compose. Between {{the turn of}} the century and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 his new works included a violin concerto (1901), a clarinet concerto (1902), a sixth and a seventh (and last) symphony (1906 and 1911), and his second piano concerto (1911). In 1916 he wrote his penultimate opera, The Critic. It was a setting of Sheridan's comedy of the same name, with the original text left mostly intact by the librettist, Lewis Cairns James. The work was well received at the premiere at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, and was taken <b>up</b> <b>later</b> in the year by Beecham, who staged it in Manchester and London.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's next {{fight was}} on December 1, 2012, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. His {{opponent}} was the undefeated WBA Super Welterweight Champion Austin Trout. Trout started the fight off fast, using his quick combinations to continually get his punches off first against Cotto. Trout also used his superior footwork to evade most of Cotto's punches, {{and was able}} to out muscle Cotto off the ropes when he was cornered in the fight. During the middle rounds, Cotto found success trapping Trout on the ropes and keeping him there, ripping Trout with body shots and finding the range with his left hook. Trout regained control in the later rounds, even backing Cotto <b>up</b> <b>later</b> in the fight, and stunned Cotto several times down the stretch with his straight left hand. Trout won the fight by a wide unanimous decision, giving him the biggest win of his career thus far. The judges scores were 117-111, 117-111, 119-109. Trout landed 238 of 779 punches (31%) and Cotto landed 183 of 628 punches thrown (29%). After the fight, Trout called out fellow light middleweight champion Canelo Álvarez. The fight averaged averaged 1.047 million and peaked at 1.4 million viewers, which set a record for Showtime boxing.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked <b>up</b> <b>later</b> by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{was also}} {{upgraded}} at this time. Thomas Ward Ltd supplied replacement track in 1955, {{and a new}} 0-4-0 diesel electric shunter was ordered from Ruston and Hornsby Ltd in 1959. It was delivered from Lincoln on a low-loader in 1960, and was so successful that a second engine of the same type was ordered the following year. The Hudswell Clarke steam engine was cut up on site in 1962, but the Corporation wrote to Peckett's {{to see if they}} would convert the Peckett engine to diesel hydraulic transmission. Peckett's declined, and so the engine was converted at the works, by cutting off the boiler and saddle tank, and fitting a Perkins diesel engine removed from a crane. It was completed on 12 May 1962, and worked well, although it spent most of its subsequent life working at Thrybergh tip. It returned to Blackburn Meadows in 1967, and was cut <b>up</b> <b>later</b> that year. A prototype steel side-tipping wagon was ordered from Robert Hudson Ltd of Leeds in 1955, and a further 22 followed in 1957, to replace the original wooden wagons. Charles Roberts and Co Ltd of Wakefield supplied 12 more in 1958, and a further 35 in 1961, with Hudsons supplying the final 6 in 1963.|$|E
5|$|This {{time the}} 27th Battalion {{was to play}} a key role. Moving off from {{positions}} around La Boiselle in the afternoon, the battalion advanced with two companies forward and two back in reserve {{under the cover of}} an intense artillery barrage. Due to congestion around the assembly trenches, the battalion arrived at its objective late. Nevertheless, the first wave managed to capture the first line of German trenches and although the follow-up waves became lost amidst thick smoke, the two assault companies began to consolidate their position during the night. In the early morning of 5 August, a heavy German counterattack was launched. This was turned back with considerable cost, with the Germans suffering an estimated 100 men killed and 60 men captured. Following this, the battalion sent out patrols into No Man's Land as reinforcements were brought <b>up.</b> <b>Later</b> during the day their positions were subjected to heavy shellfire from German guns positioned around Thiepval. Although successful, the attack proved costly with the battalion reporting the following casualties: 40 killed, 289 wounded and 67 missing. Afterwards they were relieved by the 48th Battalion and were eventually transferred to Belgium where they were rested in a 'quiet' sector south of Zillebeke.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race: two on Friday {{and one on}} Saturday. The first session ran for 105 minutes, the second 75 minutes, and the third 60 minutes. Conditions were foggy for the first session which cleared <b>up</b> <b>later</b> in the day. Junqueira was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 31.948 seconds; Tora Takagi was second and Paul Tracy third. Kenny Bräck was fourth-fastest, ahead of da Matta and Patrick Carpentier. Papis, Tony Kanaan, Michel Jourdain Jr. and Roberto Moreno rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Five yellow caution flags came out: the first was for Carpentier who had an engine failure while entering the fourth turn, the second for Bräck when he collided heavily with the turn four outside wall. Adrian Fernández's engine failed which littered debris onto the track, Papis spun after leaving the frontstretch and damaged his rear-end of his car when he hit the pit road exit barrier. A track inspection was necessitated when Castroneves' car leaked fluid onto the circuit.|$|E
