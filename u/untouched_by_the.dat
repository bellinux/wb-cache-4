5|$|Warburton was {{predominantly}} a farming village {{during the}} medieval period. The north western {{corner of the}} township {{was used as a}} deer park. Warburton grew as an agricultural town during the medieval period, and it remained almost <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Revolution; this is reflected in the population change between 1801 and 1901, dropping from 466 to 403, with little variation {{at a time when the}} rest of Trafford was expanding rapidly.|$|E
5|$|An equestrian {{statue of}} the General was erected in Boulogne-sur-Mer; the statue was inaugurated on October 24, 1909, at a {{ceremony}} attended by several units from the Argentine military. The statue was erected through purely private initiative, {{with the support of}} national government of Argentina, the municipal council of Buenos Aires and a public funding campaign. The statue is 10m high, on a 4m by 6m base; it is well known to locals. Located on the beach, it was virtually <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> numerous bombings campaigns during both world wars.|$|E
5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Civil War. Missouri, {{as a slave}} state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, a black man, was lynched in 1889.|$|E
50|$|Being {{relatively}} <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> man, <b>the</b> {{island has}} become a valuable location due to its presence of several kinds of seabirds, and seals.|$|R
50|$|On {{the western}} heath several neolithic dolmens are located. As {{they are not}} marked, they are {{relatively}} <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> tourism. <b>The</b> ancient circular rampart of Kampen also remains largely unnoticed.|$|R
50|$|Church legend {{claims that}} a large wooden crate was hauled out of <b>the</b> sea <b>by</b> Weligama {{fishermen}}. When it was opened, the statue was found inside, <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> seawater. <b>The</b> fishermen handed {{it over to the}} parish priest and the statue was placed in St. Mary's Church in Matara.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2003, the TF Warrior {{returned}} to Afghanistan, relieving TF Devil from the 82nd Airborne Division for Operation Enduring Freedom IV. For more than 6 months, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the}} country such as Paktika Province, going places previously <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote {{regions of the country}} to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|Later {{many other}} Sicilian {{towns and cities}} which had been either little damaged or {{completely}} <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> quake, such as Palermo, were also transformed by the Baroque style, as the fashion spread and aristocrats with a palazzo in Catania came to wish their palazzo in the capital to be as opulent as that in the second city. In Palermo the , began in 1566, {{was one of many}} in the city to be redecorated inside in the 18th century in the Baroque style, with coloured marbles.|$|E
50|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Veer-Zaara was {{released}} on CD, LP record and specially on Audio DVD. The music is based on old and <b>untouched</b> compositions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late Madan Mohan, as revised by his son Sanjeev Kohli.|$|R
50|$|The legend {{states that}} Vyaghrapada was a rishi {{and he was}} {{entrusted}} {{with the task of}} picking up fresh flowers, <b>untouched</b> even <b>by</b> <b>the</b> honeybees, for offering to Shiva in his aspect as Nataraja in the temple complex of Chidambaram, located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. While plucking the flowers, Vyaghrapada would get wounded on account of thorns and the rough surface. Shiva conferred on him feet of tigers and this ended the sage’s miseries. So armed with the tiger’s feet, the sage easily moved from place to place, including climbing rough trees to pluck fresh flowers <b>untouched</b> even <b>by</b> <b>the</b> honey bees.|$|R
50|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{relatively}} mild winter and spring climate, the south of Spain is attractive to overseas visitors-especially tourists from Northern Europe. While inland areas such as Jaén, Córdoba and the hill villages and towns remain relatively <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> tourism, <b>the</b> coastal areas of Andalusia have heavy visitor traffic for much of the year.|$|R
5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further {{opened to the}} outside world in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} defeat of Napoleon, the castle was {{disarmed}} and leased to John Manning, a Portland churchman, who converted {{it from a}} fortress into a private house. John's son, Charles Manning, took over the house in 1834 and continued to develop it. Among the Mannings' work was the conversion of an older house alongside the main castle, which had once housed the master gunner, into a grander property, known today as the Captain's House. In the late 1840s, the Portland Roads were converted into an artificial harbour {{through the construction of}} a breakwater, and new forts were built on the Verne heights and the sea front to protect it, although the structure of the old castle itself was left <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> growing complex of forts. Charles died in 1869 and, amid ongoing invasion fears, the War Office took over the castle again for use as accommodation for commissioned officers, including as a house for the adjutant of the Verne Citadel.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family, Nurmi left school at 12 {{to provide for}} his family. In 1912, he was {{inspired}} by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After a silver medal in the 5000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the world record in the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m races at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1500 m and the 5000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Olympics. Seemingly <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.|$|E
50|$|The {{highway is}} dotted with houses as it {{continues}} north between {{the river and the}} bluffs. The bluffs were created during the last ice age when this region of <b>the</b> midwest was <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> glaciers. <b>The</b> region is thus called the Driftless Area, referring to the lack of glacial drift, the material left behind by retreating continental glaciers.|$|R

25|$|Several notable {{buildings}} were relatively <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> quake. One significant {{example is the}} Torre Latinoamericana.

25|$|Also in 1609, a {{permanent}} Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter {{headed by a}} Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao. Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, Iligan, Basilan and Butuan. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Cross.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} a fire had been {{anticipated}} and fire guards had been posted to patrol the castle throughout the nights. However, one was ill and had not reported that he stayed home and the other had left his post for some hours. In any event, the fire was discovered all too late to salvage the main buildings. Only the “Giant tower” remained <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flames.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} century, during the Gothic Wars, the Goths were {{defeated by the}} Byzantines, and the Salerno briefly returned to the control of Constantinople (from 553 to 568), before the Lombards invaded almost the whole peninsula. Like many coastal cities of southern Italy (Gaeta, Sorrento, Amalfi), Salerno initially remained <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> newcomers, falling only in 646.

25|$|While the United States {{with its}} soil <b>untouched</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> war was enjoying {{prosperity}} and living standards {{of a sort}} never seen before in history, life in postwar Britain was comparatively grim. Living standards and life expectancy were low, there was little for working-class people to buy, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis continued to claim many lives. Automobile and home ownership were limited to the upper class of society. Birthrates were low compared to the contemporary baby boom in the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{justice of}} the peace from Brive, Moran, arrived at Le Glandier on 15 January.
