5|$|The FAA granted {{approval}} for the 767-400ER to operate 180-minute ETOPS flights before it entered service. Because its fuel capacity was not increased over preceding models, the 767-400ER has a range of , less than previous extended-range 767s. This is roughly the distance from Shenzhen to Seattle. No 767-400 version was developed, while a longer-range version, the 767-400ERX, was offered for sale in 2000 before it was cancelled a year later, leaving the 767-400ER as the sole version of the largest 767. Boeing dropped the 767-400ER and the -200ER from its pricing list in 2014. A total of 37 aircraft were delivered to the variant's two airline customers, Continental Airlines (now merged with United Airlines) and Delta Air Lines, with no <b>unfilled</b> <b>orders.</b> All 37 examples of the -400ER were in service in July 2016.

40|$|Singular {{perturbation}} {{methods are}} used to synthesize high-gain error-actuated continuous-time control policies for two production-inventory system models. In the first model {{it is assumed that}} the shipping rate is equal to the actual demand rate, whilst in the second model an <b>unfilled</b> <b>order</b> backlog is introduced so that it is not necessary that the shipping rate be equal to the demand rate. In both cases it is shown that the systems will exhibit good transient and steady-state behaviour when controlled by such control policies. It is also shown that non-interacting control can be achieved when an <b>unfilled</b> <b>order</b> backlog is introduced and that the provision of this extra flexibility thus leads to improved transient behaviour. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Health Services (LACDHS) was {{notified}} {{that a large}} nonprofit clinic serving {{the gay and lesbian}} community in Los Angeles used a nonrecommended preparation of penicillin to treat syphilis patients during January 1999 –March 2004. The clinic had inadvertently used Bicillin ® C-R, a mixture of 1. 2 million units (MU) benzathine penicillin G (BPG) and 1. 2 MU procaine penicillin G, rather than Bicillin ® L-A, a preparation that contains the 2. 4 MU BPG per dose recommended by CDC (1). Bicillin L-A is recommended for treating syphilis and upper respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible streptococci (2). Bicillin C-R is indicated for streptococcal infections of the skin and respiratory tract; however, its efficacy in treating syphilis is unknown. The inadvertent use of Bicillin C-R, which contains only half the recommended dose of BPG for syphilis, was discovered after a patient treated for syphilis read the product insert, which stated that the medication was not indicated for treatment of syphilis. Review of clinic pharmacy records revealed that it received a shipment of Bicillin C-R in lieu of an <b>unfilled</b> <b>order</b> for Bicillin L-A in late 1998 and that the pharmacy subsequently ordered Bicillin C-R until March 2004. The clinic used Bicillin C-R as its exclusive formulation of injectable penicillin during January 1999 –March 2004.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{purpose of}} the {{injection}} kicker is to provide the ultimate deflection to the incoming beam from the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) into the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The beam is kicked in the vertical direction to {{place it on the}} equilibrium orbit of RHIC. Each bunch in the AGS is transferred separately, and stacked box-car fashion in the appropriate RHIC rf bucket. In order to achieve the required deflection angle four magnets powered by four pulsers will be used for each ring of RHIC. When the bunches are stacked in RHIC the last few rf buckets are left <b>unfilled</b> in <b>order</b> to provide a gap in the beam to facilitate the ejection or beam abort process. This also means there is not a severe constraint on the fall-time of the injection kicker. One prototype pulser has been built and tested. Much of the development effort has gone into the magnet design. Although lumped ferrite magnets are simpler to build and require less power to reach ful...|$|R

40|$|The FY 2000 Flying Hour Program (FHP) {{comprised}} $ 3. 2 {{billion of}} the Operations and Maintenance, Navy (OandM, N) appropriation, nearly half of which was allocated to the Commander Naval Air Forces Pacific (CNAP) for flight operations and aircraft maintenance.

This thesis analyzed CNAP FHP cash management for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, including techniques used by managers to execute the under-funded FHP. It concluded that CNAP managers use risk contingent cash management strategies and techniques to fund requirements while carefully avoiding Anti-deficiency Act violations. These techniques include delaying required aviation repairs to future years, reducing at home squadron flying hours and using <b>Unfilled</b> Customer <b>Orders.</b> Navy budgeting does not recognize valid liabilities for some FHP related programs. The FHP is treated as discretionary and used annually as a source to pay these recurring liabilities, causing CNAP to be reactive in cash deficit control, always in need of fiscal rescue.
