25|$|The Parliament {{adopted the}} Law on the <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Languages</b> in 2006 {{committed}} Kosovo institutions to ensuring the equal use of Albanian and Serbian {{as the official}} languages. Additionally, other languages can also gain recognition at municipal level as official languages if the linguistic community represents at least 5% {{of the total population}} of municipality. The Law on the <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Languages</b> gives Turkish the status of an official language in the municipality of Prizren, irrespective {{of the size of the}} Turkish community living there. Although both Albanian and Serbian are official languages, municipal civil servants are only required to speak one of them in a professional setting and, according to Language Commissioner of Kosovo Slaviša Mladenović statement from 2015, no organizations have all of their documents in both languages.|$|E

25|$|The censuses on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> in the {{municipalities}} of the Brussels-Capital Region have shown that by 1947 French was becoming the most spoken language. However, in 1947, the percentage of residents declaring themselves bilingual was 45%, the percentage of monolingual Dutch-speakers was 9% {{and the percentage of}} monolingual French-speakers was 38%. In practice the bilingual citizens were most of the time bilingual Flemings. They were nevertheless recorded as bilinguals and not as Dutch-speakers.|$|E

The 1988 revision of the constitution (art. 129, §1) confirms that the parliaments of the French Community and the Flemish Community determine through decrees, each for their respective territory, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> in administrative matters, the education system, for social contacts between the employer and his employees, and for official documents in business. However, the constitution (art. 129, §2) makes an exception for municipalities with language facilities, stating that in those municipalities the law on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> for situations listed in [...] §1 can only be changed by a law adopted by a majority in both language groups.|$|E

2500|$|The Belgium Constitution guarantees, {{since the}} country's independence, freedom of {{language}} in the private sphere. Article 30 specifies that [...] "the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> spoken in Belgium is optional; only the law can rule on this matter, and only for acts of the public authorities and for legal matters." [...] For those public authorities, there is extensive language legislation concerning Dutch, French and German, even though the Belgian Constitution does not explicitly mention which languages enjoy official status. Article 4 does however divide the country into linguistic areas, which {{form the basis of}} the federal structure: [...] "Belgium has four linguistic areas: The French-speaking area, the Dutch-speaking area, the bilingual area of Brussels Capital and the German-speaking area." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to art. 7 of the 1966 {{law on the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> in the administration, the six {{municipalities}} {{situated in}} the Brussels periphery, namely Drogenbos, Kraainem, Linkebeek, Sint-Genesius-Rode, Wemmel and Wezembeek-Oppem, enjoy a [...] "special treatment" [...] and are called [...] "rim municipalities". As part of the wider Frenchification of Brussels and a process of urbanisation, these formerly Dutch-speaking municipalities became majority French-speaking {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. This phenomenon, known in Flanders as the [...] "oil slick", is, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in all of Belgian politics. All other municipalities with facilities, except for those in the German language area, plus Malmedy and Waimes, are grouped together as [...] "language border municipalities" [...] (art. 8).|$|E

60|$|The {{attributing}} to faculties {{that which}} belonged not to them, has given occasion to {{this way of}} talking: but the introducing into discourses concerning the mind, {{with the name of}} faculties, a notion of THEIR operating, has, I suppose, as little advanced our knowledge in that part of ourselves, as the great use and mention of the like invention of faculties, in the operations of the body, has helped us in the knowledge of physic. Not that I deny there are faculties, both in the body and mind: they both of them have their powers of operating, else neither the one nor the other could operate. For nothing can operate that is not able to operate; and that is not able to operate that has no power to operate. Nor do I deny that those words, and the like, are to have their place in the common <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> that have made them current. It looks like too much affectation wholly to lay them by: and philosophy itself, though it likes not a gaudy dress, yet, when it appears in public, must have so much complacency as to be clothed in the ordinary fashion and language of the country, so far as it can consist with truth and perspicuity. But the fault has been, that faculties have been spoken of and represented as so many distinct agents. For, it being asked, what it was that digested the meat in our stomachs? it was a ready and very satisfactory answer to say, that it was the DIGESTIVE FACULTY. What was it that made anything come out of the body? the EXPULSIVE FACULTY. What moved? the MOTIVE FACULTY. And so in the mind, the INTELLECTUAL FACULTY, or the understanding, understood; and the ELECTIVE FACULTY, or the will, willed or commanded. This is, in short, to say, that the ability to digest, digested; and the ability to move, moved; and the ability to understand, understood. For faculty, ability, and power, I think, are but different names of the same things: which ways of speaking, when put into more intelligible words, will, I think, amount to thus much;--That digestion is performed by something that is able to digest, motion by something able to move, and understanding by something able to understand. And, in truth, it would be very strange if it should be otherwise; as strange as it would be for a man to be free without being able to be free.|$|E
