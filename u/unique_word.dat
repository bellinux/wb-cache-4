2500|$|Fado (translated as destiny or [...] ) is a music genre {{which can}} be traced from the 1820s, but {{possibly}} with much earlier origins. It is characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or {{the life of the}} poor. The music is usually linked to the Portuguese word saudade, a <b>unique</b> <b>word</b> with no accurate translation in any other language. (Home-sickness has an approximate meaning. It is a kind of longing, and conveys a complex mixture of mainly nostalgia, but also sadness, pain, happiness and love).|$|E

'At certain {{critical}} {{moments in}} history,' he says, 'men {{have come out}} from the narrow and confined track of their daily life and seized in one wide vision the infinite universe; the august face of eternal nature is suddenly unveiled before them; in the sublimity of their emotion they seem to perceive the very principle of its being; and at least they did discern some of its features. By an admirable stroke of circumstance, these features were precisely {{the only ones that}} their age, their race, a group of races, a fraction of humanity, happened to be in a condition to understand. Their point of view was the only one under which the multitudes beneath could place themselves. For millions of men, for hundreds of generations, the only one access to divine things was along their path. They pronounced the <b>unique</b> <b>word,</b> heroic or tender, enthusiastic or tranquillising; the only word that, around them and after them, the heart and the intelligence would consent to hearken to; the only one adapted to the deep-growing wants, the long-gathered aspirations, the hereditary faculties, a whole moral and mental structure,--here to that of the Hindu or the Mongol, there to that of the Semite or the European, in our Europe to that of the German, the Latin, or the Slav; {{in such a way that}} its very contradictions, instead of condemning it, were exactly what justified it, since its diversity produced its adaptation, and its adaptation produced its benefits' (p. 272).|$|E

The ground truth e-texts are obtained from the Project Gutenberg website and aligned with their corresponding OCR output using a fast recursive text alignment scheme (RETAS). First, <b>unique</b> <b>words</b> in the vocabulary of the book are aligned with <b>unique</b> <b>words</b> in the OCR output. This process is recursively applied to each text segment in between matching <b>unique</b> <b>words</b> until the text segments become very small. In the final stage, an edit distance based alignment algorithm is used to align these short chunks of texts to generate the final alignment. The proposed approach effectively segments the alignment problem into small subproblems which in turn yields dramatic time savings even when there are large pieces of inserted or deleted text and the OCR accuracy is poor. This approach is used {{to evaluate}} the OCR accuracy of real scanned books in English, French, German and Spanish. Keywords-OCR evaluation; sequence alignment; digital librarie...|$|R
50|$|Only a {{few lines}} of Telesilla's poetry are extant, {{preserved}} in quotations by later authors. Various Greek writers have preserved various other single-word quotes from Telesilla, {{many of which are}} hapax legomena that preserve a <b>unique</b> <b>word</b> or a unique use of a word that would otherwise be unknown to modern scholars. This is helpful in improving modern understanding of ancient Greek, especially the Argolic Doric Greek dialect in which Telesilla wrote.|$|E

To the extent that any [...] "thing" [...] (including humans) honors God's unique idea of them they are holy. Holiness thus connects to [...] "vocation" [...] (from the Latin vocare for [...] "voice") in two ways. First, God creates through the word; and second, when being responds rightly to God's speech by expressing his <b>unique</b> <b>word</b> the result is Holiness.|$|E
