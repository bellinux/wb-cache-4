5|$|Salford Royal Hospital dated back to 1830 and was {{extended}} in 1911. It {{was closed and}} converted into flats. The modern Salford Royal, at Hope, near the boundary with Eccles, was opened in 1882 as the Salford Union Infirmary. Later renamed Hope Hospital and then again as Salford Royal, it is a large NHS hospital administrated by Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. In a 2006–07 review of all 394 NHS Trusts in England by the Healthcare Commission, Salford Royal was one of 19 to be rated excellent in its quality of services and its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport.

5|$|Around 1730, the Baroque style {{gradually}} {{began to}} break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} value level in {{learning}} oral Arabic among students at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia and its correlation with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> management strategies. The concept <b>of</b> value and <b>resource</b> management strategies {{is derived from}} the self-regulated learning framework. Value consists of three main components, namely intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and task value. Meanwhile, resource management strategies consist of four components, namely time and study management, effort regulation, peer learning and help seeking. The purposes of this study are to investigate (1) the value level among overall students, (2) the correlation between students’ value and their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> management strategies, and (3) the differences in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> management strategies between students with different level of value. The sample of this study comprised of 455 students and the data were collected through a questionnaire adapted from The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The study reveals that (1) the value level of students is high; (2) there are significant correlations between value and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> management strategies among students; and (3) the high value group <b>of</b> student <b>uses</b> significantly higher in all components <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> management strategies than the moderate group. This study has some classroom implications. It suggests that value components should be nurtured among students by selecting appropriate learning activities. Collaborative learning activities should also involve students of mixed value level which can be assessed through their prior learning experience and gender...|$|R
5|$|After Arthur Harris' {{appointment}} as GOC Bomber Command, the situation declined. Harris, since {{his days as}} a group captain at the Air Ministry's strategic planning division, had attacked the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> in maritime aviation, suggesting that bombing enemy shipyards and port facilities would solve the threat to trade defence. By November 1942, 259 Hudsons were available, but were shared by other services. The Whitley and Hampden were too vulnerable to operate near enemy coastlines without heavy fighter escort. Beaufort squadrons were sent to the Middle East to operate over the Balkans and North Africa. The highly successful de Havilland Mosquito was sought-after, but priority was given to the other two air commands. By February 1943, GOC Coastal Command John Slessor, had some 850 aircraft. But in respect of quality he was not impressed. Slessor continually wrote to the Air Ministry, complaining that Mosquitoes were being used as reconnaissance machines, while over 200 were being used by the RAF tactical air forces supporting the army, and merchant shipping was suffering high losses in the Atlantic. His successor Sholto Douglas' written records indicate the desire to upgrade, rather than produce new aircraft. By his tenure, January 1944, ten squadrons of Consolidated Liberators, five Vickers Wellingtons squadrons equipped with the Leigh light, and two Handley Page Halifax, Hudson, and Boeing Fortress squadrons were available. Among other technological developments, these long-range aircraft helped defeat the U-boats in May 1943.|$|E
