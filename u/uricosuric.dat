5000|$|Medications {{most often}} used to treat hyperuricemia are of two kinds: {{xanthine}} oxidase inhibitors and <b>uricosurics.</b> Xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease the production of uric acid, by interfering with xanthine oxidase. <b>Uricosurics</b> increase the excretion of uric acid, by reducing the reabsorption of uric acid once the kidneys have filtered {{it out of the}} blood. Some of these medications are used as indicated, others are used off-label. Several other kinds of medications have potential for use in treating hyperuricemia. In people receiving hemodialysis, sevelamer can significantly reduce serum uric acid, apparently by adsorbing urate in the gut.

40|$|Gouty {{arthritis}} {{is estimated}} to be the most frequent manifestation of inflammatory arthritis in men aged over 40. Hyperuricemia occurs because of both exogenous and genetic factors, which are particularly influential in some populations such as Taiwan aborigines. Current understanding of the disease etiopathogenesis, its clinical manifestations and the stages of its progression are presented here. The criteria for a correct diagnosis of the disease are also reported, pointing out how to distinguish gout from clinical events of different origin but with a very similar symptomatology. A distinction is made between the agents used to relieve the acute attack (colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids) and those used with the purpose of correcting hyperuricemia and preventing recurrences and complications (allopurinol, <b>uricosurics).</b> Mechanisms of action, administration routes, doses, side effects and contraindications of every drug are described.

40|$|In a {{previous}} {{issue of the}} journal, Becker and colleagues present efficacy and safety data from a large study comparing febuxostat to allopurinol. The study showed non-inferiority of febuxostat 40 mg/day in lowering serum urate compared to allopurinol 200 to 300 mg/ day. More importantly, the study showed a similar frequency of important cardiovascular adverse events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke) for febuxostat 40 mg/day (0 %), febuxostat 80 mg/day (0. 4 %) and allopurinol groups (0. 4 %). Other cardiac adverse event rates (unstable angina, coronary revascularization, cerebral revascularization, transient ischemic attack, venous and peripheral arterial vascular thrombotic event, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia) were also similar for febuxostat 40 mg/day (1. 3 %), febuxostat 80 mg/day (1. 2 %) and allopurinol groups (0. 9 %). A meta-analysis of safety data from published studies is presented.

40|$|The purine {{contents}} of commercial, low-alcohol and alcohol-free beers were determined. Four gout sufferers were studied under controlled conditions {{before and after}} ingestion of four different beverages containing alcohol, alcohol and purine, purine and neither alcohol nor purine.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} current {{management}} of gout {{in primary care}} with particular attention to lifestyle advice and drug management. Design: A retrospective non-interventional study of gout management. Subjects: Patients attending the Family Medicine Training Centre (FMTC) of the Prince of Wales Hospital between 1 st July 2003 to 30 th September 2003 with the diagnosis of gout. Main outcome measures: Baseline demographic data, frequency and quality of lifestyle advice given, serum urate levels and type of antihyperuricaemic drug used. Results: 279 patients were identified in the study. 53 % were given lifestyle advice. Amongst the 67 % patients given medications for acute gout control: 52 % had NSAIDs alone for acute attacks, 29 % colchicine alone, and 19 % both colchicine and NSAIDs. 70 % of patients were given allopurinol as antihyperuricaemic agent. None of our patients was prescribed <b>uricosurics.</b> 34 % had no obvious cause {{for the use of}} allopurinol. 19 % had multiple indications, the commonest being hyperuricaemia (49 %). The majority of those on allopurinol had urate levels of more than 0. 36 mmol/L. Different allopurinol doses had no different effect on urate levels. Conclusion: The current management of gout in terms of lifestyle advice and drug treatment for acute and chronic gout varied widely within our FMTC. Areas for improvement include the appropriate use of medications in the acute attack, the appropriate initiation of antihyperuricaemic agent, and the quality of message given in terms of lifestyle modification. Further auditing in gout management and the development of guidelines will provide additional benefits to our patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Chronic hyperuricosuria is {{associated}} with gout and uric acid nephrolithiasis. However, both conditions can occur {{in the absence of}} hyperuricosuria. Treatment of gout with <b>uricosuric</b> drugs can lead to uric acid nephrolithiasis.|$|E
5000|$|In general, <b>uricosuric</b> drugs {{act on the}} {{proximal}} tubules in the kidneys, where they interfere with the absorption of uric acid from the kidney back into the blood. Several uricosurics are known to act in vitro by blocking the function of a protein encoded by the gene SLC22A12, also known as urate transporter 1 or URAT1. URAT1 is the central mediator in the transport of uric acid from the kidney into the blood. In some persons with loss-of-function mutations of URAT1, the uricosurics benzbromarone and losartan had no effect, suggesting these drugs act on URAT1 in vivo.

40|$|Angelo L Gaffo 1, Kenneth G Saag 21 Birmingham VA Medical Center, 2 Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at BirminghamIntroduction: Gout is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} cause of arthritis in middle-aged and elderly populations, with its main predisposing factor being hyperuricemia (serum urate &gt; 6. 8 mg/dL). Options for treatment of chronic gout until 2008 were allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and the group of drugs known as <b>uricosurics</b> that stimulate the renal excretion of uric acid. A proportion of patients, including some with chronic kidney disease and solid organ transplantations, could not be treated with the those therapies because of intolerance, drug interactions, or adverse events. Febuxostat is a nonpurine xanthine oxidase inhibitor, recently approved in Europe and the United States {{for the treatment of}} chronic gout. Aim: To review the clinical evidence (phase II and III studies) of the effectiveness and safety of febuxostat for treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. Evidence review: Febuxostat, at doses ranging from 40 to 240 mg/day, is efficacious in reducing serum urate in patients with hyperuricemia and gout, comparing favorably with fixed doses of allopurinol in that respect. Early safety signals with respect to liver test abnormalities and cardiovascular outcomes have not been confirmed in recent large prospective trials but need to be further monitored. Clinical potential: Given its low cost and extensive clinical experience, allopurinol will likely remain the first-line drug for management of hyperuricemia and gout. Febuxostat may provide an important option in patients unable to use allopurinol, those with very high serum urate levels, or in the presence of refractory tophi.

50|$|Benzbromarone {{is highly}} {{effective}} and well tolerated, and clinical trials {{as early as}} 1981 and as recently as April 2008 have suggested it is superior to both allopurinol, a non-uricosuric xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and probenecid, another <b>uricosuric</b> drug.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{uncommon}} {{side effects}} include: anaemia and elevated liver enzymes and rare side effects include: tachycardia and Fanconi syndrome. Probenecid (a <b>uricosuric</b> drug) and intravenous saline {{should always be}} administered with each cidofovir infusion to prevent this nephrotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|By their {{mechanism}} of action, some uricosurics (such as probenecid) increase the blood plasma concentration of certain other drugs and their metabolic products.

50|$|<b>Uricosuric</b> {{medications}} (drugs) are {{substances that}} increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine, thus reducing the concentration of uric acid in blood plasma.

Drugs that reduce blood uric acid are not all uricosurics; blood uric acid can be reduced by other mechanisms (see other Antigout medications).|$|E
50|$|Serum pH {{is neither}} safely or easily altered. Therapies that alter pH principally alter the pH of urine, to {{discourage}} a possible complication of <b>uricosuric</b> therapy: formation of uric acid kidney stones {{due to increased}} uric acid in the urine (see Nephrolithiasis). Dietary supplements {{that can be used}} to make the urine more alkaline include sodium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, magnesium citrate, and Shohl's Solution (now replaced by Bicitra). Medications that have a similar effect include acetazolamide.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperuricosuria is {{a medical}} term {{referring}} {{to the presence of}} excessive amounts of uric acid in the urine. For men this is at a rate greater than 800 mg/day, and for women, 750 mg/day. [...] Notable direct causes of hyperuricosuria are dissolution of uric acid crystals in the kidneys or urinary bladder, and hyperuricemia. Notable indirect causes include <b>uricosuric</b> drugs, rapid breakdown of bodily tissues containing large quantities of DNA and RNA, and a diet high in purine.|$|E
50|$|Uricosurics {{are often}} used in the {{treatment}} of gout, a disease in which uric acid crystals form deposits in the joints. By decreasing plasma uric acid levels, uricosurics help dissolve these crystals, while limiting the formation of new ones. However, the increased uric acid levels in urine can contribute to kidney stones. Thus, use of these drugs is contraindicated in persons already with a high urine concentration of uric acid (hyperuricosuria). In borderline cases, enough water to produce 2 liters of urine per day may be sufficient to permit use of an <b>uricosuric</b> drug.|$|E
50|$|ABHD10 was {{identified}} in 2012, {{and only two}} main functions have been reported. First, ABHD10 {{is involved in the}} deglucuronidation of AcMPAG in human liver. The activity of this enzyme could attenuate the AcMAPG formation. AcMAPG might be responsible for some adverse effects of mycophenolate mofetil therapy because it promotes the release of TNF-α and IL-6, and it also binds to enzymes that are essential for the control of the energy and redox state of the cells. Thus, the function of ABHD10 could also be regarded as detoxification. Second, ABHD10 counteracts PRAG via deglucuronidation in human liver. As a widely used <b>uricosuric</b> agent, probenecid is mainly metabolized to PRAG, which is a causal substance of severe allergic or anaphylactoid reaction. The PRAG deglucuronidation catalyzed by ABHD10 could suppress PRAG formation and related adverse reaction.|$|E
50|$|Penicillin is {{actively}} excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared {{from the body}} within {{three to four hours}} of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused. This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The <b>uricosuric</b> agent probenecid proved to be suitable. When probenecid and penicillin are administered together, probenecid competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin's concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins resolved the supply issues, so this use of probenecid declined. Probenecid is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.|$|E
50|$|Yu {{conducted}} {{extensive research}} in which was continuously {{funded by the}} NIH for 26 years and she helped to establish the understanding a metabolic relationship between elevated levels of uric acid and the pain experienced by gout patients. She developed medicines that have been {{proven to be a}} successful for treating gout such as probenecid, a <b>uricosuric</b> drug which causes the removal of excess uric acid by being excreted with urine. In addition, Yu helped to establish a groundbreaking clinic at Mount Sinai for the treatment of gout, one of the first gout clinics in the United States at Mount Sinai. She later conducted a five- year study in which she discovered colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug that prevents recurring attacks of acute gout. In the 1960s, Yu further developed studies of gout’s mechanisms and soon discovered allopurinol, a drug that helps to prevent the formation of uric acid and used in treating gout and kidney stones. While at Mount Sinai Hospital, Yu helped to establish one of the first systemized laboratory tests for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis in which she later won the Master Award from the American Association of Rheumatology. In 1982, Yu published the book called The Kidney in Gout and Hyperuricemia. Being the first female to be appointed as Full Professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, she retired with Professor Emeritus status in 1992 at age 81. Professor Yu, MD was also awarded the Distinguished Career Achievement Award from Mount Sinai Medical Center. Yu was awarded Professor of Medicine Emeritus at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. In 2004, The Tsai- Fan Yu Foundation was established as a domestic, not-for-profit corporation. This charitable organization is a philanthropy, voluntarism, and grantmaking foundation serving purposes including religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals.

40|$|The acute {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} (i. v.) probenecid and chlorothiazide on renal urate handling were investigated in paired studies in normal men. <b>Uricosuric</b> {{responses to these}} agents were compared in the same subjects, both without and with pyrazinamide (PZA) pretreatment.

Defined in this manner, however, <b>uricosuric</b> responses to probenecid and chlorothiazide were significantly decreased after PZA pretreatment. In order to determine whether PZA diminished other renal actions of chlorothiazide, changes in sodium and inorganic phosphorus excretion were examined.
