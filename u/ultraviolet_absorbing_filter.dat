40|$|Abstract. The solar light {{consists}} of ultraviolet, visible and infrared ray. The ultraviolet and infrared rays, unlike visible ray, are not benefit to photosynthesis. Inorganic <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>absorbing</b> materials are mostly in crystallised phase such as TiO 2, ZnO and CeO 2 which caused lower transmittion in visible range.

TiO 2 emulsion for ultraviolet blocking was synthesized {{in this project}} in order to overcome such poor transmittion behavior. The preparative TiO 2 emulsion can absorb UV completely without interfering the visible light transmittance. This is because the synthesized TiO 2 via emulsion method was mainly an amorphous phase.
