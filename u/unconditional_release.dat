On July 11, 2008, Favre {{sent a letter to the}} Packers asking for his <b>unconditional</b> <b>release</b> to allow him to play for another NFL team. Packers general manager Ted Thompson announced he would not grant Favre an <b>unconditional</b> <b>release</b> and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to Aaron Rodgers as its new quarterback. Complicating matters was Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered genial. Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's <b>unconditional</b> <b>release.</b> Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E

5000|$|Archuleta filed a pro se {{petition}} (a {{petition to}} represent himself) for habeas corpus relief (seeking relief for unlawful detention) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Western District of Missouri in October, 2002 requesting an <b>unconditional</b> discharge and <b>release</b> from confinement {{in the prison}} hospital. He argued that the statute under which he was committed is unconstitutional because only a judicial unit, not an administrative one, can determine the length and conditions of his sentence and also whether his confinement after his successful NGRI defense could exceed the sentence he would have received if found guilty under the law. He further argued that his confinement in the prison facility far from the court was equal to [...] "banishment and exile" [...] and that [...] "forced treatment" [...] violated the Eighth Amendment. He also contested the finding that he had violated the terms of his conditional release, saying {{that he did not}} refuse the forced treatment [...] "but for the exception of being late on taking his anti-psychotic medication... one day". He also requested to withdraw his insanity defense.|$|R

On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers management asking for an <b>unconditional</b> <b>release</b> which will allow him to play for another team.

Also, the Packers would not start him as quarterback if he came back to the team, and named the other Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the starting quarterback and Favre as the backup.|$|E

According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre.

Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E
