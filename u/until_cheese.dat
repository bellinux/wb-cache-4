40|$|A growth {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} substituting spray-dried cheese food for spray-dried plasma protein on weanling pig performance. Five dietary treatments included the control diet or diets with cheese food replacing 25, 50, 75, and 100 % of the plasma on an equal lysine basis. Day 0 to 14 ADG and ADFI were decreased linearly as spray-dried cheese food increased. However, this decrease was most apparent when cheese food was included at more than 4 % of the diet. No effects of cheese food inclusion were seen for F/G from d 0 to 14 postweaning or for growth performance from d 14 to 28 or from d 0 to 28 postweaning. These results indicate that spray-dried cheese food resulted in a linear reduction in ADG and ADFI. However, the growth reduction was not apparent <b>until</b> <b>cheese</b> food was included at more than 4 % of the diet...|$|E

50|$|Mexican quesadillas are {{traditionally}} cooked on a comal, {{which is also}} used to prepare tortillas. As a variation, the quesadillas can be fried in oil to make quesadillas fritas. The main difference is that, while the traditional ones are prepared by filling the partially cooked tortillas, then cooked <b>until</b> the <b>cheese</b> melts, the fried ones are prepared like a pastry, preparing the uncooked masa in small circles, then topping with the filling and finally folding the quesadilla to form the pastry. It is then immersed into hot oil until the exterior looks golden and crispy.|$|R

50|$|The {{distinctive}} odour {{comes from}} the process with which the cheese is washed during its ripening; it is immersed in perry made from the local Stinking Bishop pear (from which the cheese gets its name) every four weeks while it matures. This process makes it a monastic type of cheese which owes its origin to the Cistercian monks who once farmed the pastures of Hunts Court Farm whence it was launched in 1994. As with many monastic cheeses, this variety is matured in humid cave-like conditions. To increase the moisture content and to encourage bacterial activity, salt is not added <b>until</b> the <b>cheese</b> is removed from its mould.|$|R

50|$|Queso Palmita is a soft, salty, fresh white farm cheese. The Palmita {{cheese is}} usually made in large {{circular}} containers 6 {{feet in diameter}} and four feet in height. Each Palmita Cheese batch can vary in taste depending on the ingredients which are mixed slowly for 2 to 3 days <b>until</b> the <b>cheese</b> has settled. Then the containers are set for an additional 10 days until coagulation. For the best taste, {{it is imperative that}} the cheese reaches an optimum level of saltiness. It is packaged into pressed wooden crates of 30 kilos each and set for distribution. Once the cheese is packaged, it must be sold within two to three days due to the sweating (loss of liquid) of the cheese from the boxes. Queso Palmita is originally from the Zulia State in northwestern Venezuela, which is the main source of dairy products in the country.|$|R
5000|$|According to history, Gabela {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in a contract between Nemanja, the ruler, and Dubrovnik (then called Ragusa) as Drijeva (the Croatian word for ship or ferry).

50|$|There {{are other}} street foods made with tortillas. Tostadas are flat hard tortillas either fried or dried on which are placed {{a variety of}} {{toppings}} such as shredded chicken, pork, beef, seafood, cheese and salsa. Quesadillas are derived from the Spanish word for cheese “queso” and refer to a tortilla folded in half and filled with cheese and possibly other ingredients such as spicy meat, mushrooms, chili pepper strips and more. The type of cheese used generally varies by region and in some areas, cheese is not even used unless requested. Empalmes are three stacked corn tortillas with beans, some kind of meat or stew which are typical {{in the state of}} Nuevo León. Gringas are two corn tortillas with a meat and cheese filling then toasted on each side <b>until</b> the <b>cheese</b> melts. Tlayudas are large dried tortillas topped with beans and other ingredients similar to a pizza or large tostada popular in the state of Oaxaca.|$|R

The dish is often served with garlic sauce and sambal, a hot sauce from the former colony of Indonesia. Kapsalon has a high energy content, with each serving containing approximately 7500 kJ, but apart from the high-GL fries, low in carbohydrates and hence glycemic load (GL). The term kapsalon means [...] "hairdressing salon" [...] in Dutch, alluding to one of the inventors of the dish.|$|R
50|$|Although {{rationing}} formally {{ended in}} 1954, cheese production remained depressed for decades afterwards. During rationing, most milk in Britain {{was used to}} make one kind of cheese, nicknamed Government Cheddar (not {{to be confused with}} the government cheese issued by the US welfare system). This wiped out nearly all other cheese production in the country, and some indigenous varieties of cheese almost disappeared. Later government controls on milk prices through the Milk Marketing Board continued to discourage production of other varieties of <b>cheese</b> <b>until</b> well into the 1980s, and it was only in the mid-1990s (following the effective abolition of the MMB) that the revival of the British cheese industry began in earnest.|$|R
50|$|In {{the central}} and {{southern}} regions of Mexico, a quesadilla is a flat circle of cooked corn masa, called a tortilla, warmed to soften it enough to be folded in half, and then filled. They are typically filled with Oaxaca cheese (queso Oaxaca), a stringy Mexican cheese made by the pasta filata (stretched-curd) method. The quesadilla is then cooked on a comal <b>until</b> the <b>cheese</b> has completely melted. They are usually cooked without the addition of any oil. Often the quesadillas are served with green or red salsa, chopped onion, and guacamole. While Oaxaca (or string) cheese {{is the most common}} filling, other ingredients are also used in addition to, or even substituting for, the cheese. These can include cooked vegetables, such as potatoes with chorizo, squash blossoms, mushrooms, epazote, huitlacoche, and different types of cooked meat, such as chicharron, tinga made of chicken or beef, or cooked pork. In some places, quesadillas are also topped with other ingredients, in addition to the fillings they already have. Avocado or guacamole, chopped onion, tomato, serrano chiles, and cilantro are the most common. Salsas may also be added as a topping.|$|R

5000|$|In 1774, {{the travel}} writer Alberto Fortis, {{on his way}} to Dalmatia, wrote about Pag island's products, {{including}} sea salt, sage honey, wool and Pag <b>cheese.</b> <b>Until</b> early in the 20th century, the inhabitants of Pag had their own dry stone huts in which they milked the sheep and made Pag cheese. These stone houses are adorned in sedge and reeds from the nearby fields, the huts were built out of town on the rocky hills above the pastures. The majority of the pastures are located on the hilly parts of the island and are recognizable by the dry stone walls that surround them. From far off, the intricate stone walls resemble the famous Pag lace (paška čipka) as they traverse the rocky summits. Historically, there was no private ownership of the pastures and the sheep freely grazed on all the land.|$|R
50|$|In 1869 the Streiffs {{sold the}} farm to Dietrich and Verena Freitag - also {{immigrants}} from Glarus, Switzerland. That same year, Nikolaus Gerber {{began to make}} Swiss-style cheese in the Streiff's old log house. This was around the time that chinch bugs and other factors were pushing farmers from growing wheat to other lines of business. Milk for the factory was supplied by the Freitag's herd and four other local farms. This was the first Swiss cheese factory in Wisconsin, operating in the cabin until 1877. Dietrich and the farmers took the factory over from Gerber in 1875 and operated it on the farm in various configurations <b>until</b> 1900. Swiss <b>cheese</b> manufacture became important to Green County's economy and remained so for decades; in 1938 the county produced {{a quarter of the}} Swiss cheese made in the U.S. Today some of Gerber's equipment is on display in the Swiss Historical Village in New Glarus.|$|R
40|$|A {{frequent}} difficulty {{encountered in}} the manufacture of Em-menthal or Swiss cheese is an abnormal gassy fermentation. These gassy cheeses are known to the maker as "niszler " or "pressler " cheeses, depending upon the rapidity and extent of the fermentation. Although much work has been done on this problem both here and abroad, and in spite of the now general practice of employing a starter of a high-acid-producing organism to combat abnormal fermentations, a large number of niszler and pressler cheeses result each season. In some factories the trouble is quite serious, an appreciable number of the cheeses being gassy, while in other factories it amounts to but a few cheeses in a month. A "niszler " cheese is characterized by a uniform distribution of very small holes throughout the cheese. Frequently this condition is not detected <b>until</b> the <b>cheese</b> is several weeks old. A "pressler " cheese is one in which the gassy fermentation is in evidence on the press. The gas holes are usually larger than those found in the niszler cheese and are in most cases confined to an area near the surface of the cheese. When the fermentation is particularly vigorous the cheese "huffs " and in extreme cases portions of it are forced between the board and the hoop, forming large lips. Those who have studied the gassy fermentations of the cooked cheeses are in accord as to the chief cause of the trouble, namely, the colon-aerogenes group of bacteria. Orla-Jensen (1921), Barthel (1910), and others have shown that the butyric aci...|$|R

Coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 100 % (25 / 25) of the row milk samples and in 8 % (2 / 25) of cheese samples. Twelve Staphylococcus species were identified within the selected 68 isolates, being nine negative and three positive for coagulase. Raw milk samples showed a high rate of coagulase-positive, being S. aureus the most common, whereas other product samples and equipment sulfates, pieces of furniture, utensils and manipulator gloves samples presented a high frequency of coagulase-negative and low frequency of coagulase-positive.
