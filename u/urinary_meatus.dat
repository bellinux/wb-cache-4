40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} had as its {{objective}} {{to compare the}} findings of voiding cystourethrography with those of duplex color Doppler in patients with suspected vesicoureteral reflux. MATERIALS AND METH-ODS: The research was developed through the study of ureterovesical jet angles, both in axial and longitu-dinal planes. Also, the distance (in cm) between ureteral meatuses was analyzed. RESULTS: From a total sample of 32 patients (mean age of five years and two months), 18 presented with vesicoureteral reflux (10 with unilateral reflux — 4 right-sided and 6 left-sided —, and 8 with bilateral reflux) and 14 patients did not presented with reflux. The angles of ureterovesical jet and distances between the ureteral meatuses were measured in all patients, and mean values, standard deviation and coefficient of variance were calculated. CONCLUSION: Data showed that a trend towards meatus lateralization {{is a sign of}} predisposition to vesicoureteral reflux. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney statistical analysis did not show significant differences (p> 0. 05) between groups (inclination angles of ureterovesical jet and distance between <b>urinary</b> <b>meatuses)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|With {{regard to}} non-penetrative sex, {{there is also}} variety. Frot {{is a form of}} male-male sexual {{activity}} that usually involves direct penis-to-penis contact. It is a form of frottage. Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the frenulum nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the <b>urinary</b> opening (<b>meatus)</b> of the penis head (glans penis). Intercrural sex is another form of non-penetrative sex that can be practiced between MSM. Docking (the insertion of one man's penis into another man's foreskin) is also practiced.|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: O presente estudo teve como objetivo comparar os achados da uretrocistografia miccional com o ultra-som Doppler duplex colorido, em pacientes com suspeita de refluxo vesico{{ureteral}}. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: A pesquisa foi realizada através do estudo dos ângulos dos jatos urinários intravesicais, nos planos axial e longitudinal. Foi analisada, também, a distância (em centímetros) entre os meatos ureterais. RESULTADOS: Do total de 32 pacientes estudados (com média de idade de 5 anos e 2 meses), 18 pacientes apresentaram refluxo vesicoureteral (10 com refluxo unilateral, sendo 4 no lado direito e 6 no lado esquerdo, e 8 com refluxo bilateral) e 14 pacientes não apresentaram refluxo. Os valores angulares dos jatos urinários intravesicais e as distâncias entre os meatos ureterais foram obtidos para todos os pacientes e foram calculados a média, o desvio-padrão e o coeficiente de variação. CONCLUSÃO: Os dados evidenciaram tendência de que a lateralização do meato ureteral seja sinal de predisposição ao refluxo vesicoureteral. A análise estatística não-paramétrica de Mann-Whitney não evidenciou diferenças significativas (p > 0, 05) entre os grupos (ângulos de inclinação dos jatos urinários intravesicais e distância entre os meatos ureterais).

40|$|A 15 years-old {{patient was}} brought to our {{attention}} in June 2010 with a complex genito-urinary malformation: fusion of the labia majora and a partial union of labia minora, common <b>urinary</b> and vaginal <b>meatus</b> and clitoromegaly. The patient had a normal sexual feminine hormonal development. After diagnostic iter the patient underwent surgery twice. No signs of hormonal deficency was shown authorizing us to approach the disease as a congenital malformation due to an abnormality of intrauterine development. So surgical treatment was carried out, considering it as {{the gold standard for}} this type of malformations. It's considerable to emphasize that the association between clitoromegaly and fusion of the lower third of the urethra with the vagina has not been previously reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A 94 -year-old woman {{visited a}} local urological clinic in January 2011 {{complaining}} of dysuria and vulvar discomfort {{that lasted for}} a month. Clinical examination showed a hematoma-like tumor at the external urethral meatus. She refused an operation. After 2 months, the tumor became hemorrhagic and she was referred to our hospital for operation. A black tumor of fingertip-size was seen at the external urethral <b>meatus.</b> <b>Urinary</b> sediment examination and urine cytology revealed malignant melanoma cells. The tumor showed T 1 WI high intensity, and T 2 WI low intensity by magnetic resonance imaging. Collectively, the patient was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. The tumor was extirpated. Pathological diagnosis showed malignant nodular melanoma. However, additional therapy was not performed due to her age and thereafter, the patient was followed up carefully. After 3 months, right inguinal LN swelled, and tumor recurred at the external urethral meatus. She died from multiple metastases 11 months from the initial consultation. We herein report this case of primary malignant melanoma of the female urethra in an elderly patient...|$|R
50|$|In anatomy, the urethra (from Greek οὐρήθρα - ourḗthrā) is a tube in placental mammals {{that connects}} the urinary bladder to the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> {{for the removal of}} fluids from the body. In males the urethra travels through the penis, and carries semen as well as urine. In females, the urethra is shorter and emerges at the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> above the vaginal opening.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} mammals, female spotted hyenas have a <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> that {{is located on}} the {{clitoral}} glans.|$|E

50|$|The vulva (wrapper, covering, plural vulvae or vulvas) {{consists}} of the external female sex organs. The vulva includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, bulb of vestibule, vulval vestibule, <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus,</b> greater and lesser vestibular glands, and the vaginal opening. The <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> is also included as it opens into the vulval vestibule. Other features of the vulva include: the pudendal cleft, sebaceous glands, the urogenital triangle (anterior part of the perineum), and pubic hair.|$|E
50|$|The {{membranous}} urethra or {{intermediate part}} of male urethra is the shortest, least dilatable, and, {{with the exception}} of the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus,</b> the narrowest part of the urethra.|$|E

50|$|In placental mammals, {{these three}} systems are more {{separate}}d. In females, separate orifices have evolved for all three, while in males, a common <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> discharges both urine and semen from the urethra.|$|E
50|$|It {{is likely}} that the cases he {{described}} were actually hypospadias, a condition in which the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> is {{on the underside of the}} penis. Neither condition has been shown to have a higher frequency in Jews or Muslims.|$|E
50|$|The main {{structures}} of the vulva are: the mons pubis, the labia (majora and minora) including the frenulum of labia minora, the external part of the clitoris (hood, glans), the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus,</b> the vaginal opening and hymen, and the greater and lesser vestibular glands.|$|E
50|$|The vulval {{vestibule}} (or vulvar vestibule) {{is a part}} of the vulva {{between the}} labia minora into which the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> (urethral opening) and the vaginal opening open.

Removal of the female partner's pubic hair is advised for more comfortable manipulation of the penis.|$|E
50|$|In male human anatomy, the {{foreskin}} is the double-layered fold {{of smooth}} muscle tissue, blood vessels, neurons, skin, and mucous membrane {{part of the}} penis that covers and protects the glans penis and the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus.</b> It is also described as the prepuce, a technically broader term that also includes the clitoral hood in women, to which the foreskin is embryonically homologous. The highly innervated mucocutaneous zone of the penis occurs near {{the tip of the}} foreskin. The foreskin is mobile, fairly stretchable, and acts as a natural lubricant.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of cystoscopy—flexible and rigid—differing in the {{flexibility}} of the cystoscope. Flexible cystoscopy is carried out with local anaesthesia on both sexes. Typically, a topical anesthetic, most often xylocaine gel (common brand names are Anestacon and Instillagel) is employed. The medication is instilled into the urethra via the <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus</b> five to ten minutes prior {{to the beginning of the}} procedure. Rigid cystoscopy can be performed under the same conditions, but is generally carried out under general anaesthesia, particularly in male subjects, due to the pain caused by the probe.|$|E
50|$|The male {{external}} urethral orifice is {{the external}} opening or <b>urinary</b> <b>meatus,</b> normally {{located at the}} tip of the glans penis, at its junction with the frenular delta. It presents as a vertical slit, possibly bounded on either side by two small labia-like projections and continues longitudinally along the front aspect of the glans, which facilitates the flow of urine micturition. In some cases the opening may be more rounded and this can occur naturally or may also occur as a side effect of excessive skin removal during circumcision. The meatus is a sensitive part of the male reproductive system.|$|E
