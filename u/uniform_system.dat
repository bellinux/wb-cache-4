5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a <b>uniform</b> <b>system</b> of accounting based on legislation recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the legal form of capital punishment and establishing of an eight-hour work day for public workers.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a <b>uniform</b> <b>system</b> of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E

40|$|We have numerically {{investigated}} {{whether or}} not a mean-field theory of spin textures generate fictitious flux in the doped two dimensional $t-J$-model.

We have compared the energetics of <b>uniform</b> <b>systems</b> with stripes directed along the (10) - and (11) -directions of the lattice, finding that phase-separation generically turns out to be energetically favorable. In addition to the numerical calculations, we present topological arguments relating flux and staggered flux to geometric properties of the spin texture. The calculation is based on a projection of the electron operators of the $t-J$ model into a spin texture with spinless fermions. Comment: RevTex, 19 pages including 20 figure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the time separations of events is a fundamental problem {{in the design and}} evaluation of discrete event systems. Important progresses have been made based on the event rule system model in the last decade. The existing results for event rule systems with min and max constraints can be summarized briefly as: the exact evaluation of time separations for acyclic systems is NP-complete; for cyclic systems, the structural condition of being tightly coupled is sufficient for long-term time separations of events to be bounded. In this paper, we establish a necessary and sufficient structural boundedness condition—uniformity for cyclic event rule systems with both min and max constraints. Tightly coupled systems are shown to be a special class of <b>uniform</b> <b>systems.</b> The well-known CAS algorithm for finding bounds on long-term time separations is adapted to find finite bounds for <b>uniform</b> <b>systems.</b> Our results are obtained by exploring the algebraic structures guiding the evolution of the systems...|$|R

25|$|Until March 2008, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), Grand Slam Committee, {{and several}} {{individual}} tournaments had conflicting rules on how Hawk-Eye {{was to be}} utilised.
