However, in order to get cobalt alloy films, high temperature (353 K) is necessary during the electroless deposition process which will increase costs and energy consumption. Ultrasonic was introduced during electroless plating process to obtain cobalt alloy films at lower initial temperature. It was found that the cobalt thin films could be prepared at lower initial temperature (323 K) with the introduction of <b>ultrasonic.</b> Therefore, different <b>powers</b> of <b>ultrasonic</b> were applied during the electroless deposition process to prepare CoP thin films on copper substrates from an alkaline bath in this investigation. The effects of different <b>powers</b> of <b>ultrasonic</b> on deposition rate, surface morphology, anticorrosion performance and magnetic property of films were studied. It was found that the deposition rate increased gradually with the rise in <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>powers</b> due to cavitation phenomenon. All the CoP films presented the typical spherical nodular structures with the impact of ultrasonic. Smaller and regular shaped structures could be observed when the films were deposited with higher <b>power</b> of <b>ultrasonic</b> which contributed directly to enhancement of anticorrosion performance.

50|$|Since 2004, {{different}} types of nanotube and nanowire based motors have been developed. Most of these nanomotors use hygrogen peroxide as fuel, but some notable exceptions exist. These silver halide and silver-platinum nanomotors are powered by halide fuels, which can be regenerated by exposure to ambient light. Some nanomotors can even be propelled by multiple stimuli, with varying responses. These multi-functional nanowires move in different directions depending on the stimulus (e.g. chemical fuel or <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>power)</b> applied. In Dresdan Germany, rolled-up microtube nanomotors produced motion by harnessing the bubbles in catalytic reactions. The bubble-induced propulsion enables motor movement in relevant biological fluids, but typically requies toxic fuels such as hydrogen peroxide. This has limited their in vitro applications. Further research into catalytical nanomotors holds major promise for important cargo-towing applications, ranging from cell sorting microchip devices to directed drug delivery.
