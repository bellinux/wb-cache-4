5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his <b>understeer.</b> At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the <b>understeer</b> and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience <b>understeer</b> or oversteer. Of the two, <b>understeer,</b> in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to <b>understeer</b> and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5000|$|... with k=10kN/radian, M=1000kg, b=1.0m, a=1.0m, {{the vehicle}} <b>understeers</b> below 11.3mph.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{function}} of speed. When the speed is low, the slip is negative and the body points out of the corner (it <b>understeers).</b> At a speed given by: ...|$|R
50|$|The torque {{vectoring}} rear axle differential is designed and manufactured by Magna Powertrain, {{and is being}} offered on Audi A4, A5, A6 and their derivatives (including RS models). The Sport Differential selectively distributes torque to the rear axle wheels thereby generating a yaw moment, which improves handling and also stabilizes the vehicle when it oversteers or <b>understeers,</b> thereby increasing safety.|$|R
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience <b>understeer</b> or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|Forsythe Racing {{teammates}} Tagliani and Carpentier rounded {{out the top}} ten qualifiers; Carpentier was {{hampered by}} an electrical problem which overheated his engine {{and was unable to}} improve his time when his blowoff valve opened {{between the first and second}} turns. Adrián Fernández was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was more than two-tenths of a second slower than Bräck. Fittipaldi's car developed a large amount of oversteer and reduced his pace in turn four and he took 12th. Jimmy Vasser and Oriol Servià took the 13th and 14th positions; Servià's car had oversteer after his first timed lap and drove into the pit lane where his crew made adjustments allowing him to drive faster for his second attempt. Nakano, 15th, had a large amount of <b>understeer</b> which slowed him in turn four. Dixon moved from his back-up car to his primary vehicle for qualifying and took 16th. Manning worked on his race setup but gearbox issues before the session prevented his team from focusing on a qualifying tune and he qualified in 17th. Mario Domínguez and Jourdain completed the qualifiers; Jourdain reduced his speed through the third and fourth turns after he oversteered and his slower pace prevented him from spinning.|$|E
5|$|Gutiérrez lost ninth {{position}} on lap 30 {{when he was}} passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water {{on the inside of}} the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres that lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his steering wheel, and he came out behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second pit stop (for new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced <b>understeer</b> and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his pit stop during that lap and came out behind the two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|E
5000|$|During {{pre-season}} testing journalists reported several {{reports of}} problems with the car's handling. It <b>understeered</b> travelling into the curve and oversteered as the car {{came out of the}} curve. Felipe Massa reported that the team needed to carry out substantial work {{in order to understand the}} car. Ferrari denied that the car was under-performing, but during the [...] both Alonso and Massa went off the track after struggling with the handling, and could only qualify 12th and 16th respectively. Alonso finished the race fifth, while Massa retired after a collision with Williams driver Bruno Senna.|$|R
50|$|At the restart Greg Murphy <b>understeered</b> off {{the track}} at the first turn in a self-inflicted mistake, backing the car into the wall and popping out the rear windscreen, handing second {{position}} to the charging Craig Lowndes. Whincup pitted {{at the end of}} lap 37 then on his outlap Whincup nosed into the wall at turn 8. Jason Bargwanna also hit the wall but continued. Most of the front runners pitted immediately, with Craig Lowndes striking Alex Davison leaving pitlane, subsequently leaving pitlane. Courtney missed the pitstop and had to pit the following lap but retained the race lead.|$|R
50|$|Fontana {{made his}} Formula One debut at the 1997 French Grand Prix {{replacing}} Gianni Morbidelli who had broken his arm {{prior to the}} race. He qualified 20th and retired when he <b>understeered</b> {{and ended up in}} a gravel trap. Prior to the British GP, team principal Peter Sauber looked for replacements to take Fontana's seat but eventually decided to keep Fontana on board. During qualifying, he missed a red light indicating that the car must come in for a mandatory weight check. Fontana drove past the light and was forced to start {{at the back of the}} grid. In the race, Fontana finished 9th despite his right leg becoming numb. At Hockenheim, he started 18th and finished 9th despite spinning early on.|$|R
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his second pole position of the season, his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:19.475. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Trulli who recorded a lap 0.271 seconds slower than the pole sitter and took his best qualifying performance of the season. Coulthard qualified third and said he could have set a better lap time as he saw a yellow flag out on the track. Trulli's teammate Frentzen qualified fourth but criticised Irvine for an apparent blocking manoeuvre. Häkkinen took fifth and suffered from <b>understeer</b> along with traffic during his second qualifying run. Barrichello secured the sixth place and reported his car was nervous. Alesi recorded the seventh-fastest time, despite experiencing alternator problems on his race car in the opening minutes of qualifying and switched to the spare Prost. Fisichella occupied the eighth position and reported his Benetton's handling had worsened. Ralf Schumacher and Irvine completed the top ten positions. Herbert set the eleventh fastest time, five one hundredths slower than his teammate and reported excessive oversteer on his car. He was ahead of Wurz in the slower of the two Benetton cars. Salo qualified in 13th position despite a misunderstanding with his race engineer over a yellow flag. Similarly, Jenson Button who took 14th in the other Williams, was caught out by the waved yellow flags. The two Arrows drivers filled the next two positions with Verstappen in 15th and Pedro de la Rosa in 16th; the latter crashed at the Raccasse chicane. BAR's Jacques Villeneuve started from 17th had an engine failure and was forced to use his team's spare car. Heidfeld took 18th and reported he experienced a lack of grip and <b>understeer.</b> He qualified ahead of Diniz and Ricardo Zonta in 19th and 20th respectively. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid; Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane and both crashed at Raccasse.|$|E
5|$|The fifth caution {{was shown}} on lap 188 when Moreno's engine failed {{on the top}} of the fourth turn and stopped at the exit of pit road to retire. Some drivers made pit stops for fuel under caution which would allow them to finish the race by using a rich fuel mixture which {{increased}} their top speeds. Racing resumed at the start of lap 196. Fernández veered right under acceleration on the same lap into the turn three entrance wall which removed his right-front wing section and his wheel. He slid across the track and stopped at the turn three infield apron, and the sixth caution was displayed. Consequently, Kneifel removed a further ten laps from the race's overall distance. The race restarted on lap 202 with Serviá battling Junqueira at the start-finish line for the lead. Serviá passed Junqueira shortly afterward and da Matta moved into second position. Tagliani overtook Serviá for second place on lap 204, while Papis passed Junqueira for fourth three laps later. De Ferran lost third after he was passed by Papis on the 209th lap; his engine went soft and sustained a punctured left-rear tire which increased <b>understeer.</b> On lap 213, Papis went underneath da Matta to move back into the lead, before da Matta recaimed the position on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less <b>understeer</b> and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E
50|$|Lap 14 saw Rick Kelly hit turn eight even harder, {{this time}} deranging the front {{right corner of}} the car, {{effectively}} putting him out of the race. Two laps later, Todd Kelly, having just made his first pit-stop, under-steered into the same barrier as his brother, with much lighter damage. Lap 21 saw Mark Winterbottom have an off and drop to 18th place. Holdsworth stayed out on a long stint. The stint came to an end when Holdsworth <b>understeered</b> off at turn 8, damaging the front right corner and cutting a brake line. Michael Patrizi crashed lightly into the same barrier and continued. Holdsworth was unable to make it back to the pits and a safety car was called for although Holdsworth pulled up off the course.|$|R
5|$|Johnny Cecotto Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the feature race by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, but lost the lead to teammate Evans heading into the first corner. Cecotto then <b>understeered</b> into the barrier while holding off Fabio Leimer and Jolyon Palmer spun in avoidance causing the turn to be blocked and the race was stopped because fifteen cars were stranded. Evans led the restarted race but lost the place to Bird after the pit stop phase. Bird opened up a healthy advantage {{over the rest of}} the field to win the race. Quaife-Hobbs started from pole position in the sprint race and kept the lead until Coletti passed him on the third lap. Although his lead diminished because of tyre wear Coletti led the remaining laps of the event to secure the victory.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominance}} of the MP4/13 was displayed in the opening race of the season, the 1998 Australian Grand Prix. Drivers Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard outclassed the competition by leaving every competitor at least a lap behind. Adrian Newey's aerodynamic design {{was by far the}} most efficient one and Mercedes produced the most powerful engine of the season. McLaren's dominance continued on the second race of the season in Brazil, but from the next GP in Argentina, Ferrari started closing the huge gap. However, the MP4/13 retained its superiority on high-speed tracks like Hockenheim and Silverstone, while Ferrari's F300 was closer to the McLaren on more technical circuits. Coulthard spoke of the MP4/13 later on, saying the car was fast but it <b>understeered</b> through slow corners; this was due to Newey's design that maximized the car's aerodynamic grip over its mechanical grip.|$|R
5|$|After the pit stops, which {{concluded}} on lap 91, Riggs reclaimed {{the first}} position. Kahne {{closed the gap}} to teammate Riggs, who was holding a lead of four-tenths of a second, by lap 95. One lap later, Kahne passed Riggs (who complained his car had too much <b>understeer)</b> for first place. Earnhardt moved into second when he passed Riggs on the 100th lap. Lap 105 saw the fifth caution; Waltrip lost control {{of his car and}} hit the turn four outside wall, causing him to spin while attempting to make a pit stop for fuel. During the caution, all drivers again made pit stops. Kahne maintained the lead at the lap-110 restart, followed by Earnhardt and Bowyer. Gordon passed Bowyer to claim third position one lap later. Bowyer lost two further positions when Burton and Johnson overtook him on the 115th lap. A sixth caution was prompted on the following lap when Kurt Busch spun leaving turn two and hit the inside wall on the backstretch; while attempting to avoid Busch, Sorenson lost control in turn two, and went towards the inside backstretch wall. Most of the leaders, including Kahne, made pit stops for fuel. Harvick and Kahne avoided a collision on pit road. Sadler led the field at the lap-121 restart, followed by Raines and Robby Gordon. Raines passed Sadler to reclaim the lead two laps later, while Sadler drove back to pit road with engine problems on lap 125.|$|E
5|$|Alonso lapped {{consistently}} {{in the low}} 1:19 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap of the race on lap41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12seconds. Räikkönen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop {{for the second time}} on lap43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of <b>understeer</b> over the team radio, made his second stop on lap46, two laps ahead of Räikkönen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap52, Räikkönen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but Räikkönen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the racing line as Räikkönen left the track at the run-off area. Räikkönen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from Räikkönen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran {{gained the}} lead and {{maintained}} it at the lap-104 restart. Bräck attempted to pass de Ferran around {{the outside of the}} first turn for first place but was unable to get ahead. De Ferran pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Dixon drove into the pit lane and became the race's fifth (and final) retirement on the 106th lap. His pit crew claimed his car was damaged following contact with Servià during the caution period. Kanaan was closely following Andretti but was held up by the driver which allowed Paul Tracy to pass him. The move caused Kannan's car to develop <b>understeer</b> and Vasser got ahead of him. Carpentier set the race's fastest lap during the 134th lap, completing a circuit in 25.521 seconds. On lap 138, Bräck drafted off slower cars while de Ferran was slowed by Papis in turn four. Bräck got ahead of de Ferran around the outside driving into the first turn to take over the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, Bräck led de Ferran by two-tenths of a second. As the two drivers went onto the backstraight, De Ferran drafted up to the outside of Bräck and closed up to him in the second and third corners. De Ferran steered right and overtook Bräck for the lead in the fourth turn's entrance. Both drivers avoided making contact at the corner's edge and de Ferran drove defensively causing Bräck to reduce his speed to avoid colliding with him.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Wurz was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session, one tenth faster than Mondini and two tenths faster than third fastest, Juan Pablo Montoya. Wurz was very pleased with his performance in practice, [...] "I went through my tyre choice and I {{have to say the}} way the circuit is progressing, it is coming to us just as it did at the Nurburgring, which is good. This makes me quite confident and positive that we will have a good weekend" [...] he said. Anthony Davidson had dislodged a marker stick in the [...] "Swimming Pool" [...] to cause the red flag {{at the start of the}} session. After the restart, Davidson got his entry to the [...] "Ste Devote" [...] corner wrong and <b>understeered</b> into the tyre wall, removing the Honda’s front wing and left front wheel.|$|R
50|$|Camaro Challenge: The Shoulder Check Challenge: In {{one of the}} show's most {{frequent}} challenges, the drivers each have to approach a split lane at 70 km/h, and then check left and right over their shoulder to see which lane (designated by a green marker) they must turn into. Each driver has two runs. Angelina is first-up, and on her first run drives at 100 km/h and closes her eyes, crashing straight through the central barrier, splitting the Camaro's front bumper in half and damaging its radiator. After the Camaro is repaired, Angelina takes another attempt, and nearly gets it right, but <b>understeers</b> and clips the barrier. Kevin <b>understeers</b> on his first turn, also clipping the barrier, and on his second run he steers too early and hits the lane markers; as he and Andrew note however, even this result is an improvement on the previous year. Shelby gets the challenge exactly right on the first go, as does Shirley. On his first run, Sly can't even {{make it to the}} end of the straight before driving through the lane markers, due to him turning his whole body rather than just his head. He then hits the lane marker again on his second run, this time by steering too soon. On his first run, Michael drives too slowly (at just 60 km/h) and slows down further toward the end of the straight. Andrew asks Yolanda for her honest opinion, and she launches into a tirade against Michael, which Andrew and the experts feel is an overreaction, and theorize is caused by pent-in anger at the driving-related injuries she's suffered in the past. On his second go, Michael passes with ease. Dale seems to get the technique right on her first go, but inexplicably turns into the lane she's told not to turn into. On her second go, she only checks over one shoulder and clips the central barrier, causing her to fail.|$|R
25|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Friday before the two races. In the {{practice session}}, held in windy conditions and on a dusty track, Mitch Evans was fastest {{with a time of}} one minute and 42.062 seconds, six-hundredths of a second faster than Stoffel Vandoorne in second. Raffaele Marciello was third-fastest, ahead of Abt, Stéphane Richelmi and Haryanto. André Negrão was seventh-fastest, Jolyon Palmer eighth, Trummer ninth and Conor Daly completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Julián Leal <b>understeered</b> off the track and into turn eleven; he spun off two corners later. Facu Regalia slid under braking and went off into the turn thirteen run-off area, while Rossi locked his tyres and ran wide at turn eleven. With two minutes remaining in the session, de Jong stopped in the run-off area leaving the first turn and practice ended early because of the limited amount of time available.|$|R
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between <b>understeer</b> and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
5|$|Vergne {{dropped down}} the order when his car {{developed}} a water pump battery failure {{and was forced}} to make an unscheduled pit stop to move into his second vehicle on lap eight, while di Grassi made his required pit stop for a replacement front wing on the same lap and narrowly avoided striking a trackside marshal after leaving his pit stall. López had dropped to 18th place by the start of the following lap. Bird briefly reduced the time deficit to Piquet until the latter responded to the Virgin car's fast pace. Rosenqvist lost control of the back-end of his car and slid backwards into the turn five barrier on the 14th lap, damaging his rear wing. The incident forced him to make a pit stop for the switch into his second car. López carried a large amount of speed exiting the chicane and made heavy contact with the wall on lap 17. Piquet was close behind him and took avoiding action but reacted late and had an <b>understeer</b> which sent him into the barrier. He did not damage his car and was able to reverse out of the barrier but lost the lead to Bird and Buemi moved into second place. The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car to allow marshals to repair the wall and extract López's car from the track. Some drivers (including Buemi) elected to make mandatory pit stops to switch into their second cars under safety car conditions {{at the end of the}} 20th lap.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather. Michael Schumacher clinched his ninth pole position of the season, his second at the circuit, with a time of 1:37.397. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who recorded a lap time 0.463 seconds slower than the pole sitter. Coulthard qualified third and suffered a worrying moment when a fire on his McLaren caused petrol to seep into his eye and admitted the incident could have escalated if not dealt with quickly. Barrichello, who was still suffering from flu, qualified fourth having been pushed from second position in the closing seconds of the session. Wurz qualified fifth, in his best qualifying performance of the season. Villeneuve secured the sixth fastest time despite having to walk to the pit lane when his BAR's engine was turned off on his final run. Irvine made changes to his set-up and secured seventh although he believed he could have been quicker as he backed off through turn 15. Ralf Schumacher lost four-tenths of a second on his fastest lap and managed eighth. Trulli and Frentzen rounded out the top ten qualifying positions for Jordan. Zonta missed qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second and lost time with a braking issue. Herbert, in his final Formula One race, qualified twelfth and struggled with <b>understeer</b> following an engine change. He was ahead of Fisichella, de la Rosa and Verstappen. Jenson Button qualified 16th and encountered traffic during the session which prevented him from setting a faster lap time. The Sauber, Prost and Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 17 to 22.|$|E
50|$|The {{session was}} red-flagged and {{suspended}} {{almost as soon}} as the circuit was open, when Holden Racing Team driver Garth Tander locked one of his tyres {{up at the end of}} Mountain Straight and <b>understeered</b> into the barrier on the outside of Griffins' Bend, in an incident similar to the one Chris Pither experienced in free practice. Tander was able to extricate himself from wall with largely cosmetic damage, and he limped back around the circuit to the pits while safety crews cleared away the fluids spilled by his Commodore in the accident. Tander's team were able to patch up the damage with sheets of tape, and while he was later heard on the radio complaining of his inability to stop the car and seen spinning at Hell Corner, he would ultimately set a lap time that would prove fast enough for a place in the Top 10 Shootout.|$|R
5000|$|The automobiles' suspension, brakes, and {{aerodynamic}} {{components are}} also selected to tailor the cars to different racetracks. A car that <b>understeers</b> {{is said to}} be [...] "tight," [...] or [...] "pushing," [...] causing the car to keep going up the track with the wheel turned all the way left, while one that oversteers {{is said to be}} [...] "loose" [...] or [...] "free," [...] causing the back end of the car to slide around, which can result in the car spinning out if the driver is not careful. The adjustment of front and rear aerodynamic downforce, spring rates, track bar geometry, brake proportioning, the wedge (also known as cross-weight), changing the camber angle, and changing the air pressure in the tires can all change the distribution of forces among the tires during cornering to correct for handling problems. Recently, coil bind setups have become popular among teams.|$|R
50|$|Lap 56 saw Vettel make {{a slight}} mistake in Turn 1, and allowed Kubica {{to make a}} run down the outside, towards Turn 3. Vettel braked early and Kubica was ahead turning in. However, Vettel turned in and his front wing locked onto the sidepod of Kubica's BMW. Due to this collision, both cars lost their front wings, but they carried on towards Turns 4 and 5. Kubica was ahead, but without {{downforce}} he <b>understeered</b> off the circuit into the wall and out of the race. Meanwhile, Vettel also made an error on the way into the corner, sliding and hitting the wall, causing his left front tyre to bend back on itself. He carried on, as he was still in the points at this time. He could only continue on for just over a lap, as he ground to a halt between Turns 10 and 11. As the debris was not cleared up in time, this led to only the second safety car finish in Formula One.|$|R
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded {{with the}} addition of a rear anti-roll bar, essentially the same bar as used on the Oldsmobile 442 and Buick Gran Sport. The front anti-roll bar was slightly stiffer. The result was a useful reduction in body lean in turns and a modest reduction of <b>understeer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{next few}} races came down more to {{strategy}} rather than speed. While having engine problems, Räikkönen successfully defended 2nd position from Rubens Barrichello in Austria. He came extremely close to winning in Monaco, but lost {{by less than}} a second to Juan Pablo Montoya. Starting from the pitlane in Canada after he went off track during qualifying with <b>understeer,</b> Räikkönen finished 6th, more than a minute adrift of race winner Michael Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|The Riviera's {{suspension}} used Buick's standard design, {{with double}} wishbones {{up front and}} a live axle located by trailing arms and a lateral track bar in the rear, but the roll centers were raised to reduce body lean. Although its coil springs were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera's lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards <b>understeer,</b> contemporary testers considered {{it one of the}} most driveable American cars, with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.|$|E
50|$|Weight {{shifting}} {{limits the}} acceleration of a front-wheel-drive vehicle. During heavy acceleration, weight is shifted to the back, improving traction at the rear wheels {{at the expense of}} the front driving wheels; consequently, most racing cars are rear-wheel drive for acceleration. However, since front-wheel-drive cars have the weight of the engine over the driving wheels, the problem only applies in extreme conditions in which case the car <b>understeers.</b> On snow, ice, and sand, rear-wheel drive loses its traction advantage to front or all-wheel-drive vehicles which have greater weight over the driven wheels. Rear-wheel-drive cars with rear engine or mid engine configuration retain traction over the driven wheels, although fishtailing remains an issue on hard acceleration while in a turn. Some rear engine cars (e.g., Porsche 911) can suffer from reduced steering ability under heavy acceleration, since the engine is outside the wheelbase and at the opposite end of the car from the wheels doing the steering. A rear-wheel-drive car's centre of gravity is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior.|$|R
50|$|When the car finally hit the market, its price, at $3668, {{was higher}} than the Cadillac 62 or Lincoln Capri luxury cars but came {{equipped}} with tachometer, electric windshield wipers, tinted windshield, windwings and whitewall tires. Because of the car's price and lack of performance, sales were low. The Darrin's unexceptional road performance did not help. A Willys Hurricane-6 produced 90 bhp, which allowed the car to reach {{a top speed of}} just 95 mph and go from 0 to 60 mph in around 15 seconds. While this was faster than the inexpensive MG TF, it was slower than the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider and Triumph TR2. Compared to the larger-engined Corvette, Nash-Healey and Jaguar XK120, the Darrin was completely outclassed. Also, while the Darrin possessed quick steering, it <b>understeered</b> considerably with brisk cornering and was not as agile overall as its European rivals. The ride, however, was comfortable for a sports car. Its brakes, borrowed from the much heavier Kaiser Manhattan, were excellent and the car proved easy to drive.|$|R
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Alex Lynn set the fastest time for Theodore Racing by Prema in the opening practice session—held in variable weather conditions—with a lap of two minutes and 14.495 seconds, 0.061 seconds faster than any one else at the track. His closest challenger was Félix da Costa in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Mücke Motorsport's Felix Rosenqvist in fourth position. Alexander Sims was fifth-fastest, ahead of Jaafar. Tom Blomqvist, Marciello, Lucas Auer and Korjus rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Sainz {{was the first of}} the drivers to go off the track in wet conditions and rebounded off the Fisherman's Corner barriers with his car's rear-end. His teammate King <b>understeered</b> into the same barrier eleven minutes later, while Rosenqvist crashed at San Francisco Bend on dirty tyres due to him running wide at Lisboa turn. Three other drivers—Sekiguchi, Lucas Wolf and Sun Zheng—failed to record a lap time as a consequence of encountering incidents during the session.|$|R
