The Detroit News editorialized that the <b>union</b> <b>contribution</b> demand was too much, and the likelihood of unions contributing would be slim. Other critics wrote that Bolger's demand would imperil the settlement. Bolger did receive support from conservative columnists and was urged to continue his demand.

50|$|Each player owns a {{shipyard}} with an attached {{production facility}} for goods, {{as well as}} a ship {{that can be used to}} transport goods. The game uses five kinds of (unnamed, but colour-coded) goods, which are represented as a miniature intermodal container (shipping container). Each player's ship can carry up to five containers. Initially each player has the means to produce one container in a single action; actions may be used to expand the player's production capacity (which also costs money). At the time of production, the player pays the player to his right a <b>union</b> <b>contribution,</b> and must place his newly produced goods in his factory store priced at between 1 and 4 currency units. Once containers are produced, another player—not the same player—may use an action during his turn to buy some or all of the containers, placing them on his dockside store priced as he chooses at between 2 and 6 currency units. Players can initially only keep one container in their dockside store, and must spend actions (and money) to buy more warehouses to increase their capacity.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study of trade union {{involvement}} in Sydney Alliance–a broad-based community coalition organising for the ‘common good’. The paper explores 3 main issues: the factors motivating unions {{to get involved in}} community-based organising; whether unions have the resources and capabilities to maintain long-term involvement with organisations outside the labour movement; and whether or not engagement creates the potential for rethinking union organising. Findings suggest that taking part in Sydney Alliance has created opportunities for unions to reflect and act upon internal organisational change to facilitate revitalisation and member participation; to improve the public image of unions and their engagement with civil society networks; and to counteract the loss of political influence with the Labor Party. At the same time, <b>union</b> <b>contribution</b> to the coalition has also proved difficult to sustain, in the main {{because of the lack of}} strategic capability of unions...|$|E
40|$|Background : While {{the health}} {{crisis in the}} former USSR has been {{well-documented}} {{in the case of}} Russia and other northern former Soviet republics, little is known about countries located in the southern tier of the region, i. e., the Caucasus and Central Asia. Objective : This paper presents new mortality information from two Caucasian countries, Georgia and Armenia. Results are compared with information from two relevant countries previously examined in the literature, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. Methods : Using official statistics (with adjustments when necessary), we compare adult mortality patterns in the four countries since 1979, for all causes and by cause for the recent period. For Kyrgyzstan results are presented by ethnicity, as its mortality levels have been impacted by its large Slavic population. Results : Adult mortality patterns in Armenia and Georgia have been more favorable than in Russia. This appears to be due to a large extent to lower mortality from alcohol-related causes. Mortality patterns in these Caucasian republics resemble those observed in Kyrgyzstan, especially when considering the native portion of the population. Conclusions : As far as mortality is concerned, Armenia and Georgia have weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union better than Russia. These results document a distinct southern tier pattern of adult mortality in the former Soviet <b>Union.</b> <b>Contribution</b> : This article enriches our understanding of the health crisis in the former Soviet Union by bringing new information from two lesser-known countries and further documenting the scale of heterogeneity in mortality experiences across this vast region...|$|E

40|$|Background : While social {{gradient}} in divorce has been explored in many Western societies, {{this issue has}} received less attention in Asia. Objective : Few existing studies offer evidence for how educational gradient in divorce shift from positive to negative in Asia. This study explores the changing divorce patterns by education for both sexes {{over the past four}} decades in Taiwan. Methods : Vital statistics of divorce since 1975 were used. Divorce rates were calculated and a synthetic cohort life table was also constructed to estimate the proportions of unions that remain intact with the duration-specific divorce rates observed in 2010. A separate life table estimating the actual marriage survivorship for the 1998 marriage cohort was also presented. Results : As Taiwan went through industrialization, the period findings show that a reversal in educational differential in divorce from positive to negative is observed for both sexes. Now the least educated men and women have become more vulnerable to union instability. Finally, synthetic cohort life table estimates indicate substantial educational differences in the proportions of recent marriages ending in divorce. Conclusions : The drastic increase in period divorce rates is accompanied by a reversal of educational gradient and expanding social inequality. Social gap in divorce rates expanded much faster among men than women across years. Given that remarriage rates for the disadvantaged are lower than the better educated, these patterns indicate that the disadvantaged is likely to spend an increasingly large proportion of their lives outside a marital <b>union.</b> <b>Contribution</b> : The divorce patterns revealed have critical implications for single-parent families, as well as family policies and social assistance...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} uses {{qualitative}} and quantitative analyses to {{examine the impact of}} the annual audits undertaken by the Audit Commission (hereafter the AC) at London Borough of Lambeth (LBL) on its management control system (MCS). The analysis reviews the audits undertaken between the years 2000 and 2010 and analyses the management reaction to these results to identify the impact on MCS. The objective of the research was achieved by developing research questions which served as a research framework. The study focused primarily on three research questions: (1) have the audit scores of the AC influenced MCSs at LBL?; (2) how has the audit scores of the annual audits completed by the AC influenced the MCS of LBL?; and (3) why has the audit scores of the annual audits completed by the AC influenced MCS at LBL?. The theoretical framework used in this study focused on three bodies of literature: the work of the Audit Commission, auditing and audits scores, and MCSs. The thesis used content analysis to analyse LBL’s submissions; audit results and recommendations; and improvement plans. Data for the analysis were collected via documentation, archival records, interviews, and direct and participant observation. As a local government authority, LBL receives most of its annual finance from central government to deliver services to local residents and businesses. As a result the central government, through the AC, audits them every year to ensure that they are effective and efficient with their resources. Between the years 2000 and 2004, LBL audit scores were one star out of possible four stars and this represented considerable risk to its continuous survival. It is worth noting that a council with more than three consecutive score of one star is classified as a failing organisation and that council is taken into ‘special measures’ – a situation where the central government takes administrative control of the council. The trend of audit scores at LBL had indicated the council needed to improve in the areas of: • Financial planning and monitoring; • Service performance improvement in areas such as cultural services; • Performance management processes; and • Use of resources and internal capabilities. After the audit recommendation of 2004, the council developed an improvement plan. This led to the implementation of the new financial control systems, performance management procedure and personnel control system. LBL’s performance measurement imitates the balanced scorecard approach developed by Kaplan and Norton (1992). The reactions at LBL are congruent with the findings of Asel (2009) which demonstrated that organisations with high perceived uncertainty are more likely to change their MCS. The research objectives limited the study scope which has opened opportunities for future research in local authorities such as: MCS as a package; the influence of other stakeholder; trade <b>union</b> <b>contribution</b> to MCS; and organisational leadership at local authorities. It is also worth noting that the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) is in a consultation process with an intention to outsource the work of the AC with effect from 2012 / 13 audits (www. audit-commission. gov. uk). 0023320375131...|$|E
