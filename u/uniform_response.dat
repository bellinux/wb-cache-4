25|$|Because of {{differences}} in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more <b>uniform</b> <b>response</b> are desirable, this is often {{not the case for}} music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC60268-4.|$|E

50|$|This {{correction}} {{is achieved}} by 'energy compensation' of the tube, which modifies the number of count events {{in accordance with the}} energy of the incident radiation by using an external filter collar of energy absorbing material. The collar has an increased attenuation of low energy gamma, and so compensates for the increased energy response of the naked tube at those levels. The aim is that sensitivity/energy characteristic of the tube should be matched by the absorption/energy characteristic of the filter. This results in a more <b>uniform</b> <b>response</b> over the stated range of detection energies for the tube.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Long-range {{detection}} of road surface {{in a sequence}} of images from a front camera aboard a vehicle is known as an unsolved problem.

It is an off-line algorithm which makes good use of currentandsuccessiveimagestobuildreliablemodelsofthecolor aspectsoftheroadandofitsenvironmentateachvehicleposition.

50|$|An {{alternative}} way {{of organizing}} reader-response theorists is {{to separate them}} into three groups: those who focus upon the individual reader's experience ("individualists"); those who conduct psychological experiments on a defined set of readers ("experimenters"); and those who assume a fairly <b>uniform</b> <b>response</b> by all readers ("uniformists"). One can therefore draw a distinction between reader-response theorists who see the individual reader driving the whole experience and others who think of literary experience as largely text-driven and uniform (with individual variations that can be ignored). The former theorists, who think the reader controls, derive what is common in a literary experience from shared techniques for reading and interpreting which are, however, individually applied by different readers. The latter, who put the text in control, derive commonalities of response, obviously, from the literary work itself. The most fundamental difference among reader-response critics is probably, then, between those who regard individual differences among readers' responses as important and those who try to get around them.|$|E

40|$|Structures of <b>Uniform</b> <b>Response</b> {{are special}} {{earthquake}} resistant frames in {{which members of}} similar groups such as beams, columns and braces of similar nature share the same demand-capacity ratios regardless of their location within the group. The fundamental idea behind this presentation is that seismic structural response is largely a function of design and construction, rather than analysis. Both strength and stiffness are induced rather than investigated. Failure mechanisms and stability conditions are enforced rather than tested. Structures of <b>Uniform</b> <b>Response</b> are expected to sustain relatively large inelastic displacements during major earthquakes. A simple technique has been proposed to control and address the gradual softening of such structures due to local/partial instabilities and formation of plastic hinges. In structures of <b>uniform</b> <b>response,</b> the magnitude and shape of distribution of lateral forces affects the distribution of story stiffness in proportion with story moments, therefore affecting the dynamic behavior of {{the system as a}} whole.

These three factors broadly shape the responses to change in funding mechanisms and pressures to increase research activity. A model of academic’s orientations to research is presented.

In this paper, we show for two PPD brands, Hamamatsu MPPC and SensL SPM, that the dark noise rate, breakdown voltage and rate of correlated avalanches can be inferred from the sole measure of dark current as a function of operating voltage, hence greatly simplifying the characterization procedure. We introduce a custom electronics system that allows measurement for many devices concurrently, hence allowing rapid testing and monitoring of many devices at low cost. Finally, we show that the dark current of Hamamastu Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) is rather independent of temperature at constant operating voltage, hence the current measure cannot be used to probe temperature variations. On the other hand, the MPPC current can be used to monitor light source conditions in DC mode without requiring strong temperature stability, as long as the integrated source brightness is comparable to the dark noise rate.

40|$|The {{sentinel}} and immune {{functions of}} microglia require rapid and appropriate reactions to infection and damage. Their Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense both as threats. However, whether activated microglia mount <b>uniform</b> <b>responses</b> or whether subsets conduct selective tasks is unknown. We demonstrate that murine microglia reorganize {{their responses to}} TLR activations postnatally and that this process comes with a maturation of TLR 4 -organized functions. Although induction of MHCI for antigen presentation remains as a pan-populational feature, synthesis of TNFa becomes restricted to a subset, even within adult central nervous system regions. Response heterogeneity is evident ex vivo, in situ, and in vivo, but {{is not limited to}} TNFa production or to TLR-triggered functions. Also, clearance activities for myelin under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, IFN >> factors reveal dissimilar microglial contributions. Notably, response heterogeneity is also confirmed in human brain tissue. Our findings suggest that microglia divide by constitutive and inducible capacities. Privileged production of inflammatory mediators assigns a master control to subsets. Sequestration of clearance of endogenous material versus antigen presentation in exclusive compartments can separate potentially interfering functions. Finally, subsets rather than a uniform population of microglia may assemble the reactive phenotypes in responses during infection, injury, and rebuilding, warranting consideration in experimental manipulation and therapeutic strategies.
