2500|$|The {{first major}} job that faced the {{development}} committee was finding and selecting a suitable {{site for a}} 700 <b>unit</b> <b>housing</b> project in northern New Jersey. The United States Housing Authority provided two site selection experts, and the New Jersey State Planning Commission provided assistance throughout the site selecting process. The final location had to be relatively inexpensive to purchase, be located near major utility networks for water, gas, electric and sewer connections, and be in a financially stable host community with underutilized public facilities and services. Major urban areas in northern New Jersey were eliminated early {{because there were no}} plots of land large enough for the project. The marshy rural areas near the shipyards were also found to be unacceptable early on. Quickly the committee began focusing its attention on the surrounding suburban communities, which were very popular among its work constituency. [...] Suburban communities, however, lacked financial stability, because they lacked the industrial rateables necessary to keep residential property taxes low. [...] The people of these prospective host communities were also frightened that the new project would be a direct liability rather than an asset for their towns.|$|E
