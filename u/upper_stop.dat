40|$|Abstract — Frequency-dependent {{coupling}} {{sections in}} direct-coupled resonator bandpass filters {{are used to}} generate attenu-ation poles at finite frequencies. The technique allows the pre-scription of attenuation poles {{on either side of}} the passband, symmetrically or asymmetrically, as opposed to overmoding the resonators where attenuation poles are generated only in the <b>upper</b> <b>stop</b> band. The frequency-dependent coupling sections are also used as inverters to determine the passband response. The classical inverter theory is used to obtain approximate designs which are subsequently optimized to fit the specifications. A third-order filter with four attenuation poles and a fifth-order with two attenuation poles are presented to illustrate the approach.

The ball movement is generated by the gravity force and non-harmonic oscillation of the baseplate in the vertical direction. The impact forces acting between the ball and plate and the stop are described by the nonlinear Hertz contact law. The ball motion is then governed {{by a set of}} two nonlinear ordinary differential equations. To perform their solving, the Runge–Kutta method of the fourth order with adaptable time step was applied. As the main result, it is shown that the systems exhibit regular, irregular, and chaotic pattern for different choices of parameters using the newly introduced 0 – 1 test for chaos, detecting bifurcation diagram, and researching Fourier spectra.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modular approach {{for the design}} of MMIC lumped and transversal filter with LC tuned amplifiers. The filtering improvement due to the introduction of LC tuned amplifier modules (LCTAM) as the transversal element on the conven­tional lumped and transversal structure is illustrated by comparing the performances of a single LCTAM and double LCTAM filters with a conventional one. In order to demonstrate the novel filter usefulness three filters with two transversal sections were implemented with the same typical 0. 5 um GaAs MMIC technology (a conventional, a single and a double LCTAM). It is shown that when we increase the number of LCTAM the rejection increases, however the chip area and complexity also increase. For a 1. 54 GHz centre fre­quency filter, a good compromise is the double LCTAM. This solution on the lower stop band (- 250 MHz) has 15 dB more attenuation than the other two filters and on the <b>upper</b> <b>stop</b> band (+ 250 MHz) has 17 dB and 20 dB more attenuation than the single LCTAM or conventional filter topology, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Recently a new {{systematic}} design rule was proposed to realize high-order UWB bandpass filters using cascaded E-shape microstrip structures. The responses of these miniaturized filters show one transmission zero {{at the upper}} stop-band. In order to improve the selectivity at the lower stop-band, this paper proposes {{a new generation of}} miniaturized high-order UWB bandpass filters having an attenuation pole in the lower stopband. The filters, employing the E-shape microstrip structure, are the cascade of third-order UWB bandpass filters electromagnetically coupled through λ/ 4 microstrip lines realised on the dielectric superstrate of the structure. A high selectivity sixth-order UWB bandpass filter is designed, simulated, fabricated and measured. The dimension of the filter is about 4 mm × 6 mm × 0. 5 mm excluding the feeding ports. The results from the simulation and measurement show good agreement. It is observed that this filter has attenuation better than 40 dB immediately after the passband, and over a large frequency range in the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>stop</b> bands. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Due to a {{high demand}} for {{high-speed}} wireless connectivity applications, the ultra- wide-band (UWB) technology is proposed, having frequency limits of 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz and a power transmission of - 41 dBm. Since UWB systems are extremely low power, the miniaturization ofUWB systems is desirable. Normal'ry. ttre front-end passive components part (antenna, bandpass filter, and balun circuit) of the UWB systems occupy a large space. Therefore, {{the research and development}} of miniaturised UWB bandpass filters with a high performance {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Based on its attractive features; compactness and low production cost, the E-shape microstrip structure with shorted and open middle stubs is analysed and their equivalent circuits, for the first time, are presented to show their responses. Using the equivalent circuit of the E-shape microstrip structure with shorted middle stub and considering that the input/output ports are directly connected to the structure, several second-order narrow and UWB bandpass filters are researched and developed. The proposed equivalent circuit of the miniaturised E-shape micro strip structure is then generalised for the case of E-shape microstrip structures directly cascaded through very short microstrip line. Several highly compact high-order UWB bandpass filters are developed including third, fifth, and seventh-order bandpass filters. These filters are realized with one transmission zero in the <b>upper</b> <b>stop</b> band attenuation. ill order to increase the lower stop band attenuation, a new design technique generating a transmission zero in the lower stop band too is introduced. This has led to a new generation of miniaturised UWB bandpass filters. These filters are realised using two lower order bandpass filters employing E-shape microstrip structure, coupled through a top-layer providing A. / 4 tight coupling structure. All the simulated examples are fabricated and their responses from measurement, simulation and equivalent circuit are found to be in agreement as discussed in the thesis., Next, the development of notched attenuated band in the UWB pass band is studied. As a result, a novel design technique to generate single and multiple notched bands in the miniaturised UWB bandpass filters employing E-shape microstrip structures is proposed. This is achieved by using IJ 4 short-circuited micro strip resq"na or or the E-shape microstrip structure capacitively coupled to the main filter structure. Generally, the measured results of the design examples are in excellent agreement with the theoretical results. Reasons for any discrepancies are elaborated and discussed. Finally, the realisation of the balance-unbalance (balun) circuit required in UWB systems to connect the passive to active front-end is investigated. Based on a traditional Marchand balun circuit, a technique to design a miniaturised differential ·coupler for UWB bandpass application is presented. In this technique, the Marchand balun circuit is realised in a double layer structure in order to obtain tight coupling for broadband balun. The simulated results for a balun are supported by the practical realisation. The results from measurement and simulation are generally in good agreement.
