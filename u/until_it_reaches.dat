5|$|Speeches are given, {{formally}} {{opening the}} games. Finally, the Paralympic torch {{is brought into}} the stadium and passed on <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the final torch carrier—often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation—who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.|$|E
5|$|The {{penetration}} front propagates {{to minimize}} the surface energy <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> {{the edges of the}} drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.|$|E
5|$|There is, however, {{one notable}} exception. In most implementations, COALESCE evaluates its {{parameters}} <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the first non-NULL one, while NVL evaluates {{all of its}} parameters. This is important for several reasons. A parameter after the first non-NULL parameter could be a function, which could either be computationally expensive, invalid, or could create unexpected side effects.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1934 election, {{the riding}} {{boundaries}} were changed. The western boundary was moved east to Bay Street. The boundary followed Bay Street north from the harbour <b>until</b> <b>it</b> curved northwest to meet Davenport Road. <b>It</b> followed Davenport <b>until</b> <b>it</b> met Avenue Road. It turned north following Avenue Road north skirting Upper Canada College {{on the east}} side <b>until</b> <b>it</b> met the old Belt Line Railway right-of-way. It then headed southeast following the right-of-way <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> Yonge Street. From here it turned south following a line through the Mount Pleasant cemetery and through a ravine called the Vale of Avoca (these days it is called David Balfour Park). It followed the ravine <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> the CPR right-of-way. It headed east along this right-of-way <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> MacLennan Avenue. <b>It</b> then turned south following this street and continued south on the same line when it turned into Sherbourne Street at Bloor. It continued along Sherbourne Street <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> the harbour.|$|R

5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of SR 89A {{is located}} at a junction with SR 89 north of Prescott near the Antelope Hills Golf Course and Ernest A. Love Field. The road heads east from the junction with SR 89 as a four-lane divided highway with diamond interchanges located at most intersections. It continues as a divided highway <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> Fain Road in Prescott Valley. The route continues beyond this intersection as a two-lane undivided highway.|$|E

50|$|Jan Weber, Anke Kayser, and Ursula Rinas, {{performed}} an experiment to test {{what happened to}} the methylglyoxal pathway when E. coli was {{in the presence of a}} constantly high concentration of glucose. The concentration of methylglyoxal increased <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> 20 μmol. Methylglyoxal concentration then began to decrease, once <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> this level. The decrease in the concentration of methylglyoxal was connected to the drop in respiratory activity. When respiration activity increased the concentration of methylglyoxal increased again, <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> the 20 μmol concentration (Weber 714-15).|$|R
5|$|To {{the south}} it {{includes}} the older buildings of Russell Sage College, Washington Square Park and the houses on Adams Street, the district's southern boundary. The mostly regular southeastern boundary follows Clinton Street <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> Ferry. Then it becomes ragged and irregular, reaching the district's northernmost extent at the former Grand Street Historic District. This extension allows it to include as well the Gurley Building and its surrounding neighborhood, formerly the Fifth Street-Fulton Street Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Hyderabadi haleem {{is cooked}} {{on a low}} flame of {{firewood}} for up to 12 hours in a bhatti (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden paddles throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E
5|$|After {{the artistic}} {{portion of the}} ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. The last hosting nation is {{traditionally}} the first nation to enter. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Queen's Baton is brought into the stadium and passed on <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands {{it over to the}} Head of the Commonwealth.|$|E
50|$|The {{boundary}} changed {{again in}} 1987. From {{the southwest corner}} where Highway 401 crossed the Humber River the boundary followed the river north to Steeles Avenue West. It then turned east following Steeles <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> Black Creek. <b>It</b> followed the river course south to Finch Avenue West. It then turned west following Finch to Keele Street. It then turned south following Keele <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> Highway 401. <b>It</b> then followed Highway 401 back west to the Humber River.|$|R

5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E
5|$|NY17A begins {{just south}} of NY17 exit124 {{in the village of}} Goshen. At the traffic light with the {{southern}} on-ramp from NY17 eastbound, NY207 becomes NY17A. The route quickly climbs to some of the hillier areas south of Goshen, offering views of not only Orange County's Black Dirt Region but Pochuck Mountain and High Point to the south in New Jersey. It then slowly descends past rolling meadows and farmland <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the small village of Florida, where NY94 comes in from the west shortly after the village border. The concurrent roads then become Florida's main street.|$|E
5|$|NY33 {{becomes a}} two-lane route once again as it heads out into Alden and {{eventually}} joins another state-maintained street radiating {{out from the}} city, Walden Avenue, unsigned NY952Q. NY33 and the Genesee Street name take over Walden's straight, slightly north-trending course as it leaves Erie County for Genesee County. In the latter, it intersects with NY77 {{in the center of}} the first community it encounters, the small village of Corfu. At the Batavia town line, it becomes Pearl Street, a name it keeps <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> NY98 within the city of Batavia.|$|E

50|$|After the pond, Kings Highway {{traveled}} southeast <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> Waters Avenue, {{which ran}} between Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues from 83rd Street <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reached</b> the Dyker Meadows. At Fourteenth Avenue, Kings Highway meandered around the northern {{limits of the}} Dyker Meadows Swamp, which occupied much of the block between Fourteenth and Fifteenth avenues between 83rd and 84th streets. From Sixteenth Avenue to Eighteenth Avenue, Kings Highway ran on a slight diagonal; this section appears in today’s street grid as 84th Street.|$|R
5|$|The 5 o'clock wave is {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river at high speed, and indeed visitors are told it is so powerful that surfers can ride it along the meandering river <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the town of Narrandera.|$|E
5|$|The road then {{bypasses}} Ilchester and RNAS Yeovilton and widens to {{dual carriageway}} again. Between Ilchester and Shores Bridge (over the River Parrett, east of South Petherton) the road follows {{the course of}} the Roman Fosse Way. At Yeovilton the road becomes dual two lane again, and connects with the A37 which joins it <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the end of the bypass. This final section of dual carriageway ends at South Petherton. It runs north of Ilminster as a three-lane road where it meets the A358, providing access to the M5 motorway.|$|E
5|$|This list of {{bridges and}} other fixed links serving the Island of Montreal {{proceeds}} counter-clockwise {{around the island}} from southwest, at the exit of Lake Saint-Louis, downstream along the St. Lawrence River, then upstream along Rivière des Prairies {{all the way to}} Lake of Two Mountains, then downstream again along the East Channel of the Ottawa River <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> Lake Saint-Louis. The year of construction is that of the structure currently in place, accompanied by the year of construction of the original structure if the current one replaced an older span.|$|E

5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates {{as part of a}} large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing through}} El Dorado, the Kansas Turnpike crosses the northernmost arms of El Dorado Lake. This marks the turnpike's {{entry into the}} Flint Hills, a band of hills in eastern Kansas. The turnpike does not leave this region {{completely}} <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> Topeka. As the highway continues northeast past El Dorado Lake, it runs roughly parallel to the Walnut River to the west, which feeds the reservoir, and K-177 to the east. Northwest {{of the town of}} Cassoday, K-177 finally crosses the turnpike, with Exit 92 (Cassoday), a diamond interchange, providing a connector to the state highway. The interchange was not present when the turnpike opened in 1956, but was built soon after as an east-facing folded diamond with two separate toll plazas. The present configuration was built c. 1995. Near this interchange, the turnpike crosses the Walnut River.|$|E
5|$|After {{the artistic}} {{portion of the}} ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is {{traditionally}} the first nation to enter in order to honour {{the origins of the}} Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Athens, Greece, the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>reaches</b> the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.|$|E
