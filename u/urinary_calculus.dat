50|$|Supersaturation of {{the urine}} {{with respect to}} a calculogenic {{compound}} is pH-dependent. For example, at a pH of 7.0, the solubility of uric acid in urine is 158 mg/100 ml. Reducing the pH to 5.0 decreases the solubility of uric acid to less than 8 mg/100 ml. The formation of uric acid stones requires a combination of hyperuricosuria (high urine uric acid levels) and low urine pH; hyperuricosuria alone is not associated with uric acid stone formation if the urine pH is alkaline. Supersaturation of the urine is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the development of any <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus.</b> Supersaturation is likely the underlying cause of uric acid and cystine stones, but calcium-based stones (especially calcium oxalate stones) may have a more complex cause.|$|E

40|$|Background: Intrauterine {{contraceptive}} device {{is the most}} common method of reversible contraception in women. The intrauterine {{contraceptive device}} can perforate the uterus and can also migrate into pelvic or abdominal organs. Perforation of the urinary bladder by an intrauterine contraceptive device is not common. In West Africa, intravesi‑ cal migration of an intrauterine contraceptive device has been rarely reported. In this report, we present a case of an intrauterine contraceptive device migration into the urinary bladder of a 33 year old African woman at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Case report: A 33 year old African woman presented with persistent urinary tract infection of 7 months duration despite appropriate antibiotic treatments. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed a <b>urinary</b> bladder <b>calculus</b> which was found to be an intrauterine contraceptive device on removal at cystoscopy.

We studied prospectively 21 patients referred for radiographic evaluation for renal colic from January 1998 through April 1998. All sonographic studies were performed with real-time sector scanner (Kertz, Compeson 410 using 3. 5 MHz Probe). Our sonographic criteria for a positive examination consisted of the visualization of <b>urinary</b> tract <b>calculus</b> and/or unilateral hydronephrosis with or without ureterectasis. The presence of urinary calculi was proven in 18 out of 21 patients (85 &#x 0025;). The absence of calculi was established in three cases either by negative I. V. U. (2 cases) or by the clinical and sonographic demonstration of epididymitis as the cause in one patient. In the 18 patients with proven urinary calculi, ultrasound correctly identified the diagnosis in 15 cases (83 &#x 0025;). Of those 15 visualized calculi, 11 were located at the ureterovesicular junction, two in the renal pelvis, one in the proximal third of the ureter, and one in the distal third.

40|$|Introduction. We {{aimed to}} {{identify}} metabolic and anatomical abnormalities present {{in children with}} urinary calculi. &# 13; Materials and Methods. Metabolic evaluation was done in 142 pediatric calculus formers. Evaluation included serum biochemistry; measurement of daily excretion of urinary calcium, uric acid, oxalate, citrate, and magnesium (in older children); and measurement of calcium, uric acid, oxalate, and creatinine in random urine samples in nontoilet-trained patients. Urinary tests for cystinuria were also performed. All of the patients underwent renal ultrasonography. &# 13; Results. Sixty-one patients (42. 7 %) had metabolic abnormalities. Anatomical abnormalities were found in 12 patients (8. 4 %). Three children (2. 1 %) had infectious calculi, and 3 (2. 1 %) had a combination of metabolic and anatomic abnormalities.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical features and metabolic and anatomic risk factors of urolithiasis in children. Materials and Methods. Between 2004 and 2009, a total of 84 children (35 girls and 49 boys) had been treated because of urolithiasis. Clinical presentation, <b>urinary</b> tract infection, <b>calculus</b> localization, family history, presence of anatomic abnormalities, and urinary metabolic risk factors were evaluated, retrospectively. Results. The children were between 6 months and 16 years of age (mean age, 5. 25 ± 3. 61 years). The calculus diameter was 3. 2 mm to 31 mm (mean, 7. 31 ± 4. 64 mm). In 90. 6 % of the cases, the calculus was located only in the kidneys and in 2. 4 % it was only in the bladder. The most common presentations were urinary tract infection, restlessness, and abdominal pain. A positive family history of urinary calculi was detected in 27. 3 %; urinary tract infection, in 23. 8 %; and anatomic abnormality, in 10. 7 % of the patients.

40|$|A {{statistical}} observation {{was made on}} 861 cases of urolithiasis experienced during the past thirty-two years, 1928 to 1959. 92 of them showed multilocation of stones in the urinary tract. They consisted of 221 cases (25. 6 %) of renal calculus, 291 (33. 7 %) of ureteral, 252 (29. 2 %) of vesical, 54 (6. 2 %) of urethral and 43 (4. 9 %) of prostatic. In the early period of above 32 years, calculus in the lo w er urinary tract showed higher incidence {{than that of the}} upper, but this ratio lately reversed with greatly increasing incidence of upper urinary tract calculus. Age distribution of calculus was 223 cases (25. 9 %) in the third decade, 182 (21. 1 %) in the fourth decade. In young adults, there were many cases of calculus of the upper urinary tract; on the other hand, there were many cases of the lower urinary tract calculus in the aged and children. 729 cas e s (84. 6 %) were male and 132 cases (15. 3 %) were female. The ratio of male to female on sites of stones was 3. 2 to 1 in renal calculus, 4. 2 to 1 in ureteral, 9. 1 to 1 in vesical and 54 to 0 in urethral. By occupations, farm er was in the first and business man was in the next place. In the upper <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus,</b> the ratio of renal to ureteral calculus was 1 to 1. 3. Affected side was a little more on the left than the right. Ureteral stones were found more in the lower ureter than in the upper or mid-ureter. Male to female ratio of upper <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> was 3. 7 to 1, highest incidence of which was seen in the trird decade in both male and female. V e sical calculus showed highest incidence in the seventh decade and next in the fifth decade. It was interesting that 30 cases (11. 8 %) of vesical calculus were found in one to ten years of age. Urethral c alculus occupied 6. 8 % of all <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> and was most frequent in one to sixten years of age, but there was no case of female. Prostatic calculus was mostly seen in man over 40 and occupied 5. 09 % of all <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus.</b> As far as the treatment of urolithiasis is concerned, in the early periods, those who received treatment for <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> were only 44. 8 % of all the urolithiatic patients occupying 2. 4 % of outpatients.

We {{searched for}} a pathophysiologically based feature of major water electrolytes, which may define water quality better than the water hardness, {{respecting}} <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> formation. Materials and Methods. Utilizing a multistage stratified sampling, 2310 patients were diagnosed in the imaging centers of the provincial capitals in Iran between 2007 and 2008. These were composed of 1755 patients who were settled residents of 24 provincial capitals. Data on the regional drinking water composition, obtained from an accredited registry, and their relationships with the region’s incidence of urinary calculi were evaluated by metaregression models. The stone risk index (defined as the ratio of calcium to magnesium-bicarbonate product in drinking water) {{was used to assess}} the risk of calculus formation. Results. No correlation was found between the <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> incidence and the amount of calcium, bicarbonate, or the total hardness of the drinking water. In contrast, water magnesium had a marginally significant nonlinear inverse relationship with the incidence of the disease in the capitals (R 2 = 26 %, P =. 05 for a power model). The stone risk index was associated nonlinearly with the calculus incidence (R 2 = 28. 4 %, P =. 04). Conclusions. <b>Urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> incidence was inversely related with drinking water magnesium content.

The {{ratio of the}} number of the patients with <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> (1963 cases) t o the total number of the outpatients (16153 cases) in those clinics were 12. 15 per cent, and the number of the patients with calculus in upper urinary tracts was much increased than that of the patients with calculus in lower urinary tracts. Several studies were reported in t h is paper regarding the location of calculi, multiple stone, sex, age, distribution chart in Hiroshima Ken, symptoms, complications, therapy, and relationship to urolithiasis and cholelithiasis...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} compare {{accuracy}} levels of ultrasonography and spiral computerized tomography for detection of the ureteral calculi in patients {{admitted to the}} emergency department with flank pain. Methods: The patients presented with either unilateral or bilateral flank pain to the emergency department over a four-month period and who were suspected to be renal colic were included into the study. All of the study patients with distended bladder after hydration had ultrasonography (USG) and unhanced helical computerized tomography (UHCT) performed by two independent radiologists. Results: Of the 76 patients with flank pain, CT detected ureteral calculi in 47 out of 48 patients (97. 9 %) and USG detected ureteral calculi in 34 out of the 48 patients (70. 83 %). CT detected uretral calculi in 14 patients which was not detected by USG. CT also detected renal calculi in 7 patients which was not detected by USG. A kappa value of 0. 62 (p< 0. 001) was determined, indicating a moderate concordance between CT and USG in detecting ureteral calculi. Also a kappa value of 0. 65 (p< 0. 001) was determined in the overall diagnostic performance of the both imaging tools in detecting renal calculi. Conclusions: Computerized tomography is better than ultrasonography in detecting <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> in patients presented to the emergency department with flank pain. However, as a bedside, non-invasive and non-ionized tool, USG should be preffered as the first line diagnostic choice in ED for detecting <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus.</b> CT should {{be used as an}} second choice in patients with negative USG exam in ED...|$|E
40|$|Recently a {{new idea}} for the {{disintegration}} of urinary calculi based upon the large difference of the acoustic impedance inside urinary calculi was suggested. This large difference of acoustical impedance between the two main components of kidney stones, is confirmed in this paper for smooth laminated uric acid stones by two different experimental techniques measuring sound velocities: a surface contact and a submersion technique. Our measured values correlate well with the large differences of the earlier reported measured sound velocities. In general, the disintegration of a urinary stone {{can be described as}} follows: a <b>urinary</b> <b>calculus</b> is an inhomogeneous geometrical structure, and its structure {{plays an important role in}} the disintegration process. status: publishe...|$|E
