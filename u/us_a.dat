5|$|In 1502 Henry VII {{sent his}} Flemish {{portrait}} painter Maynard Wewyck {{to the court}} of James IV and Margaret Tudor. Later in the sixteenth-century anonymous artists made portraits of important individuals, including the Earl of Bothwell and his first wife Jean Gordon (1566), and George, 7th Lord Seton (c. 1575). The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by minorities and regencies between 1513 and 1579. James VI employed two Flemish artists, Arnold Bronckorst (floruit, in Scotland, 1580â1583) and Adrian Vanson (fl. 1581â1602), who have left <b>us</b> <b>a</b> visual record of the king and major figures at the court.

5|$|Taiko {{emerged in}} the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, was formed in 1968 by Seiichi Tanaka, a postwar {{immigrant}} who studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the <b>US.</b> <b>A</b> year later, {{a few members of}} Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles led by its minister Masao Kodani initiated another group called Kinnara Taiko. San Jose Taiko later formed in 1973 in Japantown, San Jose, under Roy and PJ Hirabayashi. Taiko started to branch out to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of Denver Taiko in 1976 and Soh Daiko in New York City in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.|$|E
