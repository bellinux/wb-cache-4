Watches often had garnet, quartz, or even glass jewels; only top quality watches used sapphire, ruby, or diamond. In 1902, a process to grow artificial sapphire crystals was invented, making jewels much cheaper. Jewels in modern watches are all synthetic sapphire or (usually) ruby, made of corundum (Al2O3), {{one of the hardest}} substances known. The only difference between sapphire and ruby is that different impurities have been added to change the color; there is no difference in their properties as a bearing. [...] The advantage of using jewels is that their <b>ultrahard</b> slick surface has a lower coefficient of friction with metal.

Future uses would see these artificially petrified wood ceramic materials eventually replace metal-based superalloys (which are coated with <b>ultrahard</b> ceramics) in the tool industry.

Hicks' recipe consists of highly mineralized water and a sodium silicate solution combined with a dilute acid with a pH of 4.0-5.5. Samples of wood are then penetrated with this mineral solution through repeated submersions and applications of the solution. Wood treated in this fashion is according to the claims in the patent incapable of being burned and acquires the features of petrified wood. Some uses of this product as suggested by Hicks include use by horse breeders who desire fireproof stables constructed of nontoxic material that would also be resistant to chewing of the wood by horses.|$|E

We {{have used the}} XMS survey along with other highly complete flux-limited deeper and shallower surveys {{for a total of}} 1009, 435 and 119 sources in the Soft, Hard and <b>Ultrahard</b> bands, respectively. We have modeled the intrinsic absorption of the Hard and <b>Ultrahard</b> sources (NH function) and computed the intrinsic X-ray luminosity function in all bands using a Maximum Likelihood fit technique to an analytical model. We find that the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) is best described by a Luminosity-Dependent Density Evolution (LDDE) model. Our results show a good overall agreement with previous results in the Hard band, although with slightly weaker evolution. Our model in the Soft band present slight discrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day XLF being significantly flatter. We find faster evolution in the AGN detected in the <b>Ultrahard</b> band than those in the Hard band. The fraction of absorbed AGN in the Hard and <b>Ultrahard</b> bands is dependent on the X-ray luminosity. We find evidence of evolution of this fraction with redshift in the Hard band but not in the <b>Ultrahard</b> band, possibly due to the low statistics.

Abrasion and {{corrosion}} resistant steel has attracted considerable interest for industrial application {{as a means of}} minimising the costs associated with product/component failures and/or short replacement cycles. These classes of steels contain alloying elements that increase their resistance to abrasion and corrosion. Their benefits, however, currently come at a potentially prohibitive cost; such high performance steel products are both more technically challenging and more expensive to produce. Although these methods have proven effective in improving the performance of more expensive, high-grade steel components, they are not economically viable for relatively low cost steel products. New options are needed. In this study, a complex industrial waste stream has been transformed in situ via precisely controlled high temperature reactions to produce an <b>ultrahard</b> ceramic surface on steel.

The materials tested include three grain sizes of alumina, stabilised zirconias, sialon, cubic boron nitride and polycrystalline diamond, and these have a range of microstructural, physical and mechanical properties. The damage modes are described for the two types of erosion and the results are critically discussed. It has been shown that different properties and microstructural features control the respective types of erosion. Hardness is the critical property which controls material loss during solid particle erosion. Cavitation erosion in contrast is less sensitive to hardness, but is extremely defect sensitive and preferentially attacks weak or damaged regions on the target. Grain size and shape, and th. e properties of the grain boundary or intergranular phase exert a strong influence on both types of erosion. It has in addition been concluded, that a propensity for a stress induced phase transformation, such as that exhibited by stabilised zirconia, will benefit the resistance of a ceramic to erosion. <b>Ultrahard</b> materials generally outperform the structural ceramics that were tested.

40|$|Nine {{different}} ceramic and <b>ultrahard</b> {{materials have}} been eroded by four different erodents under standardised experimental conditions. The target materials {{range from the}} soft stabilised zirconias to the very hard polycrystalline diamond composites. The four erodent particles used were: soft, friable silica, sharp alumina, tough silicon carbide and very hard, synthetic industrial diamonds. The steady state erosion rates of the different target/erodent combinations were measured. The erosion for each combination was studied by examining the target surfaces at progressive stages of erosion and the erodent particles after impact. Special {{attention has been paid}} to the morphology of impact sites, the amount of material lost and the mechanisms of erosion. The ceramic materials eroded by an elastic/plastic process: irreversible deformation is followed by lateral fracture. The <b>ultrahard</b> materials erode by a complex process involving deformation and extrusion of the softer phases and fracture and loss of the harder crystallites. The relative hardness of the target and erodent is a determining factor in erosion. When the hardnesses are similar, the ease of initiation and propagation of lateral fracture determines the rate of material removal. When the erodent particles are much harder than the target material, initiation of fracture is inevitable and the ease of crack propagation determines the rate of material removal. This is controlled by the sharpness of the particles and the microtoughness of the target material. The microtoughness is a function of grain size, porosity and defect density. Melting features, seen in many of the eroded surfaces, are thought to arise from a combination of plastic deformation and frictional heating under high contact stresses. The amount of heat dissipated is determined by the erodent and target hardness and friction coefficients. The rate at which the heat diffuses away from the impact zone is determined by the thermal diffusivities, heat capacities and densities of the target and the erodent...|$|E
40|$|Application of <b>ultrahard</b> {{cutting tool}} {{materials}} is continuously expanding. One {{example of an}} <b>ultrahard</b> cutting tool material is polycrystalline diamond (PCD), which is widely used in tool making and machining. However, {{because of the high}} wear resistance of PCD it is characterised by low grindability and machinability. So, any mechanism used to machine PCD has to meet specific requirements. Grinding with a diamond grinding wheel is one of the economic ways to machine PCD compacts. This thesis considers the grinding of polycrystalline diamond using a conventional grinding machine and makes machining parameter recommendations to support the optimisation of PCD grinding. The PCD grinding forces are mathematically analysed. These grinding forces are measured using a force sensor installed on a conventional grinding machine. The forces produced during grinding are investigated as a function of in-feed, contact zone, material removal rate (MRR) and oscillation rate. Wheel conditioning, another major aspect of PCD grinding, is studied and optimised {{in order to reduce the}} grinding forces, increase the cutting efficiency and achieve maximum removal rates and minimum wear ratios. Grinding wheel wear is investigated as a recognized problem in PCD grinding. A series of experiments are conducted in which the material removal rate, the rate of wheel wear and the grinding forces are measured. The effects of in-feed, sharpening process and work piece hardness on the wheel wear are studied. The edge quality of the PCD compacts is investigated as an important issue in tool making. Factors affecting PCD grinding quality include the in-feed, material removal rate, the condition of the diamond grinding wheel and the rigidity of the grinding machine.

Previous work with AlMgB 14 {{has shown that}} it can have a hardness up to 46 GPa if alloyed with TiB 2, {{and it can be}} coated as a thin film using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). These films have already shown promise in various industrial applications. Vane blades coated with AlMgB 14 films via magnetron sputtering have significantly reduced the wear rate of the pump blades. Some research has been done on production of these films using nanosecond laser PLD, but this project was the first to use femtosecond pulsed laser deposition of coatings. In this work, research was conducted into methods to optimize the thin films 2 ̆ 7 wear resistance and lubricity. The addition of 70 wt...|$|E
40|$|Impact {{diamonds}} {{are formed}} by a rapid solid-state transformation of mainly sp 2 bonded carbon (graphite or coal) under very high pressure (up to 50 GPa) on the nanosecond timescale accompanied by high temperature (up to 4000 K). They are usually polyphase and can consist of cubic and hexagonal diamond, graphite, onion-like carbon and amorphous carbon [1] and exhibit unusual physical properties like extreme hardness. However, {{only a few}} (HR) TEM studies has been made on impact diamonds so far, while laboratory synthesis of <b>ultrahard</b> carbon allotropes and their nanostructural investigation is a current topic [2, 3]. We applied FIB cutting followed by low energy Ar milling and mechanical cleavage to obtain electron transparent lamellae for HRTEM imaging. Amorphous rim of about 20 nm of width was formed around the FIB lamella, which has been reduced significantly to 5 - 6 nm of width by low energy Ar ion milling at 500 eV (Figure 1) using Technoorg Gentle Mill. The structure of the amorphous rim has been changing rapidly during high resolution observation, while, the amorphous structure of the cleaved sample remained practically unchanged during several minutes of electron irradiation (Figure 2). EELS spectra also prove the different character of the amorphous component of the FIB-cut and cleaved samples. HRTEM study of the cleaved sample allowed imaging of nanodiamond particles embedded in the native amorphous carbon matrix of the impact grain (Figure 2). The size of the nanodiamonds ranges between 5 - 10 and a few hundreds of nanometres. The smaller particles are frequently nanotwinned (twin thickness is 1 - 2 nm), while the larger ones are either faultless or are characterized by larger twin thickness (5 - 10 nm). These nanostructural features are reminiscent to those published by Huang et al. [3] who fabricated <b>ultrahard</b> (Vickers hardness 200 GPa) nanotwinned diamond from onion-like carbon precursos and {{can be related to}} the hardness of the material. The investigation of the bonding structure of the amorphous matrix can provide a better understanding for the formation and physical properties of impact diamonds...|$|E
