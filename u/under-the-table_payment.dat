40|$|Informal {{payments}} {{in the health}} system refer to any payment made outside the legal funding framework. The existence of the phenomenon in Central and Eastern European countries relates to {{the characteristics of the}} health systems in the communist period. The analysis is based on three types of data: a set of data gathered from literature review; a second set of data gathered from online media; and a third set of data collected from legislative and public policy. The analysis was pursued using the key words such as informal payment, <b>under-the-table</b> <b>payment,</b> out-of-pocket payment, envelope payment, healthcare corruption, under-the-counter payment. As reflected in the media reports and even publicly recognized by the officials of the Ministry of Health, informal payments are a serious problem of the Romanian healthcare system. Nevertheless, the studies pursued by local researchers are inconsistent with the actual magnitude of the problem. Besides that, there is a serious gap between the findings in this area and the policies intended to reduce the phenomenon. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Satisfaction {{surveys are}} {{valuable}} instruments {{to evaluate the}} quality of a health care system and of changes in the system and to provide feedback for health care professionals and policymakers. Objective: This study aims to explain the level of satisfaction by looking for predictors of satisfaction. The potential predictors include demographic variables, users health status, users opinions about the changes in the health care system and <b>under-the-table</b> <b>payments.</b> Method: A survey on the new health care system in Romania was carried out using face-to-face interviews with 619 Romanian citizens from the Dolj region. The satisfaction questions included the evaluation {{of the health care system}} in general and the evaluation of relevant institutions and providers. Results: There were three basic findings. Firstly, the level of users satisfaction with the new health care system is rather high, but not for hospital care in Romania. Secondly, satisfaction with the new health care system in general is relatively strongly related to satisfaction with health care providers, i. e. general practitioners, medical specialists, dentists and pharmacists. Thirdly, men, more educated people, people who offered "gifts " and those who judged the new system as more inaccessible, of less quality or showing no improvement in physicians behavior were less satisfied than their counterparts. Conclusion and implications: The transition of the health care system in Romania is evaluated positively by the majority of the population but, at the same time, there is a necessity for programs to address inaccessibility, quality of care and <b>under-the-table</b> <b>payments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Guinea {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, as is reflected in its health indicators (Eckert 2002). According to the Demographic and Health Survey III (DNS/Macro 2006), Guinea’s maternal mortality ratio is 980 for 100, 000 live births, and it has a neonatal mortality rate of 39 for 1, 000 live births. In 1997, the government of Guinea, in collaboration with UNICEF, set up a project to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in the health district of Dabola. This project aimed both at improving the quality of services and at enhancing community involvement through the establishment of community health insurance schemes for safe motherhood (MURIGAs). Following an evaluation of this pilot project, the MURIGA approach was adopted as a national maternal mortality reduction strategy and has since been developed in 17 of Guinea’s 33 health districts. Today, members pay a contribution of between € 0. 9 and € 1. 8 per year, depending on the sub-prefecture, entitling them to access to care in the event of obstetric complications, including caesarean sections.

(2) To identify interventions that improve TB detection. Methods : Review {{of the available}} original research data, health normative base, health systems performance and national economic data, following WHO framework for detection of TB cases, {{which is based on}} three scenarios of why incident cases of TB may not be notified. Results : Data analysis revealed that some aspects of TB case detection are more problematic than others and that there are gaps in the knowledge of specific obstacles to TB case detection. The phenomenon of “initial default” in Tajikistan has been documented; however, it needs to be studied further. The laboratory services detect infectious TB cases effectively; however, referrals of appropriate suspects for TB diagnosis may lag behind. The knowledge about TB in the general population has improved. Yet, the problem of TB related stigma persists, thus being an obstacle for effective TB detection. High economic cost of health services driven by <b>under-the-table</b> <b>payments</b> was identified as another barrier for access to health services. Conclusion : Health system strengthening should become a primary intervention to improve case detection in Tajikistan. More research on reasons contributing to the failure to register TB cases, as well as factors underlying stigma is needed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Private health {{expenditure}} for consuming maternity health services {{has been identified}} as an issue within public hospitals. Aim: To estimate level of private {{health expenditure}}, in the form of informal payments, for maternal services in public hospitals in Greece. Methods: The study population consisted of 160 women who had recently given birth in three provincial general hospitals and one general hospital in Athens. A three-part questionnaire was developed in order to collect financial information regarding the use of public obstetrics services in Greece. Results: The mean age of respondents was 29. 5 (± 5. 6) years. There was a high rate of informal payments with 74. 4 % of women involved in informal transactions. Mean total private payments were € 1549 (± 992), representing 7. 9 % of the mean annual per capita income in Greece. Mean informal payment was € 848 (± 714). For 56. 3 % of the respondents, it was at the obstetrician's request, on top of formal payment of € 701 (± 1351). Total informal payments were higher for women who gave birth in Athens (p < 0. 001), for Greek women compared to non Greek (p < 0. 001) and for deliveries that were conducted by women's personal obstetrician (p = 0. 001). Conclusion: There is a large black economy in the field of obstetric services, as 74. 4 % of women who used public maternity services had to pay <b>under-the-table</b> <b>payments</b> corresponding approximately to the net salary of an intern physician. There is a need for the state to adopt innovative strategies and mechanisms in order to reduce informal payments for obstetric services in the public sector. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that property {{is by far the}} largest store of wealth, and development economics suggests that property markets are the bedrock for economic development. Countries make efforts to promote national and international real estate investors and enterprises. Real estate markets are mainly organized by the State through institutional frameworks and practices. In this paper, we focus on the reasons for real estate market low transparency and effects on tourism investments in Greece through a systemic analysis of the property development process. National or international real estate investors encounter an unfamiliar environment in which they find themselves in a difficult position due to low real estate transparency. Specifically: - Absence of financial benchmarks; - Lack of historical or current market statistics; - Financial statements of listed vehicles that are neither detailed nor standardized according to International Accounting Standards; - Urban, regional and environmental planning procedures and codes that are not clear; - Situations where local assistance or <b>under-the-table</b> <b>payments</b> are required to navigate the investment/development/management process; - Lack of title insurance; - Environment in which government or public utilities change urban development status and regulations, introducing risk. Tourism is considered by the Greek State as the most promising economic sector of the country. Tourism Development Co., created in 1998, is a state-owned company that has undertaken to develop and revitalize the assets owned by the Hellenic Tourism Organization located in the most privileged sites of the country (large land plots for development, casinos, marinas, hotels, health clubs, etc.) by the mobilization both of international and national funds.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} {{a model of}} the child support and labor supply decisions in the formal and underground sectors for low-income fathers who have never married the mother of their child, as well as the paternity establishment decisions of the mothers. Ethnographic studies have found that child support policies such as automatic wage withholding, relatively high child support award amounts, and low child support disregards for children on welfare may encourage low-income fathers to evade child support regulations by working ‘off the books’ and by making <b>under-the-table</b> child support <b>payments.</b> Similarly, these policies, particularly the low child support disregard for women on welfare, may encourage mothers of children born outside marriage to refuse to cooperate with the child support authorities in establishing paternity and obtaining a formal child support order. Our model assumes a Stackelberg structure in which the father can implicitly determine whether the mother cooperates with the child support authorities through an informal child support payment, which may be zero. If the father’s informal child support payment is not high enough to induce the mother to not cooperate with establishing paternity, then he is subject to automatic wage withholding of the ordered amount if he works in the formal sector.
