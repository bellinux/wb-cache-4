5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the sixties}} John Mayall was {{residing}} in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California and had developed connections with local musicians, befriending Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor, who had both just departed Canned Heat. Taylor had appeared on one track of Mayall's previous album, Empty Rooms, the only studio recordings of his [...] "Turning Point" [...] band, and stayed on to replace Stephen Thompson (with whom he duetted on [...] "To a Princess"); Mandel essentially replaced acoustic guitar specialist Jon Mark, and electric violinist Harris replaced saxophonist Johnny Almond. In the USA <b>Union</b> <b>liner</b> notes, Mayall noted that, after the Turning Point band broke up, he'd played a British music festival with an all-star lineup and then needed to form a new band swiftly when Polydor Records pressed him for a new album.|$|E

50|$|Alexander {{wanted to}} go, and booked a stateroom in a <b>Union</b> Castle <b>liner</b> for himself. But {{that was not}} to happen. He {{was worried about the}} case, distraught over the death of his friend Lord Lytton in October 1947, and that autumn he had a fall which may have contributed to his having a stroke in December. A week later he had another stroke, was left with the {{paralysis}} of his left hand, leg and face, and doctors had little hope for him. He had to cancel his trip to South Africa. However, he made a remarkable recovery within a month, it was said by applying his own technique to himself. He wrote to Irene Tasker in South Africa, in a clear hand, telling her how much better he was.|$|R
40|$|Generally speaking, public {{transport}} is {{the transport of}} persons and cargo available for use to the general public, performed {{on the basis of}} a transport contract. Public transport costal liner shipping is the transport of passengers, cargo and vehicles in the internal marine waters and territorial sea of the Republic of Croatia performed on pre-established lines in compliance with the published terms and conditions of the sailing schedule and services pricelist. The Act on Transport in Liner Shipping and Occasional Costal Maritime Transport established the {{public transport}} system in the Republic of Croatia, ensuring regular connection of inhabited islands with the mainland and other inhabited islands, as well as between coastal towns, with an appropriate number of daily two-way connections, to improve the conditions of island life and stimulate their development. Prior to the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European <b>Union,</b> the maritime <b>liner</b> shipping market in the Republic of Croatia was reserved primarily for Croatian shipping companies. Now, following the expiry of the transitional period negotiated in pre-accession negotiations with the European Union and the expiry of previously concluded concession contracts, the market is opening up to shipping companies from the European Economic Area. Hence, over the last couple of years, the Republic of Croatia was required to modify its legal framework regulating this subject matter. This paper presents novelties in the legal framework introduced in 2016 and 2017, which directly affect the opening of the maritime liner shipping market in the Republic of Croatia to shipping companies from the European Economic Area, with the critical analysis of the new solutions...|$|R
