5|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} {{features}} jugate busts of Bibb, Alabama's first governor as a state, and the incumbent in 1919, Kilby. In so appearing, Kilby became the first living person depicted on a U.S. coin. Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, averred that the issuance was not controversial at the time, as the Act of May 16, 1866, that forbids the depiction of living people on currency was deemed to refer to paper money only, but Q. David Bowers wrote that the portrayal caused contemporary comment, for {{the position of the}} federal government (excepting some paper money issues of the 19th century) was that living people should not appear on <b>U.S.</b> <b>money.</b> A total of 22 stars flank the busts, symbolic of Alabama being the 22nd state; a message reinforced on those pieces bearing the inscription 2X2 in the obverse field. The X in that inscription alludes to the St. Andrew's cross on the flag of Alabama. The date, the names of the governors, and various other wordings appear towards the rim of the obverse.|$|E

25|$|By 1965 {{the pool}} was {{increasingly}} unable {{to balance the}} outflow of gold reserves with buybacks. Excessive inflation of the <b>US</b> <b>money</b> supply, in part to fund the Vietnam War, led to the US no longer being able to redeem foreign-held dollars into gold, as the world's gold reserves had not grown in relation, and the payment deficit had grown to US$3 billion. Thus, the London Gold Pool came under increased pressures of failure, causing France to announce in June 1967 a withdrawal from the agreements and moving large amounts of gold from New York to Paris.|$|E
25|$|Panic of 1857 Land and {{railroad}} boom in US following discovery {{of gold in}} California in 1849. Resulted in large expansion of <b>US</b> <b>money</b> supply. Railroads boomed as people moved west. Railroad stocks peaks in July 1857. The failure of Ohio Life in August 1857 brought attention to the financial state of the railroad industry and land markets, thereby causing the financial panic to become a more public issue. Since banks had financed the railroads and land purchases, they began to feel {{the pressures of the}} falling value of railroad securities and many went bankrupt. Ended in worldwide crisis.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the stock}} market crash, the {{worldwide}} economy plunged into the Great Depression. The <b>U.S.</b> <b>money</b> supply began to contract by one-third. The protectionist Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act incited retaliation by Canada, Britain, Germany and other trading partners. Congress, in 1932, worried about the rapidly growing deficit and national debt, and raised income tax rates. Economists generally agree that these measures deepened an already serious crisis. By 1932, the unemployment rate was 25%. Conditions were worse in heavy industry, lumbering, export agriculture (cotton, wheat, tobacco), and mining. Conditions were not quite as bad in white collar sectors and in light manufacturing.|$|E

25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give <b>us</b> <b>money</b> and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
500|$|In December 1902, the German {{government}} asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its {{dispute with}} Venezuela over unpaid debts.

[...] Hay supposedly said, as final details were being worked out, [...] "I have it all arranged. [...] If Teddy will {{keep his mouth shut}} until tomorrow noon!" [...] Hay and Roosevelt also differed over the composition of the Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute. [...] The commission was to be composed of [...] "impartial jurists" [...] and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges. [...] Roosevelt appointed politicians, including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge. [...] Although Hay was supportive of the President's choices in public, in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt, complained by letter to his friends, and offered his resignation. [...] Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. [...] The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.|$|E

2500|$|Legacy admissions {{have had}} a history of controversy; {{economist}} Peter Sacks criticized the practice of legacy admissions as a [...] "social reproduction process" [...] in which [...] "elite institutions have an implicit bargain with their alumni ... 'You give <b>us</b> <b>money,</b> and we will move your kid {{to the front of the}} line.'" [...] Another agreed that legacies perpetuated a [...] "hereditary aristocracy". But an opposing view is that all colleges, to varying extents, make choices as part of the admissions process, including state schools that charge in-state residents (with taxpaying parents) a lower rate than out-of-state residents, and it was argued that there was not really much difference between taxpaying parents contributing to a state school as well as generous alumni contributing to a private school—both with the possibility that it will help their offspring get into college. Consultant Donald Dunbar suggested that admitting legacies encourages future donations, and in turn these incoming money flows help the school subsidize the education of more minority students; another source suggested that alumni gifts was important in helping a college pay for need-blind programs. Legacy admissions was criticized by Daniel Golden in his book The Price of Admission in which elite schools gave [...] "heavy preferences to the wealthy", according to essayist Neal Gabler in the Boston Globe.|$|E
