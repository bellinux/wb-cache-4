5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} {{ignored by the}} music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close {{to the success of}} its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera {{at the bottom of a}} corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
25|$|Fancher {{states that}} radical hermeneutics, {{which is similar}} to but {{different}} from ontological hermeneutics, may end up being a kind of Trojan horse for psychotherapy because its emphasis on subjective narrative and deconstruction can lend itself to a dangerous relativism. He likens it to a small boy jumping <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diving board of an empty pool: what starts out in innocence is likely to end up in disaster.|$|E

25|$|Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi is a {{fighting}} {{game with a}} 3D gameplay element. The player is able to move their character not only forwards and back using the left and right, but can sidestep by using the <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> controller. There are three ways to achieve a win: knocking out the opponent, forcing the opponent out of the ring, or having the most health when time runs out. Rounds are timed, and the player must win two of three rounds to be declared {{the winner of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato {{can also}} be used for a fast trill. A trill {{initiated}} from just hammering the finger <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and vibrato is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note: this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|E
25|$|A Portuguese captain major, {{armed with}} a sword and a shield, strode <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore {{encouraging}} his men to continuously press the attack. He ordered them to fire even on the shallops {{to prevent them from}} assisting the Dutch troops. The remaining Dutch troops raised a white flag realizing that they were stranded. At the same time, a cannonball from a shallop hit Mendonça on his head and killed him instantly. Suddenly, Portuguese troops found themselves leaderless and without direction. A sergeant major who was next in command stood irresolute, while the Portuguese attack halted. In panic they abandoned the fight and retired back to the fort in scattered groups. Some of the wounded (Captain Jorge Fernandes the commander of the center, Captain João de Sequeira and four Soldiers) were left behind and they were taken prisoner by the Dutch.|$|E

500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E
2500|$|Vihear Suor village Water buffalo racing festival, Cambodia, each year, people visit Buddhist temples {{across the}} country to honor their {{deceased}} loved ones during a 15-day period commonly known as the Festival of the Dead but in Vihear Suor village, about [...] northeast of Cambodia, citizens each year wrap up the festival with a water buffalo race to entertain visitors and honour a pledge made hundreds of years ago. There was a time when many village cattle which provide rural Cambodians with muscle power to plough their fields and transport agricultural products died from an unknown disease. The villagers prayed to a spirit to help save their animals from the disease and promised to show their gratitude by holding a buffalo race each year {{on the last day of}} [...] "P'chum Ben" [...] festival as it is known in Cambodian.

2500|$|Every player {{receives}} {{their own}} starship, which was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010. Footage of space combat was released at Gamescom. The short clip provided by BioWare revealed that space combat {{would be a}} [...] "tunnel shooter." [...] A tunnel shooter, otherwise known as a scrolling shooter or rail shooter, is a flying game where the player is on a predetermined track. Game play includes moving right and left on the X axis and <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Y axis; however, players do not have control {{of the speed of}} their space craft. Jake Neri, LucasArts Producer, told PC Gamer in their October 2010 issue that their goal was to [...] "capture the most cinematic moments that we can create. We want players to get in and feel like they're in the movies. It's about highly cinematic, controlled combat moments ... very heroic, action-packed, exciting, visceral and dangerous encounters that'll make you pee your pants." [...] With the December 2013 release of the free expansion, Galactic Starfighter (GSF), players now have a free flight PVP space combat experience, with multiple ships and roles independent of other aspects of the game.|$|E
