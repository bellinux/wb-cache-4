The Fokker-Planck coefficient of pitch-angle scattering, which is used to describe scattering parallel to the mean magnetic field, is therefore of central importance.

These {{satellites}} need a huge surface to collect enough solar energy to be beamed on Earth by means of a microwave power transfer system. Different concepts appeared during last forty years and a lot of studies addressing the SPS economical feasibility have been published. In this work a particular concept is considered, the JAXA Reference Concept 2003. It is a formation flying SPS, composed by two reflectors and a central array panel. The objective of the work is to study two major problems this concept presents. Due to its dimensions, the satellite orbit will suffer from important orbital perturbations and since formation flying satellites need a tight orbit control, the first task is to derive an analytical approximation to perform relative perturbed orbit propagation for formation flying satellite.

Schaub’s formulation in which formation flying satellites <b>unperturbed</b> <b>orbit</b> is described by means of an approximated relation function of orbital element differences.

A major advantage of the approach is that the direct physical meaning of the low-order coefficients is clear, and although the solutions are approximate (because of the truncation of the series) the accuracy of the solution appears to be merely a problem of computational power. Furthermore the method includes some free parameters, that can be properly set to reduce the computational effort (that is to reduce the number of polynoms needed in the series to reach good accuracy). This approach can be used for studying both growing or damping waves, as well as marginal stability. The method has been tested for an Harris sheet equilibrium and several instabilities (lower-hybrid drift, drift kink, tearing), showing good agreement with classical method.

40|$|First {{passage time}} {{experiments}} {{were used to}} explore the effects of low amplitude noise {{as a source of}} accelerated phase space diffusion in two-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, and these effects were then compared with the effects of periodic driving. The objective was to quantify and understand the manner in which ``sticky'' chaotic orbits that, in the absence of perturbations, are confined near regular islands for very long times, can become ``unstuck'' much more quickly when subjected to even very weak perturbations. For both noise and periodic driving, the typical escape time scales logarithmically with the amplitude of the perturbation. For white noise, the details seem unimportant: Additive and multiplicative noise typically have very similar effects, and {{the presence or absence of}} a friction related to the noise by a Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem is also largely irrelevant. Allowing for colored noise can significantly decrease the efficacy of the perturbation, but only when the autocorrelation time becomes so large that there is little power at frequencies comparable to the natural frequencies of the <b>unperturbed</b> <b>orbit.</b> Similarly, periodic driving is relatively inefficient when the driving frequency is not comparable to these natural frequencies. This suggests strongly that noise-induced extrinsic diffusion, like modulational diffusion associated with periodic driving, is a resonance phenomenon. The logarithmic dependence of the escape time on amplitude reflects the fact that the time required for perturbed and unperturbed orbits to diverge a given distance scales logarithmically in the amplitude of the perturbation.

40|$|In a plasma with a {{population}} of super-thermal particles generated by heating or fusion processes, kinetic effects can lead to the additional destabilisation of MHD modes or even to additional energetic particle modes. In order to describe these modes, a new linear gyrokinetic MHD code has been developed and tested, LIGKA (Linear Gyrokinetic Shear Alfvén Physics) [1; 2], based on a gyrokinetic model [3]. A finite Larmor radius expansion together with the construction of some fluid mo-ments and specification to the shear Alfvén regime results in a self-consistent, elec-tromagnetic, non-perturbative model, that allows not only for growing or damped eigenvalues but also for a change in mode-structure of the magnetic perturbation due to the energetic particles and background kinetic effects. Compared to previous implementations [3], this model is coded in a more general and comprehensive way. LIGKA uses a Fourier decomposition in the poloidal coor-dinate and a finite element discretisation in the radial direction. Both analytical and numerical equilibria can be treated. Integration over the unperturbed particle orbits is performed with the drift-kinetic HAGIS code [23; 24] which accurately describes the particles ’ trajectories. This allows finite-banana-width effects to be implemented in a rigorous way since the linear formulation of the model allows the exchange of the <b>unperturbed</b> <b>orbit</b> integration and the discretisation of the perturbed potentials in the radial direction.

40|$|This paper summarises an {{investigation}} of the effects of low amplitude noise and periodic driving on phase space transport in 3 -D Hamiltonian systems, a problem directly applicable to systems like galaxies, where such perturbations reflect internal irregularities and. or a surrounding environment. A new diagnsotic tool is exploited to quantify how, over long times, different segments of the same chaotic orbit can exhibit very different amounts of chaos. First passage time experiments are used to study how small perturbations of an individual orbit can dramatically accelerate phase space transport, allowing `sticky' chaotic orbits trapped near regular islands to become unstuck on suprisingly short time scales. Small perturbations are also studied in the context of orbit ensembles with the aim of understanding how such irregularities can increase the efficacy of chaotic mixing. For both noise and periodic driving, the effect of the perturbation scales roughly in amplitude. For white noise, the details are unimportant: additive and multiplicative noise tend to have similar effects and {{the presence or absence of}} a friction related to the noise by a Fluctuation- Dissipation Theorem is largely irrelevant. Allowing for coloured noise can significantly decrease the efficacy of the perturbation, but only when the autocorrelation time, which vanishes for white noise, becomes so large that t here is little power at frequencies comparable to the natural frequencies of the <b>unperturbed</b> <b>orbit.</b> This suggests strongly that noise-induced extrinsic diffusion, like modulational diffusion associated with periodic driving, is a resonance phenomenon.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative technique for solving the linearized Vlasov-Maxwell set of equations, {{in which the}} velocity dependence of the perturbed distribution function is described {{by means of an}} infinite series of orthogonal functions, chosen as Hermite polynomials. The orthogonality properties of such functions allow us to decompose the Vlasov equation into a set of infinite coupled linear equations. With a suitable truncation relation, the problem is transformed in an eigenvalue problem. This technique is based on solid but easy concepts, not attempting to evaluate the integration over the unperturbed trajectories and can be applied to any equilibrium. Although the solutions are approximate, because they neglect contributions of higher order coefficients of the series, the physical meaning of the low-order coefficients is clear. Furthermore the accuracy of the solution, which depends on the number of terms taken into account in the Hermite series, appears to be merely a problem of computational power.

In this manuscript, {{we consider the}} impact of a small jump-type spatial heterogeneity on the ex-istence of stationary localized patterns in a system of partial differential equations in one spatial dimension, i. e. defined on R. This problem corresponds to analyzing a discontinuous and non-autonomous n-dimensional system, u ̇ = f(u), t ≤ 0, f(u) + εg(u), t> 0, under the assumption that the unperturbed system, i. e. the ε → 0 limit system, possesses a heteroclinic orbit Γ that connects two hyperbolic equilibrium points (plus several additional non-degeneracy conditions). The <b>unperturbed</b> <b>orbit</b> Γ represents a localized structure in the PDE setting. We define the (pinned) defect solution Γε as a heteroclinic solution to the perturbed system such that limε→ 0 Γε = Γ. We distinguish between three types of defect solutions: trivial, local and global defect solutions. The main goal of this manuscript is to develop a comprehensive and asymptotically explicit theory of the existence of local defect solutions. We find that both the dimension of the problem as well as the nature of the linearized system near the endpoints of the heteroclinic orbit Γ has a remarkably rich impact on the existence of these local defect solutions. We first introduce the various concepts in the setting of planar systems (n = 2) and – for reasons of transparency of presentation – consider the three-dimensional problem in full detail. Then, we generalize our results to the n-dimensional problem, with a special interest for the additional phenomena introduced by having n ≥ 4. We complement the general approach by working out two explicit examples in full detail: (i) the existence of local defect pinned kink solutions in a heterogeneous Fisher– Kolmogorov equation (n = 4) and (ii) the existence of pinned local defect front and pulse solutions in a heterogeneous generalized FitzHugh–Nagumo system (n = 6).

40|$|Abstract. Some {{interesting}} {{observations from}} the recent massive particle simulation of the electron temperature gradient mode turbulence indicated that the mechanism underlying anomalous electron transport is the kinetic wave-particle decorrelation rather than the fluid eddy mixing. [Lin, Z, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 (2007) 265003] Long streamers, close to the pressure gradient scale length, are observed in this simulation. However, the transport didn’t show dependence on the streamer length, but {{is proportional to the}} local fluctuation intensity. In tokamak sheared magnetic field, there is a percentage of electrons are trapped in the potential patterns of electrostatic turbulence, and their <b>unperturbed</b> <b>orbits</b> follow pendulum motion. These potential patterns constitute phase-space islands. The overlapping of islands not only takes place in velocity space but also in configuration space, due to the presence of densely packed mode rational surfaces in the tokamak configuration. The overlapping of adjacent phase-space islands leads to the formation of chaotic region near the separatrix of the islands. As a result, the particle performs random walk process in phase space and during this process irreversible scattering process takes place. This mechanism induces a Brownian diffusion in configuration space as well as velocity space, with a time scale determined by the resonant scattering time. In this paper, this transport mechanism is formulated using nonlinear drift kinetic equations and resonance broadening theory. It is indicated that the nonadiabatic response of the wave-trapped electrons induced by the resonant scattering process is an important dissipation mechanism underlying anomalous electron transport in tokamak plasmas...|$|R
