As part of {{the project}} on the Europeanization of British {{politics}} and public policy this Paper undertakes a study of banking, investment and insurance directives as well as the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to deal with conceptualizations of Europeanization and assess the impact of this on British financial services regulation. Through this study the Paper allows a comparison with the German institutional structure and identifies similarities regarding the impact of Europeanization on this member state’s financial services sector. The Paper picks up {{on a number of issues}} outlined by Bache and Jordan (2004) in terms of top-down or downloading, bottom-up or <b>up-loading,</b> cross-loading and policy transfer procedures of Europeanization. Overall the Paper recognises an interaction between the European Union (EU) and member states in terms of <b>up-loading</b> and downloading and an interaction between member states in the context of cross-loading...|$|E
40|$|Introduction]. In general {{this paper}} is {{concerned}} with issues relating to theoretical and empirical discussions regarding the conceptual nature of Europeanization and European integration. Through an analysis of British financial services in terms of banking, investment and insurance directives, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) the paper identifies both ‘situation’ and ‘process’ conceptualizations of Europeanization and illustrates its close links {{with the idea of}} European integration. Initially, this paper provides a conceptualization of Europeanization and explains its relationship with European integration. Second, it provides an overview of changes to the British regulatory structure over the last 20 years. Third, the paper explains the role of interest group intermediation in the formulation of shared beliefs and preference <b>up-loading</b> to EU policy-making institutions. In this context, the paper identifies how the concept of a ‘competent authority’ was up-loaded to the EU and the how Britain interpreted the downloaded structure {{in the form of the}} FSA. In addition, the FSA is investigated in its role as a unitary ‘competent authority’ and its attempts at policy transfer in championing this model are explored. Indeed, this brings into question the differences between vertical and horizontal policy transfer and <b>up-loading.</b> Finally, an analysis of British financial services provides some insight into the affects of Europeanization and European integration on the sector, as well as the affects the sector has had on Europeanization and European integration. Through an analysis of British financial services the study is able to track elements of European integration as well as <b>up-loading</b> and downloading examples of Europeanization...|$|E

Residues from diverse contexts have been retrieved and analysed from the remains of food, medicine and cosmetics to hafting material on stone arrowheads, pitch and tar from shipwrecks, and ancient manure from soils. Research has brought many advances in our understanding of archaeological, organic residues over the past two decades. Some have enabled very specific and detailed interpretations of materials preserved in the archaeological record. However there are still areas where we know very little, like the mechanisms at work during the formation and preservation of residues, and areas where each advance produces more questions rather than answers, as in the identification of degraded fats. This chapter will discuss some of the significant achievements in the field over the past decade and the ongoing challenges for research in this area. The copyright situation is complex with this paper. In the original copyright agreement I signed it says that I am allowed to post the title, reference and abstract to an open access repository. Further investigation of the ACS website reveals that this is still the case with book titles but that we are also allowed to publish a link directly to the article by DOI (which I have pasted in above). The website also specifically states that permission will not be granted to <b>up-load</b> articles onto websites.

The cost function that we seek to minimize is the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition. For every environment model, and for every formula, our method computes a robot trajectory which minimizes the cost function. The problem is motivated by applications in robotic mon-itoring and data gathering. In this setting, the optimizing proposition is satisfied at all locations where data can be <b>up-loaded,</b> and the entire formula specifies a complex (and infinite horizon) data collection mission. Our method utilizes Büchi automata to produce an automaton (which {{can be thought of}} as a graph) whose runs satisfy the temporal logic specification. We then present a graph algorithm which computes a path corresponding to the optimal robot trajectory. We also present an implementation for a robot performing a data gathering mission in a road network. I...|$|R

Consumers of this facility create, <b>up-load,</b> share, like, tag and comment on this media information. So this sharing information allows to get meta data about this media file and this meta data is useful for search engine optimization {{in the way of}} individual user search results. This paper new approach for generating search results according to the way of users previous work with the sharing site is considered to get best of best his individual search results. The conceptual deviation of this paper are in to: 1) Superiority based parallel models 2) User interest model so the query relevance and user interest will help to improve results. 3) Complex word search. As shown in fig. 2 data is collected as user, image, tag it is also called as ternary relation. This data is provided to superiority based parallel model which will remove noise and provide annotation prediction to image, it also reconstruct u, i, t relation topics and user preferences...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of today's main {{challenge}} {{related to}} cloud storage {{is to maintain}} the functionalities and the efficiency of customers' and service providers' usual environments, while protecting the confidentiality of sensitive data. Deduplication {{is one of those}} functionalities: it enables cloud storage providers to save a lot of memory by storing only once a file <b>up-loaded</b> several times. But classical encryption blocks deduplication. One needs to use a " message-locked encryption " (MLE), which allows the detection of duplicates and the storage of only one encrypted file on the server, which can be decrypted by any owner of the file. However, in most existing scheme, a user can bypass this deduplication protocol. In this article, we provide servers verifiability for MLE schemes: the servers can verify that the ciphertexts are well-formed. This property that we formally define forces a customer to prove that she complied to the dedupli-cation protocol, thus preventing her to deviate from the prescribed func-tionality of MLE. We call it deduplication consistency. To achieve this deduplication consistency, we provide (i) a generic transformation that applies to any MLE scheme and (ii) an ElGamal-based deduplication-consistent MLE, which is secure in the random oracle model...|$|R
