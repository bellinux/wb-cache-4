50|$|An {{ultrasound}} scan evaluates {{the amount of}} amniotic fluid around the baby. If the placenta is deteriorating, then the amount of fluid will be low, and induced labor is highly recommended. However, <b>ultra</b> <b>sounds</b> are not always accurate since they also monitor the fetus's development, and if the fetus is smaller than normal, the doctor's guess at the age can be quite off. The actual placenta won't start to deteriorate until about 46 weeks. Because of the risks, doctors favour induction by 42 weeks.|$|R

40|$|Rotating Biological Contactors (RBCs) {{constitute}} {{a very unique}} and superior alternative for biodegradable matter and nitrogen removal on account of their feasibility, simplicity of design and operation, short start-up, low land area requirement, low energy consumption, low operating and maintenance cost and treatment efficiency, as well as easy scalability. It {{is well known that}} the performance of this type of reactors is controlled by a high number of design parameters. In this sense, the work of this group has been focused on the study of the performance of anoxic bench-scale RBCs to treat synthetic wastewaters using different carbon/nitrogen (C/N), carbon sources and hydraulic retention times (HRT) as well as varying organic and nitrate influent concentrations. As municipal landfill leachate is considered one wastewater with the greatest environmental impact mainly due to its high nitrogen content, it has also been an aim of our work to use AnRBCs for denitrification of a landfill leachate rich in nitrate. The same operational parameters above mentioned have been also assayed. Presently, we are testing leachate pre-treatments by Fenton oxidation, ozonization or by <b>ultra</b> <b>sounds,</b> {{in order to reduce the}} COD load and in this way to increase the process leachate biodegradability...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to incorporate the control and management of infertility within the framework of maternal and child health and family planning program in primary health care setting. It was a cohort study and was held in central of Sudan, from June 2007 to June 2009. It was conducted in four health centers. Sample size was 200 infertile couples, selected by taking 10 % from total number of all married female patients visited primary health care center complaining from any health problem during one month. Data were collected by special questionnaire includes, demographic data, medical history and examination, investigations and management. Data collection was performed by the author, doctor, midwife and nurse of each health centre. Investigations were done within the laboratory of health centers which include; blood test, urine analysis, seminal analysis, hormonal assay, high vaginal swap for culture and sensitivity, histosalpingiography and <b>ultra</b> <b>sounds</b> were done in the central laboratory. Outcome results were; 80 % had primary infertility and 20 % had secondary infertility. Infertility due to husbands alone was 20. 5 %, that due to wives alone was 37. 5 % and infertility due to both couple was 31 % while those with unknown aetiology was 11 %. The main cause of female primary infertility was unovulatory cycle and for secondary infertility were tubal problems. Male infertility due to seminal abnormality was 42. 5 % and those with medical problem was 2 %. Management varied from health education, hormonal therapy, antibiotic and surgical intervention.

40|$|Humans {{have changed}} {{ecosystems}} steadily over the years, leading to habitat fragmentation and loss. Road- and railroad networks are rapidly expanding {{around the world}} and disintegrating natural landscapes. Habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and habitat degradation are three factors why bat species are threatened, and infrastructure such as roads has the potential to contribute to all of these factors. This is the first study of bats and the impact roads have on bats in Sweden. In this study we tested whether the major road acts as a barrier to movement of four different taxa of bats. Especially we focused on the activity of Myotis species at various environments in the landscape in relation to a major road. We placed auto boxes that automatically record bat <b>ultra</b> <b>sounds</b> in 34 study sites around Enköping for seven weeks. We had 8 sites along a major road, 8 sites in open gaps between forests without any roads, 4 sites at wildlife passages and 14 control sites within the forest. The results of this study show avoidance behaviour in Myotis, and Eptesicus species. For Nyctalus` the road does not reveal to be any obstacle. Observations of Pipistrellus species were too few to draw any conclusions. An important conclusion in this study is {{that there is not a}} difference in Myotis- activity between the road and open gaps in the forest. Both types of openings are avoided. However, wildlife passages are used for foraging and commuting. It is important to do further studies to improve the mitigation measures for bats in infrastructure projects in Sweden. More knowledge about the different taxa’s behaviour near major roads and an understanding of the thresholds, such as limit distances for Myotis in open gaps are necessary to draw conclusions about mitigation measures and alternatives for ecoducts...|$|R
