5|$|For , Rindt's {{partner at}} Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill {{had left the}} team to drive for Rob Walker's {{customer}} franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix {{of the season in}} South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one {{on each side of the}} cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
25|$|A serious {{design fault}} in these {{locomotives}} was their very high <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of 33 tons. Geared motors {{had not been}} used as it was {{thought they would be}} noisy in the confines of a tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> to 11 tons.|$|E
40|$|In-wheel type permanent-magnet {{synchronous}} motors {{for electric}} commuter cars {{are required to}} be compact and light to use limited wheel space effectively and reduce <b>unspringing</b> <b>weight.</b> Therefore, our previous papers presented a low-cost in-wheel axial-gap motor that uses ferrite permanent magnets. This motor adopted an open slot structure to reduce production costs. However, to achieve further size and weight reduction, we examine here in detail {{the adoption of a}} semiclosed slot structure instead of an open slot structure. Experimental results show that the semiclosed slot structure is effective in realizing size and weight reduction...|$|R
25|$|Formula One cars {{must have}} four {{uncovered}} wheels, all {{made of the}} same metallic material, which {{must be one of}} two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA. Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum <b>unsprung</b> rotating <b>weight</b> reduction.|$|R
50|$|As {{was typical}} of early front wheel drive cars, the 1000 {{featured}} inboard drum brakes up front to reduce <b>unsprung</b> suspension <b>weight</b> and an easier implementation of an independent front suspension (but atypically Subaru would retain this unusual design into the seventies). Other unique features of the 1000 were a lack of a heater core, the heating system took its warmth directly from the radiator, and a hybrid suspension system that used torsion bars in combination with coil springs (much like the front suspension of the Subaru 360).|$|R
25|$|Many early {{implementations}} for automobiles {{located the}} brakes on the inboard side of the driveshaft, near the differential, while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} modification was the fitting of a stronger rear differential {{to handle the}} increased engine power. A Salisbury 4HU unit with inboard disc brakes to reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> was chosen instead of the old E.N.V. unit. It was the same unit used on the Jaguar E-Type.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The rear brake caliper {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} {{the feasibility}} of designing a high performance vehicle suspension using a Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) composite material. In particular, the possibility of replacing spring and damper of a double wishbone suspension with a leaf spring constituted by a hybrid material made of a fiberglass and SMA is analysed. Reduction of <b>unsprung</b> masses <b>weight,</b> improved aerodynamics, simplification of suspension layout reprent the main advantages associated with this solution. The choice of the SMA and design of the composite material has been made based on both Finite Element Analysis simulations and experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the many}} {{opportunities}} offered by electric vehicles (EVs), {{the design of}} power trains based on in-wheel electric motors represents, from the vehicle dynamics point of view, a very attractive prospect, mainly due to the torque-vectoring capabilities. However, this distributed propulsion also poses some practical challenges, owing to the constraints arising from motor installation in a confined space, to the increased <b>unsprung</b> mass <b>weight</b> and to {{the integration of the}} electric motor with the friction brakes. This last issue is the main theme of thiswork, which, in particular, focuses on the design of the anti-lock braking system (ABS). The proposed structure for the ABS is composed of a tyre slip controller, a wheel torque allocator and a braking supervisor. To address the slip regulation problem, an adaptive controller is devised, offering robustness to uncertainties in the tyre–road friction and featuring a gainscheduling mechanism based on the vehicle velocity. Further, an optimisation framework is employed in the torque allocator to determine the optimal split between electric and friction brake torque based on energy performance metrics, actuator constraints and different actuators bandwidth. Finally, based on the EV working condition, the priorities of this allocation scheme are adapted by the braking supervisor unit. Simulation results obtained with the CarSim vehicle model, demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall approach...|$|R
25|$|Porsche's Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, {{with very}} high {{temperature}} capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (therefore reducing the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of the vehicle), {{a significant reduction}} in dust generation, substantially increased maintenance intervals, and enhanced durability in corrosive environments over conventional iron discs. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense. It is generally recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum six-piston calipers that are matched with the discs. The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.|$|E
25|$|Cracking {{is limited}} mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled {{near the edge}} of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of {{expansion}} in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|In {{racing and}} very-high-performance road cars, other disc {{materials}} have been employed. Reinforced carbon discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking {{systems such as}} those used on Concorde were introduced in Formula One by Brabham in conjunction with Dunlop in 1976. Carbon–carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high operating temperature before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is easily visible during night racing, especially at shorter tracks. It {{is not uncommon to}} be able to look at the cars, either live in person or on television and see the brake discs glowing red during application.|$|E
25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five wheel nuts simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One wheel changes, the spanner would then retain the wheel nuts and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
2500|$|Changing the TGV to {{electric}} traction required a significant design overhaul. The first electric prototype, nicknamed Zébulon, {{was completed in}} 1974, testing features such as innovative body mounting of motors, pantographs, suspension and braking. Body mounting of motors allowed over 3tonnes to be eliminated from the power cars and greatly reduced the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> The prototype travelled almost [...] during testing.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "722 Edition" [...] {{includes}} an engine rated [...] at 6,500rpm and [...] at 4,000rpm. 19-inch light-alloy wheels {{were used to}} reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> while modifications were also made to the suspension, with a stiffer damper setup and [...] lower ride height introduced for improved handling. Larger [...] diameter front brakes and a revised front air dam and rear diffuser were fitted.|$|E
2500|$|First in the {{industry}} carbon fiber wheels are optional equipment, [...] lighter than the standard forged alloy wheels, both using center locking nuts.

2500|$|The {{line between}} Shepherd's Bush and Bank was {{formally}} opened on 30 June 1900, public services beginning on 30 July. With a uniform fare of 2d the railway {{became known as}} the [...] "Twopenny Tube". It was initially operated by electric locomotives hauling carriages, but the locomotive's considerable <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> caused much vibration in the buildings above the line, and the railway rebuilt the locomotives to incorporate geared drives. This allowed higher-speed and lighter motors to be used, which reduced the overall weight of the locomotive as well as the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> The railway also tried an alternative approach: it converted four coaches to accommodate motors and control gear. Two of these experimental motor coaches were used in a 6-coach train, the control gear being operated by the system used on the Waterloo and City Railway. The modified locomotives were a considerable improvement, but the motor coaches of an even lower weight were much better still. The CLR ordered 64 new motor cars designed to use Sprague's recently developed traction control system. The CLR was exclusively using the resulting electric multiple units by 1903.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the dirt}} tracker, {{it came with}} brakes: a rear disc brake, and in front, a Fontana four leading shoe drum brake, which is two twin leading drum brakes paired {{side by side in}} two drums. The XRTT is the final example of a {{competition}} motorcycle with drum brakes, superseded by disc brakes on all other racing bikes due to the excessive <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> added by the very large drum brake assembly. The official horsepower was never published, but estimates for the early 1972 engines were in the high [...] range, increasing to an estimated [...] or more by 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The engine {{produces}} [...] at 8500 rpm and [...] torque at 5250 rpm. The car has a {{dry weight}} of [...] (80kg {{lighter than the}} F430 Spider) and a curb weight of [...] The chassis was stiffened {{to cope with the}} extra performance available and the car featured many carbon fibre parts as standard. Specially lightened front and rear bumpers (compared to the 430 Scuderia) were a further sign of the efforts Ferrari was putting into this convertible track car for the road. Unique 5-spoke forged wheels were produced for the 16M's launch and helped to considerably reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> with larger front brakes and callipers added for extra stopping power (also featured on 430 Scuderia). It accelerates from 0- in 3.7 seconds, with a top speed of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{gasoline}} engine is a , 1.0 litre, ECA series 3-cylinder unit providing lean burn operation with an air-to-fuel ratio that can reach 25.8 to 1. The engine utilizes lightweight aluminum, magnesium, and plastic to minimize weight. The electrical motor assist adds another [...] {{and a maximum}} of 36 pound-feet (49 Nm) of torque when called on, with the aim to boost performance {{to the level of}} a typical 1.5 L petrol engine. It also acts as a generator during deceleration and braking to recharge the vehicle's batteries, and as the Insight's starter motor. (This improves fuel efficiency and extends the lifetime and fade resistance of the brakes, without adding <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight).</b> When the car is not moving, for example at a stop light, the engine shuts off. Power steering is electric, reducing accessory drag.|$|E
2500|$|Though not {{as obvious}} as the car's radical styling, the new chassis {{was just as}} {{important}} to the Sting Ray's success. Maneuverability was improved thanks to the faster recirculating ball, or [...] "Ball-Race", steering, and a shorter wheelbase. The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride, but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it. Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering, and with some 80 additional pounds on the rear wheels, the Sting Ray offered improved traction. Stopping power improved, too. Four-wheel cast-iron 11-inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider, for an increase in effective braking area. Sintered-metallic linings, segmented for cooling, were again optional. So were finned aluminum drums, which not only provided faster heat dissipation (and thus better fade resistance) but less <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b> Power assist was available with both brake packages. Evolutionary engineering changes included positive crankcase ventilation, a smaller flywheel, and an aluminum clutch housing. A more efficient alternator replaced the old-fashioned generator.|$|E
2500|$|... 1976 models {{featured}} steel {{floor panels}} shielding the catalytic converter exhaust. These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its cowl vent grille and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars. The rear window defroster option was changed from the forced-air type of previous years to the new [...] "Electro-Clear" [...] defogger, an in-glass heated element type. Even without a convertible model, the Corvette still set new sales records.|$|E
50|$|The {{larger the}} ratio of sprung weight to <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight,</b> the less the body and vehicle {{occupants}} are affected by bumps, dips, and other surface imperfections such as small bridges. However, a large sprung weight to <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> ratio can also be deleterious to vehicle control.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{method used}} is {{to replace the}} cast iron {{friction}} brake assembly with a wheel motor assembly of similar weight. This results in no net gain in <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> and a car capable of braking up to 1G. [...] A {{good example of this}} is the Michelin Active Wheel motor as fitted to the Heuliez Will that results in an <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> of 35 kg on the front axle which compares favorably to a small car such as a Renault Clio that has 38 kg of <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> on its front axle.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Contribution to <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{and total}} weight ...|$|E

5000|$|Lower <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> as {{only the}} halfshafts are carried, not the centre {{differential}} of an axle.|$|E
50|$|Inboard brakes (which reduce <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight)</b> are {{probably}} avoided more due to space considerations than to cost.|$|E
50|$|Lighter (mostly {{aluminum}} or magnesium alloy) wheels improve handling {{as well as}} ride comfort, by lessening <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
5000|$|So the [...] "wheel bounce" [...] due {{to wheel}} inertia, or {{resonant}} {{motion of the}} <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{moving up and down}} on the springiness of the tire, is only poorly damped, mainly by the dampers or shock absorbers of the suspension. For these reasons, high <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> reduces road holding and increases unpredictable changes in direction on rough surfaces (as well as degrading ride comfort and increasing mechanical loads).|$|E
50|$|This <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> {{includes}} the wheels and tires, usually the brakes, plus some {{percentage of the}} suspension, {{depending on how much}} of the suspension moves with the body and how much with the wheels; for instance a solid axle suspension is completely unsprung. The main factors that improve <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight</b> are a sprung differential (as opposed to live axle) and inboard brakes. (The De Dion tube suspension operates much as a live axle does, but represents an improvement because the differential is mounted to the body, thereby reducing the <b>unsprung</b> <b>weight.)</b> Wheel materials and sizes will also have an effect. Aluminium alloy wheels are common due to their weight characteristics which help to reduce unsprung mass. Magnesium alloy wheels are even lighter but corrode easily.|$|E
