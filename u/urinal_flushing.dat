The treatment facility uses a membrane bioreactor process, manufactured and supplied by GE/Zenon, consisting of two bioreactor tanks and an ultrafiltration (hollow fibre) membrane tank, followed by chlorination to remove colour and disinfect the reclaimed water. The treatment system is designed for an average daily flow of 75 cubic metres per day (20,000 gpd), and maximum flows of up to 150 cubic metres per day (40,000 gpd). With the City of Vancouver 2012 commercial metered water and sewer rates at $2.803 and $1.754, respectively, the convention centre can save over $21,000 per month in utility fees through water reuse. One of the biggest operating challenges is to maintain the treatment plant bacteria in a healthy condition during lengthy periods (e.g. late December through mid-January) of no or limited convention activity and concurrent wastewater generation within the building.|$|E

40|$|The water {{shortage}} of today’s world {{is one of}} the most challenging problems and the world is looking for the best solution to reduce the crisis. Some human made causes and also natural causes such as less rainfall, economic development, rapid urbanization, natural hazards (typhoon, earthquake), structural failures and repairs, etc., are liable for the shortage of the existing water supply system. In Taiwan, especially during summer time, a lot of typhoons occurred and during that typhoon period, the turbidity of raw water increases beyond the treatment capacity of a treatment plant and the plant cannot supply required amount of water. To cope with the system, a couple of days are needed and during that period, there would be insufficient supply towards demand for a few days which causes shortage. The purpose of this study is to cope with this emergency shortage problem. A dual-mode Rainwater Harvesting System (RWHS) was used in this study as a supplemental to the existing water supply system to support some selected secondary/non-potable components such as toilet flushing and <b>urinal</b> <b>flushing.</b> This system was able to supply water both for ordinary uses and for emergency uses.

According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using <b>urinals,</b> <b>flush</b> <b>urinals</b> when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a mess in the restroom and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, the restroom occupants turn to violence, leading to police and biological hazard team involvement that closes the restroom. Forced to go elsewhere, other men repeat the scenario, eventually leading to complete societal breakdown.|$|R

40|$|Context: Water is {{currently}} {{considered the most}} critical natural resource on the planet. Numerous worldwide {{studies have shown that}} rainwater harvesting systems have been needed to meet different basic needs. One of the most important steps in planning a rainwater harvesting system is to use a method to determine The optimal capacity of collection and storage tanks Method: In this paper we present different concepts of authors of articles at a global level that refer to the use of rainwater, its capture and use avoiding that this resource is wasted and that it reaches the sewers and raking with the garbage found What happens is that they contaminate and cover these teachers causing flooding. Results: Research has shown that rainwater harvesting systems promote water saving in a variety of settings, such as stadiums, universities, schools, airports and residential areas. Conclusions: it is determined that rainwater has not been taken into account as a saving factor, nor the use of this resource with respect to an environmental impact.

50|$|The {{shares of}} total CII use in schools range from 3.5 percent in Phoenix, Arizona to 6.5 percent in Tampa, Florida {{and up to}} 8 percent in Oakland, California. Most schools use water for restrooms, cooling and heating, {{irrigation}} of outdoor playing fields and lawns, locker rooms, laboratories, and cafeteria kitchens. An expected intensity of use (WUI) in schools would be between 22 and 44 g/ksf/d for indoor use and from 110 to 255 g/ksf/d of total use. More recent studies show observed school use of 33 to 52 g/ksf/d in Colorado and 76 g/ksf/d in eight utilities from Florida and Texas. The EPA Energy Star’s Portfolio Manager shows median use of 27 g/ksf/d. Data on functional metrics show schools' use between 3 and 15 gallons per school day per student for indoor use. and between 4.7 and 23.6 gallons/student/day in Santa Fe, New Mexico. There are 389,000 school buildings in the U.S. with the total floor space of 12,239 million square feet. This building count includes preschools and day care, elementary and middle schools, high schools, and colleges and universities.

40|$|Water {{is one of}} the world’s most {{valuable}} resources. However it is under constant threat due to urbanization, explosive population growth and pollution. The most promising efforts to stem water crisis are to treat the wastewater in a sustainable way and reuse for non-potable applications. Grey water (GW) being highly voluminous and relatively less polluted, recycling for non-potable uses like <b>urinal</b> and toilet <b>flushing,</b> landscaping etc will decrease the stress on fresh water consumption and protect the environment from residual pollutant disposal. This paper discusses about the performance of a hybrid baffled constructed wet land for the treatment of grey water from a hostel located in Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India campus. The hybrid constructed wetland is a combination of vertical and horizontal flow wetland achieved by providing baffles in the system. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of newly developed baffled constructed wetlands in the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), nitrate – nitrogen (NO 3 -N), suspended solids (SS), fecal contamination (FC), sodium do-decyl sulphate (SDS), propylene glycol (PG) and trimethyl amine (TMA) at different hydraulic retention times (HRT) and various organic loading rates (OLRs). The overall removal efficiencies obtained were in the range of 84 - 92 %, 86 - 94 %, 88 - 95 %, 92 - 98 %, 85 - 99 %, 86 - 98 %, 94 - 97 % and 94 - 98 % for BOD 5, COD, NO 3 -N, SS, FC, SDS, PG and TMA, respectively for an HRT of 12. 5 to 16. 5 days. The system showed a distinct solids removal at higher HRT. The hybrid CW was able to eliminate the emerging contaminants such as SDS, PG and TMA from the treated water. The efficient performance of the baffled unit was due to the longer pathway provided by the baffles which in turn provided more contact of the wastewater with the plant, microbes and the matrix...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{a summary of}} the water {{analysis}} performance for the Denver, Colorado Wynkoop Building. The Wynkoop Building (Figure 1) was built in 2006 as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 8 Headquarters intended to house over 900 occupants in the 301, 292 gross square feet (248, 849 rentable square feet). The building was built on a brownfield in the Lower Downtown Historic District as part of an urban redevelopment effort. The building was designed and constructed through a public-private partnership with the sustainable design elements developed jointly by General Services Administration (GSA) and EPA. That partnership is still active with all parties still engaged to optimize building operations and use the building as a Learning Laboratory. The building design achieved U. S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for New Construction (LEED-NC) Gold Certification in 2008 (Figure 2) and a 2008 EPA Energy Star Rating of 96 with design highlights that include: (1) Water use was designed to use 40 % less than a typical design baseline. The design included low flow fixtures, waterless <b>urinals</b> and dual <b>flush</b> toilets; (2) Native and adaptive vegetation were selected to minimize the need for irrigation water for landscaping; and (3) Energy use intensity was modeled at 66. 1 kBtus/gross square foot, which is 39 % better than ASHRAE 90. 1 1999. The Wynkoop Building water use (10 gallons/square foot) was measured at lower than industry average (15 gallons/square foot) and GSA goals (13 gallons/square foot), however, it was higher than building management expected it would be. The type of occupants and number of occupants can {{have a significant impact on}} fixture water use. The occupancy per floor varied significantly over the study time period, which added uncertainty to the data analysis. Investigation of the fixture use on the 2 nd, 5 th, and 7 th floors identified potential for water use reduction if the flush direction of the dual-flush toilet handles was reversed. The building management retrofitted the building's toilets with handles that operated on reduced flush when pushed down (0. 8 gallons) and full flush when pulled up (1. 1 gallons). The water pressure on the 5 th floor ( 80 psi). The measured water savings post-retrofit was lower on the 5 th floor than the 7 th floor. The differences in water pressure may have had an impact on the quantity of water used per floor. The second floor water use was examined prior to and following the toilet fixture retrofit. This floor is where conference rooms for non-building occupants are available for use, thus occupancy is highly variable. The 3 -day average volume per flush event was higher post-retrofit (0. 79 gallons per event), in contrast to pre-retrofit (0. 57 gallons per event). There were 40 % more flush events post retrofit, which impacted the findings. Water use in the third floor fitness center was also measured for a limited number of days. Because of water line accessibility, only water use on the men's side of the fitness center was measured and from that the total fitness center water use was estimated. Using the limited data collected, the fitness center shower water use is approximately 2 % of the whole building water use. Overall water use in the Wynkoop Building is below the industry baseline and GSA expectations. The dual flush fixture replacement appears to have resulted in additional water savings that are expected to show a savings in the total annual water use...|$|R
