Secondly, it <b>unifies</b> supervisory control, diagnosis and prognosis: we develop a framework for a generic well-formed decision-maker; and then, we apply the framework to the three subjects.

40|$|The <b>Unify</b> {{project is}} {{exploring}} scalable approaches for designing large-scale multicomputers that span large geographical areas.

Typically, message passing systems have been proposed as the only efficient platforms for such an environment. <b>Unify</b> takes a new approach in that it provides efficient and scalable communication, but yet constructs a shared memory programming model where communication details are hidden. <b>Unify</b> achieves scalability beyond that of existing DSM systems via new data sharing abstractions, scalable synchronization primitives, application specific memory consistency, and efficient multicast protocols. This paper outlines the <b>Unify</b> design and presents experimental results taken from a prototype system.

5|$|Relations between steppe nomads and the settled {{people in}} and around Central Asia were often marked by conflict. The nomadic {{lifestyle}} was well suited to warfare, and steppe cavalry became {{some of the most}} militarily potent forces in the world, only limited by nomads' frequent lack of internal unity. Periodically, strong leaders would organise several tribes into one force, creating an almost unstoppable power. These <b>unified</b> groups included the Huns, who invaded Europe, and under Attila, conducted campaigns in both eastern France and northern Italy, over 500miles apart, within two successive campaign seasons.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{of students with}} the potential to succeed in mathematics- and science-based study despite previous educational disadvantage is a critical issue currently facing many South African higher education institutions. The possible use of school-leaving examination (Matric) results and/or scores on specially developed aptitude tests for the selection of disadvantaged students was investigated during a four year <b>UNIFY</b> Selection Research Project. <b>UNIFY</b> is a mathematics and science foundation year programme at the University of the North, intended specifically for disadvantaged students from previously black-only educational systems. The research results show that both Matric results and aptitude tests have predictive validity for student performance in <b>UNIFY.</b> Matric results add significantly to the predictive validity attained by the <b>UNIFY</b> selection tests. No significant predictive bias against home and school background is found for the <b>UNIFY</b> student group for either Matric results or aptitude tests. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
