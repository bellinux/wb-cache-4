500|$|After {{finishing}} film school, Australian director James Wan and Australian writer Leigh Whannell {{wanted to}} write and fund a film. The inspiration that they needed came after watching the low-budget independent film The Blair Witch Project. [...] Another film that inspired them to finance the film themselves was Darren Aronofsky's Pi. The two thought the cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room. Whannell said, [...] "So I actually think the restrictions we had on our bank accounts at the time, {{the fact that we}} wanted to keep the film contained, helped <b>us</b> <b>come</b> up with the ideas in the film." [...] One idea was to have the entire film set with two actors stuck in an elevator and being shot in {{the point of view of}} security cameras.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} one of the first to use {{practical}} locations during shooting. According to Clarke, [...] "When we needed a scene in a bar, we went to Santa Monica and asked a guy how much money he would charge to let <b>us</b> <b>come</b> in and shoot scenes in his bar". Because Clarke also acted in the film, editor and co-writer Tom Boutross served as co-director. Boutross later [...] The main character's home in the film was located on Lafayette Boulevard in Los Angeles, which is no longer standing. The four-story rooming house was rented for 5–6 weekend days for $25 per day. The exterior shots of the character's house were shot in a different location around Glendale Hill. A scene in the film where a transformed McKenna graphically crushes a rat with his bare hands was not in the script, and was improvised while on location. The effect was accomplished by placing ketchup on the rat; Clarke would then gently squeeze the rat, making the ketchup ooze from his fingers. This scene was removed from prints that were released on television, but was later restored.|$|E

During the interview Rihanna explains that she, her crew members and dancers were touring for a considerable amount of time and became very close so as a result of that, they hang out a lot.

2500|$|Before the conference, Smuts met Lord Kitchener at Kroonstad station, {{where they}} {{discussed}} the proposed terms of surrender. Smuts {{then took a}} leading role in the negotiations between the representatives from all of the commandos from the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (15–31 May 1902). Although he admitted that, from a purely military perspective, the war could continue, he stressed the importance of not sacrificing the Afrikaner people for that independence. He was very conscious that 'more than 20,000 women and children have already died in the concentration camps of the enemy'. He felt it would have been a crime to continue the war without the assurance of help from elsewhere and declared, [...] "Comrades, we decided to stand to the bitter end. Let us now, like men, admit that that end has come for <b>us,</b> <b>come</b> in a more bitter shape than we ever thought." [...] His opinions were representative of the conference, which then voted by 54 to 6 in favour of peace. Representatives of the Governments met Lord Kitchener and at five minutes past eleven on 31 May 1902, Acting President Burger signed the Peace Treaty, followed by the members of his government, Acting President de Wet and the members of his government.|$|E
