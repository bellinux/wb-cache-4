5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might {{be understood as}} a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> transformation.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{engines are}} {{a class of}} {{hypothetical}} megastructures whose purpose is to extract <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> from a star, sometimes for specific purposes. For example, Matrioshka brains extract energy for purposes of computation; Shkadov thrusters extract energy for purposes of propulsion. Some of the proposed stellar engine designs {{are based on the}} Dyson sphere.|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often <b>useful</b> <b>energy.</b> Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting <b>useful</b> <b>energy.</b> Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} energy saved through {{recycling}} depends upon the material being recycled {{and the type of}} energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with life-cycle analysis using real energy values. In addition, exergy, which is a measure of <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials.|$|E
25|$|Potassium cyanide is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of cellular respiration, acting on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, hence blocking oxidative phosphorylation. This prevents the body from oxidizing food to produce <b>useful</b> <b>energy.</b> Lactic acidosis then occurs {{as a consequence of}} anaerobic metabolism. Initially, acute cyanide poisoning causes a red or ruddy complexion in the victim because the tissues are not able to use the oxygen in the blood. The effects of potassium and sodium cyanide are identical, and symptoms of poisoning typically occur within a few minutes of ingesting the substance: the person loses consciousness, and brain death eventually follows. During this period the victim may suffer convulsions. Death is caused by cerebral hypoxia.|$|E

40|$|Cogeneration is the {{production}} of electrical and thermal energy from a single fuel source. In comparison, electric power generation rejects the <b>useful</b> heat <b>energy</b> into lakes or other heat sinks. Electric generation alone provides approximately 30 percent of its prime <b>energy</b> for <b>useful</b> end-use <b>energy,</b> while cogeneration makes approximately 80 - 85 percent of its prime energy source available for useful work (Figure A). The application of the thermal energy {{is critical to the}} economic analysis of a cogeneration project since nearly two-thirds of the energy and economic savings are produced by the hot water and/or exhaust gases.

25|$|Today, about 90 {{percent of}} {{vehicular}} fuel needs are met by oil. Petroleum also makes up 40 {{percent of total}} energy consumption in the United States, but is responsible for only 1 percent of electricity generation. Petroleum's worth as a portable, dense energy source powering {{the vast majority of}} vehicles and as the base of many industrial chemicals makes it one of the world's most important commodities. Viability of the oil commodity is controlled by several key parameters, number of vehicles in the world competing for fuel, quantity of oil exported to the world market (Export Land Model), Net Energy Gain (economically <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> provided minus energy consumed), political stability of oil exporting nations and ability to defend oil supply lines.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{efficiency}} {{of a system}} or device that converts energy {{is measured by the}} ratio of the amount of <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> put out by the system ("output energy") to the total amount of energy that is put in ("input energy") or by useful output energy {{as a percentage of the}} total input energy. In the case of fuel cells, useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system. Input energy is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40–60% energy efficient. This is higher than some other systems for energy generation. For example, the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25% energy efficient. In combined heat and power (CHP) systems, the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use, increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85–90%.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of <b>useful</b> <b>energy</b> storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{mathematician}} Lazare Carnot {{proposed in}} his 1803 paper Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement {{that in any}} machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of moment of activity. In other words, in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of <b>useful</b> <b>energy.</b> Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son Sadi Carnot published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever [...] "caloric" [...] (what {{is now known as}} heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He made the analogy with that of how water falls in a water wheel. This was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics. Carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th century [...] "Newtonian hypothesis" [...] that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of Count Rumford who showed (1789) that heat could be created by friction as when cannon bores are machined. Carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance, such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state {{at the end of a}} complete engine cycle, that [...] "no change occurs in the condition of the working body".|$|E
