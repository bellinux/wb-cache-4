25|$|What was <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> the Zisapels' {{business}} {{philosophy was}} that each company would operate independently, without a holding company, {{but all of}} the companies would be guided by them under a collective strategic umbrella. Companies may cooperate in the development of their solutions, engage in joint marketing activities and benefit from a common management structure. This decentralized business philosophy was designed to maximize the advantages inherent in smaller business units, such as flexibility, entrepreneurial spirit and management focus. As a result, since 1984, when the RAD Group came into being, it has spawned more than 185 companies, 8 IPOs and 19 mergers and acquisitions.|$|E
25|$|Netzer {{discovered}} the Roman Theatre {{just before his}} death in late 2010. A loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This means that when Herod or other notable officials went to see a play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 650 people. What is quite <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> this find is that frescoes of landscapes were discovered. This suggests that the painters were well traveled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome.|$|E

25|$|The {{major defect}} in silver halides is the Frenkel defect, where silver ions are located interstitially (Agi+) in high {{concentration}} with their corresponding negatively charged silver-ion vacancies (Agv−). What is <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> AgBr Frenkel pairs {{is that the}} interstitial Agi+ are exceptionally mobile, and that its concentration in the layer below the grain surface (called the space-charge layer) far exceeds that of the intrinsic bulk. The formation energy of the Frenkel pair is low at 1.16 eV, and the migration activation energy is unusually low at 0.05 eV (compare to NaCl: 2.18 eV {{for the formation of}} a Schottky pair and 0.75 eV for cationic migration). These low energies result in large defect concentrations, which can reach near 1% near the melting point.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} metals in their solid state {{helps to explain}} the unusually high {{electrical}} conductivity of copper. In a copper atom, the outermost 4s energy zone, or conduction band, is only half filled, so many electrons are able to carry electric current. When an electric field is applied to a copper wire, the conduction of electrons accelerates towards the electropositive end, thereby creating a current. These electrons encounter resistance to their passage by colliding with impurity atoms, vacancies, lattice ions, and imperfections. The average distance travelled between collisions, defined as the “mean free path,” is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the metal. What is <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> copper is its long mean free path (approximately 100 atomic spacings at room temperature). This mean free path increases rapidly as copper is chilled.|$|E
25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, {{it has been}} hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes. The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions. Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans. This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> the environment of ancestral humans, which {{gave rise to the}} need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment. Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.|$|E

25|$|Hoveyda's rise {{to power}} {{involved}} many years of service within the ministry of foreign affairs, but this path took {{on a whole new}} approach once he joined the Board of Directors of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in 1958 at the behest of his patron Abdullah Entezam, who had by then assumed a high ranking position at the company. As managing director and special assistant to Entezam, Hoveyda used his experiences in the West to transform management-worker relations. As an example, he introduced innovative methods by which workers filed grievances in regard to any aspect of the working environment they deemed unsatisfactory, and helped to figuratively enmesh the roles of management and the labourers into a collective entity. One way he went about doing this was by eating many of his meals alongside wage labourers in the cafeteria. Although he advocated the emulation of Western models to improve overall productivity and worker relations, Hoveyda was very outspoken in favour of expelling foreign technicians and attracting indigenous sources of labour. It was during his tenure in which the NIOC's periodical, Kavosh (Exploration), was first published. What is <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> this magazine is that it was, initially, virtually void of any semblance of the growing cult of personality which surrounded the Shah.|$|E
500|$|<b>Unique</b> <b>about</b> {{the field}} is the design itself. Initially, the south end zone had either [...] "Steelers" [...] or [...] "Panthers" [...] painted in the end zone, {{depending}} on the game itself. The north end zone has always read [...] "Pittsburgh", which is painted in gold lettering and trimmed in either black for the Steelers or dark blue for Pitt. Although there is typically no midfield logo when both Pitt and the Steelers are in season, both teams have applied their logo if the field's schedule allows for a sufficient break to remove or apply the other team's logo for that team's next upcoming game. The Steelers have typically added their logo to midfield after Pitt's football season has ended.|$|E

[...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story."

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. He praised the storytelling, positively commenting {{on how it}} revolved around Skinner and his past life. In addition he wrote that the episode possessed some [...] "good scares". However, {{he felt that the}} [...] "central paranormal mystery of the episode is handled in a fashion that feels a bit muddled". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode fails to capitalize on the idea of delving into the world of Walter Skinner. The conspiracy elements seem a bit redundant, and the paranormal side of the episode is a forced and inconsistent mess. Instead of developing something <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> Skinner, the episode dwells on what is already known or suggested, leaving the character in the same emotional place at the end as in the beginning." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Avatar" [...] a D+, describing it as [...] "ridiculous" [...] and saying, [...] "The clench-toothed Skinner deserves more air time, but not this USA Network reject".|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time {{magazine}} {{considered the}} character as [...] "the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: {{his head is}} as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, {{and he has a}} personality to match–conscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him". The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said, [...] "His relentless good cheer would be irritating if he weren't so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange ... Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet". Robert Thompson, a professor of communications and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told The New York Times, [...] "There is something kind of <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> [...] It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era.

In another interview with LA Times, he commentated on the show's adult audience: [...] " [...] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [...] On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented. It is very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the frames." [...] In a 2007 interview, Barack Obama named SpongeBob his favorite TV character and admitted that SpongeBob SquarePants is [...] "the show I watch with my daughters".

500|$|Development officially {{began in}} 2009, when TNT {{announced}} that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project. Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who {{is best known for}} writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. [...] "I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [...] spirit of '76. I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world," [...] he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. [...] "I've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?" [...] he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, [...] "It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [...] They say write what you know, and with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was <b>unique</b> <b>about</b> her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
