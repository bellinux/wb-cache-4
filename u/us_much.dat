5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells <b>us</b> <b>much</b> about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E
5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in the speech has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells <b>us</b> <b>much</b> about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one of our best sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E
25|$|Inland mining for copper, gold, etc., {{is another}} source of marine {{pollution}}. Most of the pollution is simply soil, which ends up in rivers flowing to the sea. However, some minerals discharged {{in the course of}} the mining can cause problems, such as copper, a common industrial pollutant, which can interfere with the life history and development of coral polyps. Mining has a poor environmental track record. For example, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, mining has contaminated portions of the headwaters of over 40% of watersheds in the western continental <b>US.</b> <b>Much</b> of this pollution finishes up in the sea.|$|E

25|$|Ward {{had been}} a {{frequent}} public speaker since leaving university, and by the 1960s her lectures attracted international respect; several lecture series, including some presented in Canada, Ghana and India, were published in book form. Ward spent increasing amounts {{of time in the}} <b>US,</b> <b>much</b> of her work there funded by the Carnegie Foundation. In 1957 Harvard University gave her an honorary LittD and until 1968 she was a Carnegie fellow there, living for part of each year in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. She got to know Adlai Stevenson and John F Kennedy and acted as adviser to various influential policy makers, including Robert McNamara at the World Bank and Lyndon B Johnson, who welcomed her thoughts on his Great Society projects despite her opposition to the Vietnam war.|$|E
25|$|Due to Belyi's theorem, {{the action}} of Γ on dessins is {{faithful}} (that is, every two elements of Γ define different permutations {{on the set of}} dessins), so the study of dessins d'enfants can tell <b>us</b> <b>much</b> about Γ itself. In this light, it is of great interest to understand which dessins may be transformed into each other by {{the action of}} Γ and which may not. For instance, one may observe that the two trees shown have the same degree sequences for their black nodes and white nodes: both have a black node with degree three, two black nodes with degree two, two white nodes with degree two, and three white nodes with degree one. This equality is not a coincidence: whenever Γ transforms one dessin into another, both will have the same degree sequence. The degree sequence is one known invariant of the Galois action, but not the only invariant.|$|E

About a year later, on May 27, 2003, Levy's remains were buried in Lakewood Memorial Park Cemetery at Hughson, California, near her home town of Modesto.

500|$|In January 1983, Minutemen {{were asked}} by ex-Blue Cheer keyboardist and local {{producer}} Ethan James to contribute {{a song to}} Radio Tokyo Tapes, a compilation named after the Californian studio where James worked. The band agreed and contributed three songs to the compilation, with James recording them all for free. These three songs, and another five recorded in May 1983 {{for a total of}} $50, were included in their 1983 EP Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat. The band had recorded solely with SST engineer Spot prior to the recordings. However, they were so impressed by the sessions that they enlisted James to record their next full-length album; Watt later commented: [...] "Ethan, although not knowing <b>us</b> <b>much,</b> tapped right in." [...] After their European tour in mid-1983 with Black Flag, Minutemen entered Radio Tokyo Studios in November to record their next studio album.|$|E
500|$|... "Jacksonville" [...] premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine {{called it}} [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "well-acted", especially liking John Noble's performance. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining [...] "I liked 'Jacksonville' {{for the way}} it plunged directly {{into the heart of}} the show's mythology for the first time in a while, and even if it didn't tell <b>us</b> <b>much</b> we didn't already know, having the story become more personal for our heroes served to create that unsettled feeling at which Fringe excels". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved [...] "Jacksonville", believing it to be a [...] "tremendously moving, startling episode" [...] and [...] "one of [...] finest hours". AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self, and then confronting Walter over it. She also felt Olivia's loss of memory to be [...] "interesting," [...] and became [...] "practically gleeful" [...] at her and Peter's near kiss.|$|E
500|$|After the match, {{figures from}} each team were {{critical}} of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying [...] "It was a pathetic attitude. You never win anything like that." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: [...] "It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed {{to be concerned with}} keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at <b>us</b> <b>much</b> – apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and {{it was a case of}} breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish." [...] Meanwhile, Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel was {{critical of the}} quality of the Liverpool team: [...] "Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago. I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players." ...|$|E

Mendelson felt [...] "this [...] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling <b>us</b> <b>much</b> we don't already know" [...] adding, [...] "Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if this really is the final Avengers 2 trailer, then {{at least on the}} trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled." [...] A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had [...] "smashed records" [...] with over 35 million views.|$|E
500|$|The band Motörhead {{was founded}} in 1975 by already {{experienced}} musicians. Their leader Ian [...] "Lemmy" [...] Kilmister was {{a former member of}} the space rock band Hawkwind, Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies, and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight's Zeus. Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal. Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene. Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his Peel Sessions program and the first to reach No.1 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith in June 1981. Lemmy himself said, [...] "the NWOBHM... didn't do <b>us</b> <b>much</b> good", because Motörhead [...] "came along a bit too early for it".|$|E

TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling <b>us</b> <b>much</b> more." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans. Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with <b>us</b> <b>much</b> longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E
