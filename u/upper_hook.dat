40|$|ABSTRACT: Thirteen fresh cadaver spinal {{segments}} (fifth thoracic to fifth lumbar vertebra) with a posterior ligamentous defect at {{the twelfth}} thoracic-first lumbar level were tested to failure in flexion, creating an Un-stable fracture at the twelfth thoracic and first lumbar vertebrae. The fractured spines were then in-strumented with Harrington distraction rods and re-tested. Spines instrumented at the eleventh thoracic to second lumbar vertebra {{were not significantly}} stronger than uninstrumented specimens (with a posterior liga-mentous defect). Repositioning the <b>upper</b> <b>hook</b> from the eleventh to the tenth thoracic vertebra increased the failure moment {{by an average of}} 36 per cent.

40|$|Background and Aims: Various {{methods are}} used for {{treatment}} of open bite. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of Lower Anterior High Pull Headgear (LAHPH) appliance in Class I subjects with moderate open bite and high lower lip line. Materials and Methods: The study group was composed of 10 subjects with a mean age of 15. 8 ± 2. 5 years and 3. 05 ± 0. 07 mm moderate open bite. All the patients rejected orthognathic surgery. The treatment included extraction of upper and lower second premolars followed by leveling, banding, bonding, posterior space closure, and anterior retraction. After these procedures, the open bite was reduced to 2. 04 ± 1. 17 mm. Afterwards, LAHPH was applied for 18 hours per day for 8 ± 2 months. LAHPH appliance was composed of High Pull Headgear and two hooks mounted on its inner bow. Two elastics (1. 8, light, Dentaurum) connected the <b>upper</b> <b>hooks</b> on the inner bow to the lower hooks on the mandibular canines vertically. The forces produced by the prescribed elastics were 10 and 60 g during mouth closing and opening, respectively. Paired T-test was used to evaluate pre-andpost-treatment outcomes. Results: The pre-and post-treatment cephalometric evaluations showed that the LAHPH reduced effectively the open bite of the patients to 0. 15 ± 1. 7 mm (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: This appliance can be used as an acceptable method for closing the open bite in Class I subjects...|$|R
