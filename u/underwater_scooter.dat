50|$|A diver {{propulsion}} vehicle (DPV, {{also known}} as an underwater propulsion vehicle or <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter)</b> is an item of diving equipment used by scuba and rebreather divers to increase range underwater. Range is restricted {{by the amount of}} breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed under exertion, and the time limits imposed by the dive tables to avoid decompression sickness. DPVs can have military application.|$|E
50|$|The core {{gameplay}} {{consists of}} {{elements of a}} third-person shooter and a driving game, with a huge open-world map to explore. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, swimming and jumping, as well as utilizing weapons. Players can take control {{of a variety of}} vehicles, including cars, boats, airplanes, helicopters, motorcycles and even an <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter.</b> Players can also perform stunts with their cars in which they can stand on the roof and jump to another car, or choose to open their parachute whilst still in motion on the roof. Other key features of the game include parasailing (grappling onto a car while utilizing a parachute) and skydiving.|$|E

40|$|Macrohabitat distribution, zonation and {{morphology}} {{of coral}} reefs in the Flores Sea region were investigated. Descriptions of reefs and reef maps are presented, based on large area surveys and aerial photographs. Diving equipment, <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter,</b> depth recorder and different methods of aerial photography {{were employed to}} collect data. The aim of the surveys was to acquire synoptic views of the study areas and to attribute to a uniform classification system applicable to reef mapping throughout the archipelago...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A diver {{propulsion}} vehicle (DPV) is {{a device}} used by scuba divers to help pull {{them through the}} ocean {{without the use of}} additional exertion. The objective of this re-search project was to build a diver propulsion vehicle (DPV), or <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter</b> as it came to be known. The scooter would have to reliably pull an adult through water and allow neutral buoyancy whereby the user would neither submerge to the bottom nor float to the surface. The entire system would also need to be waterproof to protect the elec-tronics and sustain the life of the scooter. The prototype also had to be durable and able to function {{for an extended period of}} time. Finally, the scooter had to be built at a rela-tively low cost. A combination of relevant mechanical engineering, electrical engineer-ing, and programming programing skills were required to design and assemble a working prototype. The first prototype did not fulfill the given requirements, but upgrades to this initial model generated a more efficient design. Further upgrades could improve the style, speed, and efficiency of the <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter.</b> Over time, some aspects of the de-sign, with upgrades, could have commercial applicability...|$|E
40|$|Artificial reefs (ARs) {{have been}} {{deployed}} on the inner shelf of Paraná State, south Brazil, to recuperate marine biodiversity and as protection against destructive trawling activities. The {{purpose of this study}} was to offer a first characterization of the ichthyoplankton community associated with the ARs and the adjacent archipelago of Currais. Two sampling methodologies were used; 1) plankton net attached to an <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter</b> and; 2) light-traps. A hydrodynamic model was used to study dispersal trajectories to and from the study area. Sampling was conducted between 31. 07. 14 and 04. 04. 16. A total of 13 families and 11 species were identified, expanding the total species list of the study area with six species and four families; 63...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{processes}} affecting fish {{recruitment and}} population connectivity is of major {{importance to the}} management of Marine Protected Areas. Fluctuations in recruitment of coastal fishes can be affected by processes occurring during the early life stages such as the dispersal and availability of larvae. In nearshore temperate environments, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge about the patterns of larval supply or biophysical interactions that may influence recruitment variability in these populations. With the objectives of investigating within season (Spring-Summer period) fluctuations that may affect recruitment, and of understanding patterns of larval retention close to the reefs, we used a plankton net attached to an <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter</b> to investigate weekly variation in the composition of fish larval assemblages, larval density and diversity and ontogenetic patterns of occurrence of fish larvae in the extreme nearshore environment of the Arrábida Marine Park (Portugal). The results from multivariate analysis (PERMANOVA and SIMPER) have showed a lower number of species dominating the assemblage, and significant differences in the abundance between species, when compared to previous studies. The presence of larvae in several developmental stages indicates some degree of retention. These findings are important to the management of the Marine Park...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we compare}} the composition, {{abundance}} {{and structure of}} a temperate fish larval assemblage at different depth intervals (0 – 4, 4 – 8 and 8 – 12 m) in the extreme nearshore environment. We used a plankton net attached to an <b>underwater</b> <b>scooter</b> to sample {{in close proximity to}} the rocky substrate (< 50 cm). A total of 868 larvae from 27 taxa in 13 families were caught. The majority of larvae belonged to benthic reef-associated species (Blenniidae, Gobiidae, Gobiesocidae and Tripterygiidae), the four most abundant comprising 76 % of the total larvae caught. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) showed that there was a single multispecific larval patch near the substrate in the extreme nearshore up to 12 m depth. Nonetheless, distinct larval abundances were found in this relatively small depth range, with the majority of species being more abundant at the deepest interval, particularly Pomatoschistus pictus and Gobius xanthocephalus. Tripterygion delaisi was an exception being more abundant at the shallowest depth as young larvae. The density of pre-flexion larvae was not significantly different across depth intervals, but post-flexion larval density increased with depth. The full size range (from hatching to settlement) of P. pictus was present at the extreme nearshore. The innovative sampling technique used here revealed high densities of larvae close to the bottom, and depth was found to be an important factor influencing the distribution of several taxa and ontogenetic stages. The nearshore component of coastal fish larval assemblages near rocky substrates has been poorly studied, and our results suggest that the high densities of larvae found to aggregate in these environments {{must be taken into account}} when studying distribution and functional aspects of these assemblages...|$|E
