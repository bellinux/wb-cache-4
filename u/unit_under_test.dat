2500|$|Direct-field {{acoustic}} testing, or DFAT, is {{a technique}} used for acoustic testing of aerospace structures by subjecting them to sound waves created by an array of acoustic drivers. The method uses electro-dynamic acoustic speakers, arranged around the test article to provide a uniform, well-controlled, direct sound field at {{the surface of the}} <b>unit</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> The system employs high capability acoustic drivers, powerful audio amplifiers, a narrow-band multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) controller and precision laboratory microphones to produce an acoustic environment that can simulate a helicopter, aircraft, jet engine or launch vehicle sound pressure field. A high level system is capable of overall sound pressure levels in the 125–147dB for more than one minute over a frequency range from 25Hz to 10kHz.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{literature}} of life-testing, general progressive censoring has been studied extensively. But, all {{the results have been}} developed under the key assumption that the <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> are independently distributed. In this paper, we study general progressively Type-II cen-sored order statistics arising from identical <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> which are jointly distributed according to an Archimedean copula with completely monotone generator (GPCOSARCM-II). Density, distribution and joint density functions of GPCOSARCM-II are all derived. Finally, some ex-amples of GPCOSARCM-II are also provided...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{maintaining}} complex software systems {{is a difficult}} task. In principle, tests {{can be a good}} source of information about how the system works. Unfortunately, tests are frequently unstructured and disconnected from each other and from their <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> We propose a new approach to organizing unit tests in which tests produce examples of their <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>tests</b> which also can be reused for composing higher-level tests. The approach is based on the Eg meta-model, which classifies tests according to their granularity and their goals. We have developed the EgBrowser, an experimental tool for specifying tests that conform to the Eg metamodel while keeping track of the connection between tests themselves and their <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> Initial usability studies suggest that the approach is both easy to learn and more efficient than the programmatic approach to developing tests. ...|$|R

50|$|Electric motor/generator dynamometers are a {{specialized}} type of adjustable-speed drive. The absorption/driver unit {{can be either}} an alternating current (AC) motor or a direct current (DC) motor. Either an AC motor or a DC motor can operate as a generator that {{is driven by the}} <b>unit</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> or a motor that drives the <b>unit</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> When equipped with appropriate control units, electric motor/generator dynamometers can be configured as universal dynamometers. The control unit for an AC motor is a variable-frequency drive, while the control unit for a DC motor is a DC drive. In both cases, regenerative control units can transfer power from the <b>unit</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> to the electric utility. Where permitted, the operator of the dynamometer can receive payment (or credit) from the utility for the returned power via net metering.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{techniques}} to explain abstract concepts is to provide concrete examples. By explaining an abstract concept with a concrete example people {{make sure that the}} concept is understood and remembered. Examples in software can be used both to test the software and to illustrate its functionality. Object-oriented programs are built around the concepts of classes, methods and variables, where methods are the atoms of the functionality. But the meta-models of object-oriented languages do not allow developers to associate runnable and composable examples with these concepts and particularly not with methods. Unit tests on the other hand, assure the quality of the <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> and document them. Not being integrated into the language, unit tests are not linked explicitly to their <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> which makes it unnecessarily difficult to use them for documenting, typing and debugging software. In addition they are not composable making it hard to develop higher level test scenarios in parallel with higher level objects.

50|$|It is {{generally}} possible to perform unit testing {{without the support}} of a specific framework by writing client code that exercises the <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> and uses assertions, exception handling, or other control flow mechanisms to signal failure. Unit testing without a framework is valuable in that there is a barrier to entry for the adoption of unit testing; having scant unit tests is hardly better than having none at all, whereas once a framework is in place, adding unit tests becomes relatively easy. In some frameworks many advanced unit test features are missing or must be hand-coded.|$|R

Special types of nodes, the so called crosscutting nodes, {{are included in the}} CFG to represent additional information about the type of advice that affects that point, as well as the name of the aspect the advice belongs to. Control flow and data flow testing criteria are proposed to particularly require paths that include the crosscutting nodes and their incoming and outgoing edges.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} today's testing scenarios demands for an integrated, open and flexible approach {{to support the}} management of the overall test process. Furthermore systems <b>under</b> <b>test</b> become composite (e. g. including Computer Telephony Integrated platform aspects), embedded (e. g. with hardware/software codesign) and run on distributed architectures (e. g. client/server architectures). In addition, it is increasingly unrealistic to restrict the consideration of the testing activities to single units, since complex subsystems a#ect each other and require scalable, integrated test methodologies. In this paper, we present a test management layer driving the generation, execution and evaluation of system-level tests in a highly heterogeneous landscape. The management layer introduces the required flexibilization of the overall architecture of the test environment: it is a modular and open environment, so that several tools and <b>units</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> can be added at need. By means of a CORBA/RMI-based implementation of the external interfaces of the management layer, we are able to address and encapsulate a wide range of commercial test tools.
