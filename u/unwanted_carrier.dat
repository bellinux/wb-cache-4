40|$|Quadrature {{modulators}} are {{ubiquitous in}} modern communication systems {{due to the}} flexibility they provide. By simply generating an in-phase and quadrature-phase signal, nearly any type of modulated waveform can be created with a quad modulator. Although these devices are simple to use, they produce relatively large amounts of <b>unwanted</b> <b>carrier</b> and image signals. In many cases, {{they need to be}} calibrated before operation, or operated in a closed-loop to adjust the stimulating signals and null the undesired emissions. There have been many methods developed to iteratively find the appropriate correction factors needed to improve the spurious performance of these devices. In the following thesis, a method for rejecting the image and carrier leakage is proposed which solves for the correction factors directly from a limited number of measurements. This method is proven through simulations in Agilent 2 ̆ 7 s Advance Design System (ADS) and Matlab/Simulink. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To {{establish}} the interference canceller, generating replicas of unwanted carriers is a key. This paper addresses {{the design and}} performances of two types of signal canceller that are used for two typical types of satellite communications, namely P-MP VSAT (Point-to-Multi-Point Very Small-Aperture Terminal) and P-P (Point-to-Point) paired carrier systems. For P-MP VSAT, we show a simplified method where a replica of an <b>unwanted</b> <b>carrier</b> is generated by demodulating it. We have developed a reference simulator to simulate the behavior and performance. This simulator takes into account degradation due to implementation. The source code developed here is applicable {{to the implementation of}} FPGA. We also propose a method to generate replicas by stably measuring the satellite round-trip delay by multi-component code (MCC) on a real-time basis for P-P, since we cannot apply the same method to this case as we can for VSAT systems. We use MCC (Multi-component Code) to measure the delay as quickly and accurately as possible. It is the key how stably the acquisition of the code is established in the actual environment of satellite channel which is suffered from heavy noise and large level variation. We show a method to stabilize acquisition process of MCC by normalizing multilevel correlation using a level obtained by additional loop.

40|$|The {{conventional}} a-Si photovoltaic (PV) {{has been}} designed with intrinsic a-Si interfaced with p- and n- type doped layers, total around 40 - 50 nm. Here, the intrinsic layer needs to be much thicker than the doped layers {{in order to maximize}} the conversion of the photogenerated carriers to electric current. Since the dopants, as intentional impurities, annihilate photogenerated carriers, the doped material should be as thin as possible unless it reduces an internal electric field. Eventually the <b>unwanted</b> <b>carrier</b> recombination with dopants causes light-induced degradation of a-Si PV. 	In this dissertation, we present studies suggesting removing dopants in a-Si PV for higher internal quantum efficiency as well as previously undiscovered novel PV applications. We propose intrinsic a-Si hybrid structure with inorganic/organic materials for PVs without any doping. The highest average power conversion efficiency of the a-Si hybrid PV is 6. 7 % by 180 nm-thick undoped a-Si layer. Its current density-voltage (J-V) curve shows the average short circuit current (Jsc) of 13. 6 mA/cm 2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0. 77, and fill factor (FF) of 64 %. We also characterize the hybrid cells by capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement to identify a built-in potential, from 0. 7 V to 0. 85 V, according to metal oxide Schottky contact at anode. The built-in potential consequently determines Voc of the hybrid cells. 	We exploit the proposed a-Si hybrid device further by running capacitance-frequency (C-f) measurement in order to quantify the interfacial amount of charge annihilation with regard to varied a-Si thicknesses, thereby affecting Voc ranging from 0. 6 V to 0. 8 V. The Voc change is also evaluated under concentrated sun condition (1 Sun ~ 7 Sun). Since the a-Si hybrid cell shows FF decrease (68 % to 62 %) with increased a-Si thickness (50 nm to 180 nm), we exploit the ambipolar diffusion length (~ 80 nm) by transient photocurrent and photovoltage responses. Notably, we demonstrate the use of the a-Si hybrid cells for decorative colored PV applications by designing a-Si thickness below ~ 30 nm, even a few nanometers for semi-transparent PVs. We also suggest applying the ultra-thin a-Si hybrid structure for various photo-sensing applications including large area high-speed photo-detectors...|$|E
40|$|Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) {{are used}} {{extensively}} in various applications where substrate {{are required to}} be possessing higher surface area, porosity and electrical and thermal conductivity. Such properties can be enhanced to target a particular gas and biochemical for efficient detection when CNT matrix is functionalized with Nanoparticles (NPs). Conventional functionalization involves harsh oxidation repeated washing, filtration and sonication, which induce defects. The defects lead to hindered mobility of <b>carriers,</b> <b>unwanted</b> doping and also fragmentation of the CNTs in some cases. In this document we demonstrate functionalization of CNT with Au nanoparticles on a macro scale under dry and ambient condition using Xenon ash induced solid-state dewetting. A sputtered thin film was transformed into nanoparticles which were confirmed {{to be in a}} state of thermodynamic equilibrium. We worked on 3 nm, 6 nm, 9 nm, 15 nm, 30 nm initial thickness of thin films. Xenon ash parameters of energy, number of pulse, duration of pulse, duration of gap between consecutive pulses were optimized to achieve complete dewetting of Au thin films. 3 nm deposition was in the form of irregular nano-islands which were transformed into stable nanoparticles with a single shot of 10 J/cm 2 of 2 ms duration. 6 nm and 9 nm deposition was in form of continues film which was also dewetted into stable nanoparticles with a single pulse but with an increased energy density of 20 J/cm 2 and 35 J/cm 2 respectively. In case of 15 nm and 30 nm deposition the thin film couldn't be dewetted with a maximum energy density of 50 J/cm 2, it was observed that 3 and 4 pulses of 2 ms pulse duration and 2 ms gap duration with an energy density of 50 J/cm 2 were required to completely dewet the thicker films. However irregularity was induced in the sizes of the NPs due to Ostwald ripening phenomenon which causes smaller particle within a critical difiusion length to combine and form a larger particle during or after dewetting process. For comparison, the Au thin films were also dewetted by a conventional process involving annealing of samples until the thin film was fully transformed into NPs and the size of NPs seized to grow. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterize the samples. Thermodynamic stability of the particles was confirmed with statistical analyses of size distribution after every additional pulse...|$|R
