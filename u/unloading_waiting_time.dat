40|$|BACKGROUND: Providing {{emergency}} department (ED) <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> {{information to the}} public has been suggested as a mechanism to reduce lengthy ED <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> (by enabling patients to select the ED site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time),</b> but the effects of such a program have not been evaluated. We evaluated the effects of such a program in a community with two ED sites. METHODS: Descriptive statistics for <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> of the two sites before and after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information were used to evaluate the effects of the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information on <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> Multivariate logistical regression was used to test whether or not individual patients used published <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> to decide which site to visit. RESULTS: We found that the rates of <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> exceeding 4 h, and the 95 th percentile of <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> in the two sites decreased after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information, even though the average <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> experienced a slight increase. We also found that after controlling for other factors, the site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> had a higher likelihood of being selected after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information, but there was no such relationship before the publication. CONCLUSIONS: These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information leads to patients selecting the site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time.</b> While publishing ED <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information did not improve average <b>wait</b> <b>time,</b> it reduced the rates of lengthy <b>wait</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

Objective: A <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> survey (WTS), {{conducted}} in 2007 at 94 % of clinics in Cape Town, measured length of patient <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> (WT) for services and provided recommendations to shorten <b>waiting</b> <b>times.</b> Whether subsequent implementation of these recommendations occurred was unknown, hence a {{study was conducted}} {{to assess the impact of}} the previous <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> survey recommendations on stimulating efforts to reduce <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> and whether <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> had reduced. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study design assessed the perceptions of 92 % of clinic managers in Cape Town, regarding the 2007 survey, while a before and after study design assessed changes in <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> between 2007 and 2011, using a random sample of 22 clinics. Results: The overall median <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> of all clinics in the sample decreased by 21 minutes in 2011 (95 % CI 11. 77 - 30. 23), a 28 % decrease from 2007. This reduction was manifest at individual clinic level as well, with 55 % of clinics reducing their median <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> by at least 15 minutes.

Design. Retrospective study. Setting and study participants. Patients from orthopaedic units at 10 Swedish hospitals participated in the study. A questionnaire was sent to 1336 surgical patients (517 hip replacement, 321 back surgery, and 498 arthroscopic knee surgery) 3 months after surgery. Information extracted from the hospitals' patient administrative systems was also used. Outcome measures. Length of <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> socio-economic variables, hospital type, health-related quality of life, and opinion about <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> The data were analysed mainly using regression analyses. Results. The overall response rate was 79 %. In all pre-operative stages, <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> were longest in the hip replacement group. Socio-economic variables were not consistent determinants of variation in <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> except for working status in the back surgery group where. working patients had shorter <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> than non-working patients irrespective of phase of <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> Admission to a county/district county hospital, compared with a university/regional hospital, was associated with shorter <b>time</b> on the <b>waiting</b> fist.

We aimed to estimate total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for surgical procedures, including outpatient visits and diagnostic tests prior to surgery. In addition, we propose an alternative system to manage total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> that reduces variability and maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> without increasing the use of health care resources. This system is illustrated by three surgical procedures: cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair. Methods: Using data from two Autonomous Communities, we adjusted, through simulation, a theoretical distribution of the total <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> assuming independence of the <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> of each stage of the clinical procedure. We show an alternative system in which the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> for the second consultation is established according to the <b>time</b> previously <b>waited</b> for the first consultation. Results: Average total <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for cholecystectomy, carpal tunnel release and inguinal/femoral hernia repair were 331, 355 and 137 days, respectively (official data are 83, 68 and 73 days, respectively). Using different negative correlations between <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for subsequent consultations would reduce maximum <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> by between 2 % and 15 % and substantially reduce heterogeneity among patients, without generating higher resource use.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prior {{research}} shows that clinical demand and supplier capacity significantly affect the throughput and the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> within an isolated unit. However, it is doubtful whether characteristics (i. e., demand, capacity, throughput, and <b>wait</b> <b>time)</b> of one unit would affect the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units on the patient flow process. Focusing on cardiac care, this paper aims to {{examine the impact of}} characteristics of the catheterization unit (CU) on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of cardiac surgery unit (SU). METHODS: This study integrates published data from several sources on characteristics of the CU and SU units in 11 hospitals in Ontario, Canada between 2005 and 2008. It proposes a two-layer <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> model (with each layer representing one unit) to examine the impact of CU's characteristics on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU and test the hypotheses using the Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modeling analysis tool. RESULTS: Results show that: (i) <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of CU has a direct positive impact on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU (β = 0. 330, p < 0. 01); (ii) capacity of CU has a direct positive impact on demand of SU (β = 0. 644, p < 0. 01); (iii) within each unit, there exist significant relationships among different characteristics (except for the effect of throughput on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in SU). CONCLUSION: Characteristics of CU have direct and indirect impacts on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU. Specifically, demand and <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of preceding unit are good predictors for <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units. This suggests that considering such cross-unit effects is necessary when alleviating <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in a health care system. Further, different patient risk profiles may affect <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in different ways (e. g., positive or negative effects) within SU. This implies that the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> management should carefully consider the relationship between priority triage and risk stratification, especially for cardiac surgery...|$|R

Method: A web-based survey was distributed to 379 agencies providing CAMHS in Canada. The survey contained questions about agency characteristics, waiting list characteristics and agency <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> Pearson’s correlations were used to determine the bivariate relationship between agency and waiting list characteristics and <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> Results: The response rate was 30. 6 % (n= 116). Only 8. 6 % of agencies reported no waiting lists for their programs or services. Estimated mean <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> for initial assessment decreased with increasing levels of clinical priority.

Specifically, these sources of vehicle <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> include cognitive reorientation and interaction <b>wait</b> <b>time,</b> queues for multiple vehicle interactions, and loss of situation awareness <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> When <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> were included, predictions using a multiple homogeneous and independent UAV simulation dropped by up to 67 %, with loss of situation awareness as the primary source of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> delays. Moreover this study demonstrated that even in a highly automated management-by-exception system, which should alleviate queuing and interaction <b>wait</b> <b>times,</b> operator capacity is still affected by situation awareness <b>wait</b> <b>time,</b> causing a 36 % decrease over the capacity model with no <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> included.
