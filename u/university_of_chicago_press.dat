40|$|With the anniversaries of the 1959 (and 2008) Tibetan Uprisings just past, Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism {{has been}} much in the news {{in the past few}} months. But Buddhism more {{generally}} has been popping up in world news. A few readings on the topic… 1) “Six episodes” are distilled from Donald Lopez’s new book Buddhism and Science: A Guide for the Perplexed at <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>Press’s</b> website. Here’s one: Although hailed in Victorian Europe for its rejection of the Indian caste system and its championing of the spiritual potential of all social classes, Buddhism also {{played a role in the}} science of race during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1914, the Sinhalese Buddhist Anagarika Dharmapala described the Buddha as ”the great Aryan Savior,” while explaining that ”the life of the Nazarene Jew was not of cosmic usefulness. ” In 1937, the Chinese Buddhist monk Taixu wrote a letter to Adolf Hitler, recommending Buddhism as the ideal religion for the Aryan race. Lopez also took the “Page 99 test” on the book for Campaign for the American Reader. 2) Pankaj Mishra did an intriguing interview about “the Buddha in the World” for the NPR show, Speaking of Faith...|$|R

40|$|This {{illustrated}} article {{represents a}} popular {{account of the}} study of the Babylonian astronomical records of Enuma Anu Enlil tablet series i. e. of the Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa and of two lunar eclipses linked with the IIIrd dynasty of Ur, having resulted in the proposal of Ultra-Low chronology of the Near East in II millennium B.

Tables of relative chronologies of principal kingdoms of Mesopotamia are given, along with some dates associated with the fall of Babylon in II millennium B. C.

5000|$|While {{playing for}} San Francisco in 1910, Walker {{identified}} himself as Frank Mitchell, leaving off his last name. Mystery surrounded his appearances in the Pacific Coast League. Some accounts indicate that he wore a mask while pitching for the Seals. After he won both games of a doubleheader over the Los Angeles Angels in early September 1910, allowing seven hits {{in the first game}} and six in the second, the Los Angeles Times first referred to him as [...] "Mysterious Mitchell", reporting as follows:"The big feature of this first double-header was the work of the iron 'busher' who heaved in both games. In the first, of ten innings, he allowed but seven hits, and in the second, of seven innings, six swats were made off him. ... Hash Mitchell, the mystery that came from nowhere to pitch four straight victories for the Seals ... Every one watched Mitchell in the hope that they might guess who he is by looking at him, and while they were gazing they saw some real spit ball pitching that was remarkable for the amount of juice he used to deceive the local batsmen."The following week, the buzz surrounding [...] "Mysterious Mitchell" [...] continued to grow. Following a game in San Francisco, the press reported that Mitchell remained the focus of attention:"Mysterious Mitchell furnished the sensation at Recreation Park once more this afternoon when 8000 wildly excited fans upset baseball tradition. ... Until after the game the twirler created as much interest and excitement as the contest itself as there was still more to follow. He was the center of a throng as he left the stand and {{when he went to the}} offices of the baseball company, several hundred people gathered to look at him and call for a speech."On September 19, 1910, Chicago sporting writers identified Mysterious Mitchell based on a photograph published by the Los Angeles Times as Fred Walker, the former pitching star for the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago.</b> The <b>press</b> reported that Walker had signed earlier in the summer with the New York Giants but [...] "got into trouble with a chambermaid at a hotel where he stopped, who accused the young pitcher of attempted assault." [...] Following the accusation, Walker had disappeared leaving no trace until his photograph appeared in the Los Angeles Times. For the rest of his career in baseball, Walker was known as either [...] "Mysterious Walker" [...] and [...] "Mysterious Mitchell." ...|$|R
