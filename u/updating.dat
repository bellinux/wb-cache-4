5|$|Apple CEO John Sculley {{demands to}} know why the world {{believes}} he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on <b>updating</b> the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E
5|$|From May to late August 1996 {{the park}} was closed for a $700,000 {{refurbishment}} that included repairs and upgrades to filters and pumps, automated chlorination, restoration of cement, and <b>updating</b> of the lighting system. The fountain was also shut down in 1997 and 1998 for 10 months while the water bureau replaced a 1930s-era pump. The piping was also relined with cross-linked polyethylene {{in the spring of}} spring 2000, a costly operation due to the original piping being cast into the concrete.|$|E

5|$|The low {{turnout was}} {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in <b>updating</b> the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This allegation {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which would otherwise have exceeded 50%. It was later estimated that the actual turnout in Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.|$|E
5|$|Toyota's {{pattern of}} <b>updating</b> their Lexcen model tended to follow Commodore's model cycle. The T2 (VP) Lexcen from 1991 pioneered new {{specification}} designations: CSi, VXi and Newport. All future updates (T3 (VR), T4 (VS) and T5 (VS II) Lexcens) {{made use of}} the new naming system until 1997, when the badge engineering scheme ceased. To give further differentiation to the Lexcen from the Commodore, the Lexcens from the VP model onwards had unique front-end styling treatments.|$|E

40|$|Many {{software}} maintenance problems {{are caused by}} using text editors to change programs. A more systematic and reliable way of performing program <b>updates</b> is to express changes with an <b>update</b> language. In particular, <b>updates</b> should preserve the syntax- and type-correctness of the transformed object programs. We describe an <b>update</b> calculus {{that can be used}} to <b>update</b> lambda-calculus programs. We develop a type system for the <b>update</b> language that infers the possible type changes that can be caused by an <b>update</b> program. We demonstrate that type-safe <b>update</b> programs that fulfill certain structural constraints preserve the type-correctness of lambda terms. The <b>update</b> calculus can serve as a basis for higher-level <b>update</b> languages, such as for Haskell or Java. We briefly indicate a possible design of these <b>update</b> languages...|$|R

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for <b>updating</b> all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for <b>updating</b> all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|As well as Thunderhawks, Anderson {{developed}} {{other ideas}} for a remake. A 1976 concept, Inter-Galactic Rescue 4, {{was to have}} featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed <b>updating,</b> T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing {{to a lack of}} funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation. But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Bouyon (Boo-Yon) {{is a form}} {{of popular}} music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who {{originated}} the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, <b>updating</b> the sound for the New Generation.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012 Hewlett-Packard Co. v.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} problem of <b>update</b> {{translation}} for views on XML documents. More precisely, given an XML view definition and a user defined view <b>update</b> program, find a source <b>update</b> program that translates the view <b>update</b> without side effects on the view. Additionally, we require for the translation to be defined on all possible source documents; this corresponds to Hegner's notion of uniform translation. The existence of such translation would allow to <b>update</b> XML views without need of materialisation. The class of views we consider can remove parts of the document and rename nodes. Our <b>update</b> programs define the simultaneous application {{of a collection of}} atomic <b>update</b> operations among insertion/deletion of a subtree and node renaming. Such <b>update</b> programs are compatible with the XQuery <b>Update</b> Facility (XQUF) snapshot semantics. Both views and <b>update</b> programs are represented by recognizable tree languages. Two settings for the <b>update</b> problem are studied: without source constraints, where all source <b>updates</b> are allowed, and with source constraints, where there is a restricted set of authorized source <b>updates.</b> Using tree automata techniques, we establish that without constraints, all view <b>updates</b> are uniformly translatable and the translation is tractable. In presence of constraints, not all view <b>updates</b> are uniformly translatable. However, we introduce a reasonable restriction on <b>update</b> programs for which uniform translation with constraints becomes possible. Finally, we present as a proof of concept a small fragment of the XQUF that can be expressed by our <b>update</b> programs, thus allows for <b>update</b> propagation...|$|R
