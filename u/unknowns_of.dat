500|$|The {{initial mass}} of Betelgeuse {{can only be}} {{estimated}} by testing different stellar evolutionary models to match its current observed properties.

[...] The initial rotation rate is more uncertain, but models with slow to moderate initial rotation rates produce the best matches to Betelgeuse's current properties. That main sequence version of Betelgeuse would have been a hot luminous star with a spectral type such as O9V.|$|E

50|$|An {{indeterminate}} {{system is}} consistent, the latter implying that there exists {{at least one}} solution. For a system of linear equations, the number of equations in an indeterminate system could {{be the same as}} the number <b>of</b> <b>unknowns,</b> less than the number <b>of</b> <b>unknowns</b> (an underdetermined system), or greater than the number <b>of</b> <b>unknowns</b> (an overdetermined system).

2500|$|Analogies from physics (and biology) are conspicuous, {{such as the}} Le Chatelier {{principle}} and [...] correspondence principle, but they are given a nontrivially generalized formulation and application. [...] They and mathematical constructions, such as Lagrangian multipliers, are given an operational economic interpretation. [...] The generalized Le Chatelier principle is for a maximum condition of equilibrium: [...] where all <b>unknowns</b> <b>of</b> the function are independently variable, auxiliary constraints ("just-binding" [...] in leaving initial equilibrium unchanged) [...] reduce the response to a parameter change. [...] Thus, factor-demand and commodity-supply elasticities are hypothesized to be lower {{in the short run}} than in the long run because of the fixed-cost constraint in the short run. [...] In the course of analysis, [...] comparative statics, changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a parameter change of the system, is formalized and most clearly stated (Kehoe, 1987, p.517). [...] The correspondence principle is that the [...] stability of equilibrium for a system (such as a market or economy) implies meaningful theorems in comparative statics. [...] Alternatively, the hypothesis of stability imposes directional restrictions on the movement of the system (Samuelson, pp.258, 5). [...] The correspondence is between comparative statics and the dynamics implied by stability of equilibrium.|$|E
60|$|Not to talk, {{to remain}} impassive {{and as far}} as {{possible}} in profile; these were the lessons that old Dubois had mastered years ago. To seem to know all, to betray no surprise, to refuse to hurry--itself a confession of miscalculation; by attention to these simple rules, Dubois had built up a steady reputation from the days when he had been a promising junior officer, a still, almost abstracted young man, deliberate but ready. Even then men had looked at him and said: 'He will go far.' Through fifty years of peace he had never once been found wanting, and at manoeuvres his impassive persistence had perplexed and hypnotised and defeated many a more actively intelligent man. Deep in his soul Dubois had hidden his one profound discovery about the modern art of warfare, the key to his career. And this discovery was that NOBODY KNEW, that to act therefore was to blunder, that to talk was to confess; and that the man who acted slowly and steadfastly and above all silently, had the best chance of winning through. Meanwhile one fed the men. Now by this same strategy he hoped to shatter those mysterious <b>unknowns</b> <b>of</b> the Central European command. Delhi might talk of a great flank march through Holland, with all the British submarines and hydroplanes and torpedo craft pouring up the Rhine in support of it; Viard might crave for brilliance with the motor bicycles, aeroplanes, and ski-men among the Swiss mountains, and a sudden swoop upon Vienna; the thing was to listen--and wait for the other side to begin experimenting. It was all experimenting. And meanwhile he remained in profile, with an air of assurance--like a man who sits in an automobile after the chauffeur has had his directions.|$|E
