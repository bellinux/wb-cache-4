5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the <b>user</b> <b>manual</b> for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the <b>user</b> <b>manual</b> for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and variable-frequency drives.|$|E
500|$|At the 2006 Machinima Film Festival, Machinima.com founder Hugh Hancock and Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences founder Paul Marino cited Dance, Voldo, Dance {{as one of}} {{the first}} {{examples}} of machinima-based music videos. The book SwanQuake: The <b>User</b> <b>Manual</b> described it as a difficult form of machinima to characterize, describing it [...] "genre-bending work" [...] and having elements of puppetry, moviemaking, and choreography. Another book, The Machinima Reader, described it as [...] "an ingenious fight-as-dance choreography", citing the [...] "sexualized virtual identity" [...] of the character combined with the original soundtrack. In Developing Interactive Narrative Content, Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor Michael Nitsche compared the animation to virtual puppetry in that it was rooted solely on in-game animation, yet also used it as an example to illustrate that such material could be entertaining. In Medien Körper Imagination, the motions used in the video were described as both descriptive and often prescriptive, comparing it to time and motion studies.|$|E

500|$|Its sequel, Halo 2 was {{released}} on the Xbox on November 9, 2004, and later for Windows Vista on May 17, 2007. For the first time, the game {{was released}} in two different editions: a standard edition with just the game disc and traditional Xbox packaging; and the Collector's Edition with a specially designed aluminum case, along with an additional bonus DVD, extra booklet, and slightly different <b>user</b> <b>manual.</b> Halo 2 introduced new gameplay elements, chief among them the ability to hold and fire two weapons simultaneously, known as [...] "dual wielding". Unlike its predecessor, Halo 2 fully supported online multiplayer via Xbox Live. The game uses [...] "matchmaking" [...] to facilitate joining online matches by grouping players looking for certain types of games. This was a change from the more traditional [...] "server list" [...] approach, which was used to find matches in online games at this time. Upon release, Halo 2 became the game played by the most people on the Xbox Live service that week; it retained this title for over two years– the longest streak any game has held the spot.|$|E

Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images, but when put together they make a complete image. The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the alpha channel (or layer mask). This channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible, partially visible or invisible. Each layer has a layer mode that can be set to change the colors in the image.|$|E
