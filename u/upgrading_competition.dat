40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} shows that R&D spending is highly correlated with firm productivity, highly concentrated among large firms, and responsive to trade liberalization. This paper develops a model of product upgrading with heterogeneous firms that captures these characteristics by allowing firms to choose their optimal level of fixed cost spending from a continuum. The endogenous component of fixed costs is assumed to represent R&D or product development that is spent once but reaps demand benefits over all the markets the firm serves. This mechanism encourages firms to export and capture economies of scale in fixed cost spending. The model makes two new predictions. The first prediction is that exporters upgrade while domestic firms cut costs when trade liberalizes. The second prediction is that the selection effect of trade liberalization is weaker in industries characterized by intense <b>upgrading</b> <b>competition</b> between firms.

The analysis of competing firms, thus, {{has to go}} beyond the limits of each firm to incorporate the analysis of the entire chain(s) in which the firms participate. An approach is lacking to integrate the relations between strategy and structural issues, such as regulations, demand trends and concentration of clients/suppliers, and economic performance in terms of the contribution to local development. The general objective of this research was to make ex-post and ex-ante assessments of strategies for honey value chains in Brazil. The honey chain was chosen because of the importance of honey production and trade to Brazil, which was among the top ten world honey exporters in terms of volume. This thesis extended the Structure-Conduct-Performance (SCP) framework to value chains, identifying categories of structure, conduct and performance for value chain streams (segment of a value chain in a territory) and providing an integrated approach to explore possible interactions among those categories. The empirical applications of this research used this value chain SCP framework and focused on three honey value chain streams, located in the northeast of Brazil, all in top producing areas: two in Ceará State (Limoeiro do Norte and Santana do Cariri) and one in Piauí State (Picos). First, likely successful strategies of those value chain streams to their performance were identified for the 2007 - 2011 period, in a multi-case study. Then, the contributions of individual strategies of those streams to their performance were quantitatively assessed, also for the 2007 - 2011 period, using conjoint analysis. Finally, using adaptive conjoint analysis, promising strategies in terms of their contribution to chain competitiveness and local development were identified, under different scenarios. The results of this thesis reveal that the value chain SCP framework allows for ex-ante and ex-post integrated assessments of strategies for a segment of a value chain in a territory. The results also show that the relative importance of strategies to enhance performance of the studied honey value chain streams in Brazil depends on industry structure and varies among performance goals. In addition, the alignment of the value chain stream strategies towards a certain performance goal improves the likelihood of success of the implementation task. Moreover, the most commonly applied upgrading typologies do not cover all the strategy choices to value chain streams.  ...|$|E

40|$|We use Belgian {{firm level}} data {{over the period}} 1996 - 2007 to analyze the impact of imports from China and other low wage {{countries}} on firm growth, exit, and skill upgrading. We distinguish the impact of imports into two different channels: industry-level import competition and firm-level outsourcing. We find that imports from China are {{much more important than}} imports from other low-wage countries. Industry-level import competition from China reduced firm employment and induced skill <b>upgrading.</b> Import <b>competition</b> from China alone can explain around 30 percent of the total skill upgrading in Belgian manufacturing during 1996 - 2007.

50|$|Of the CAA schools {{involved}} in this phase of realignment, the first to announce its departure was VCU, doing so on May 15. While it had initially planned to join the A10 for the 2013-14 school year, it ended up joining for the 2012-13 school year. One reason for the immediate move was that under CAA bylaws, a school that announces its departure becomes immediately ineligible for conference championships in team sports—most significantly the men's basketball tournament. VCU's move to the A10 was also a substantial <b>upgrade</b> in basketball <b>competition.</b> The CAA had never received an at-large bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament until George Mason made the 2006 tournament and went on a surprise Final Four run. Only three other CAA teams received at-large bids from 2007 to 2012, {{with one of them}} being the 2011 VCU team that made its own surprise Final Four run. By comparison, the A10 had received 20 at-large bids from 2000 to 2012. The move also united VCU with cross-city rival Richmond.|$|R
40|$|Discussions of {{economic}} reform focus on two strategies for tempering corporate excess and mobilizing corporations for growth and prosperity: restructuring markets via competition policies and various forms of countervailing power. Populists, Progressives, and New Dealers looked to antitrust, regulatory states, and unions as counterweights to corporations. Contemporary efforts look to not-for-profit watchdogs, NGO certification and standard setting, privatization, and corporate governance reform to upgrade markets and deflect corporations from low road paths. This essay recovers a third strategy for regulating and reforming corporate capitalism: promoting organizational diversity via the formation of parallel systems of cooperative, mutual and local, state-owned enterprises. During the “era of corporate consolidation,” producer and consumer groups in the US formed {{tens of thousands of}} such enterprises in just in agriculture, but also in banking, insurance, and technologically advanced industries like electricity and telephones. These efforts produced enduring systems of cooperatives and kindred enterprise in the American economy, creating alternatives to corporations and organizational legacies for present day problem solving. They provided regulators and policy makers with new options and capacities for state intervention. And they demonstrated possibilities for using mixed organizational systems to discipline firms, create and <b>upgrade</b> markets, foster <b>competition,</b> and otherwise solve vexing problems {{of economic}} development...|$|R
50|$|When the NIMT {{opened in}} 1908 between Auckland and Wellington, New Plymouth {{passenger}} traffic dropped.

In 1925 opening of the railway to Whangarei cut passenger traffic and required reductions of fares and freight rates. and the Onerahi passenger service ended on 24 September 1926. The completion of the railway to Tauranga in 1927 brought about an end to trains connecting with the steamer, complaints of undercutting {{and an end to}} the passenger service on 2 April 1929. The Onehunga-New Plymouth passenger service closed on 3 May 1930, a few years after a bus service had started on the <b>upgraded</b> SH3. Rail <b>competition</b> was also cited as the reason to end the passenger service to Russell in 1931. In 1932 dairy company shareholders at Whakatane responded to a threat to close the railway by instructing the company to transfer its freight from NSS to the railway. The 70 mi Auckland-Paeroa passenger service lasted until 1937. In 1937 passenger services still ran to Algies, Coromandel, Great Barrier, Matakana , Mahurangi, One Tree Point, Waiheke, Warkworth and Whangarei. In 1938 SS Kawau was advertised as running summer weekend excusions to Waiheke. By 1939 the only remaining passenger steamer was Hauiti.|$|R
30|$|It takes not {{overnight}} but a {{long time}} to transform and upgrade China’s manufacturing industry. What Chinese manufacturing sector needs to do now is to overcome the problems and gradually move towards industrial 4.0. China’s intelligent industry is a long and arduous task which needs the various participations. China’s manufacturing sector can build the platform consist of government, industry, university, research unit, and customer to promote technological innovation in an all-round way. The industry 4.0 era will make the relationship between countries and the world becoming more and more closely linked, and their inter-dependence is strengthening. Therefore, it is important to establish the manufacturing technological standards in line with the world’s standards. In industry 4.0 era, the requirement for the network is higher. So, China must build network infrastructure to meet the requirement. To achieve the industrial transformation and upgrading is a huge systematic project. So, it is necessary to set up major intelligent projects and carry out pilot work which can lay a good foundation for the industrial transformation and <b>upgrading.</b> Ultimately, all <b>competition</b> depends on the talent competition, so talent in manufacturing industry occupies an important position absolutely. China’s manufacturing sector must build the Personnel-Training system to cultivate intelligences who meet the needs of industry 4.0. Only in the above discussed way can China occupy a place in the world manufacturing industry and achieve from big manufacturing country to powerful one.|$|R
3000|$|The State Council {{released}} its “Circular of Opinions on Accelerating Mergers and Restructuring of Coal Mines” 12 in 2010, requesting nationwide rectification {{of the coal}} mining industry. The guiding principle of rectification as provided in this document is to “make full use of the market mechanism and facilitate it with state policies … combine enforcement in accordance with laws and regulations with institutional and mechanism innovations, {{reduce the number of}} coal mines while protecting the lawful rights of workers and investors.” The central objectives are to combine the market mechanism and state intervention to eliminate inefficient coal mines through selection or <b>competition,</b> <b>upgrade</b> the industrial structure, and protect the rights of investors and workers. S Province did not take the implementation of this state policy very seriously and only created its rules of implementation in early 2013. The provincial rules abide by the guiding principle of the State Council by stating that it is to “make full use of the market mechanism and facilitate it with state policies, combine centralized planning with adaption to local conditions and classified management, combine enforcement in accordance with laws and regulations with institutional and mechanism innovations, reduce the number of coal mines while protecting the lawful rights of workers and investors,” 13 and specify that coal mines that do not have legal mining licenses and do not meet safety-in-production criteria, coal resources-exhausted mines, and mines of which the annual production output is below 30, 000  t have to be shut down and rectified. This document also required counties specializing in the coal mining industry to create their work plans before June 2013, make initial efforts to shut down coal mines that did not have legal mining licenses and did not meet safety-in-production criteria, and complete the merger and restructuring of all coal mines by June 2015. It was repeated again and again that the interests of various stakeholders should be protected: “all localities and all departments should attach great importance to the employment of workers, carefully handle the transfers and changes of labor relations of workers … carefully solve the problems of continuing workers’ labor relations and social insurance and unpaid wages and social insurance premiums in order to protect workers’ lawful rights … and cope with problems in debts and liabilities, specify the duties of repayment of debts, and protect the lawful rights of creditors and investors.” [...]...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{consists}} of an introduction followed by three independent chapters. Each chapter is a self-contained paper that can be read independently. They cover different topics of international economics with a specific focus on multinational production and international trade. A common feature to all the papers {{is that they are}} micro-based empirical analyses of the effects of globalization on the competitiveness of companies. The first and last chapters are solo papers, while the second is coauthored with Friedrich Bermann, PhD student at Copenhagen Business School. The first paper studies the impact of foreign direct investment on the intensity of competition in the host economy. In this chapter I use firm-level data of Romanian manufacturing companies active between 2001 and 2008 and I measure the impact of foreign ownership on the market power of affiliates and local competitors. The empirical evidence shows that foreign ownership is associated to a higher market power, which I proxy with firms’ estimated markups. Moreover, I find that higher competition of foreign affiliates is associated to a decrease in the markups charged by domestic firms. In the second chapter we analyze how the strategy of vertical integration of foreign multinationals modifies the nature of productivity spillovers perceived by local suppliers (i. e. backward spillovers). Building on the results of previous research on productivity spillovers and on multinational production, we argue that backward productivity spillovers should be weaker if foreign multinationals are vertically integrated in the industry of local suppliers. We test this hypothesis using a panel dataset of firm-level data of European manufacturing companies. We find that the vertical integration of foreign multinationals does in fact modify the intensity of spillovers to local suppliers. Domestic firms benefit only from the activity of foreign clients that are not vertically integrated in their industry. In the last chapter, I use a detailed dataset of international transactions of Danish companies to study the impact of Chinese competition on the pricing strategy of Danish exporters. I also explore the role of quality differentiation in determining the nature and intensity of this effect. I find that Chinese export represents a source of stiffer competitive pressure for Danish exporters that are forced to reduce the prices they charge. This effect depends on the quality of Danish products. I find the producers of low-quality goods reduce their prices less intensively than producers of high-quality ones. This is because producers of low-quality varieties react to Chinese <b>competition</b> <b>upgrading</b> the quality of their products. This mitigates the downward pressure on prices. I finally reconcile these results by using quality-adjusted prices. Using this measure I find that quality does in fact protect Danish exporters from the pressure of Chinese competition...|$|R
