Prior studies mainly examined motivational factors influencing <b>user</b> <b>contributions.</b> In the current study, we examine effects of interface layouts on <b>user</b> <b>contributions,</b> {{from the perspective of}} attention allocation. We also distinguish between the two types of user contributions: creating original sharing and appreciating others' sharing. Since attention is a limited resource, we argue that interface layouts may lead to attention trade-off between the two types of <b>user</b> <b>contributions.</b> Leveraging an opportunity of a popular social commerce site's transformation to Pinterest-style infinite scrolling layouts, we collected panel data. Empirical findings show that the new layouts design has opposite effects on the two types of user contribution: a positive effect on users' appreciation of others' sharing, but a negative effect on users' original sharing. Some user characteristics moderate the effects. The findings yield important implications for research and websites design practice. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved...|$|R

The community includes a group of volunteer designers who submit designs and vote on the designs of others. In addition to free exposure, designers are provided monetary incentives including a $2,500 base award as well as a percentage of T-shirt sales.

Lessigs favorite example is Wikipedia itself. The top ten most visited website relies on <b>user</b> <b>contribution</b> - from creation to editing - for its content and gives no monetary incentive for this contribution. While providing the option of anonymity, the users of Wikipedia have been remarkably consistent with the sites suggestions - be it regarding consistent aesthetic or neutral point of view.
