40|$|INTRODUCTION: The da Vinci Xi {{has been}} {{developed}} to overcome some {{of the limitations of}} the previous platform, thereby increasing the acceptance of its use in robotic multiorgan surgery. METHODS: Between January 2015 and October 2015, 10 patients with synchronous tumors of the colorectum and others abdominal organs underwent robotic combined resections with the da Vinci Xi. Trocar positions respected the <b>Universal</b> <b>Port</b> Placement Guidelines provided by Intuitive Surgical for "left lower quadrant," with trocars centered on the umbilical area, or shifted 2 to 3 cm to the right or to the left, {{depending on the type of}} combined surgical procedure. RESULTS: All procedures were completed with the full robotic technique. Simultaneous procedures in same quadrant or left quadrant and pelvis, or left/right and upper, were performed with a single docking/single targeting approach; in cases of left/right quadrant or right quadrant/pelvis, we performed a dual-targeting operation. No external collisions or problems related to trocar positions were noted. No patient experienced postoperative surgical complications and the mean hospital stay was 6 days.

40|$|Maritime {{shipping}} {{is considered}} the most efficient mode of transport in economic and environmental terms. However, its impacts on climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and on human health from air pollutants released near residential centres cannot be ignored. Over the last decades, regulatory bodies have been developing policies that seek to further improve the sector???s environmental performance {{and at the same}} time new technologies improve the efficiency of vessels. Operational practices of shipliners and port authority initiatives are also relieving the sector???s impacts. While there has been significant research on the environmental impacts of maritime transport, there has been relatively little work focusing on the effects of maritime activity in the proximity and at ports. This thesis presents a transferable framework that allows the estimation of emissions pollutant generation near the port focusing on CO 2, SO 2, NOx and BC emissions. The most relevant emissions reduction actions are considered and their effects on the environmental footprint of the port are modelled. The thesis emphasizes on the implementation of speed reduction programmes near the port, use of cold ironing at berth, and the effects of fuel quality regulation, considering the perspectives of the port authority, and the ship operator. The thesis considers the emerging environmental and economic trade-offs due to the different emissions reduction actions. A non-linear convex optimization model is formulated that minimizes fuel consumption in a sequence of port calls where in some areas speed limits or fuel regulations are in place. The results show that there is no <b>universal</b> <b>port</b> policy that can simultaneously minimize the environmental impact of all ships without economic or environmental penalties. This indicates that there is great scope of improvement in existing policies, and that regulators will need to decide what their priorities should be in improving the system. The achievements of this thesis can be beneficial to policy makers, port authorities, and shipping companies that wish to improve their environmental performance without sustaining environmental and economic penalties to do so.

40|$|PURPOSE The new da Vinci Xi® {{has been}} {{developed}} and released to overcome some {{of the limitations of}} the previous platform, therefore increasing the acceptance of its use in robotic multi-quadrant operations. The new characteristics could have an important role in colon-rectal surgery and particularly in attaining fully robotic colon-rectal resection combined with other major surgical procedures. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the pre-operative results of totally robotic colorectal surgery for cancer in association with other major procedures with Da Vinci Xi. METHODS We reviewed the charts of all patients undergoing fully robotic combination procedures involving colon-rectal resections using the Da Vinci Xi, from January 2015 to October 2015. Variables that were examined included patient demographic characteristics, pre-operative data such as trocar position, technical aspects, operative time and robot dock/undocking times. Postoperative variables included the length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. Ten patients were included in this study, including 12 colorectal procedures: 5 right hemi-colectomy and 5 anterior rectal resections with TME were performed in combination with sigmoidectomy (1), right nephrectomy (2), hysterectomy (1), hepatic resection (3), enucleation of pancreatic tail lesion (2) and ileo-cecal resection (1). RESULTS All the operations were completed by a fully robotic approach, without conversion to hand assisted laparoscopy or laparotomy, and without hybrid approaches or need of changing of robotic cart position. Trocar positions respected the <b>Universal</b> <b>Port</b> Placement Guidelines provided by Intuitive Surgical for “left lower quadrant”. Simultaneous procedures in the same quadrant or left quadrant and pelvis, or left/right and upper, were performed with a single docking/single targeting approach; in cases of left/right quadrant or right quadrant/pelvis, we performed a dual-docking operation where we re-targeted using the camera to orient the system towards the new work space (an opposite facing quadrant) and re-docked the remaining arms. No external collisions or problems related to trocar positions were noted. Mean overall procedural time was 360 min (± 128 min). No patient experienced postoperative surgical complications and the mean hospital stay was 6 days (± 3 days). DISCUSSION In our early experience we were able to complete all procedures with a full robotic approach, without the necessity to associated or convert to a laparoscopic approach. Thanks to the targeting function of the Da Vinci Xi, the robot re-targeting could be enough in combined surgical operation of the same hemi-abdomen. This procedure allows us to obtain a new improved alignment of robotic arms. Instead, in the case of left/right quadrant, it was necessary to re-target using the camera to orient the system towards the new work space (an opposite facing quadrant) with 180 °-boom rotation and then re-docked the remaining arms. However, this procedure is simple and not time consuming as it was only necessary to rotate the boom without changing cart’ position. These types of combined surgical procedures were not possible with the da Vinci Si. In fact with the previous system, it was mandatory to undock the robotic arms, disconnect and change the cart’ position in the opposite side of the operating table and finally re-docked the Da Vinci System. These maneuvers leads to both a substantial increase in operating time and difficulties in moving the bulky robotic cart. The limitations of Da Vinci Si were overcome by the new realized product Da Vinci Xi. We tried to suggest an initial proposal for standardized surgical procedures’, trying to define the best trocars’ position for combined surgical operations that would not requires an additional trocar position or problems with instruments collision. In our opinion the trocars’ position described in the this present experience allows us to perform operations in all abdominal quadrants without major movements thus only changing robotic arms’ position, rotating the boom or exploiting the targeting function. In fact, in all cases we were able to perform all surgical procedures without the need of additional robotic trocar, completing the surgical procedure with a full robotic approach and no robotic arms clashing or an excessive time needed for the re-docking was reported. CONCLUSIONS The herein presented high success rate of robotic colorectal resection combined with other surgical interventions for synchronous tumors, without conversion or excessive operating time, suggests the efficacy of the new released product Da Vinci Xi, in minimally invasive multi-quadrant combined surgery. A further possible advantage may be provided by da Vinci Xi Integrated Table Motion feature (available only in the EU), that allows patients to be repositioned without undocking the robot and without removing instruments inside the abdomen...|$|E

The authors report four clinical cases of congenital lobar emphysema in the newborn. Clinical cases: Four term newborns, 3 M/ 1 F, were admitted for respiratory distress starting between 20 hours of life and 18 days. The chest x-ray at admission was suggestive of CLE and the diagnosis was confirmed by computorized tomography. The CLE affected the right upper lobe in three cases and the medium lobe in one case. All patients were treated with lobectomy. The pathological study of the surgical specimens confirmed the diagnosis in the four cases, and revealed hypoplasia of the bronquiolar tree cartilage in three.

40|$|This thesis {{will present}} {{concepts}} of modular space systems, including definitions and specific {{examples of how}} modularity has been incorporated into past and present space missions. In addition, it will present two architectures that utilize modularity in more detail to serve as examples of possible applications. The first example is a fully modular spacecraft design, which has standardized and reconfigurable components with multiple decoupled subsystems. This concept was developed into a testbed called Self-assembling Wireless Autonomous and Reconfigurable Modules (SWARM). This project sought to demonstrate the use of modular spacecraft in a laboratory environment, and to investigate the "cost," or penalty, of modularity. The second example investigates the on-orbit assembly of a segmented primary mirror, {{which is part of}} a large space-based telescope. The objective is to compare two methods for assembling the mirror. The first method uses a propellant-based spacecraft to move the segments from a central stowage stack to the mirror assembly. The second is an electromagnetic-based method that uses superconducting electromagnetic coils as a means of applying force and torque between two assembling vehicles to produce the same results as the propellant-based system. (cont.) Fully modular systems could have the ability to autonomously assemble and reconfigure in space. This ability will certainly involve very complex rendezvous and docking maneuvers that will require advanced docking ports and sensors. To this end, this thesis investigates the history of docking ports, and presents a comprehensive list of functional requirements. It then describes the design and implementation of the <b>Universal</b> Docking <b>Port</b> (UDP). Lastly, it explores the development of an optical docking sensor called the Miniature Video Docking Sensor (MVDS), which uses a set of infrared LED's, a miniature CCD-based video camera, and an Extended Kalman Filter to determine the six relative degrees of freedom of two docking vehicles. It uses the Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) to demonstrate this fully integrated docking system. by Lennon Patrick Rodgers. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Space {{systems are}} {{inherently}} difficult to verify prior to launch {{due to the}} challenges of replicating the space environment through ground testing. The SPHERES testbed on the International Space Station has provided a risk-tolerant test facility for evaluating enabling technology. The operational execution of the SPHERES facility has resulted in the development of best practices for working with experiments in the operational space environment that can be continually refined through successive generations of SPHERES projects. This thesis presents an experiment framework for developing space technology using the International Space Station that focuses on incrementally building toward technology demonstration through the achievement of specific results at each step that are designed to enable an effective demonstration. The operational nature of the ISS constrains both the time available for testing and the control that the scientist can exercise over the experiment. Therefore, this framework addresses the need to design experiment campaigns that can eciently achieve the desired results using data gathered from tests that exhibit unexpected behavior in addition to the tests that exhibit expected behavior. The framework is inspired by the lessons learned from the RINGS project, an attachment to the SPHERES facility that tests Electromagnetic Formation Flight using electromagnetic coils attached to the vehicle. The RINGS experiment campaign is reviewed with a focus on the lessons learned from the operational phase of the project. From these lessons, the experiment framework is developed and presented so that researchers can have a guide in the planning and designing of their experiments for use on remote, operational facilities. The framework is then applied to the next-generation SPHERES project, the <b>Universal</b> Docking <b>Port,</b> as well as the RINGS project, in order provide examples of how this framework can be implemented. by Andrew Robert Hilton.

The existing EMU PLSS data down-link capability during EVA is one data packet every 2 minutes and is subject to bad packets or loss of signal. High-rate PLSS data is generated by the ECWS (Enhanced Caution and Warning System) but is not normally captured or distributed. Access to high-rate data will increase the capability of EMU anomaly resolution team to pinpoint issues remotely, saving crew time by reducing required call-down Q&A and on-orbit diagnostic activities. With no Shuttle flights post FY 11, and potentially limited down-mass capability, the ISS crew and ground support personnel {{will have to be}} capable of on-orbit operations to maintain, diagnose, repair, and return to service EMU hardware, possibly through 2028.

40|$|Jarle Kotsbak started {{started the}} company Kotsbak Consulting to test an idea he had of {{a method of}} {{sequencing}} DNA material, that is reading {{the contents of the}} string of genes in a DNA. The method is supposed to be much faster and cheaper than the methods that exist today. For the analysis equipment {{there are a lot of}} parts that need to be developed, and the most important ones in the first phases of experimentation is given as problems for this thesis. The analysis is going to take place in a relatively small reaction chamber where chemicals need to be automatically added and heated to the correct temperature. Then a high resolution image is going to be captured using a small image chip similar to those found inside digital cameras. As these have varying real time requirements, it is not possible to control from a ordinary PC. A microcontroller is needed to do the low level controls. Control of the experiments should be possible to set up from a PC connected to the equipment using a USB (<b>Universal</b> Serial <b>Port)</b> 2. 0 port, which is also going to transfer the images captured to the PC for image and data analysis. Atmel AVR 32 microcontroller was suggested for use, and it was not found that any of the requirements was not in theory possible to solve using this microcontroller, so it was the one used in all parts. It was evaluated if it was best to program the microcontroller directly without an operating system, but it was found that using Linux, which the evaluation boards of the microcontroller was shipped with, had so many advantages over the small and uncertain advantages of programming the microcontroller directly. so Linux was used in all parts. As most of the needed drivers for Linux were new or unreleased, a lot of time was spent learning how to compile the Linux kernel with those patches and finding out how to use the undocumented parts of the drivers, as well as extending the drivers to support the hardware and specification needed. The heating controller worked quite well after getting the connection to the sensors working, including estimation of the temperature inside the reaction chamber, which is the temperature that is going to be controlled, but can not be measured directly. If needed it is possible to tune the controller better for stricter requirements or change to a model based controller if needed and the parameters in the model can be found, which turned out to be hard. A nice solution to the flow control was found using a stepping motor that is able to push the piston in a syringe containing one of the chemical mixes in exact amounts, controlled by an external stepping motor driver chip, which was easy to get working, connected using I 2 C. The solution was at least as good and much easier to implement than the one suggested in the assignment, using valves and pressure measurements to estimate the amount flowing. It was shown that image capture of the required resolution, i. e. 2048 x 1536 and possibility for much higher, was possible using Linux and the hardware support for transferring images from image chips in the AVR 32 microcontroller using kernel modules. The problem is that it was only working sometimes, so a little more debugging of the possible hardware/ software reason for this to be resolved, but it seems like it is only a small problem and not caused by any limitation in software or hardware. It was attempted to get the USB part working without running an O/S on the microcontroller, but it did not succeed, partly because of incomplete documentation of the USB hardware module in the AVR 32. Then the available driver systems for USB slave equipment under Linux was studied and it was found that gadgetfs seemed most promising to use. The driver did though first not load, just giving a stacktrace. In a newer version of the Linux version for the development board, it did though load and it seemed like it was working. Further development of this part was not done because of much delay in the other parts, and the fact that choosing Linux as platform, as well as the image being buffered in RAM, allows to use ethernet to transport the images during testing until later product development stages. Overall most of the parts have been accomplished according to the specifications, although there was not too detailed practical testing of each part because of much time spent on solving problems, and the fact that many complex parts were outlined to be solved during the project. Solving the small problems left as described at the corresponding discussion chapters should, with small modifications/customization, make the practical solutions found usable for future prototypes of the product or for more experiments. </p...|$|R
