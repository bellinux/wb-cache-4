40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} testing {{hypotheses}} about {{the parameters of}} the Wiener process with a constant drift rate and instantaneous variance. The tests are based on the first time, when the process reaches a pre-specified boundary point. We consider a process with a non-negative drift rate, and we observe hitting a positive point. We focus on tests about the drift rate, in particular about the absence of any drift. We first study several basic properties of the Wiener process and its connection with the Wiener process with a drift. Using these, we derive distributional properties of the first hitting time. We also describe selected hypotheses testing techniques in the setting of exponential families. We construct <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> unbiased <b>tests</b> of one parameter {{in the presence of a}} nuisance parameter. Further, we construct <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>tests</b> of hypotheses about the drift rate, while the variance is known, and we study this situation in more detail.

An invariance condition is used to eliminate the target location parameter, and a <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>test</b> developed for the reduced data.

40|$|Lehmann and Sheffe (1955) derived a <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>test</b> for an {{exponential}} family distribution. This {{assumption of}} exponentiality, however, {{is not always}} satisfied. For example, Poisson distribution has been frequently used to analyze discrete data. It assumes that its mean is equal to its variance, but data often suggest that the variance {{is larger than the}} mean. To explain this overdispersion, a parameter is considered random so that the distribution belongs to a conditionally exponential family distribution (Lawless (1987 a), Lawless (1987 b), Thall (1988), Dean and Lawless (1989)).

50|$|The frequentist {{procedures}} of significance testing and confidence intervals {{can be constructed}} without regard to utility functions. However, some elements of frequentist statistics, such as statistical decision theory, do incorporate utility functions. In particular, frequentist developments of optimal inference (such as minimum-variance unbiased estimators, or <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>testing)</b> make use of loss functions, which {{play the role of}} (negative) utility functions. Loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property. However, loss-functions are often useful for stating optimality properties: for example, median-unbiased estimators are optimal under absolute value loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss, and least squares estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss.|$|R
40|$|Similarity {{of a test}} {{is often}} a {{necessary}} condition for a test to be unbiased (in particular for a <b>test</b> to be <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> unbiased when such a test exists). Lehmann (Testing Statistical Hypotheses, 2 nd Edition, Wiley, New York, 1986) describes the connection between similar <b>tests</b> and <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> unbiased <b>tests.</b> The methods to achieve these properties as outlined in Lehmann are used extensively. In any case, an admissible similar test is frequently one that can be recommended for practical use. In some constrained parameter spaces however, we show that admissible similar tests sometimes completely ignore the constraints. In some of these cases we call such tests constraint insensitive. The tests seem not to be intuitive and perhaps should not be used. On the other hand, there are models with constrained parameter spaces where similar tests do take into account the constraints. In these cases the admissible test is called constraint sensitive. We offer a systematic approach that enables one to determine whether an admissible similar test is constraint insensitive or not. The approach is applied to three classes of models involving order restricted parameters. The models include testing for homogeneity of parameters, testing subsets of parameters, and testing goodness of fit of a family of discrete distributions.
