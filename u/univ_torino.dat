40|$|The q-deformation of {{harmonic}} oscillators {{is shown}} to lead to q-nonlinear vibrations. The examples of q-nonlinearized wave equation and Schrödinger equation are considered. The procedure is generalized to broader class of nonlinearities related to other types of deformations.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we analyze a {{quadrature}} rule based on integrating a C 3 quartic spline quasi-interpolant on a bounded interval {{which has been}} introduced in Sablonnière (Rend. Semin. Mat. <b>Univ.</b> Pol. <b>Torino</b> 63 (3) : 107 - 118, 2005). By studying the sign structure of its associated Peano kernel we derive an explicit formula of the quadrature error with an approximation order O(h 6). A comparison of this rule with the composite Boole's and the three-point Gauss-Legendre rules is given. We also compare the Nyström methods associated with the above quadrature formulae for solving the linear Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Then, by combining the proposed rule with composite Boole's rule, we construct a new quadrature rule of order O(h 7). All the obtained results are illustrated by several numerical tests...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAbstractCOTIC 98 was {{the second}} {{workshop}} organized {{in the context of}} the ESPRIT Working Group COTIC. The previous one, COTIC 97, was held at RISC in October 1997. These workshops aim at stimulating research on timed extensions of (concurrent) constraint programming and more generally timed declarative languages. Additionally, they seek to investigate possible uses of concurrent logic and constraint programming languages in representing the reasoning and communication capabilities of intelligent agents. The programme of COTIC 98 included eight presentations selected by a programme committee consisting of: F. S. de Boer (co-chair, Univ. Utrecht), P. Bonatti (<b>Univ.</b> <b>Torino),</b> M. Gabbrielli (co-chair, Univ. Pisa), A. Maggiolo-Schettini (Univ. Pisa), J. Maluszynski (Univ. Linkoeping), J. -J. Meyer (Univ. Utrecht), L. Monteiro (Univ. Lisboa) and V. S. Subrahmanian (Univ. Maryland). Out of the eight presented papers four were selected for inclusion in this volume. Further information on the workshop can be found at the COTIC 98 web page. We would like to thank the authors of the submitted papers and the members of the program committee for their contribution to the meeting. We also would like to thank Michael Mislove for his help with the editing of the proceedings. November 1998, F. S. de Boer and M. Gabbriell...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionBohm's theorem: {{applications}} to Computer Science Theory - BOTH 2001 This {{part of the}} volume contains the Proceedings of the ICALP 2001 Satellite Workshop on Bohm's theorem: {{applications to}} Computer Science Theory (BOTH 2001), held in the Aldemar Knossos Royal Village Hotel, Hersonissos, Crete, Greece on 13 July 2001. Bohm's theorem {{is central to the}} study of the untyped lambda calculus. It shows that disctinct normal forms, up to eta conversion, cannot be identified in any consistent model of the lambda calculus. This first separability result has been generalised to non normal forms and is the underlying concept for the introduction of finite or infinite trees of head normal forms, also known as Bohm trees. In the semantics of programming languages, Bohm's theorem corresponds to the notion of full abstraction in models, and gave the initial hints towards the construction of models for sequential languages; in the theory of concurrency, it is the notion of observability and is used for building bisimulations; in the semantics of security, it gives a strong meaning to the notion of safe computations. Thirty years later, on the occasion of Corrado Bohm's EATCS Distinguished Service Award, this workshop attempted to provide a synthetic view as well as the most recent results on Bohm trees, sequentiality and game semantics, logic, security, fully abstract translations, action calculi, abstract rewriting systems, based on the seminal work of Bohm. BOTH 2001 was one of the four satellite workshops of the 28 th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP 2001), held in Crete, Greece, July 8 - 12, 2001. The proceedings appear as Volume 50 No. 2 in the series Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS). The volumes in the ENTCS series can be accessed at the URL [URL] Program Committee selected five contributions by researchers from several different countries: France, Italy, Japan, Yugoslavia. Selected contributions are connected to Bohm's theorem or Bohm's research. The program included also two invited talks by Henk Barendregt (Univ. of Nijmegen) and Mariangiola Dezani (<b>Univ.</b> di <b>Torino).</b> Pierre-Louis Curien also offered to give a talk on Separation in Girard's Ludical framework. The program committee of BOTH 2001 consisted of the following people: 				•Pierre-Louis Curien (CNRS, Univ. of Paris 7) •Gérard Huet (INRIA, France) •Jan-Willem Klop (Free University, Amsterdam) •Jean-Jacques Lévy (INRIA, France) •Harry Mairson (Boston University) •Gordon Plotkin (Univ. of Edinburgh) •Simona Ronchi (<b>Univ.</b> of <b>Torino)</b> We would like to thank Christos Zaroliagis (ICALP 2001 Satellite Workshops Coordinator) for his continuous support.

40|$|We {{have found}} an {{inconsistency}} {{in our previous}} version of the paper "Generalized splines in R^n and optimal control". We give a new-time-dependent definition of spline curves in R^n which results from solving a non-autonomous linear quadratic optimal control problem (P) where the matrix B(t) {{is assumed to be}} rectangular with maximum rank. Nevertheless, our results are only valid if B(t) is a square (nonsingular) matrix. This was pointed out to us by Andrey Sarychev. We have proceeded with the necessary corrections. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% We give a new time-dependent definition of spline curves in R^n, which extends a recent definition of vector-valued splines introduced by Rodrigues and Silva Leite for the time-independent case. Previous results are based on a variational approach, with lengthy arguments, which do not cover the non-autonomous situation. We show that the previous results are a consequence of the Pontryagin maximum principle, and are easily generalized using the methods of optimal control. Main result asserts that vector-valued splines are related to the Pontryagin extremals of a non-autonomous linear-quadratic optimal control problem.
