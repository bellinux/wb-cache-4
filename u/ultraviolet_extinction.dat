40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in the Astrophysical Journal; Fixed radio flux density units (mJy) The ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions are presented for all 75 galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). A principal component analysis of the sample shows {{that most of the}} sample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, one representative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and one representative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. The influence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied (e. g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultraviolet spectral slope, and star formation history). Consistent with our understanding of normal star-forming galaxies, the SINGS sample of galaxies in comparison to more actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in the infrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. Early type galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surface brightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation. These results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominant regulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. Finally, a new discovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool for parametrizing the global dust temperature and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>extinction</b> in nearby galaxies. The dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warm accompanied by low <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>extinction,</b> while in spiral galaxies there is typically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and average <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>extinction.</b> For galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dust temperature and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>extinction</b> are relatively high compared to disk galaxies...|$|E

Between 1250 and 3200 A, {{in addition to the}} well-known 2175 A bump, there is only one fairly small (10 %) absorption feature at 2700 A. The feature is very broad (> 400 A). It coincides extremely well in position and shape with laboratory measurements of presolar diamond grains found in meteorites. As this feature appears in both the new STIS and archival IUE data, it is unlikely to be an instrumental effect. This feature appears to be ubiquitous in the ISM as it is seen along sightlines toward various clouds with reddenings in the range of E(B-V) = 0. 35 to 1. 73 mag. The identification with diamonds remains tentative since it is based on a single, weak feature.

40|$|The circumstellar {{grains of}} two hot evolved post {{asymptotic}} giant branch (post AGB) stars, HD 89353 and HD 213985 were examined. From ultraviolet spectra, energy {{balance of the}} flux, and Kurucz models, the extinction around 2175 A was derived. With visual spectra, {{an attempt was made}} to detect 6614 A diffuse band absorption arising from the circumstellar grains so that we could examine the relationship of these features to the infrared features. For both stars, we did not detect any diffuse band absorption at 6614 A, implying the carrier of this diffuse band is not the carrier of the unidentified infrared features not of the 2175 A bump. The linear <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>extinction</b> of the carbon-rich star HD 89353 was determined to continue across the 2175 A region with no sign of the bump; for HD 213985 it was found to be the reverse: a strong, wide bump in the mid-ultraviolet. The 213985 bump was found to be positioned at 2340 A, longward of its usual position in the interstellar medium. Since HD 213985 was determined to have excess carbon, the bump probably arises from a carbonaceous grain.

PAHs are of importance because of their ubiquity and high abundance inferred from the infrared data, and also because they may link the molecular and dust phases of the interstellar medium. A presence or absence of UV absorption bands due to PAHs could be a definitive test of this hypothesis. We should be able to detect a 20 A ̊ wide feature down to a 3 limit of 0. 02 AV.

Longward of 2830 A the curve is almost coincident with the mean Galactic curve. The 2175 A feature is narrower than the average.

Both quantum-chemical computations and laboratory experiments have shown that the exciton-dominated electronic transitions in graphene cause a strong absorption band near 2755 Angstrom.

We derive [C/H]_dust from the Kramers-Kronig relation which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to the total dust volume. This approach is less model-dependent since it does not require the knowledge of the detailed optical properties and size distribution of the dust. We also derive [C/H]_dust from fitting the observed UV/optical/near-infrared extinction with a mixture of amorphous silicate and graphite. We find that the carbon depletion [C/H]_dust tends to correlate with the strength of the 2175 Angstrom bump, while the abundance of silicon depleted in dust shows no correlation with the 2175 Angstrom bump. This supports graphite or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules as the possible carrier of the 2175 Angstrom bump. We also see that [C/H]_dust shows a trend of correlating with 1 /R_V, where R_V is the total-to-selective extinction ratio, suggesting that the far-UV extinction is more likely produced by small carbon dust than by small silicate dust.

Taking advantage of the high angular resolution of the HST WFC 3 and ACS detectors, we develop a method to simultaneously determine the relative extinction and the fraction of obscured starlight for five dusty complexes located in the circumnuclear region. The extinction curves of these clumps (RV = 2. 4 - 2. 5) are steeper than the average Galactic one (RV = 3. 1), but are similar to optical and near-infrared curves recently measured toward the Galactic Bulge (RV 2. 5). This similarity suggests that steep extinction curves may be common in the inner bulge of galaxies. In the <b>ultraviolet,</b> the <b>extinction</b> curves of these clumps are also unusual.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} that the UV dust extinction in starburst galaxies {{is similar to}} that found in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) motivated us to re-investigate the <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>extinction</b> found in the SMC. We have been able to improve significantly on previous studies by carefully choosing pairs of well matched reddened and unreddened stars. In addition, we benefited from the improved S/N of the NEWSIPS IUE data and the larger sample of SMC stars now available. Searching the IUE Final Archive, we found only four suitable early-type stars that were significantly reddened and had well matched comparison stars. The extinction for three of these stars is remarkably similar. The curves are roughly linear with 1 /lambda and have no measurable 2175 A bump. The fourth star has an extinction curve with a significant 2175 A bump and weaker far-UV extinction. The dust along all four sightlines is thought to be local to the SMC. There is no significant Galactic foreground component. The first three stars lie in the SMC Bar and the line-of-sight for each of them passes through regions of recent star formation. The fourth star belongs to the SMC Wing and its line-of-sight passes though a much more quiescent region. Thus, the behavior of the dust extinction in the SMC supports a dependence of dust properties on star formation activity. However, other environmental factors (such as galactic metallicity) must also be important. Dust in the 30 Dor region of the LMC, where much more active star formation is present, does not share the extreme extinction properties seen in SMC dust.
