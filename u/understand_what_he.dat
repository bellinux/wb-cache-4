5|$|Angie (Drea de Matteo) {{takes an}} instant dislike {{to her son}} Danny's (Beau Mirchoff) new girlfriend, Ana (Maiara Walsh), who she fears is too fun-loving and not serious enough. However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine and say they will try to forgive her.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, {{it is helpful to}} <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.|$|E
25|$|If a firstborn {{attending}} a siyum does {{not hear the}} completion of the tractate, or if he does not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> hears, or if he is in the shiva period of mourning and is thus forbidden from listening to the Torah material being taught, some authorities rule that subsequent eating would not qualify as a seudat mitzvah and he would therefore be forbidden to break his fast (Ben Ish Chai 1:96:25; Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Elyashiv, Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, p.168; Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Chazon Ovadiah, p.99). Other authorities allow a firstborn to break his fast under such circumstances (Minchas Yitzchak 9:45; Teshuvos V'hanhagos 1:300, 2:210 in the name of Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky). The Minchas Yitzchak (ibid.) suggests that a firstborn in such a position should at least try to contribute to the siyum in some way, such as by sponsoring or helping to prepare the meal.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, trying to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could have done more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|Several {{lines in}} the episode were re-recorded. During post-production, editors feared that Rich's mumbly voice would {{make it hard for}} viewers to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying, so he was brought back in to re-record his dialogue, which was then dubbed over the footage. In addition, during the scene wherein Mulder tells Scully Bobby's {{nickname}} at school, the original version featured Mulder saying [...] "Dickweed". Fox's standards and practices department made the show change the name to [...] "Dorkweed", which required David Duchovny to re-dub his line.|$|E
500|$|Paul Birchard {{was cast}} as Libby McCall because the {{producers}} believed he {{acted like a}} [...] "dinosaur" [...] from the former Bush administration. Child actor Luke Tzortzis was cast as Nico since they were impressed with his intelligence and the fact he is a [...] "strong" [...] actor; children are often hard to work with in the series, but in Tzortzis' case, he would ask the production crew several questions between takes {{in order to do}} <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is to do in the episode. It was also Tzortzis' first performance as an actor, having no past experiences.|$|E

500|$|... is Laguna's other comrade. An {{imposing}} man, he wields a large harpoon in battle; in his Limit Break, Massive Anchor, he uses it {{to crush}} his opponents from above. During the incident at Centra, he loses his voice in a battle with Esthar soldiers. After being separated from Laguna and Kiros, he becomes a janitor at the D-District Prison. When Laguna becomes president of Esthar, Ward joins Kiros as an advisor, directing affairs with gestures and ellipses. Laguna and Kiros can <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is saying by his reactions. Like Kiros, Ward's interactions with Laguna {{are based on the}} staff's interactions during development.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} his cantata in 1723 for the Sunday Quinquagesima which Bach knew as , {{the last}} Sunday before Lent. In {{the city of}} Leipzig, tempus clausum was observed during Lent, therefore {{it was the last}} Sunday with a cantata performance before a celebration of the Annunciation, Palm Sunday and the vespers service on Good Friday and Easter. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, [...] "praise of love" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, healing the blind near Jericho (...) [...] The Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in Jerusalem, and that the disciples do not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is saying.|$|E
500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means to them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I’m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don’t hate him at all. And I <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Shrek {{interrupts}} {{the wedding}} before Farquaad can kiss Fiona. He tells her that Farquaad {{is not her}} true love and is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogre {{in front of everyone}} in the church, causing a surprised Shrek to fully <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Dragon bursts in alongside Donkey and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss; Fiona is bathed in light as her curse is broken but is surprised that she is still an ogre, as she thought she would become beautiful, to which Shrek replies that she is still beautiful. They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon while Donkey and the fairytale creatures celebrate by singing [...] "I'm a Believer".|$|E
500|$|Angry with Deepe for airing Khánh's grievances against him, Taylor invited {{every other}} US {{journalist}} in Saigon to this private briefing. Taylor gave the journalists {{his account of}} the dispute and discussions with the generals, and hoped it would be useful background information for the media, so they would <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done and not reach negative conclusions about his conduct in their writing. Due to the sensitivity of the situation, he asked them to keep the remarks off the record. However, someone at the briefing informed Deepe of what Taylor had said, and she published the remarks on December 25 under the title [...] "Taylor Rips Mask Off Khánh". In this article, comments were also attributed to Taylor describing some South Vietnamese officers as borderline [...] "nuts" [...] and accusing many generals of staying in Saigon and allowing their junior officers to run the war as they saw fit. Deepe's article caused an uproar due to the tension between Taylor and the Vietnamese generals.|$|E

It was a song about getting too old for discos and that whole line that Pete sings, 'Goodbye Sister Disco, I go where the music fits my soul,' is kind of operatic; it's a bit pompous. That's why I personally didn't sing that line because I can't...when Pete sings it he's got enough kind of tongue-in-cheek quality {{to get away with}} it and it works, but if I sang it, it would be a total disaster."

500|$|Vickers {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first career win {{in front of the}} crowd, earning $228,850 for the victory. Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient." [...] Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus, was annoyed: [...] "I just don't think [...] has the talent to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has underneath him." ...|$|E
500|$|The Never Ending Tour {{commenced}} on June 7, 1988, and Dylan {{has played}} roughly 100 dates {{a year for}} the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s—a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s. By May 2013, Dylan and his band had played more than 2,500 shows, anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier, drummer George Recile, multi-instrumentalist Donnie Herron, and guitarist Charlie Sexton. To the dismay of some of his audience, Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night. Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material. Others have criticized his live performances for mangling and spitting out [...] "the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable", and giving so little to the audience that [...] "it is difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing on stage at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was [...] "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: [...] "It's not something you can process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age." ...|$|E
