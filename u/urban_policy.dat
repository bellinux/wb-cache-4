40|$|AbstractUrban {{division}} {{is a process}} formed by the reaction of several forces, among which, the role of <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> in shaping division proves high prominence. Cairo witnesses a spatial pattern of division where contrasting socioeconomic areas exist in close proximity. Although some researchers have recently addressed this division in Cairo, its relation with <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> has always been generalized regardless the specificity of location. This research aims at understanding the relation between <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> and socioeconomic division on a micro level by investigating how broad <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected on a certain {{part of the city}} leading to its division. Accordingly, the research adopts a twofold methodology. The first is for selecting the case study which leads to choosing the divided area of (El-Maadi) and (Dar El-Salam). The second is for analyzing the relation with <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> by forming a relations diagram with lines of causes and influence described with respect to time. The research shows a strong relation between division and <b>urban</b> <b>policies.</b> It is concluded that {{division is}} also affected by how <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> interact {{with each other and with}} the characteristics of the area. This puts the generalization of <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> affecting division under question...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} the interlinked usages of {{the concepts}} of ‘governance’ and ‘sustainable development’ {{over the past two}} decades of French <b>urban</b> <b>policies.</b> It shows that the importance of ‘sustainable development’ procedural principles has significantly declined in public agendas alongside the rise to prominence of climate change issues. Based on a study of the <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> developed by central French government authorities since the 1990 s, it identifies two main phases. In the 1990 s and early 2000 s, ‘sustainable development’ and ‘governance’ slogans were extensively mobilized in <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> for the purposes of modernizing public action. In a context of economic, social and institutional transformations, these <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> aimed at constructing local dynamics of collective action and encouraged the emergence of projects relying on incremental and deliberative practices. As of the mid- 2000 s, this dynamic weakened and climate change replaced sustainable development as a reference in <b>urban</b> <b>policies.</b> This shift occurred in the context of a neo-managerial restructuring, with central government authorities regaining influence over cities and <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> being redefined around quantitative and technical objectives...|$|R

40|$|AbstractVarious {{projects}} {{all over}} the world are attempting to build smart cities in hopes of achieving energy-efficient and livable communities, but most of them are aiming to fulfill their goals technologically. However, the energy efficiency and livability of a city are affected by not only these technological factors but also urban structures that encompass residential areas, offices, transportation networks, and other facilities. <b>Urban</b> <b>policies</b> intervene in transportation and land-use conditions and thereby change how citizens consume energy and go about their daily lives as the actors in the urban system alter their behavior. This means that energy efficiency and quality of life share close ties. Assessments of <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> thus need to consider the reactions of actors to the intervention. This study demonstrates the applicability of a land-use transport model to the assessment of <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> for building smart communities. First, we outline a model that explicitly formulates the actors' location-related decisions and travel behavior. Second, we apply this model to two <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> – road pricing and land-use regulation – to assess their long-term impact on energy saving and sustainability using the case of a simplified synthetic city. Our study verifies that, under assumed conditions, the model has the capacity to assess <b>urban</b> <b>policies</b> on energy use and sustainability in a consistent fashion...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} several decades, most U. S. {{metropolitan}} areas have experienced strong suburbanization of housing and jobs (i. e., urban sprawl). The sprawl that arises from urban growth has become a big issue in many metropolitan areas in the U. S. In response, there has been increased interest in <b>urban</b> containment <b>policies.</b> There are contrasting views (planning-oriented vs. market-oriented) of urban sprawl and <b>urban</b> containment <b>policies.</b> Planning-oriented scholars asserted the problems of 2 ̆ 7 geographic sprawl (GS) 2 ̆ 7 and {{the positive effects of}} urban containment polices, while market-oriented scholars asserted the problems of 2 ̆ 7 economic sprawl (ES) 2 ̆ 7 and the negative or negligible effects of <b>urban</b> containment <b>policies.</b> Therefore, this dissertation analyzed whether <b>urban</b> containment <b>policies</b> affect <b>urban</b> sprawl, employment center formation, and urban commuting.

However, as seen in the relationship between <b>urban</b> containment <b>policies,</b> <b>urban</b> sprawl and housing values, stronger <b>urban</b> containment <b>policies</b> can produce negative effects, such as traffic congestion and an increase in housing prices...|$|R
