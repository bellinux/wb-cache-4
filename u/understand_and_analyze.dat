There have been things said about this book which have moved me profoundly; the more profoundly because they were uttered by men whose occupation was avowedly to <b>understand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyze,</b> and expound--in a word, by literary critics. They spoke out according to their conscience, and some of them said things that made me feel both glad and sorry of ever having entered upon my confession. Dimly or clearly, they perceived the character of my intention and ended by judging me worthy to have made the attempt. They saw it was of a revealing character, but in some cases they thought that the revelation was not complete.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Designing and {{interoperability}} {{testing of}} distributed, application-level network protocols is complex. Windows, for example, supports currently more than 200 protocols, ranging from simple protocols for email exchange to complex ones for distributed file replication or real time communication. To fight this increasing complexity problem, we introduce a methodology and formal framework that uses model program composition to specify behavior of such protocols. A model {{program can be}} used to specify an increment of protocol functionality with a coherent purpose, which can be <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzed</b> separately. The overall behavior of a protocol can be defined by a composite model program, which defines how the individual parts interoperate. ...|$|R

50|$|In the beginning, Dalcroze {{thought that}} the {{solution}} to many problems would be basically teaching musicians to contract and relax in a specific time (the speed of sound or time), in a specific space (the duration of a sound), and with a particular force (energy dynamics of a sound). Thus, he worked on {{a new series of}} exercises designed to help students strengthen their perception by the metric and its instincts by many streams of the movement, called rhythm. Then, he began to propose exercises by playing music and suggesting that students walk as they would feel the pulse. Surprisingly, students acted differently and had difficulties in different tempos. Therefore, he deduced that people still had trouble reaching the goal of speed, accuracy, and performance by being rhythmically expressive. He realized that there could be some system of quick communication between the brain, which <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzes,</b> <b>and</b> the muscles that performs - a system to e from the brain, which studies the performance of the body and sends the information to be corrected.|$|R

Intellectual property laws supply exclusive rights that can enable a researcher, employer or funder to ‘own’ data; they can then bring legal claims against persons who access or reuse data without permission. Some of these rights attach automatically to data, data sets, or databases, and thus must be managed properly to enable robust data sharing in climate science. Other rights are created by contract, and the policies around such privately created rights must be <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzed.</b> This chapter briefly describes the variety of climate data needed by researchers and the role of intellectual property and related rights in governing access to and use of such data...|$|R
40|$|The optical {{transitions}} {{above the}} threshold of the uniaxial crystal bismuth telluride have been investigated by means of electroreflectance over the energy range 1 - 5. 5 eV using an electrolyte to produce electric fields at the surface. Both near-normal and oblique incidence measurements were made using light polarized under different orientations of the electric vector with respect to the c axis. The combination of these techniques permitted an unambiguous identification of the symmetry of the critical points and yielded the precise polarization dependence of the transitions. The broad electroreflectance spectra of bismuth telluride have been <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzed</b> in terms of strongly lifetime-broadened Franz-Keldysh tunneling.
