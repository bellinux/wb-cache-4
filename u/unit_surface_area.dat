SWNTs have a high theoretical specific surface area of 1315m2/g, while that for MWNTs is lower and {{is determined by the}} diameter of the tubes and degree of nesting, compared with a surface area of about 3000 m2/g of activated carbons. Nevertheless, CNTs have higher capacitance than activated carbon electrodes, e.g., 102F/g for MWNTs and 180F/g for SWNTs.|$|E
