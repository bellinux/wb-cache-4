5|$|At {{the hill}} of Puigpardines, Juigné was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants {{of the local}} somatent–a type of militia–, when the arrival of Sala's, Mas' and Baliart's miquelets {{convinced}} him to withdraw. When they tried to cross back the Fluvià, however, they found the way blocked. Juigné decided then attempting to escape to Olot across the wood of Malatosquera and through the bridge of Sant Roc, but the Catalans anticipated him. Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one, and while Josep Mas de Roda, leading the first one, pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood, he blocked the bridge of Sant Roc ahead the second group. During the running fight <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> Juigné's force lost 25 men and abandoned part of its ammunitions.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman {{squadron}} had set anchor at the Gulf of Girolata {{to distribute}} the booty from the recent raid. Dragut had chosen the place because it was deserted and far from the common sailing routes. As such, he left no ship to guard {{the entrance of the}} gulf. On arriving in the waters nearby, Gianettino Doria sent his relative Giorgio Doria into the gulf with 6 galleys and a small rowing frigate in order to identify the anchored galleys. Accounts of the battle's course differ. According to Cesáreo Fernández Duro and Julien de la Gravière, the Ottoman seamen and soldiers were ashore, sleeping <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> or having a meal, when the arrival of the Spanish galleys took them by surprise. According to De La Gravière, 600 Ottomans fled to the surrounding mountains before the battle actually started and Dragut barely had time to embark and fire a single volley before the Genoese and Spanish boarded his flagship and his other galleys. At the first shots, many of his men, whether Turks, Moors or European renegades, jumped overboard to escape inland.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} plan for Pohick Church was {{drawn up by}} James Wren, and was identical to that used for both The Falls Church and Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia; however, {{at some point during}} the construction process the footprint of the church was altered to that seen today. Some sources have claimed that George Washington himself drew up the design for the building, and at least one hints that George Mason, too, might have provided input; however, records show that in March 1769 the vestry paid James Wren and William West for the church plans. Construction was initially overseen by the planter Daniel French of Rose Hill, a member of the congregation. He died before completion of the building works, and oversight passed to William Buckland, who was also involved in the building of Gunston Hall nearby, and who may have participated in the decoration of the church interior as well; it is possible that Buckland took over the work at the instigation of his employer, George Mason, who had assumed many of French's debts and obligations at the latter's death. Much of the original woodwork in the building was executed by master carver William Bernard Sears, a longtime associate of Buckland's who was also attached to Gunston Hall, likely in indenture to Mason, and is known to have worked at Mount Vernon as well. The account presented by him for his services survives, and indicates that he was paid £58:19:0 for his craft. Plans for the church complex also called for the installation of mounting blocks and six benches in the churchyard, so that people could sit <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> and for the area to be cleared of all rubbish and litter. Washington's records indicate that he took an interest in furnishing the new church; besides paying William Copan for carving ciphers on both his pew and that of his neighbor Fairfax, he fitted his own pew with drawers, and also paid for a latch and a door for the church building.|$|E

500|$|In 1873, Virginia City {{recovered}} {{with a new}} strike bringing wealth back to the region. Eilley Bowers {{opened the}} Bowers Mansion {{to the public as}} a resort. The grounds were advertised as being beneficial to health, while dances and social events were held in the mansion. Bowers improved the mansion and grounds by adding a dance hall and offering the upstairs suits for family use. With the extension of the railroad which now connected Virginia City to the young town of Reno and the Trans Continental Railroad, Bowers Mansion became a prime destination for grand excursions. [...] Eilley spent many weekends hosting extravagant picnics. [...] The guests bathed in the fishponds, swung <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> waltzed on the dance floor and generally just had a fine old time. For the next few years, Bowers Mansion was filled with music and laughter.|$|E
500|$|In their {{accounts}} afterward, British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired {{at them from}} behind trees and stone walls, rather than confronting them in large, linear formations {{in the style of}} European warfare. [...] This image of the individual colonial farmer, musket in hand and fighting under his own command, has also been fostered in American myth: [...] "Chasing the red-coats down the lane / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> {{at the turn of the}} road, / And only pausing to fire and load." [...] To the contrary, beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat, the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies, even when dispersed to take advantage of cover. [...] Reflecting on the British experience that day, Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics: During the whole affair the Rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance & resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body. Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so. Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about, having been employed as Rangers against the Indians & Canadians, & this country being much covered with wood, and hilly, is very advantageous for their method of fighting.|$|E
