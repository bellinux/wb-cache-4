5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, and the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E

The Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after {{the outbreak of}} the war. The Pacific airlift was further expanded by the charter of civil airlines planes. The Canadian Government lent the United Nations a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron of six transports, while the Belgian Government added several DC-4s to the effort. Altogether, the fleet of about 60 four-engine transport planes operating across the Pacific before June 25, 1950, was quickly expanded to approximately 250. In addition to these, there were MATS C-74 Globemaster and C-97 Stratofreighter planes operating between the United States and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 15th, and coal production was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E

5|$|Canada {{occupies}} much of {{the continent}} of North America, sharing land borders with the contiguous <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, and the US state of Alaska to the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, {{the difference being due}} to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E

The street has a rich history from its origins {{as a major}} trail for horseback riders and carriages. During {{the last three decades}} of the 19th century, a six-block section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic Prairie Avenue District, which was declared a Chicago Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{returned}} to Washington in March 1877 {{at the start}} of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker. As the session began, many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875. That Act, passed when Republicans last controlled the House, was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation, replacing them with dollars backed in specie (i.e., gold or silver). With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873, this would effectively return the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War. Randall, who had voted against the act in 1875, agreed to let the House vote on its repeal, which narrowly passed. The Senate, still controlled by Republicans, declined to act on the bill.|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr {{was also}} active in Ireland. German {{intelligence}} operations effectively ended in September 1941 when police made arrests {{on the basis}} of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin, including that of the <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men {{at the start of the}} war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.|$|E

The Soviet Union, which had broken off diplomatic relations with Belgium in May 1941 (heavily influenced by the then-in force Nazi-Soviet Pact), re-established its legation to the government in exile {{in the aftermath of the}} German invasion and eventually expanded it to the rank of Embassy in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{scored the}} winning {{goal in the}} Olympic semi-final match against Canada in extra time, sending the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gold medal match against Japan. Her goal came in the 123rd minute, the latest goal ever scored {{by a member of}} the U.S. women's team and a FIFA record. The goal {{continued}} her propensity for late heroics in the closing stages of matches. Seventeen of her 28 total goals to date have come after the 60th minute. The match-winning goal was Morgan's team-high 20th in 2012, becoming only the sixth and youngest U.S. player to do so in a single year. In the final, a 2–1 win against Japan on August 9, Morgan assisted on a Carli Lloyd header. She ended the tournament with three goals, and a team-high four assists (tied with Megan Rapinoe) and ten points (tied with Rapinoe and Wambach).|$|E
