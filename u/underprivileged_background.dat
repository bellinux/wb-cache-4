5000|$|Puri {{came from}} an <b>underprivileged</b> <b>background.</b> When he was six years old, his father who was a railway {{employee}} was put behind bars on allegations of theft of cement. This resulted in their family becoming homeless. To make ends meet, Puri's brother, Ved Prakash Puri, worked as a coolie (railway porter) and Puri worked in a local tea shop. Thereafter, to help support his family, he had to start working at the young age of seven. He did odd jobs, worked at a neighbourhood dhaba (street side food stall), a tea stall and would bring coal from near railways tracks to support his family. He and his brother's children were later brought up by a maid servant, Shanti. While working, Puri continued to study. After his primary education, he joined the National School of Drama in Delhi to study theatre acting. A fellow NSD student who became a long-term friend, Naseeruddin Shah, encouraged Puri to follow him to the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune. In an interview with The Times of India, Puri later recounted his family was so poor {{that he did not}} have a decent shirt to wear when he joined FTII.

40|$|Performance on {{intelligence}} tests {{is known to}} be associated with class mobility, with high scorers tending to move up the socio-economic hierarchy, and low scorers tending to move down. However, much remains unknown about the association. It is possible that the importance of intelligence varies across different occupational areas, or that there is friction acting against mobility, such that a person from an <b>underprivileged</b> <b>background</b> would have to be more intelligent in order to reach a given position than someone who had had greater social advantage. Data from a longitudinal study of a broad, socially representative cohort of the British population (the NCDS) are used to investigate these questions. The results show that intelligence test scores in childhood are associated with class mobility in adulthood uniformly across all social classes. There is no evidence that those from underprivileged backgrounds have to be disproportio-nately able in order to reach the professional classes. The study reveals an apparently high level of social mobility and meritocracy in contemporary Britain. The scores adults achieve {{on intelligence}} tests are correlated with their socio-economi...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Very {{few studies}} have {{documented}} the relative significant factors that assess the parents and their family status that can have some impact towards dental treatment needs. Aim: To assess the burden of dental caries among children aged 8 - 14 years in relation to parental influence and family characteristics from North Bengaluru. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was carried out on 1216 school children aged 8 years to 14 years. Children were examined in schools and data comprised information about dental caries status. Structured questionnaires were given to parents to collect information regarding their socioenvironmental and family characteristics. Student′s t-test on metric parameters and Chi-square/Fisher for study parameters between two or more groups were used. Results: In families where the average monthly income < 6000 /-, decayed, missing, and filled teeth was proportionately lower in comparison to decayed, missing, and filled surfaces which were higher. Conclusions: The socioeconomic status, which is primarily influenced by parental factors and family structure, have a definite role in dental needs of children from <b>underprivileged</b> <b>background.</b> Dental health program should aim to reduce the gross inequalities in the oral health status of these children and their families...|$|E
40|$|Art and {{physical}} education programs provide crucial stimulation for the healthy cognitive, emotional, social, {{and physical}} development of children and adolescents. The progressive defunding of these programs in public schools may jeopardize the overall well-being and maturation of youth, especially those who are at-risk or from an <b>underprivileged</b> <b>background.</b> After-school programs may boost resilience by increasing resilience factors such as self-efficacy, self-esteem, social relationships, and felt connections to the surrounding community. After-school programs that emphasize dance {{have been found to}} promote well-being in at-risk children yet the impact of ballet, as a community-based programmatic intervention, upon children and adolescents has yet to be evaluated. Assuming a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and using a mixed methodology, the aims of this study are two-fold: The first goal is to explore the cognitive, emotional, social, and physical impact that ballet can exert on youth who participate in the Aspire Project, a non-profit, after-school ballet program whose primary mission is to provide subsidized ballet lessons for at-risk youth. The second goal is to investigate, identify, and delineate effective programmatic interventions utilized by the Aspire Project in relation to their community members...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria takes a heavy toll in Niger, {{one of the}} world's poorest countries. Previous {{evaluations}} {{conducted in}} the context of the strategy for the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, showed that 84 % of severe malaria cases and 64 % of ordinary cases are not correctly managed. The aim of this survey was to describe epidemiological, clinical and biological features of malaria among Methods The study was performed in 2003 during the rainy season from July 25 th to October 25 th. Microscopic diagnosis of malaria, complete blood cell counts and measurement of glycaemia were performed in compliance with the routine procedure of the laboratory. Epidemiological data was collected through interviews with mothers. Results 256 children aged 3 – 60 months were included in the study. Anthropometrics and epidemiological data were typical of a very underprivileged population: 58 % of the children were suffering from malnutrition and all were from poor families. Diagnosis of malaria was confirmed by microscopy in 52 % of the cases. Clinical symptoms upon admission were non-specific, but there was a significant combination between a positive thick blood smear and neurological symptoms, and between a positive thick blood smear and splenomegaly. Thrombopaenia was also statistically more frequent among confirmed cases of malaria. The prevalence of severe malaria was 86 %, including cases of severe anaemia among Conclusions The study confirmed that malaria was a major burden for the National Hospital of Niamey. Children hospitalized for malaria had an <b>underprivileged</b> <b>background.</b> Two distinctive features were the prevalence of severe malaria and a high mortality rate. Medical and non-medical underlying factors which may explain such a situation are discussed. </p...|$|E
