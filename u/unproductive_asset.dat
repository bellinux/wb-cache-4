In this paper, I use an adapted version of the asset-based poverty trap model to explain households’ use of asset liquidation as a coping strategy when faced with food crises. To test my theory, I employ a household-level panel data set from Tanzania that covers the years 2008, 2010, and 2012. I estimate fixed effects regressions of productive and <b>unproductive</b> <b>asset</b> levels on a measure of household-specific food prices.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of incomplete markets and sticky nominal wages {{is shown to}} magnify business cycles even though these two features – in isolation – dampen them. During recessions, fears of unemployment stir up precautionary sentiments which induces agents to save more. The additional savings {{may be used as}} investments in both a productive asset (equity) and an <b>unproductive</b> <b>asset</b> (money). But even a small rise in money demand has important consequences. The desire to hold money puts deflationary pressure on the economy, which, provided that nominal wages are sticky, increases wage costs and reduces firm profits. Lower profits repress the desire to save in equity, which increases (the fear of) unemployment, and so on. This is a powerful mechanism which causes the model to behave differently from both its complete markets version, and a version with incomplete markets but without aggregate uncertainty. In contrast to previous results in the literature, agents uniformly prefer non-trivial levels of unemployment insurance.

30|$|Dowry {{practice}} is an intrinsic tradition of Indian society, {{spread throughout the}} entire territory, with stronger consolidation in the North. The more women are lacking in producing wealth, the more dowry practice becomes instrument to make desiderable an <b>unproductive</b> <b>asset</b> so as {{to get rid of}} daughters as soon as possible through marriage. In addition, as already seen in the previous section, the institutionalization of the sanskritization process and hypergamy custom justified in the frame of Hinduism reinforce the reasons for the dowry practice persistence. Daughters are, therefore, burdens on their family of origin in many ways. The dowry obligation is consequently the direct cause of infanticides and feticides, physical and psychological domestic violence, arranged child marriages, induced suicide and uxoricides, all fully recognized and grouped under dowry related violence (De Somviele and Marchand 2003). According to official statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau, just in April-November 2009 alone, there were about 11, 004 cases of extreme-violence against women. Reports of rape, molestation, dowry death rose by 6.4 percent in 2012 from the previous year, with the highest number of rapes recorded in the capital city. Although more women, nowadays, denounce violence, the figures indicate a general rise of gender related violence in India.

Freeman. 2001. ‘Value and Crisis Theory in the “Great Recession”’. World Review of Political Economy. Vol 2 No. 1, Spring 2011. Pp 35 - 47. This article throws light on the current disarray among Marxist analyses of the present crisis. Focusing on recent discussions of “financialisation”, in particular a recent paper by Costas Lapavitsas, this article highlights a number of difficulties in these discussions and traces them to the absence of any theory of value. Marx’s distinction between productive and unproductive capital—which includes finance capital—provides a coherent framework to analyse such phenomena and obviates the need for the false polarisation between the falling rate of profit and financialisation as factors in the crisis. In value terms, financialisation is a withdrawal from the sphere of production into the sphere of circulation provoked by falling profit rates. A financial asset is a capitalised claim on a stream of income whether or not it produces value and is itself an <b>unproductive</b> <b>asset</b> which generates no additional value and serves only to equalise the general rate of profit as a parasitic deduction from value generated elsewhere. This deepens and exacerbates the long run tendency of profits to fall. Financialisation is thus an aspect, and a particular form, of this long-run historical tendency, not an independent phenomenon running counter to it. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} uncertainty shocks on the labour market. Using US data, I show empirically that increases in unemployment are due to both {{an increase in the}} separation rate and a decrease in the job-finding rate. By contrast, standard search and matching models predict an increase in the job finding rate in response to an increase in the crosssectional dispersion of firms’ productivity levels. To explain observed responses in labour market transition rates, I develop a search and matching model in which heterogeneous firms face a decreasing returns to scale technology, firms can hire multiple workers, and job flows do not necessarily coincide with worker flows. Costly job creation is key to obtaining a decrease in the job-finding rate after an increase in uncertainty. Standard numerical solution techniques cannot be used to obtain an accurate solution efficiently and I propose an alternative algorithm to overcome this problem. The second chapter studies business cycles when markets are incomplete, nominal wages do not respond one-for-one to price level changes, and labour markets are characterized by matching frictions. During recessions, idiosyncratic labour income risk increases as workers worry about being unemployed. This induces workers to save more. We allow such precautionary savings – in principle – to end up in both an <b>unproductive</b> <b>asset</b> (money) and a productive assets (firm ownership). The increased demand for money puts deflationary pressure on prices. If nominal wages are not sufficiently responsive to deflationary pressures, wage costs and the unemployment rate are pushed up, which in turn intensifies the fear of becoming unemployed. Unemployment benefits improve welfare in our economy. The third chapter analyses the inefficiencies created in a search and matching model that allows for on-the-job search. First, the Hosios rule for the efficient level of the worker’s bargaining power is adapted in a simple model. As the average gain of a new match is lower when some job seekers already have a job, the efficient level of labour market tightness should be lower and the worker’s bargaining power higher than in a model devoid of on-the-job search. Second, the decision of when to perform on-the-job search is endogenised. Too much on-the-job search is taking place, because workers do not fully incorporate their current firms’ loss when they quit. Partial wage commitment improves the efficiency of the on-the-job search decision and the efficient level can be obtained...|$|E

The results show that efficiency measures decreased significantly during the sample period {{and that there are}} large differences over the period before and after the economic crisis. Unlike many other industries, the low level of cost efficiency of the construction industry is mainly due to allocative inefficiency (inappropriate mix of input factors) rather than technical inefficiency. The low level of allocative efficiency, together with the strong relationship between institutional investors and efficiency, implies that the agency problem between managers and owners had prevailed in the Korean construction industry, and that construction firms could increase efficiency by minimizing agency costs.

40|$|We use a forward-looking multi-sectoral general {{equilibrium}} {{model to}} analyze wide ranging impacts of financial liberalization policy adopted by the Nepalese government in 1992. From analyses of model results we argue that by equalizing rates of return across sectors financial liberalization improves efficiency and brings more equal distribution of income over time. Efficiency gained in the allocation of resources increases the capital usage more in previously heavily repressed sectors such as agriculture and textile, allowing up to 19 percent expansion in production and employment with noticeable increase in output also in other sectors that cease to receive subsidy under the liberalization. The savings and investment responses, degree of factor substitutions, are higher in the complete liberalization than in partial or piecemeal liberalization. Increased output raises the level of income, consumption, utility and overall welfare of rural and urban households. Liberalization is not effective if savings are used in accumulations of <b>unproductive</b> <b>assets</b> i. e. gold, jewelry, urban land, foreign exchange. Financial liberalization improves the distribution of income by raising the wage rate of rural labor than for urban labor.

40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{financial}} crisis risks to hide the black holes which are nested in accepted theories and policy guidelines. Among such black holes there are important issues: how money is created in a growing economy, which {{is the role of}} wealth assets not linked with current production, which are the relations between such phenomena and monetary savings, how chronological time affects production and in its changes, how the emergence of sophisticated contracts and the explosion of discretionary behaviours have complicated the problem of coordination. The paper, which aims at reaching an audience of social scientists wider than the economists’ community, shows that the endogenous creation of money for financing the productive activities (Wicksell) is unlikely to be sufficient to feed a moving economy. Additional money is likely to be needed. It can be provided by public deficit or by credit going to finance speculative investments. In the meanwhile monetary savings have a high probability to result, in developed economies, in excess with respect to productive investments. These interrelated elements may imply an inflation concerning the prices of <b>unproductive</b> <b>assets</b> and a possible displacement of real activities. However, while the inflation concerning productive flows is considered as an evil, everybody seems to be happy when the values of assets not directly connected with current production increase, and the central banks end up admitting that they support such tendencies. The paper discusses how we ought to revise policy strategies, favouring a non-Keynesian policy of deficit spending linked to long lasting programs and adopting banking policies for the financing of industrial projects. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} whether {{households in}} the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) allocate their resources efficiently and {{in such a way}} as to promote growth. It focuses on the role of urban households because they form the majority and they are the main source of growth in human capital. I argue that an efficient and pro-growth allocation of household resources may not be feasible because of constraints that households face in their decisions to supply labor, and to accumulate human and physical capital. I identify two aspects of the environment in which MENA households operate as critical to conditioning their behavior: the large role of the state in the economy, which distorts the incentives in the education and labor markets, and social norms regarding gender, which influence the division of labor at home and in the economy. Patriarchal gender norms limit women’s participation outside the home, resulting in higher fertility and lower labor force participation of women in MENA compared to countries with similar income. The strong role of the state affects incentives in three key markets for credit, education, and labor. Powerful central governments have inhibited the development of modern financial markets by preventing the emergence of private banking and an independent judiciary, which is critical for the enforcement of financial contracts. Distorted financial markets affect household savings by keeping interest rates low and often negative, and thereby discourage accumulation of financial <b>assets</b> relative to <b>unproductive</b> <b>assets</b> such as land.

We study two cases: {{a case where the}} central bank cannot screen insolvent banks and a case where the central bank can only imperfectly screen insolvent banks. The major results that our model produces are as follows: (1) It is impossible for any separating equilibrium to exist because insolvent banks always have an incentive to mimic solvent banks to gamble for resurrection. (2) The pooling equilibria in which, on one hand, all the banks borrow from the central bank and, on the other hand, all the banks do not borrow from the central bank, could exist given certain market beliefs off the equilibrium path. However, neither of the equilibria is socially efficient because insolvent banks will continue to hold their <b>unproductive</b> <b>assets,</b> rather than efficiently liquidating them. (3) When the central bank can screen banks imperfectly, the pooling equilibrium where all the banks borrow from the central bank becomes more likely, and the pooling equilibrium where all the banks do not borrow from the central bank becomes less likely. (4) Higher precision in central bank screening will improve social welfare not only by identifying insolvent banks and forcing them to efficiently liquidate their assets, but also by reducing moral hazard and deterring banks from choosing risky assets in the first place. (5) If a central bank can commit to a specific precision level before the banks choose their assets, rather than conducting a discretionary LOLR policy, it will choose a higher precision level to reduce moral hazard and will attain higher social welfare...|$|R

The deflationary pressure yields a mean-reverting reduction in the price level, which implies an increase in expected inflation and a decrease in the expected real interest rate even if the policy rate does not adjust. Thus, our mechanism is different from the typical zero lower bound argument. Due to the deflationary spiral, our model also behaves differently from its incomplete market version without aggregate uncertainty, especially in terms of the impact of unemployment insurance on average employment levels.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Several mixed {{industry}} prediction models about failure {{have been}} reasonably successful in differentiating between successful companies {{and those that}} have failed. The challenge, however, is to venture into the grey area in between and to identify companies, which are financially unstable, at an early stage. Early identification enables management to intervene timeously {{in an attempt to}} prevent failure. Failure is defined as either liquidation, delisting, suspension of listing or a substantial change in structure. The grey area focused on in this study is overtrading. Overtrading is triggered by the company growing at too high a rate relative to its specific structure. Cash is necessary to fund expansion, whether for an increase in inventories, credit sales or new non-current assets. If the company does not generate enough cash to fund this expansion, it has to be financed through external sources. The longer the period of growth and the higher the growth rate, the more the cash requirements. From the theoretical model underlying overtrading, it was found that: • the higher the growth in sales, • the smaller the profit margin, and • the higher the net current assets in proportion to total assets, the lower the cash flow from operating activities before dividends were paid (CFO). Any company ought to generate enough cash from its daily activities {{in order to maintain the}} existing level of business, to repay loans, to replace assets and to pay dividends. If the internal generation of cash is insufficient to finance these activities, existing cash resources will be consumed, <b>unproductive</b> non-current <b>assets</b> will be sold and possibly also some of the productive non-current assets. The outcome for such a company is a business combination or liquidation. Due to the fact that cash plays such a big role in failure, cash flow variables constitute the majority of the independent variables used in the development of the failure prediction models. The overtrading ratio was developed as a measurement tool to quantify overtrading. As long as the company generates a positive CFO, it is not so much at risk as a company that does not succeed in generating a positive CFO. Therefore, a negative CFO for a three-year period was decided on as the norm for identifying possible financial difficulty. A company is involved in overtrading if the sum of CFO for three years less the sum of the adjusted profit for the three years, divided by the absolute value of the sum of the adjusted profit for the three years equals - 1 or smaller in the case of a company with a cumulative profit for the three years; and smaller than nought in the case of a company with a cumulative loss for the three years. South African industrial companies listed for at least three years during the period 1974 to 2003, were identified. From a total of 6 662 cumulative three-year periods, 944 overtrading years were identified. Failure occurred in 212 out of 526 companies involved in overtrading between January 1974 and August 1989. 120 out of 199 companies involved in overtrading between September 1989 and November 1995 failed, while 90 out of 127 companies involved in overtrading, failed between December 1995 and June 2000. By June 2005 it was already evident that 49 out of 92 companies involved in overtrading between July 2000 and December 2003, had already failed. Companies involved in overtrading, may survive artificially for lengthy periods with the support of providers of capital. It can therefore be expected that failure prediction models will not achieve a better accuracy rate than achieved by probabilities. Six failure prediction models utilising classification tree algorithms were developed. Using data from two periods, two different models were developed; one for growth and recession phases of the economy, the other without distinction between economic phases. The first period was September 1989 to June 2000, the other December 1995 to June 2000. June 2000 was chosen as the cut-off, since a period of five years after an overtrading year was necessary to follow-up whether the company had failed. Each universe was split in two – the learning sample, more or less 60 %, and the test sample, more or less 40 %. The models were developed from the learning sample and the test sample was used as substantiation of the results of the developed model. The total classification accuracy of the three best models, one for the growth-phase, one for the recession-phase and one mixed economy model, is respectively 72, 99 %, 96, 67 % and 80, 26 % and the classification accuracy for the failed companies 75, 29 %, 100 % and 85, 19 % respectively. The total prediction accuracy of the three models is respectively 69, 23 %, 80, 95 % and 72, 55 %, and that of the failed companies 73, 68 %, 86, 67 % and 83, 33 %. The accuracy of all the models was found to be higher than what the accuracy would have been if all the companies involved in overtrading were merely classified as having failed. From the results of the different tests, it seems that Ver 3, the growth in sales from year 1 to year 3, is probably the most important independent variable in the classification between failed and non-failed overtrading years. This corroborates the theory underlying overtrading that indicates that a high sales growth puts a company at risk for cash flow problems. Companies where the cash flow problems develop because of an increase in current assets will be intercepted by the overtrading ratio. Companies where cash flow problems develop due to replacement of non-current assets, will not necessarily be intercepted by the overtrading ratio as CFO that is used in the overtrading ratio does not allow for replacement of non-current assets. It is therefore necessary to adjust CFO to a free cash flow CFO. Depreciation is used as an alternative for replacement investment since disclosure of replacement investment is not required. Depreciation is theoretically the fraction of the value of an asset lost during the year; this value needs to be replaced. By subtracting the depreciation for the year from CFO, this amount will be more representative of the cash position of the company after considering all the normal transactions in order to sustain the business. After all the adjustments for a free cash flow, six models were developed for the different periods and economic phases. The accuracy of these models were better than what the accuracy would have been if overtrading years were merely classified as failed. Implementing these models would therefore improve specificity. From the tests performed, Ver 3 and KVB 3 /TB (the cumulative CFO for the three years over total assets) seem to be the most important independent variables in the classification between failed and non-failed when considering free cash flow. This is informative as KVB 3 :TB represents a fictional amount, as if the company spent an amount equal to depreciation on replacement investment. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Heelwat gemengde industrie-mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle was al redelik suksesvol in die onderskeid tussen mislukte en suksesvolle maatskappye. Die uitdaging is egter om die grys area tussen dié uiterstes te betree en ’n maatskappy wat finansieel onstabiel is, vroegtydig te identifiseer. Vroegtydige identifikasie stel die bestuur in staat om betyds in te gryp en mislukking te voorkom. Mislukking word as likwidasie, òf denotering, òf opskorting van notering, òf ’n wesenlike struktuurverandering, gedefinieer. Die grys area waarop die fokus in hierdie studie val, is oorbedryf. Oorbedryf word veroorsaak deurdat die maatskappy teen ’n te hoë koers relatief tot sy spesifieke struktuur groei. Kontant is nodig om uitbreiding, hetsy ’n toename in voorraad, kredietverkope of nuwe nie-bedryfsbates, te finansier. Indien die besigheid nie genoeg kontant genereer om hierdie uitbreiding te finansier nie, moet dit vanuit eksterne bronne gefinansier word. Hoe langer die tydperk van groei voortduur en hoe hoër die groeikoers is, hoe meer is die kontantbehoeftes. Uit die teoretiese model wat onderliggend is aan oorbedryf, is bevind dat: • hoe hoër die groei in verkope, • hoe kleiner die winspersentasie, en • hoe hoër die bedryfskapitaal in verhouding tot die totale bates; hoe laer is die kontantvloei uit bedryfsaktiwiteite voor dividende betaal (KVB). Enige besigheid behoort genoeg kontant uit dag-tot-dag-aktiwiteite te genereer ten einde die bestaande vlak van besigheid vol te hou, lenings terug te betaal, bates te vervang en dividende te betaal. Indien die interne kontantgenerering onvoldoende is om hierdie aktiwiteite te finansier, sal bestaande kontantbronne uitgewis word, onproduktiewe nie-bedryfsbates sal verkoop word en moontlik ook van die produktiewe nie-bedryfsbates. Die uiteinde vir so ’n maatskappy is ’n besigheidsoorname of ’n likwidasie. Aangesien kontantvloei so ’n groot rol in mislukking speel, is kontantvloeiveranderlikes die meerderheid van die onafhanklike veranderlikes wat in die ontwikkeling van die mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle gebruik is. Die oorbedryfsratio is as ’n maatstaf ontwikkel om oorbedryf te meet. Solank as wat ’n maatskappy ’n positiewe KVB genereer, is hy nie so riskant soos ’n maatskappy wat nie daarin kan slaag om positiewe kontant te genereer nie. Daarom is ’n negatiewe kumulatiewe KVB vir ’n drie-jaar-tydperk as die norm gestel om moontlike finansiële nood te identifiseer. ’n Maatskappy is besig met oorbedryf indien die som van die KVB vir drie jaar minus die som van die aangepaste wins vir die drie jaar, gedeel deur die absolute waarde van die som van die aangepaste wins vir die drie jaar, gelyk aan of kleiner as - 1 is, in die geval van ’n maatskappy wat ’n kumulatiewe wins vir die drie jaar het; en kleiner as nul in die geval van ’n maatskappy wat ’n kumulatiewe verlies vir die drie jaar het. Alle Suid-Afrikaanse genoteerde industriële maatskappye wat vir ten minste drie jaar gedurende die tydperk 1974 tot 2003 genoteer was, is geïdentifiseer. Uit ’n totaal van 6 662 kumulatiewe drie-jaar-tydperke was daar 944 oorbedryfsjare. Vanaf Januarie 1974 tot Augustus 1989 was daar 526 oorbedryfsjare, waarvan 212 misluk het. Vanaf September 1989 tot November 1995 was daar 199 oorbedryfsjare, waarvan 120 misluk het en vanaf Desember 1995 tot Junie 2000 het 90 van 127 oorbedryfsjare misluk. Teen Junie 2005 was dit reeds bekend dat 49 van die 92 oorbedryfsjare tussen Julie 2000 en Desember 2003 misluk het. Oorbedryfsmaatskappye bly soms vir uitgebreide tydperke kunsmatig voortbestaan, indien die verskaffers van kapitaal hulle dra. Die verwagting was dus dat mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle nie ’n beter akkuraatheid sou behaal as wat waarskynlikhede sou bepaal nie. Ses mislukkingvoorspellingsmodelle is met behulp van die klassifikasieboomalgoritme ontwikkel. Een model elk vir die groeifase en die resessie-fase van die ekonomie en een model sonder onderskeid van die ekonomiese fase is met die gebruikmaking van twee tydperke se data ontwikkel. Die eerste tydperk was September 1989 tot Junie 2000 en die ander Desember 1995 tot Junie 2000. Junie 2000 is as die afsnypunt gebruik aangesien ’n vyf-jaaropvolgtydperk na ’n oorbedryfsjaar nodig is om vas te stel of die maatskappy misluk het. Elke universum is in twee verdeel – die leersteekproef, ongeveer 60 %, en die toetssteekproef, ongeveer 40 %. Die modelle is uit die leersteekproef afgelei en die toetssteekproef is gebruik as bevestiging van die resultate van die afgeleide model. Die totale klassifikasie-akkuraatheid van die drie beste modelle, een vir die groeifase, een vir die resessie-fase en een gemengde ekonomiemodel, is onderskeidelik 72, 99 %, 96, 67 % en 80, 26 % en dié vir die mislukte maatskappye 75, 29 %, 100 % en 85, 19 %. Die totale voorspellingsakkuraatheid van die drie modelle is onderskeidelik 69, 23 %, 80, 95 % en 72, 55 % en dié van die mislukte maatskappye 73, 68 %, 86, 67 % en 83, 33 %. Al die modelle se akkuraatheid is meer as wat die akkuraatheid sou wees indien al die oorbedryfsjare bloot as misluk geklassifiseer sou wees. Uit die resultate van verskeie toetse blyk dit dat Ver 3, die groei in verkope vanaf jaar 1 tot jaar 3, waarskynlik die belangrikste onafhanklike veranderlike in die onderskeid tussen mislukte en nie-mislukte oorbedryfsjare is. Dit ondersteun die teorie wat onderliggend is aan oorbedryf, wat aandui dat ’n hoë groei in verkope ’n maatskappy op risiko plaas vir kontantvloeiprobleme. Maatskappye waar die kontantvloeiprobleme vanweë ’n uitbreiding in bedryfskapitaal ontstaan, word deur die oorbedryfsratio onderskep. Die maatskappye waar die kontantvloeiprobleme eerder uit die vervanging van nie-bedryfsbates sal voortvloei, sal nie noodwendig deur die oorbedryfsratio ondervang word nie, aangesien die KVB wat in die oorbedryfsratio gebruik word, nie voorsiening maak vir vervangende investering nie. Dit is daarom nodig om KVB tot ’n vrye kontantvloei-KVB aan te pas. Waardevermindering word as ’n alternatief vir vervangende investering gebruik, aangesien vervangende investering nie ’n verpligte openbaarmakingsvereiste is nie. Waardevermindering is teoreties dié deel van die bate wat gedurende die jaar opgebruik is en wat vervang behoort te word. Deur dus die jaarlikse waardevermindering van KVB af te trek, is hierdie syfer meer verteenwoordigend van die maatskappy se kontantposisie nadat alle normale transaksies om die besigheid in stand te hou, in ag geneem is. Na die aanpassings vir vrye kontantvloei is weer ses modelle uit die verskillende tydperke en vir die verskillende ekonomiese fases ontwikkel. Al die modelle se akkuraatheid is beter as wat die akkuraatheid sou wees indien al die oorbedryfsjare bloot as misluk geklassifiseer sou wees. Ver 3 en KVB 3 :TB (die kumulatiewe KVB vir die drie jaar tot die totale bates) blyk uit die toetse die belangrikste onafhanklike veranderlikes te wees in die onderskeid tussen misluk en nie-misluk wanneer vrye kontantvloei in ag geneem word. Dit is insiggewend aangesien KVB 3 :TB ’n fiktiewe syfer verteenwoordig, sou die maatskappy ’n bedrag wat gelyk is aan waardevermindering, aan vervangende investering bestee het...|$|R
