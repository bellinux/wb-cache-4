5|$|Allen's manager {{introduced}} her to production duo Future Cut in 2004. They worked in a small studio {{in the basement of}} a Manchester office building. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records; the label gave her £25,000 to produce an album, though they were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases such as Coldplay's X and virtual band Gorillaz' Demon Days.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} will be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} {{differences with the}} patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal {{to cooperate with the}} hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E

50|$|As a {{refinement}} {{to stamp}} systems is {{the method of}} requiring that a micropayment only be made (or some other form of penalty imposed) if the recipient considers the email to be abusive. This addresses the principal objection to stamp systems: popular free legitimate mailing list hosts would be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> their services {{if they had to}} pay postage for every message they sent.|$|R
5|$|Privately funded service – Transport by {{ambulance}} is {{paid for}} by the patient themselves, or through their insurance company. This may be at the point of care (i.e. payment or guarantee must be made before treatment or transport), although this may be an issue with critically injured patients, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> such details, or via a system of billing later on.|$|E
5|$|Adkins {{was born}} in Boone County, West Virginia on April 29, 1937, where he spent his entire life. He was the {{youngest}} of ten children of Wid Adkins, a coal miner, and Alice Adkins, raised in a tarpaper shack on property rented from a local coal company. Born {{at the time of the}} Great Depression, Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very brief time, as few as two days of first grade.|$|E
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Following a long {{record of}} instigating {{localised}} conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, {{appealed to the}} League for international intervention. Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, {{a city with a}} substantial number of foreigners. The League was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference.|$|E
5|$|Hindley's {{first job}} {{was as a}} junior clerk at a local {{electrical}} engineering firm. She ran errands, made tea, and typed. She was well liked at the firm, enough so that when she lost her first week's wage packet, the other girls had a collection to replace it. Beginning at Christmas 1958, Hindley began a short relationship with Ronnie Sinclair, and became engaged at 17. The engagement was called off several months later; Hindley apparently thought Sinclair immature, and <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> her with the life she envisaged for herself.|$|E
5|$|When Bahá'u'lláh {{returned}} to Baghdad {{he saw that}} the Bábí community had become disheartened and divided. During Bahá'u'lláh's absence, it had become alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued his policy of militancy and had been <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> effective leadership. Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the Báb against the Báb's clear instructions; dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the Shah; and instigated violence against prominent Bábís who had challenged his leadership.|$|E

5|$|After {{purchasing}} a decrepit yacht, the Granma, on 25 November 1956 Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 revolutionaries armed with 90 rifles, 3 machine guns, around 40 pistols and 2 hand-held anti-tank guns. The 1,200 mile crossing to Cuba was harsh, {{and in the}} overcrowded conditions of the ship, many suffered seasickness, and food supplies ran low. At some points they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan had been for the crossing to take 5 days, and on the ship's scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pais led an armed uprising against government buildings in Santiago, Manzanillo and several other towns. However, the Granmas journey ultimately lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> reinforcements, Pais and his militants dispersed {{after two days of}} intermittent attacks.|$|E
5|$|Details on the Mauretanian {{events of}} 39–44 are unclear. Cassius Dio wrote an entire chapter on the {{annexation}} of Mauretania by Caligula, {{but it is}} now lost. Caligula's move seemingly had a strictly personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion {{may not have been}} prompted by pressing military or economic needs. However, the rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats.|$|E
5|$|Female {{students}} were {{admitted to the}} college {{for the first time}} in 1987; until then it had been single sex. Since this time the college has become fully mixed, with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred. Expansion caused a strain on college numbers, however, and in 2004 the college was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> accommodation for all of its fresher students {{for the first time in}} its history. Following the foundation of Josephine Butler, Durham's first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from the university to take on additional students has lessened, and undergraduate numbers have been intentionally reduced in recent years.|$|E
30|$|Continuity {{and quality}} of service (QoS) are also related to {{reliability}} and availability. Services are dependent {{on the availability of}} the system. If a system is unavailable due to hardware or software failures, then {{it is obvious that the}} system would be <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>providing</b> services. A system that is not <b>providing</b> or fails <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> smooth and consistent service, suffers from the problems known as continuity {{and quality of}} service.|$|R
5000|$|George Washington was one {{of several}} ships {{participating}} in disaster relief after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] While docked for maintenance in Yokosuka she detected radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, and was ordered to leave port before schedule, with a smaller-than-normal crew, to avoid the radioactive plume. The smaller crew was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> aid. [...] While at sea, the carrier made two visits to United States Fleet Activities Sasebo to exchange crew members and take on maintenance equipment. The ship returned to her berth at Yokosuka on 20 April 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{main focus}} for INGOs is <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> relief and {{developmental}} aid to developing countries. In relation to states, {{the purpose of}} INGOs is <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> services {{that the state is}} <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for their people. These organization's projects in health, like HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, clean water, and malaria prevention, and in education, like schools for girls and <b>providing</b> books <b>to</b> developing countries, help <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the social services that the country's government is <b>unable</b> or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> at the time. International Non-governmental Organizations are also some of the first responders to natural disasters, like hurricanes and floods, or crises that need emergency relief.|$|R
5|$|France also {{committed}} military {{assets to}} the coalition; in October 1990, eight Jaguar A aircraft {{along with several}} Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft {{were sent to the}} Middle East, with the Mirages, which had more advanced avionics, acting as guides for the Jaguars. Owing to obsolete navigational systems being <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers, RAF Tornadoes also required adaption to a lesser extent. The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia built up to a maximum of 28 aircraft, which carried out 615 combat sorties, with one Jaguar damaged by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile. Typical targets were Iraqi armoured units, Scud missile sites, and naval vessels.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, he fronted a {{consortium}} – funded by Saudi brothers Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti {{of the company}} Allied Properties – that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, beating a rival bid from Doug Ellis. The brothers wanted anonymity, and were only revealed to the public after investigation by journalists. He sacked manager Ian Greaves and replaced him with former Wolves teammate Graham Hawkins. However the council rejected planning permission for the club to construct a supermarket, and the Bhattis were unwilling or <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> further funding for the club. Wolves won promotion out of the Second Division in 1982–83, but were relegated out of the First Division in last place in 1983–84, and Dougan sacked Hawkins and replaced him with Tommy Docherty. Dougan resigned in January 1985.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, Warren {{met with}} Dr Albert K. Chapman, the Vice President and General Manager of Eastman Kodak, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the {{director}} of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall, the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED). They asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> all the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.|$|E

5|$|A church, or group, that is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> fully <b>provide</b> for the {{religious}} {{needs of its}} members is called a mission. Missions are dependent on a congregation which is administered by a minister. A group of several congregations with their missions form a district. The Church in each nation is divided into multiple districts. In Mexico, several districts form together into five jurisdictions that act as legal entities.|$|R

To ease his father's burden, Pineda quit school and started working.|$|R
5|$|In special {{elections}} held in June 1861, Unionists captured nine of Kentucky's ten congressional {{seats and}} obtained two-thirds majorities {{in both houses}} of the state legislature. Despite Magoffin's strict adherence to the policy of neutrality, the Unionist legislature did not trust him and routinely overrode his vetoes. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> effective leadership due to a hostile legislature, Magoffin agreed to resign as governor in 1862, provided he could choose his successor. Lieutenant governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and Magoffin refused to allow Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk to succeed him as governor. Accordingly, Fisk resigned and the Kentucky Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, as speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson ascended to the governorship, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring flew to Sicily {{himself on}} 12 July {{to survey the}} {{situation}} and decided that {{no more than a}} delaying action was possible and that the island would eventually have to be evacuated. Nonetheless, he intended to fight on and he reinforced Sicily with the 29th Panzergrenadier Division on 15 July. Kesselring returned to Sicily by flying boat on 16 July to give the senior German commander, General der Panzertruppe Hans-Valentin Hube, his instructions. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy flak units on the island, although this was contrary to Luftwaffe doctrine. In all, Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in Sicily for another month and the Allied conquest of the Sicily was not complete until 17 August.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1993, {{a mortar}} shell fired by Bosnian Serb troops hit a Sarajevo neighbourhood, {{injuring}} five-year-old Irma Hadžimuratović and killing several others, including her mother. Sarajevo's overstretched Koševo hospital was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> adequate {{treatment for the}} injuries Irma received to her spine, head and abdomen. She developed bacterial meningitis as a result. Edo Jaganjac, the surgeon treating Hadžimuratović, tried unsuccessfully to have her evacuated on a UN relief flight. He then resorted to distributing her photograph among foreign journalists in Sarajevo. Several picked up Irma's story, giving it widespread coverage in the international (and especially the British) press. On the evening of 8 August, BBC news led with coverage of Irma's injuries. On 9 August, British Prime Minister John Major personally intervened, dispatching an RAF Hercules to airlift Irma to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.|$|E

40|$|Squatter {{households}} in Mumbai line up jerry cans in preparation {{of water to}} be supplied by the local municipality {{in the early hours}} of the morning. The chain linking the cans is to prevent them from being stolen. Not all the urban poor receive municipal supplies of water but depend on informal water vendors. The urban poors expenditure on water (per cubic metre) from water vendors is very high compared to those with piped water connections: 7 times as much in Mumbai and Phnom Penh, and 15 times in as much in Karachi and Kathmandu. Often, illegality and haphazard settlement patterns are cited as reasons why governments are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>provided</b> piped water. The question is: how can government and non-government actors work with informal water vendors to cut out the role of intermediaries and thus reduce costs whilst not depriving water vendors of this source of their livelihood...|$|R

However, he argued against legislation to combat disability discrimination, believing {{that it was better}} to assist the disabled directly than impose obligations on businesses, since imposing those obligations would mean that the businesses were then <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>providing</b> direct help.|$|R
