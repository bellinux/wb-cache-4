5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful.

Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>of</b> the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not letting the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast.

ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>of</b> another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against {{global warming and}} the waste of natural resources, and accusing the <b>U.S.</b> <b>of</b> being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally. He later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.|$|E

5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding <b>us</b> <b>of</b> faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E

5|$|It {{finished}} 1994 as {{the fourth}} best-selling US Latin album and the best-selling regional Mexican album. In 1995, it ranked second to Dreaming of You for the best-selling Latin album, but was the best-selling regional Mexican recording. Amor Prohibido remained the best-selling regional Mexican album in 1996, while the record became the ninth best-selling Latin album of that year. It also ranked {{as the second}} best-selling catalog Latin album of 1997, while in 1998 it placed third. Billboards revised catalog criteria made it ineligible for the Top Latin Albums chart on January 18, 1997. It {{was removed from the}} list and began charting on the newly formed Latin Catalog Albums chart positioned at number two. Since 1997, the album has spent 13 nonconsecutive weeks at number one on the Top Latin Catalog Albums chart including three weeks in 2010. Following another revision to its Top Latin Albums chart, Billboard removed its two decade-long ban of catalog albums in its chart beginning with the February 11, 2017 list; Amor Prohibido re-entered the Top Latin Albums and Regional Mexican Albums chart after 20 years. Before its revision, Nielsen SoundScan reported that Amor Prohibido was the ninth best-selling Latin record of 2016. After its revision, Amor Prohibido reclaimed the number one position on the Regional Mexican Albums chart in May 2017. In November 1994, the album had sold 200,000 units in the US. A report showed the singer was one of the top-selling acts in Mexico. It became the second Tejano album to reach year-end sales of 500,000 copies. This had only been accomplished by La Mafia previously. Despite this, Nielsen Soundscan reported that the recording actually sold 184,000 units by April 1995. According to Behar, the sales figures Nielsen SoundScan provided did not include sales in small shops specializing in Latin music. That May, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album gold, for shipments of 500,000 units. Within three weeks, it was certified platinum for increments of one million units. Amor Prohibido became the first Tejano record to receive a platinum certification. By June 1995, it had sold 1.5 million units in the <b>US,</b> <b>of</b> which 100,000 were sold in Puerto Rico alone. As of February 2010, the album has been certified double diamond (Latin), denoting shipments of two million units. It is tied at second, behind her album Dreaming of You, for the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the US with 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. The recording has been ranked as the best-selling Tejano album of the 1990s, and the best-selling Tejano album of all-time.|$|E
