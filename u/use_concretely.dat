An experience-grounded semantics is introduced in this paper, using NARS, an intelligent reasoning system, as a concrete example. In NARS, the truth {{value of a}} sentence indicates the amount of available evidence, {{and the meaning of}} a term indicates its experienced relationship with other terms. Accordingly, both truth value and meaning are dynamic and subjective. This approach provides new ideas to the solution of some important problems in artificial intelligence. 1 Introduction Semantics studies how the items in a language are related to the environment in which the language is <b>used.</b> <b>Concretely,</b> semantics is the theory of meaning and truth.

40|$|For {{a surface}} with non {{vanishing}} Gaussian curvature the Gauss map is regular {{and can be}} inverted. This {{makes it possible to}} use the normal as the parameter, and then it is trivial to calculate the normal and the Gauss map. This in turns makes it easy to calculate offsets, the principal curvatures, the principal directions, etc. Such a parametrization is not only a theoretical possibility but can be <b>used</b> <b>concretely.</b> One way of obtaining this parametrization is to specify the support function {{as a function of the}} normal, i. e., as a function on the unit sphere. The support function is the distance from the origin to the tangent plane and the surface is simply considered as the envelope of its family of tangent planes. Suppose we are given points and normals and we want a C k-surface interpolating these data. The data gives the value and gradients of the support function at certain points (the given normals) on the unit sphere, and the surface can be defined by determining the support function as a C k function interpolating the given values and gradients. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{there is}} a growing need of data related to beam solar radiation. The market {{situation}} of the solar technologies as well as the premium prices in countries like Spain drives to the necessity to characterize the expected DNI in a specific location with short measurement campaign. Due to it is impossible to wait ten or more years for measure the DNI in a specific location, methodologies for deriving DNI representative series are needed. To estimate beam radiation from global radiation, there can be used information derived from satellite images, or data from well known data bases of global solar radiation. In both cases global-to-beam irradiance models are needed. This work presents a novelty methodology to transform hourly global irradiance registers in a concrete emplacement, into beam irradiance data. In front of classical global to direct models where general curves are fitting to simulate the direct irradiance behavior, the present methodology allows us to fit the "better curve" to each available observation. To implement this method, a set of ground measurements of Beam and Global irradiance were available and different mathematical techniques have been <b>used.</b> <b>Concretely,</b> topics of measure theory, cluster methods and kernel machines learning are included in the present methodology.

40|$|Mobile and {{wireless}} communication systems {{are becoming more}} and more complex, making understanding the interaction of different technologies on different layers a very difficult task. The introduction of sophisticated techniques on the physical layer that react to changes of the wireless channel on small timescales requires new paradigms for modeling, simulating, and analyzing current and future wireless networks. Investigating the relationship of new physical layer techniques, application-specific requirements and performance measures will become a major research topic for future wireless networks. A continuous change in the methodology for evaluating the network performance takes place in the Internet. In the past, network performance was mainly evaluated <b>using</b> <b>concretely</b> measurable values like packet loss rate, delay, or jitter. The current trend in the Internet goes toward application-specific quality measures that judge more the subjective experience of the end user than they do network parameters. In the terminology, this is expressed as the change from quality of service (QoS-Quality of Service (QoS)) to quality of experience (QoE). For wireless networks this leads to interesting consequences, as currently the traffic requirements for MAC layer connections are mainly formulated in terms of QoS parameters. Accomplishing the change from QoS to QoE also in the definition of connection parameters is a future challenge for wireless networks, for which the first approaches are presented...|$|R

Each fungus was inoculated in the center on Czapek Yeast Autolysate Agar (CYA) dishes. Dishes were tightly sealed with parafilm and incubated for fourteen days at 25 ± 1 °C (three replicates were used for each treatment). Volatile phase effect of 50 μl of the essential oils was found to inhibit on growth of Penicillium spp [...] Fungicidal and fungistatic concentracions (MFC) were determined by microathmosphere method. Complete growth inhibition of the isolates by EOs of thyme and clove was observed. The most sensitive isolate was P. crustosum (P 4) (P < 0. 05) The essential oils (EOs) of basil and rosemary had antifungal effect on growth of P. citrinum (P 1 – P 2) after 3 day of the incubation at concentration 100 % of EOs. The most resistant isolates were P. expansum (P 5 – P 6). Growth of these isolates was inhibited by thyme and clove EOs (100 %), like each other tested isolates, but with effective MFC concentration of 30 % (30 / 70; v/v) after all days of cultivation.
