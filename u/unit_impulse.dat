40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} an {{optimization}} of laminated arches is solved under condition that generally anisotropic layers are considered {{and the design}} parameters of optimization are eigenparameters (intrinsic fields), either eigenstrains or eigenstresses. Mathematical appara-tus is to be discussed and the formulas needed for programming on computers will be derived. The focus here is concentrated on problem of the response of harmonic load, which can be simulated by developing time coordinate into the Fourier series. The solution on separated coordinates of position is formulated for simply supported or clamped layered arch in cylin-drical coordinates. The semi-analytic solution is used for simply supported arch in the posi-tion coordinates. The conditions being valid for clamped edges are taken from the well known Lechnitski’s book on Theory of plates. The procedure used in the book enables us to solve the simply supported arch and by virtue of <b>unit</b> <b>impulses</b> of a slope at the supports to derive the solution for fixed ends. The boundary conditions are fulfilled by selections of sine or cosine series applied to different directions of displacements and eigenparameters.

Neuronal spikes were threshold extracted (> 4 SD above baseline). Single units were con-firmed using a spike sorting algorithm [2]. Spike trains were then constructed at 1 kHz with <b>unit</b> <b>impulses</b> at each spike time (Fig. 1 B) and zeros elsewhere. Episodes of tremor related activity were identified in which the spectral peak in the tremor range (2 - 6 Hz) was substan-tially higher than baseline (Fig. 1 D). Spike trains corresponding to identified oscillatory activity were then band pass filtered (2 to 6 Hz) to produce a continuous signal (Fig. 1 A) corresponding to the envelope of the low frequency activity [3]. The Hilbert transform was used to reconstruct the phase of this signal at each time point. The derivative of this waveform gives the instantaneous frequency (Fig. 1 C), and large deviations from the base-line rate of about 4 Hz indicate that the phase of the oscillation has been reset. We identified spontaneous phase advances (Fig. 1 A 1,B 1, and C 1) in which the next burst occurred sooner than expected as well as sponta-neous phase delays (Fig. 1 A 2,B 2, and C 2) in which th...|$|R
