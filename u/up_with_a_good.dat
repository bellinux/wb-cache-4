5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she grew <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience {{to be the perfect}} political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Polish Jews was aware that Bełżec and Treblinka had been closed, dismantled and all remaining prisoners {{had been sent to}} the gas-chambers and they suspected that Sobibor would be next. There was a great urgency in coming <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> escape plan, and Pechersky, with his army experience, was their best hope. The escape had to also coincide with the time when the Sobibor's deputy commandant Gustav Wagner went on vacation, since the prisoners felt that he was sharp enough to uncover the escape plan.|$|E
25|$|The Aliens have {{appeared}} in many crossovers (including {{a large number of}} intercompany crossovers) in comic books and other media such as novels, toys, and video games. The largest of these crossovers is the Alien vs. Predator franchise, in which the Aliens battle the Predators. This was an idea that came to comic book artist Chris Warner in early 1989. He and other people at Dark Horse Comics were trying to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> character combo for a new comics series. Dark Horse had been publishing Aliens comic book under license from 20th Century Fox since 1987. In 1990, the first depiction of the idea in film appeared in Predator 2, when an Alien skull, sculpted by Kevin Hudson, appeared as one of the trophies in the Predator spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|Insects {{that had}} evolved their proto-wings {{in a world}} without flying predators could afford to be exposed openly without risk, but this changed when {{carnivorous}} flying insects evolved. It is unknown when they first evolved, but once these predators had emerged they put a strong selection pressure on their victims and themselves. Those of the prey who came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solution about how to fold their wings over their backs {{in a way that}} made it possible for them to live in narrow spaces would not only be able to hide from flying predators (and terrestrial predators if they were on the ground) but also to exploit a wide variety of niches that were closed to those who couldn't fold their wings in this way. And today the neopterous insects (those that can fold their wings back over the abdomen) are by far the most dominant group of insects.|$|E
500|$|The episode guest starred Phyllis Somerville, {{known for}} her recent work on the Showtime series The Big C that ended in her character's death. Somerville {{expressed}} hope that the science fiction nature of Fringe would convince The Big C writers to hire her back, commenting [...] "maybe I can get those sci-fi folks to hook me <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> gadget that will allow Marlene {{to come back to}} life and bug Laura Linney some more." [...] "6B" [...] featured recurring guest actors Ryan McDonald and Seth Gabel as Massive Dynamic scientist Brandon Fayette and Agent Lincoln Lee, respectively. The episode also featured one-time guest star Ken Pogue as Alice's husband Derek.|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a handle on the character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody has come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E

Yet if we could get <b>up</b> {{something}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of sentiment and no principle involved; referring only to the past, but with his practised powers touching the present.

500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
500|$|Following its broadcast, [...] "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{his review of}} The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "Even in the series’ crummier seasons, the staff always seems to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> Halloween episode", and that [...] "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] "continues that trend". Of the three segments, Jacobson found [...] "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] to be the weakest. He wrote [...] " [...] other than a good ending, it simply doesn’t have a lot going for it" [...] and added {{that it is the}} most dated of the three. He continued, [...] "'Diddily' offers a fun horror spoof, and 'Xena' is a terrific superhero bit with plenty of cleverness." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane gave the episode a positive review as well. Considering it {{to be one of the}} season's best episodes, Jane wrote [...] "This one, like so many that have come before and since, is a great blend of horror movie parody and Halloween themed fun in Springfield." [...] In 2007, Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal included [...] "Desperately Xeeking Xena" [...] in a list called [...] "The Ten Best Treehouse of Horror Vignettes". Although he disliked Bart and Lisa's part in the segment, Patrick wrote that it [...] "earns its stripes by being perhaps Comic Book Guy's finest hour". He also praised the segment's references, as well as Lawless' line [...] "A wizard did it", a phrase used to explain continuity errors. In 2009, The Collector's marriage proposal to Lawless was included in [...] "Line-O-Rama: Comic Book Guy", a compilation of what IGN considers to be The Comic Book Guy's best lines.|$|E

Why can't we just say 'no more killing, let's all go home'? Why would it be stupid just to pack it in, sir? Why?" [...] Neither Captain Blackadder nor Lieutenant George are able to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> answer beyond an attempted accusation of defeatism from George.|$|E

5000|$|The {{final order}} of choices led to debate, {{some of which}} came from the SportsCentury camp. Bob Costas, one of the series' voters, said, [...] "I had Babe Ruth as my number one, but I think the list they came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one. Everybody more or less {{deserved}} to be there." [...] ESPN writer Bud Morgan conceded that the Secretariat pick [...] "was kind of controversial {{because a lot of}} people took the attitude 'What is a four-legged animal doing on this list?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Uncle Lot, {{like every}} one else, felt the magical {{brightness}} of his daughter, and was delighted with her praises, {{as might be}} discerned by his often finding occasion to remark that [...] "he didn't see why the boys need to be all the time a' comin' to see Grace, for she was nothing so extror'nary, after all." [...] About all matters and things at home she generally had her own way, while Uncle Lot would scold and give <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> regular <b>good</b> grace that was quite creditable.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, Rampal {{played a}} {{lead role in}} Naresh Malhotra's Dil Ka Rishta {{opposite}} Aishwarya Rai. Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performance. Ronjita Kulkarni of Rediff wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal shakes off his wooden image and comes <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> performance. He is subtle and convincing in the emotional scenes. He has certainly moved on from Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat." [...] It was ranked the thirtieth film of the year {{on the basis of}} box office collections. Rampal's next role was in Khalid Mohammed's Tehzeeb opposite Urmila Matondkar. Rampal played a Muslim in the film. The film earned critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh praised his performance, quoting: [...] "the easy-going attitude his character reflects injects that certain sheen to the enterprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though this {{is rarely}} {{mentioned}} in print, Garfield {{is set in}} Muncie, Indiana, the home of Jim Davis, according to the television special Happy Birthday, Garfield. Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, coffee, and disdain of Mondays and diets. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring minor characters appear as well. Originally created with the intentions to [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> marketable character", Garfield has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{first stage}} {{name as a}} dancer was [...] "Jennasis", which she later used as {{the name of a}} {{business}} that she incorporated ("Jennasis Killing Co."). [...] As for picking her permanent professional name, she said, [...] "I had to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> name. [...] I didn't want a porno name. [...] So I sat down, opened up the phone book and thumbed to the J's, cause I wanted it to match my first name." [...] She saw 'James', but rejected [...] "Jenna James" [...] because it [...] "sounds too porno". [...] Right under that was 'Jameson' which struck her as being the name of the whiskey she likes and thought [...] "Ok, that's perfect." [...] That night at work she saw her brother and asked him what he thought of the name [...] "Jenna Jameson". [...] He said, [...] "I'm drinking Jameson right now." [...] And the name stuck after that.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{mastering}} his fears, Jonathan contrived {{to speak}} <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> appearance of spirit.

And she rubbed it well in about my currant wine and how I'd always said it couldn't have the least effect on anybody. I just told her plainly that currant wine wasn't meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child I had to do with was so greedy I'd sober her <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> right <b>good</b> spanking." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, Kramnik {{played in}} the very strong tournament in Linares. He finished fifth, beating the then world number three, Vassily Ivanchuk, along the way.

2500|$|In September 1985, the El Greco was {{carefully}} carved into four pieces and hauled {{from its original}} site in Westwood to its new location in the Beverly-Fairfax district. [...] Architect Peter de Bretteville, {{who was in charge}} of the move and refurbishment, noted: [...] "The difficult relocation was accomplished by dividing the apartment into four separate sections, preserving all of the structure's Spanish roof tiles and other elements of the charming brick and tile courtyard, including its central fish pond, which was recreated to its original appearance on the new site. [...] The haul from Westwood required a great deal of preparation on the site, careful planning and finally settling of the structure on the new site. [...] We worked within certain budget constraints and we tried to intrude as little as possible on the structure itself. [...] I believe we came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> compromise." [...] When the old structure was removed, construction began on a new $7.5 million, 112-unit apartment complex on the original site.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{began working}} {{in the studio with}} Naughty Boy in 2009, where the pair first worked {{together}} on Chipmunk's debut album I Am Chipmunk. When Sandé was 16 years of age, her parents took her to Alicia Keys Songs in A Minor Tour and she said she always wanted Keys to hear her music. She spoke on why she likes Keys so much; [...] "I'd read about her background and identified with her on so many levels. She was mixed race like me, a great student who'd been top of her class, who played piano and loved Nina Simone. And there she was in the pop charts, yet with songs that had a message. I saw 16,000 people hanging on her every word and thought, [...] "I want this kind of attention. I want Alicia to know my music." [...] The pair met when Sandé had just came back from New York and just began a second songwriting stint, but this time involved with Keys. The pair sat at a piano and played for hours trying to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> track. She said that she wanted the songs on her debut album to be fresh and she wanted to try and take it back how she wrote songs at the beginning of her career. Sandé had classical music training as a songwriter in her teens and learnt to play the piano at an early age, and getting across that she played, made and wrote her own music was very important to her. She said on the album, she wanted people to see every side of her as an artist, so it was important to have songs there where there could be a real connection with the lyric, rather than there just be throwaway pop music. Joni Mitchell and Lauryn Hill were also major influences for the album.|$|E
