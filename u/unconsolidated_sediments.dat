25|$|The ore {{materials}} are trapped within a fumarole field or a black smoker field {{when they are}} expelled into the ocean, cool, and precipitate sulfide minerals as stratiform sulfide ore. Some deposits show evidence of formation via deposition of sulfide via replacement of altered volcanosedimentary rocks and may also form by invasion of sulfur-rich brines into <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rocks {{forming the}} Eastern Hills {{range in age}} from Late Cretaceous to Paleogene and are covered by sub-recent sediments of the Pleistocene and Holocene. The contact between the Maastrichtian to Lower Paleocene Guaduas and Late Paleocene Cacho Formations is discordant, {{indicating}} the first uplift of the Andes. Between the Eocene and Pleistocene a hiatus is present, where the Pleistocene formations are followed by Holocene <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the intensity of ground shaking during earthquakes and the associated damage to structures are significantly influenced by local geologic and soil conditions. <b>Unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments</b> are found to amplify ground motion during earthquakes and are hence more prone to earthquake damage than ground with hard strata. Modern cities built on soft sediments are especially vulnerable to damage caused by amplified ground motions.|$|E

25|$|A {{destructive}} earthquake occurred {{two days}} before the mainshock at 21:00 local time, centered in the Val di Noto. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII–XI on the Mercalli intensity scale. Intensities of VIII or higher have been estimated for Augusta, Avola Vecchia, Floridia, Melilli, Noto Antica, Catania, Francofonte, Lentini, Scicli, Sortino and Vizzini. Augusta lies well outside the main zone of severe shaking; its extensive damage is probably due to its construction on <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments.</b>|$|E
25|$|Layered {{sedimentary}} deposits are widespread on Mars. These deposits probably {{consist of}} both sedimentary rock and poorly indurated or <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments.</b> Thick sedimentary deposits {{occur in the}} interior of several canyons in Valles Marineris, within large craters in Arabia and Meridiani Planum (see Henry Crater for example), and probably comprise much of the deposits in the northern lowlands (e.g., Vastitas Borealis Formation). The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landed in an area containing cross-bedded (mainly eolian) sandstones (Burns formation). Fluvial-deltaic deposits are present in Eberswalde Crater and elsewhere, and photogeologic evidence suggests that many craters and low lying intercrater areas in the southern highlands contain Noachian-aged lake sediments.|$|E

"Ekbletomys hypenemus" [...] {{is known}} from {{material}} from two small limestone caves at Two Foot Bay {{at the eastern}} side of the island of Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda and from a site named Mill Reef in the far east of Antigua, also in Antigua and Barbuda, which has not been described in detail. In both Barbuda caves, the [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] material was found in red to yellow <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments</b> on the cave floor which were partially overlain by a darker sediment that yielded the introduced Rattus, indicating deposition after the first European contact around 1500. These sediments are probably ancient owl pellets deposited by a burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and they also yielded the frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei; the lizards Thecadactylus rapicauda, Ameiva griswoldi, and Anolis leachii; the birds Puffinus lherminieri, Zenaida aurita, Columbina passerina, Tiaris bicolor, and an unidentified fringillid; and the bats Mormoops blainvillei, Brachyphylla cavernarum, Natalus stramineus, Tadarida brasiliensis, and Molossus molossus. The deposits that included [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] are probably very late Quaternary, but pre-Columbian, and the Antigua material ranges in age from about 2500 BCE to post-Columbian.|$|E
50|$|When {{a shallow}} <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> is {{composed}} of alternating coarse grained and impermeable clay layers the fluid pressure inside the coarser layers may reach a critical value due to lithostatic overburden.

According to the descriptions in Lugo, A. E., 2005, in the NEC there are four forest types: coastal dry forests on volcanic substrate, wet and dry forests in alluvial valleys, coastal rain forests on sandy substrate and lowland rainforests on the volcanic substrate.|$|E
50|$|Soft bottom {{consists}} of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> and unvegetated areas. In some regions soft bottoms are not protected {{even though they}} may be primary nursery areas, anadromous fish spawning areas, and anadromous nursery areas. Characteristics that affect soft bottom in relation to organisms that utilize them include sediment grain size, salinity, dissolved oxygen and flow.|$|R
50|$|Steady state theory - Boulton and Hindmarsh {{propose a}} steady state theory. They suggest tunnel valleys form in <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> when meltwater flows under {{pressure}} through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive removal of sediment by meltwater, ice deforms {{under its own}} weight into the cavity to create a tunnel valley through a positive feedback mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Much of the {{sediment}} deposited along a coast {{is the result}} of erosion of a surrounding cliff, or bluff. Sea cliffs retreat landward because of the constant undercutting of slopes by waves. If the slope/cliff being undercut is made of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> it will erode at a much faster rate then a cliff made of bedrock.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} glaciation, the Baltic Polish area {{was covered in}} ice and {{associated}} morainal sediments. Deglaciation left {{a substantial amount of}} unconsolidated sediment. Currently, these <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments</b> are strongly eroded and reworked by the sea.|$|E

50|$|In USDA soil taxonomy, entisols {{are defined}} as soils that do not show any profile {{development}} other than an A horizon. An entisol has no diagnostic horizons, and most are basically unaltered from their parent material, which can be <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> or rock. Entisols are the second most abundant soil order (after inceptisols), occupying about 16% of the global ice-free land area.|$|R
5000|$|A water gap {{is usually}} an {{indication}} of a river that is older than the current topography. The likely occurrence is that a river established its course when the landform was at a low elevation, or by a rift in {{a portion of the}} crust of the earth having a very low stream gradient and a thick layer of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The order {{covers all}} soils {{where there is}} thick organic layer or humus horizon (< 10 cm) on solid rock (carbonate or not carbonate) or <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> (like sand, loam, loess). Initial soils can be found both in lowland areas and in mountains.

50|$|Dolines (or sinkholes) {{are mostly}} found in its suffusion form. Suffusion dolines are {{depressions}} formed above caves and smaller cavities in <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments.</b> Many dolines in the Eramosa Karst are formed {{by a combination}} of soil piping and erosion of the glacially deposited sediments, overlying the bedrock.|$|E
50|$|Slump {{structures}} are mainly found in sandy shales and mudstones, {{but may also}} be in limestones, sandstones, and evaporites. They {{are a result of}} the displacement and movement of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediments,</b> and are found in areas with steep slopes and fast sedimentation rates. These structures often are faulted.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{dramatic}} uplift along the fault, the fault scarp is very prone to erosion, {{especially if the}} material being uplifted consists of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment.</b> Weathering, mass wasting and water runoff can soon wear down these bluffs, sometimes resulting in V-shaped valleys along runoff channels. Adjacent V-shaped valley formations give the remaining fault spurs a very triangular shape. This formation {{is known as a}} triangular facet; however, this landform is not limited to fault scarps.|$|R
5000|$|Ball-and-pillow {{deformations}} are {{a result}} of a physical shock that has been applied to <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment.</b> This shock causes rupturing to occur in the sedimentary rock layer, which induces instability. Individual lobes caused by this unstable state break off and move downward, settling into the underlying layers. There may also be a repeated lobe detachment, causing a greater downward movement into the sediments below. The [...] "pillows" [...] that have now been produced typically retain their original bedding compositions.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{estimate}} using gravity data {{the thickness}} of post-glacial <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> filling two major glacial valleys in northern Pyrenees: the Gave de Pau valley between Pierrefitte-Nestalas and Lourdes, and the Garonne valley between Saint-Béat and Barbazan. One hundred and eighty-four new gravity data complete 74 measurements obtained from the International Gravimetric Bureau database. Negative residual anomalies resulting from the presence of small-density <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> approach 4 mgal in both the Gave de Pau and the Garonne valleys. Estimating the sediment thickness requires knowing the density contrast between Quaternary sediments and the underlying bedrock. Supposing this density contrast is 600 kg/m 3, the maximum estimated thickness of post-glacial sediment is ∼ 230 and 300 meters, and the volume of sediment is 2. 1 and 3. 2 km 3 in the Gave de Pau and Garonne valleys, respectively. In both valleys, the depth of Quaternary sediment suddenly increases at the confluence between two major glacial valleys (Gave de Pau – Gave de Cauterets, and Garonne – Pique confluences). Overdeepened basins are less deep downstream when approaching terminal moraines (Lourdes and Barbazan area), illustrating that the efficiency of glacial erosion depends on the ice flux flowing through valleys...|$|R
40|$|ABSIT~tACT: Coherent {{masses of}} sand, bound {{together}} by fungal mycelia, {{have been found}} at three wide-spread localities in Michigan. Formation of the masses involved permeation of unconsolidated sand by fungus growing from rotting wood substrates. It is suggested that these masses may consitute precursors for concretions; that their presence in rock would indicate that the preexisting <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> was once in a nonaquatic environment; and that, if they were found in growth position, the masses might serve as geopetal indicators...|$|R
40|$|The {{climax of}} the Kos Plateau Tuff (KPT) {{eruption}} (eastern Aegean, Greece) generated a highly energetic, coarse-grained, lithic-rich, pyroclastic flow. In most places on Kos, the deposit from this event is an ignimbrite (ignimbrite El) that comprises a basal, coarsegrained, lithic breccia and overlying pumiceous part, above a planar, strongly erosional lower contact. However, along the northern coast of central Kos, “normal” ignimbrite El overlies a hummocky, 6 -m-thick layer of chaotic breccia comprising mingled-to-pervasively mixed ignimbrite El and <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment.</b> The surface morphology of the chaotic breccia and its internal texture resemble those of a debris-avalanche deposit, but the breccia is neither proximal nor downcurrent of steep topography. The {{lower part of the}} chaotic breccia comprises distinct domains of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment</b> or lower KPT units that are deformed and/or mingled with pumiceous ignimbrite. The upper part is dominated by a matrix of mingled-to-pervasively mixed ignimbrite and sediment that contains sediment domains as large as 2 – 10 m in diameter. Such large intact allochthonous domains are best preserved {{at the top of the}} chaotic breccia and form the hummocks. The chaotic breccia formed synchronously with the passage of a highly energetic pyroclastic flow where it traversed wet, <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>sediment.</b> Shear-induced liquification, together with possible ground shaking associated with the eruption, probably caused failure. Part of the unconsolidated substrate and basal part of ignimbrite El were dislodged and resedimented a short distance (tens to hundreds of metres) downcurrent. The lower part records deformation and disintegration of the substrate induced by the overriding, shearing flow. Mingling and deformation of the poorly consolidated material occurred as a result of within-flow lateral shear. Attenuated worm burrows within the sediment domains, and pinch-and-swell and flame structures within the mingled domains, preserve evidence of shear in the lower part. The upper part was transported downcurrent above a zone of shear failure. Internal heterogeneities in physical properties resulted in variable strain rates causing some domains to be pervasively mixed while others remained intact. Intact large unconsolidated domains at the top were transported mostly above the zone of shearing...|$|R
