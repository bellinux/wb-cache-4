40|$|The {{medicinal}} {{properties of}} the aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum subsp. angustifolium have been extensively investigated, yet {{little is known about}} the chemical composition or potential uses of the root extracts. In this study, xanthone production in wild plants and plants grown <b>under</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions was investigated. Chemical analyses carried out on wild plants revealed that xanthones were mainly accumulated in the roots. We mainly detected 1, 7 -dihydroxyxanthone, paxanthone, 5 -O-methyl- 2 -deprenylrheediaxanthone B, kielcorin. The roots of wild plants showed low xanthone accumulation. In the roots of plants grown <b>under</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions, xanthone accumulation was 27 times greater than that in the roots of wild-grown plants. Kielcorin was not detected in the roots of plants grown <b>under</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions. As xanthones are known for their antifungal activity, the extracts from both samples were tested against the human fungal pathogens Candida albicans, non-albicansCandida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, and dermatophytes. The root extracts from plants grown <b>under</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions showed greater antifungal activity, probably correlated with higher xanthone accumulation...|$|R
