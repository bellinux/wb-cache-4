500|$|Police constable Martin Spirito {{told the}} court that, on 2 February: [...] "The search {{commenced}} at 10.00am.

It fell from his hand on the ascent." ...|$|E

[...] I get 3 cents a dozen for eggs. [...] I'm lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream. [...] Will you tell me what I've got to lose?" [...] and a cheer went over the audience.

[...] The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> with more sorrow than anger: That means you are writing lies! I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: [...] "Things are not that simple, Rebbe. Some events do take place but are not true; others are—although they never occurred." ...|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter.

[...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
500|$|Free {{from his}} EMI {{contract}} on 9 May 1972, Barrett signed {{a document that}} ended his association with Pink Floyd, and any financial interest in future recordings. Barrett attended an informal jazz and poetry performance by Pete Brown and former Cream bassist Jack Bruce in October 1973. Brown arrived at the show late, and saw that Bruce was already onstage, along with [...] "a guitarist I vaguely recognised", playing the Horace Silver tune [...] "Doodlin'". Later in the show, Brown read out a poem, which he dedicated to Syd, because, [...] "he's here in Cambridge, and he's {{one of the best}} songwriters in the country" [...] when, to his surprise, the guitar player from earlier in the show stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No I'm not". By the end of 1973, Barrett had returned to live in London, staying at various hotels and, in December of that year, settling in at Chelsea Cloisters. He had little contact with others, apart from his regular visits to his management's offices to collect his royalties, and the occasional visit from his sister Rosemary.|$|E

500|$|Watchmen {{was first}} {{mentioned}} publicly in the 1985 Amazing Heroes Preview. When Moore and Gibbons {{turned in the}} first issue of their series to DC, Gibbons recalled, [...] "What really clinched it [...] was [...] Howard Chaykin, who doesn't give praise lightly, and who came <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Dave what you've done on Watchmen is fuckin' A.. Speaking in 1986, Moore said, [...] "DC backed us all the way [...] and have been really supportive about even the most graphic excesses". To promote the series, DC Comics released a limited-edition badge ("button") display card set, featuring characters and images from the series. Ten thousand sets of the four badges, including a replica of the blood-stained smiley face badge worn by the Comedian in the story, were released and sold. Mayfair Games introduced a Watchmen module for its DC Heroes Role-playing Game series that was released before the series concluded. The module, which was endorsed by Moore, adds details to the series' backstory by portraying events that occurred in 1966.|$|E
500|$|When {{speaking}} on the conceptual basis of Ready, Songz said, [...] "You think about a record like 'LOL Smiley Face,' it's something real simple, {{but when you look}} at the title or listen to the record, you're like, 'Wow.' That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1977 tour Bruford {{declined}} {{an offer}} to return as second drummer, leaving Collins searching for a replacement. He heard American drummer Chester Thompson, of Frank Zappa's band and Weather Report, play a drum passage on [...] "More Trouble Every Day" [...] from Zappa's live album Roxy & Elsewhere. Collins said, [...] "It floored me completely ... I had never met him. I rang him <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hi Chester, I've heard your stuff, {{would you like to}} play with Genesis?' ... He didn't even audition!" [...] Genesis toured Wind & Wuthering from January to July 1977 across Europe, North America, and for the first time, Brazil. The stage show cost £400,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). which featured a new PA system, lasers and smoke, and lighting supplied from two rows of Boeing 747 aircraft landing lights. Touring began on 1 January with three sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where 80,000 applications were made for the 8,000 available tickets. They returned to London for three nights at Earls Court, then the largest arena in Britain, supported by Richie Havens. The band's growing popularity in North America led to television appearances and concerts organised in larger venues than previous tours, including Madison Square Garden in New York City. Their Brazilian dates were attended by over 150,000 people and a proposed 100,000-person gig was cancelled over rioting fears. An armed bodyguard accompanied each member throughout their stay.|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This is trying to be creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

We could not quite get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I looked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> {{we are not going}} out that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of the}} soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment.
