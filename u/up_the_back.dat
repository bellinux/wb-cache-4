5|$|MacFarlane {{developed}} a Family Guy spin-off called The Cleveland Show, {{which focuses on}} the character of Cleveland Brown and his family. The idea for the show originated from a suggestion by Family Guy writer and voice of Cleveland, Mike Henry. Fox ordered 22 episodes and the series first aired on September 27, 2009. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered. Due to strong ratings, Fox picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> nine episodes of season 2, making a 22-episode season and bringing the total episode count of the show to 44. The series ended on May 19, 2013, with a total of 4 seasons and 88 episodes, and the character of Cleveland returned to Family Guy in the episode He's Bla-ack!. This is the only animated series created by MacFarlane that does not have him voicing the main character.|$|E
5|$|The talonid, {{another group}} of cusps, makes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the tooth. It is wider than long and {{contains}} a well-developed cusp, the hypoconid, on the outer side and a depression, the talonid basin, in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller hypoconulid cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by a cutting edge which is suggestive {{of the presence of}} a metacone cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the entocristid, rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is swollen and on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct entoconid cusp is absent. This entocristid is continuous with the lingual cingulum.|$|E

However, Butler did send an expedition <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> River with naval support on June 24, 1861 which destroyed 14 transports and several small boats which had {{supplies for the}} Confederate forces. Both sides generally continued to hold and improve their positions and works until the Peninsula campaign began.|$|E
25|$|When {{dragged through}} a field the coulter cuts {{down into the}} soil and the share cuts {{horizontally}} from the previous furrow to the vertical cut. This releases a rectangular strip of sod that is then lifted by the share and carried by the mouldboard up and over, so that the strip of sod (slice of the topsoil) that is being cut lifts and rolls over as the plough moves forward, dropping {{back to the ground}} upside down into the furrow and onto the turned soil from the previous run down the field. Each gap in the ground where the soil has been lifted and moved across (usually to the right) is called a furrow. The sod that has been lifted from it rests at about a 45 degree angle in the next-door furrow and lies <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the sod from the previous run.|$|E

25|$|The Guthrie's design arose out of Ralph Rapson's {{work with}} the Walker Art Center, and {{concepts}} the Walker was considering for a small auditorium near their museum. The result was a theater designed by Rapson, that seated 1,441 people when it first opened its doors in 1963. Its irregularly-shaped stage, designed by Tanya Moiseiwitsch, had 7 sides and took up 1120 square feet (104 m²). Seating radiated outward and upward, and the ceiling was hung with acoustical panels that carried the asymmetrical theme {{to the top of}} the theater. The design concept encouraged the use of a minimal use of large set pieces. In 1974 the distinctive exterior screen, which had suffered from corrosion by the elements over the years, was removed. In 1980 Artistic Director Liviu Ciulei redesigned the stage. The stage itself was modified so that its size, shape and height was adjustable, and he opened <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> wall to create more depth.|$|E
500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he could feel his skin crawling <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of his neck the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E

Due to course scheduling conflicts she was permitted to take the more challenging boys' course, although she had to sit <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the class. She entered Ohio State University, from which she received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1924. She then went on to earn a Doctor of Philosophy at the [...] University of Chicago, writing her thesis on [...] "Stereoisomeric Bromoimino Ketones" [...] under the supervision of Julius Stieglitz.|$|E

I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|Carlisle's 1903 {{season was}} a success, {{with only two}} losses. The 12–11 defeat by Harvard is known for the [...] "hunch-back", or [...] "hidden-ball", play which Warner learned from Heisman; he had a tailor sew elastic bands into the waists of several players' jerseys before the game so the play could be executed. It was used during a Harvard kickoff; when the ball was caught, Carlisle formed {{a circle around the}} {{returner}} and pushed the ball <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the player's (altered) jersey. Carlisle then broke the huddle and spread out in different directions. Each player except the returner (who had the hidden ball) pretended to carry the football. The ruse confused the Harvard players, who scrambled to find the ball carrier, and the returner (ignored, with both hands free) ran untouched into the end zone. Warner's next step was a brief return to Cornell.|$|E

The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking to the BBC, Finch said Ruth [...] "is strong willed, {{determined}} and pretty direct in her {{approach to life}} and people in general." [...] Finch explained having breast cancer mellowed Ruth and instead of fighting her corner, she is quite likely to negotiate instead. Finch added her character appreciates life day to day. Robert Hanks writing for The Independent described Ruth as The Archers [...] "matriarch-in-waiting" [...] and said she is [...] "a family lynchpin – loyal wife, loving mother, and handy in the milking-shed when called on." [...] Simon Frith and Chris Arnot, authors of The Archers Archives, opined Ruth is not a stereotypical farmer's wife. They said [...] "Ruth {{is more likely to}} have her hand in a rubber glove rather than an oven glove – thrust <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> end of a Friesian rather than delving into an Aga and emerging with something wholesome for supper." ...|$|E
500|$|From the skin, {{the brain}} {{receives}} information about fine touch, pressure, pain, vibration and temperature. From the joints, the brain receives information about joint position. The sensory cortex is found just near the motor cortex, and, like the motor cortex, has areas related to sensation from different body parts. Sensation collected by a sensory receptor {{on the skin}} is changed to a nerve signal, that is passed {{up a series of}} neurons through tracts in the spinal cord. The posterior column–medial lemniscus pathway contains information about fine touch, vibration and position of joints. Neurons travel <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> part of the spinal cord to the back part of the medulla, where they connect with [...] "second order" [...] neurons that immediately swap sides. These neurons then travel upwards into the ventrobasal complex in the thalamus where they connect with [...] "third order" [...] neurons, and travel up to the sensory cortex.The spinothalamic tract carries information about pain, temperature, and gross touch. Neurons travel up the spinal cord and connect with second-order neurons in the reticular formation of the brainstem for pain and temperature, and also at the ventrobasal complex of the medulla for gross touch.|$|E
500|$|Uprising {{supports}} {{both local}} and online multiplayer. Along with the game's single-player story mode, the game also features multiplayer {{for up to six}} players locally or via wi-fi. Players can compete in team-based cooperative matches or free-for-all melees using standard fighter characters. In the team-based mode, named Light vs. Dark, each team has a health meter that depletes when a player is defeated. The value of the player's weapon determines how far the meter depletes after death, and the player whose death depletes the meter completely will become their team's angel, a more powerful character who represents the team. The match ends when the other team's angel is defeated. In addition to normal ways of playing, Uprising comes bundled with a 3DS stand for the platform for ease of play. Augmented Reality (AR) Cards, collected by players, can be used as part of a card contest. Using the 3DS' outer camera, the AR Cards produce [...] "Idols" [...] (representations of characters from Uprising): by lining <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> edges of two AR Cards and selecting the [...] "Fight" [...] option, Idols appear from the cards and battle each other, with the winner being determined by its statistics.|$|E

500|$|On March 1, Scarborough, Tamar, Cherokee, and Hinchinbrook sailed up the Savannah River to Five-Fathom Hole, {{accompanying}} transports {{carrying two}} to three hundred men under Grant's command. Hinchinbrook {{and one of the}} transports then sailed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> River. [...] The transport anchored opposite the port area, while Hinchinbrook, in an attempt to take a position above the town, grounded on a sandbank in the river. [...] Gunfire from Joseph Habersham's militia cleared Hinchinbrook decks, but without suitable boats, Habersham was unable to attempt the taking of the vessel, which floated free on the next high tide. [...] Late on the evening of March 2, Grant's men were landed on Hutchinson Island. [...] They made their way across the island, and, at 4:00 am on March 3, took over a number of the rice boats anchored near the island. [...] Due to their success at remaining quiet, and possibly with the collusion of the ship captains, the alarm was not raised in Savannah until 9:00 am. [...] The arrival of the ships on March 1 prompted the Committee of Safety to issue calls for the defense of the town and the ships, which were forwarded along with a request for assistance to South Carolina's Committee of Safety the next day.|$|E

Fanning has also said of Coghill [...] "He likes to antagonise people, and I don't mean that in a mean way", and continued to say jokingly that [...] "It makes me want to smash him sometimes." [...] Guitarist Darren Middleton says of Coghill [...] "Jon likes movies with explosions in them", and has also described him as stubborn. Fellow guitarist Ian Haug says Coghill is an excellent arranger, explaining [...] "he can listen to it all, just sort of sit back and go, 'Okay, that's a really good bit.'" [...] Coghill himself has described himself as a [...] "superhero". He has also stated that he shares the band's hatred of band photos. Coghill says he shares the stereotype of drummers being the most [...] "out there" [...] member of the band. He says this is true because [...] "We have so much energy...We’re stuck <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and we’re more likely to do stupid shit to get rid of it." [...] In 2008, Coghill studied a mixture of politics and law at Griffith University. He is currently a journalist for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
