This new acronym has been created not only to refer to shipwrecks of modern vessels, but also for other types of marine sites such as dumping areas, pipelines, etc. Independent of the specific type, a PPMS represents a potential source of pollution for the marine environment. Although several type-specific databases are available worldwide (from local to global scale), there is an evident lack of <b>uniformity</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> different aims of data collection). A common approach description of these sites at local single-site level may permit aggregation for multiscale decisions, e. g., for remediation and incident response. To adequately manage these sites, a standardized PPMS geospatial database (GeoDB) application has been designed to collect relevant information suitable for site inventory and geo-spatial analysis. In particular, benefits in structuring the data in conformance with the Universal Hydrographic Data Model (IHO S- 100) and encoding using the Geographic Markup Language (GML) are presented. A possible practical storage solution is proposed using a GML-enabled spatial relational database management system. Finally, a Web GIS deployment is illustrated, being the simplest way to communicate to the public the collected information, with the related possibility of using the data as a Web Map Service in almost any GIS, allowing for better development and integration with other available datasets.

40|$|Natural {{light is}} a vital force for human beings. Successful {{daylighting}} in buildings requires trade-offs and optimization between competing design aspects (e. g. light distribution, glare, solar gains, views, etc.), whilst also including consideration of façade layout, space configuration, internal finishes and choice/operation of shading devices. However, to design energy-sustainable built environments which are conducive to human health, these variables have necessarily to be related also with biological and behavioural factors such as metabolic rhythms, psychological stimulation and occupants’ preferences. Basing on a multidisciplinary review of existing literature, this paper looks at the relationship between quantitative physical measures of the luminous environment (e. g. horizontal and vertical illuminance, luminance ratio, correlated colour temperature), qualitative aspects of vision (e. <b>g.</b> <b>uniformity,</b> distribution), and psycho-physiological human response to natural light. The aim of the study consists in defining a framework to implement existing daylighting practices basing not solely on photopic requirements but also containing awareness of the demands for psychological and photobiological stimulation, so as to positively influence the health of occupants whilst enhancing energy savings. <br /...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{was asked}} by Itzkowitz in 1976 {{whether or not the}} {{equality}} of left and right uniformities on a locally compact group G could be decided by sequences. Twelve years later, the question was answered in the affirmative: For the left and right <b>uniformities</b> on <b>G</b> to be equal, it is necessary and sufficient that for each sequence (hn) in G and each neighborhood V of the identity e in G, the set ∩nϵNhn− 1 Vhn should be a neighborhood of e. Two independent proofs of this unexpected result were proposed, one in the spirit of set-theoretic topology (Pestov), and the other based on finite-dimensional Lie theory (Itzkowitz, Rothman, Strassberg and Wu). Shortly after, Hansel and Troallic referred to techniques of harmonic analysis to prove that a symmetric set B of automorphisms of G is equicontinuous if and only if the countable subsets of B are equicontinuous (G being endowed with its left uniformity). This substantially betters the aforementioned property, which can be obtained if B is chosen as the set of all inner automorphisms of G. In this paper, we re-examine the result and consider it in a maximal generality. We obtain the following basic property: Let X be a quasi-k-space (for example a locally compact space), Y a uniform space and H a subset of C(X,Y); then H is equicontinuous if and only if for each countable subset A of X and each countable subset D of H, the set D|A of restrictions to A of mappings of D is equicontinuous. Several applications of this criterion are given, among which a strengthened version of a well-known theorem of Corson and Glicksberg. In the last section, the technique is applied to the sets of inner automorphisms of topological groups, and a refinement of the result by Itzkowitz, Pestov, Rothman, Strassberg and Wu is obtained...|$|R

In this paper we give the first proof which determines B(G,Z 2) for all possible bipartite graphs G. In fact, we prove a much more general result from which B(G,Z 2) can be deduced: Let G be a (not necessarily connected) bipartite graph, which can be embedded in Kn,n, and let F be a field. A function f: E(Kn,n) → F is called G-stable if every copy of G in Kn,n has the same weight (the weight of a copy {{is the sum of}} the values of f on its edges). The set of all G-stable functions, denoted by U(G,Kn,n, F) is a linear space which is called the Kn,n <b>uniformity</b> space of <b>G</b> over F.

40|$|The authors {{present and}} test {{a model of}} schismatic {{processes}} in social groups. According to this model, schismatic intentions are caused by the perception that a proposed new norm fundamen-tally changes a central aspect of group identity. Also, {{the impact of this}} perception on schismatic intentions is mediated by the belief that group identity has been subverted, whose effect on schismatic intentions is, in turn, mediated by perceived inability to voice dissent and perceived lack of group entitativity. Data from officials of the Church of England who are against the ordi-nation of women to the priesthood (N = 211) fit the predicted model. For decades, social psychologists have explored the processes that lead social groups to achieve oneness and <b>uniformity</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> Cartwright & Zander, 1968; Festinger, 1950; Nemeth & Staw, 1989). However, despite an unde-niable propensity to cohere and to seek consensus, most social groups are internally divided into subgroups (Hornsey & Hogg, 2000). What is more, in some situa-tions the members of a subgroup may decide to undergo a schism (Liebman, Sutton, & Wuthnow, 1988; Worchel, 1984); that is, they may leave the parent group either to form a breakaway group or to join a different group. Schisms are most clearly associated with religion, where division is endemic (e. g., Blasi, 1989; Rochford & Burke, 1989). However, they tend to occur in many other types of groups, such as political parties (Husbands, 1988), nations (Hassan, 1993), professional organiza-tions (Savoye, 1981), social movements (Mamiya, 1982), and sporting associations (Defrance, 1989). In sum, schisms constitute a widespread phenomenon; there are few groups that have not been affected by a schism at some stage of their development. Most existing groups were born as a breakaway group, have witnessed the secession of subgroups, or were joined by a group that had previously seceded from another group. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore the social psychological factors involved in the schismatic process...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{substantiate}} {{an extensive}} use of daylight in commercial buildings {{it is necessary to}} demonstrate that, other than just providing potential energy savings, natural lighting can foster further benefits (financial, environmental and in terms of productivity) for both the owners and the occupants. Specifying daylighting solutions for energy efficiency can be a very complex task, where many factors (e. g. illuminance, glare, solar gains, views) can diverge from each other making design choices extremely difficult. Nonetheless, to foster the design of energy-conscious buildings which are also conducive to human well-being, these variables have to be related with qualitative and behavioural factors such as time/duration of exposure, directionality and spectral composition of visible radiation, psychological stimulation and user preference. Correlating literature research with lighting standards and field measurements, this paper looks at the relationship between quantitative physical factors of the luminous environment (e. g. horizontal/vertical illuminance, luminance ratio, colour temperature), qualitative aspects of vision (e. <b>g.</b> <b>uniformity,</b> distribution, contrast) and physio-psychological human response to daylighting. The aim of the study consists in defining a framework to implement existing recommendations based not only on photopic requirements for visual tasks but also containing awareness of the demands for photobiological stimulation that can influence the well-being of occupants, whilst also enhancing energy savings...|$|R

The results of simulation show that a noticeable depletion zone of protein also exists around a growing crystal in liquid/liquid diffusion chamber under 0 g condition. The gravity-driven convection decreases {{the thickness of the}} depletion zone seriously. Furthermore, influenced by the solutal convection, the protein concentration and solution supersaturation at the crystal/solution interface are much higher in 1 g case than in 0 g case. In addition, in our case the computed gravity-driven convection had more complicated pattern and higher strength than those known for the batch and vapor diffusion crystallizations. Our simulation also shows that the uniformity of concentration and supersaturation distributions at the crystal/solution interface could be improved by the gravity-driven convection. The lower <b>uniformity</b> in 0 <b>g</b> case is owing to the initial gradient distribution of protein concentration in liquid/liquid diffusion crystalliza-tion, but it could be improved by adjusting the initial conditions of protein crystallization. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{technology}} {{used for the}} fabrication of microelectronics devices and microelectro- mechanical systems (MEMS) {{is based on the}} successive deposition or growth of planar layers and the subsequent transfer of the desired pattern onto these layers. Lithography and plasma or wet etching are the essential steps of this technology. Profile control of the etched structures is necessary for the efficient operation of the corresponding microelectronics devices and MEMS. The loss of microscopic <b>uniformity</b> (e. <b>g</b> reactive ion etching lag) and deviations from the perfectly anisotropic profiles of the structures (e. g. microtrenching, sidewall bowing, roughness) are etching artifacts that make the profile control difficult. There is a need to understand the mechanisms causing these artifacts and suppress them. Besides experimental study, topography evolution simulation of the etched structures can contribute to this direction. The goal of this work is the development of an integrated simulation framework for the topography evolution of structures etched with plasma. This framework links the bulk plasma gas phase with the profile of the etched structure and consists of: 1) A local flux calculation model. Shadowing and reemission of flux are taken into account. This model links the species fluxes in the bulk plasma gas phase with the local species fluxes inside features. 2) A surface etch model. This model includes the processes during the etching of SiO 2 and Si surface with fluorocarbon plasma. The surface model is a phenomenological model that takes into account the competitive phenomena of etching and deposition occurring during etching with fluorocarbon plasma. The model is based on site balances on the etched surface and links the species local fluxes with the local etching rate. 3) An algorithm for the topography evolution of the etched features. The level set method is implemented. The algorithm uses the local etching rate to move the topography of the etched structures. The third component of the simulation framework, the topography evolution algorithm, is a general boundary evolution algorithm, which can be applied in several areas, such as the evolution of an interface between two fluids in fluid mechanics. The coupling of the first two models of the simulation framework [components (1) and (2) ] that yields the local etching rate, defines the boundary evolution problem that the boundary evolution algorithm, namely the level set method, solves. ...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{structure}} of epitaxial graphene formed on polar faces of SiC - the (0001) face, {{also known as the}} Si-face, and the (0001) face, known as the C-face. On both polar surfaces, graphene films are prepared in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), in environments either of argon or cryogenically purified neon, or in a low-pressure background of disilane. Characterization of graphene is done by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM). In addition, a dynamical LEED structure calculation is performed to analyze the interface structures formed between graphene films and the C-face of SiC. When SiC is heated at high temperature, Si atoms preferentially sublimate from the surface, leaving behind excess C atoms that self-rearrange to form graphene on the surface. We find, in agreement with other reports, that the structure and the electrical properties of graphene films formed on the two polar faces are very different, in many aspects. For example, in all environments we have employed, the graphene formation rate is slower on the Si-face than that on the C-face under the same preparation condition. Also, graphene films formed on the Si-face are generally more homogeneous and the domain sizes are larger, compared to those formed on the C-face (by “domain”, we mean a surface area with constant thickness of multilayer graphene). On the Si-face, graphene lattice vectors are rotated 30 º with respect to the SiC lattice vectors as observed by LEED, while on the C-face, graphene films are usually rotationally disordered which gives rise to streaking in the diffraction pattern. In addition, the electrical properties of graphene films are also quite different between these two polar surfaces. These differences between the two polar surfaces, we believe, {{can be attributed to the}} differences of interface structures between graphene films and the underlying substrate. In this thesis, we report our interpretation of these differences in terms of the detailed interface structures that form for graphene on the two polar surfaces. For the Si-face, graphene films prepared in vacuum are of moderate quality; thickness <b>uniformity</b> e. <b>g.</b> for a film with average thickness of two graphene monolayer (ML) ranges between about 1 and 3 ML, and the surface morphology of the underlying SiC is found to contain numerous small pits. In this thesis, we report improvements in the morphology of graphene films for the Si-face utilizing environments of disilane, 1 atm of argon or 1 atm cryogenically purified neon. The presence of disilane, argon, or neon gas decreases Si sublimation rate, thus increasing the temperature required for graphene formation. The higher graphitization temperature enhances the mobility of diffusing species, which in turn results in an improved morphology of the graphene films. For the case of the C-face, graphene prepared in vacuum is of considerably worse quality than for the Si-face; a film with average thickness of 2 ML will contains areas covered by 0 – 5 ML of graphene. In order to improve the quality of graphene, the same preparation techniques (graphitization in 1 atm of argon, 1 atm purified neon, or in disilane) as we have used for the Siface are employed for the C-face. When graphene is prepared in argon on the C-face, the morphology is found to become much worse (unlike the improvement found for the Si-face). We find that the surface becomes unintentionally oxidized before the graphene formation (due to residual oxygen in the argon), and hence become resistant to graphitization. This unintentional oxidization results in inhomogeneous islands of thick graphene forming over the surface. In contrast, utilizing purified neon can eliminate the unintentional oxidation while permitting increased preparation temperatures, and thus is found to improve the morphology of graphene on the C-face. Use of a low-pressure background of disilane yields a similar improvement. The morphology of graphene on both polar surfaces of SiC in these various environments is reported in detail in this thesis. In terms of interface structure, the situation is presently well understood for the Si-face: the interface consists of a C-rich layer having 6 √ 3 × 6 √ 3 − 30 ° symmetry, which is covalently bonded to the underlying SiC substrate. This interface on the Si-face acts as an electronic “buffer” layer between graphene films and substrate and provides a template for subsequent graphene formation. It is noteworthy that this interface on the Si-face occurs for all growth conditions. In contrast, formation of interface structures on the C-face is sensitive to both the starting surface of SiC and graphene preparation conditions. In this thesis, the graphene/SiC interface on the C-face is studied by varying the preparation conditions (sample temperature T, and silicon partial pressure PSi). In vacuum, a 3 × 3 reconstruction is found before and after graphitization. At relatively low PSi of 5 ´ 10 - 6 Torr, a 2 × 2 reconstruction is found, both before and after graphene formation. When graphene is formed on the C-face using 5 ´ 10 - 5 Torr of disilane (or using 1 atm of neon), a new interface structure forms between the graphene films and the underlying substrate, which displays √ 43 × √ 43 − ± 7. 6 ° (√ 43 for short) symmetry as revealed by in situ LEED immediately after graphitization. When subsequent oxidation of the surface is performed, the interface structure transforms to one with √ 3 × √ 3 − 30 ° symmetry. Electron reflectivity measurements coupled with the recent published first-principles computations indicate that the new interface structures consists a graphene-like layer that forms between the graphene and the underlying substrate, similar to that found on the Si-face. This graphene-like layer has the √ 43 symmetry due to bonding to the underlying SiC, but upon oxidation, these bonds are broken and the layer becomes “decoupled” from the SiC. The decoupled graphene-like layer then becomes a graphene layer. From a dynamical LEED structure calculation for the oxidized C-face surface, it is found that the interface structure transforms to that of a graphene layer sitting on top of a silicate (Si 2 O 3) layer, with the silicate layer having the well-known structure as previously studied on bare SiC(0001) surfaces. A separate project discussed in this thesis is determination of size, shape, and composition of InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QD) by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and finite-element calculation. Cross-sectional STM images and finite-element calculations reveal individual InAs QDs having a lens shape with maximum base diameter of 10. 5 nm and height of 2. 9 nm. Comparison between the STM data and the computational results of the displacement of the dot profile out from the cleavage surface, together with measurements of its local lattice parameter, leads to an accurate determination of the cation composition as varying from 65 % indium at the base of the QD to 95 % at its center and back to 65 % at its apex...|$|R
