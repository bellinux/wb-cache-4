500|$|As Hornsby {{recalled}} later, Ruth [...] "didn't say a word. He didn't {{even look}} around or <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> He just picked {{himself up and}} walked away". Ruth's failed attempt to steal second base ended {{the game and the}} 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2016, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield.|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game â€“ the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{sat down}} and looked at him, and he stood <b>up</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{stepped back}} into the little hall. They were talking {{together}} earnestly. Arthur looked <b>up</b> and glared <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me he gave a little start of surprise; he {{certainly}} straightened <b>up</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> hard.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he looked}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, and swore {{one of his}} great oaths.|$|E

60|$|I {{had given}} him no time to speak, nor did he seem so inclined.

60|$|Isaac looked <b>up</b> {{in amazement}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and Melissa craning our necks {{over the edge}} of the roof. Then he saw the dog and took in the situation. The {{creature}} actually grinned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep them," [...] he said, and {{snatched}} at a yawn. He stood <b>up,</b> stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, and smiled. [...] "You {{have had two}} eventful days," [...] said he.
