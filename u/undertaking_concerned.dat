Dogmatism was measured by the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale (Form E) included in the ques-tionnaire. Performance was determined by supervisor ratings using the paired comparison technique. The data revealed a slight negative relationship (gamma =-. 19) between dogmatism and performance. This relationship was affected by the age and level of education of the respondents.

40|$|The {{standard}} of English of Hong Kong students {{is a matter}} of considerable debate. Academics, business people and others bemoan the deterioration of English-speaking skills and the declining quality of students. Explanations for this situation include the introduction of mass education, the lack of trained English teachers and an exam-centred curriculum. Yet, little research has been <b>undertaken</b> <b>concerning</b> student intellectual ability and English skills. This short report examines the English skills of 146 undergraduates using the ACER Word Knowledge Test - Form F, and their abstract reasoning ability using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices.
