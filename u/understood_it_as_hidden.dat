60|$|Mr. Candy {{understood}} the suggestion, {{and showed me}} that he <b>understood</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> an insult.|$|R
5000|$|Jenny cognitively {{assesses the}} snake in her presence. Cognition {{allows her to}} <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a danger.|$|R
30|$|Although in the novel, Ghosh {{uses the}} word “Brahma,” I <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> “Brahman” due to the {{characteristics}} used to describe it.|$|R
2500|$|The later Stoics <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the account which governs everything," [...] and Hippolytus, in the 3rd century CE, {{identified}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{meaning the}} Christian Word of God.|$|R
25|$|Verb meaning: when a pre-school child {{hears the}} verb 'fill', he <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the action 'pour' {{rather than the}} result, which is 'make full'.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{been free}} {{to return and}} wait for Lord John?"--that was {{the sense in which}} the elder woman {{appeared}} to prefer to <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> speaking.|$|R
5000|$|... "Once we <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a leading, {{that enabled}} us to <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> {{in the way we}} think... We came to share Jim's leading, as a way of giving {{something}} to the entire Houston community that was important." ...|$|R
5000|$|Steeleye Span {{recorded}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a <b>hidden</b> {{track on}} their 2009 album, Cogs, Wheels and Lovers.|$|R
2500|$|Schopenhauer {{refused to}} {{conceive}} of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man's psyche and dramatically shaped the world: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nephew Alec. He <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> well as I do. Well, now, I'm real {{glad you}} asked me to stay to supper. I'm proper hungry--didn't have much of a dinner today." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Living Nature": Faivre {{argued that}} all esotericists {{envision}} the natural universe as being {{imbued with its}} own life force, and that <b>as</b> such they <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> being [...] "complex, plural, hierarchical".|$|R
25|$|Rabbi Elijah Benamozegh, an Italian Kabbalist, {{wrote that}} were {{evolution}} {{to become a}} mainstay of scientific theory, it would not contradict the Torah as long <b>as</b> one <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> having been guided by God.|$|R
60|$|Either, methinks, 'plays' {{should be}} 'play'd,' or 'and' {{should be changed}} to 'while.' I can {{certainly}} <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a parenthesis, an interadditive of scorn; {{but it does not}} sound to my ear as in Shakspeare's manner.|$|R
60|$|Doocheek {{was present}} {{and heard the}} question, but of course did not <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was put in the Dogrib tongue. The search, however, which {{immediately}} began induced him to retire promptly and absent himself from home for the time being.|$|R
50|$|McDowell writes further, in his {{interpretation}} of Wittgenstein, that to understand rule-following we should <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> resulting from inculcation into a custom or practice. Thus, to understand addition, is simply to have been inculcated into a practice of adding.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} episodes of mutual fear and hatred between Tabitha and the murderers/conspirators. Elizabeth can't <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> she's always known Tabitha as a sweet cat that {{everyone}} loves. Michael believes it's because the cat knows why Ella disappeared.|$|R

5|$|The reading 'Avete vos' is {{from the}} fifteenth century manuscripts and editions. In this case the emperor is simply {{returning}} the salutation. The literal meaning is, however, 'be well', 'be safe', or 'be sound', and the gladiators <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> dismissing them.|$|R
60|$|Limb. This lingua, {{what you}} call it, is the most rarest language! I <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> if <b>it</b> were English; you shall see me answer him: Seignioro, stay a littlo, and {{consider}} wello, ten guinnio is monyo, a very considerablo summo.|$|R
50|$|Cruise {{recorded}} {{a new version}} of the song and released <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a <b>hidden</b> track on her 2002 album The Art of Being a Girl.|$|R
5000|$|She also <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "not {{primarily}} a unified academic discipline or one delineated, hybridic artform", {{but rather as}} an [...] "area of joint practical and critical investigation of the many uses writing and language are being put to and push themselves into." ...|$|R
6000|$|The above {{title is}} an unfortunate one, {{but since it}} is widely used we must try to <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> best we can. Yet when one begins to define [...] "classicism" [...] one is {{reminded}} of that old bore Polonius, who tells how Hamlet is affected: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have some}} {{business}} with the purser, who is waiting for me, but cannot find my señora," [...] he explained, and Dick, knowing that local conventions forbade his leaving Clare alone, <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a request that he should {{take care of her}} until the other's return.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{feasible}} to <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{the means and}} art that combine fixed projected images (slides or digital support) in its montage, accompanied by sounds of a different nature, therefore meaning a language different from the film, since it does not use the image in motion.|$|R
30|$|When it is {{not easy}} to test a {{specific}} piece of code, developers <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a class design smell. When this happens, developers usually try to refactor the code to make it easier to test. A participant also affirmed that he takes <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a rule; if it is hard to test, then the code may be improved.|$|R
2500|$|He {{was born}} with tetra-amelia without some fully formed limbs. According to his autobiography, his mother refused to see him or hold him while the nurse held {{him in front of}} her, but she and her husband {{eventually}} accepted their son's condition and <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "God's plan for their son".|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a view of}} medical employees on nurse process in use. If they <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an instrument for {{improving the quality of}} nurse care, or what are their knowledge about this matter. Last but not lease what is their thought of suitable using nurse process and in which internal condition...|$|R
50|$|Most people {{familiar}} with this term <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the one who introduces superproduction, mainly based {{on the story of}} Wincenty Pstrowski, a miner who in 1947 achieved 270 percent of expected efficiency per month. Later Pstrowski died due to misconducted dental intervention, but in popular opinion it was due to deadly exhaustion.|$|R
25|$|While {{the problem}} {{had long been}} well <b>understood</b> by planners, <b>it</b> {{is not clear that}} the public <b>understood</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> well, or that it widely {{influenced}} development, buying or building decisions. Liquefaction risk at the Pegasus Town site was identified in 2005, so the developers spent approximately $20 million on soil compaction, and the ground there held firm during the quake.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possibility}} {{is to not}} understand the name of Vinland as fixed to one defined location, but as merely referring to every location where vínber could be found, i.e. to <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a common noun, vinland, {{rather than as a}} toponym, Vinland. The Old Norse and Icelandic languages were, and are, fusional languages.|$|R
50|$|The third {{screenplay}} took 91 days {{to write}} and {{to the surprise of}} Kasahara, it was the most successful at the time. The writer said he did not <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the film made no sense to him and was curious what the audience saw, before suggesting that it must have been Kinji Fukasaku's direction.|$|R
40|$|This study {{intends to}} follow the {{relationship}} concept in different approaches of the family therapy, adding the reading from Deleuze of that concept in Espinosa's work. The Psychoanalysis understands that the family relationship comes from an unconscious family structure. The Systemic theory <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a standard group interaction. The Si-Cibernectic <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a builder of recursive contexts. Independent of the theory it is essential in clinic practice. Several readings from these theories develop, as Gilles Deleuze understands, an interiority treatment, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> tries to explain the reality through the suggested models. Using a reasoning of exteriority based on Deleuze's ideas about Espinosa, the family relationship molds various types of expressions connecting the parts of each one and {{the parts of the}} group. It is in the engagement of the active forces and the passive forces that the family devises, opens to connections or closes to the circulation of life...|$|R
25|$|Culture is {{understood}} as the sphere in which the human being is educated and knows himself, in which values are formed, in which he recognizes and appreciates truth, goodness, and beauty. It is a fundamental area of apostolate for the Sodalitium, which <b>understands</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a school of humanity, {{and at the same}} time a space for human fulfillment.|$|R

5000|$|Friedrich Nietzsche [...] {{claimed that}} there is no art for art’s sake. He asked: [...] "…what does all art do? does it not praise? glorify? select? highlight?
