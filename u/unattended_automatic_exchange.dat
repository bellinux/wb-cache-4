5000|$|The use {{of letters}} on dials was {{proposed}} in 1917 by W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T. Large cities like New York would ultimately require a seven-digit number, but some {{tests in the}} early 1900s indicated that the short-term memory span of many people could not handle seven digits and many dialling errors due to memory lapse might occur (the documentation for these tests is lost). Hence the first Panel <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> cutover in 1915 in Newark, New Jersey used [...] "semiautomatic" [...] operation with the local operator keying the number for the caller. And as large cities would have both manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> for some years, the numbers for manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{would have the same}} format (originally MULberry 3456, with three letters then four numbers), which could be either spoken or dialled.|$|R

After the banking scandals of 2008 {{and the subsequent}} global financial crisis, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for TaxPurposes has proposed the exchange of information upon request as the fiscal transparency standard. However, some measures adopted by the European Union, previous initiatives from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and, above all, {{the introduction of the}} Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca) by the United States in 2010 have promoted the need to adopt the <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information as the new fiscal transparency standard. <b>Automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information allows home countries to verify whether their taxpayers have correctly included foreign income, allowing tax authorities to have early warning of possible noncompliance cases.

50|$|The {{earliest}} musical fountains {{were played}} manually by a live operator, who usually controlled pumps or valves and sometimes lights {{by way of}} switches on a control panel. Music was almost always live. Later, choreography could be prerecorded on a punched paper card which was scanned by a computer; and even later, it could be recorded on magnetic tape or, in the most modern shows, on a CD along with the music. Even so, the choreography is still usually painstakingly programmed by hand, some types of shows being played live from a control console and connected to a computer that records the operator's actions for later automatic playback. Recent advances in technology provides for <b>unattended</b> <b>automatic</b> choreography that can rival manual programming.|$|R
40|$|Resume in English Name of the thesis: "GATCA" and its {{integration}} into legal {{order of the}} Czech Republic The diploma thesis deals with legislation regulating <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information in tax matters based on the Common Reporting Standard On Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information (also known as Common Reporting Standard) usually {{referred to as a}} GATCA system and its {{integration into}} legal order of the Czech Republic. A main goal of the legislation is to secure higher public incomes for public budgets and to weaken a position of tax havens in relation to tax evasion by taxpayers. The GATCA system legislation and its integration into legal order of the Czech Republic are evaluated in accordance with this goal. One of the main conclusions of the diploma thesis is considering some possible loopholes of the GATCA system that may be used by taxpayers to avoid duties imposed on them by legislation regulating <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information in tax matters and suggesting solutions that should be used to close these loopholes. The greatest GATCA system's loophole is its relation to the another system of <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information in tax matters known as a FATCA system and based on the US federal statute Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and intergovernmental agreements between [...] ...|$|R
