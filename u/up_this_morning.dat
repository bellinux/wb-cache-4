500|$|March 1968, at a jam at the Scene club in New York City, later {{released}} on Woke <b>Up</b> <b>This</b> <b>Morning</b> and Found Myself Dead. [...] Unlike his other versions, Hendrix used a guitar figure similar to Cream's [...] "Crossroads".|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 1917, Kerensky {{declared}} Russia a republic. Michael {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "We woke <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to hear Russia declared a Republic. What does it matter which form the government will be {{as long as there}} is order and justice?" [...] Two weeks later, Michael's house arrest was lifted. Kerensky had armed the Bolsheviks after a power struggle with the commander-in-chief and in October there was a second revolution as the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former colleague of Michael from the Savage Division who was now a commander in Petrograd, Michael planned to move his family to the greater safety of Finland. They packed valuables and prepared to move, but their preparations were seen by Bolshevik sympathisers and they were placed once more under house arrest. The last of Michael's cars were seized by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening {{series of}} songs have {{straightforward}} lyrics. On [...] "Back to Love", Bilal flatters his date's shoes and {{is backed by}} a bubbling funk groove. The song draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of [...] "Winning Hand" [...] draw on Steely Dan. [...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: [...] "Woke <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{to the sound of}} a bluebird singing / Suddenly I knew just where to begin / Something so simple / How can it speak so loud to me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The same {{scenes were}} {{repeated}} at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 13, 2007 with {{over half the}} sold-out venue walking out in disgust even earlier than his stage exit. The same happened again one day later at the Blue Note Records Festival in Ghent, Belgium. Here he left the stage after saying to the audience that [...] "when waking <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{he realized he was}} old, and so he needed to take a break now". He did the same again one day later, performing at the North Sea Jazz Festival.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1940, Guy Liddell, {{director}} of MI5's counterintelligence B Division, {{said that he}} had been told by an officer present at the interrogation that Scotland had punched the jaw of a captured German agent at MI5's secret interrogation centre, Camp 020. The agent was Wulf Schmidt, known by the code name [...] "Tate." [...] Liddell said in a diary entry that Scotland was [...] "hitting TATE in the jaw and I think got one back himself." [...] Liddell said: [...] "Apart from the moral aspects of the thing, I am convinced that these Gestapo methods do not pay in the long run." [...] Liddell said that [...] "Scotland turned <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with a syringe containing some drug or other, which it was thought would induce the prisoner [...] to speak." [...] Schmidt subsequently became a double agent against the Germans as part of the Double Cross System of double agents operated by MI5.|$|E
2500|$|On Australia Day 2015 Abbott {{announced}} that Queen Elizabeth had accepted his recommendation that her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, be appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia. The appointment was criticised by Shorten who said: [...] "It's {{a time warp}} where we're giving knighthoods to English [...] royalty. Some people (have) wondered whether it was an Australia Day hoax." [...] Adam Giles, Northern Territory chief minister and Country Liberal Party leader, said: [...] "I woke <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and read the wires and was confused between Australia Day and April Fool's Day," [...] adding [...] "It makes us {{a bit of a}} joke. It's Australia Day, we're not a bunch of tossers." [...] Abbott later stated that he had made a captain's call and not consulted with his cabinet colleagues over the appointment. Abbott faced criticism from some parliamentarians in his own party and the Nationals over the proposed appointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no use in denying it. I have {{abundant}} proofs. The {{girl who}} cleaned <b>up</b> here <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> found a handkerchief {{with your name}} on it lying on the floor. If you weren't here, how did that come here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said March; [...] "and I {{was going}} out to look <b>up</b> Lindau <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I've inquired at Maroni's, and he hasn't been there for several days. I've some idea perhaps he's sick. But they gave me his address, and I'm going to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} allow me, I will explain," [...] Macheson {{interrupted}} eagerly. [...] "Letty came <b>up</b> from Thorpe <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> on an excursion train which returned at midnight." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mahindra team {{principal}} Dilbagh Gill eulogised his team's maiden victory, {{calling it}} [...] "a massive breakthrough for Mahindra and Indian sport" [...] but stated {{the company would}} not get eager for more wins but believed further successes would come: [...] "We knew it would happen soon because we have had increased confidence with multiple podiums. For some reason when I woke <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I knew we would win." [...] After starting from 14th and gaining positions to finish in fifth place, Buemi was disqualified from the race after post-race scrutineering determined that all four tyres on both his cars were below the minimum mandated pressure of [...] set by tyre supplier Michelin, causing {{him to be in}} breach of Article 25.11 of the series' sporting regulations. Buemi's disqualification meant his teammate Prost, Bird, Vergne and Engel all gained one place and Turvey moved into the final points-scoring position of tenth. e.Dams-Renault co-owner Alain Prost admitted it was a mistake by his team but stated their task was to improve in the following day's race and enable Buemi to remain in contention for the championship. Buemi spoke of his disappointment in the outcome but said he would remain focused on the second race and return with stronger form.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wednesday.--My {{experience}} of Miss Milroy's habits suggested a suspicion to {{me last night}} which I thought it desirable to clear <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, that's queer, your saying that,' {{said the}} caretaker. 'It's a coincidence. That's exactly what I {{do want to}} buy. I was just {{thinking}} of going along {{and trying to get}} one. My old dog picked <b>up</b> something <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that he oughtn't to have, and he's dead, poor feller.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{even now}} you aren't {{on to the}} full depths of the {{extraordinary}} sagacity I've shown. Do you know what brought Aunt Dahlia <b>up</b> here <b>this</b> <b>morning?</b> She came to tell me I'd got to distribute the prizes at some beastly seminary she's a governor of down at Market Snodsbury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough, {{and more}} than enough, of groping in the dark," [...] he said. [...] "One point is clear to me after what has {{happened}} <b>up</b> stairs <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> We must accept the position in which Miss Silvester has placed us. I shall give up all further effort to trace her from this moment." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no!" [...] she declared. [...] "Mother can't bear travelling. A {{lot of us}} came <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> at {{six o'clock}} on a day excursion, six shillings each." ...|$|E

'After a {{great deal}} of wrangling, and saying we would never see each other any more,' {{continued}} Miss Price, 'we made it <b>up,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> John went and wrote our names down to be put up, for the first time, next Sunday, so we shall be married in three weeks, and I give you notice to get your frock made.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} there," [...] said Tabitha slowly. [...] "I’ll swear it, for I {{stood on the}} landing by her door and listened; something scuffling on the floor round and round the room.

6000|$|... 'That's {{exactly what}} Ma has been doing,' {{interposed}} Lavvy, over the maternal shoulder, 'ever since we got <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> It's {{all very well}} to laugh, Bella, but anything more exasperating {{it is impossible to}} conceive.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{said the}} {{umbrella}} man--"that is--well, {{you know how}} these mistakes occur--I--if it's your umbrella I hope you'll excuse me--I picked it <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> in a restaurant--If you recognise it as yours, why--I hope you'll--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It will be deuced {{hard work}} {{to make up the}} time. I was to have been <b>up</b> at four <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but that alarum went off and never woke me. However, I shall be able to do {{something}} to-night." ...|$|R
