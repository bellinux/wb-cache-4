25|$|One recent {{theory about}} bed bug reappearance in the <b>US</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they never truly disappeared, but {{may have been}} forced to {{alternative}} hosts. Consistent with this is the finding that bed bug DNA shows no evidence of an evolutionary bottleneck. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs at poultry facilities in Arkansas. Poultry workers at these facilities may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely {{discussed}} false positives in medical screening come from the breast cancer screening procedure mammography. The US rate of false positive mammograms is up to 15%, the highest in world. One consequence of the high false positive rate in the <b>US</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in any 10-year period, half of the American women screened receive a false positive mammogram. False positive mammograms are costly, with over $100million spent annually in the U.S. on follow-up testing and treatment. They also cause women unneeded anxiety. As {{a result of the}} high false positive rate in the US, as many as 90–95% of women who get a positive mammogram do not have the condition. The lowest rate in the world is in the Netherlands, 1%. The lowest rates are generally in Northern Europe where mammography films are read twice and a high threshold for additional testing is set (the high threshold decreases the power of the test).|$|E

The Reverend Thomas Tiller, the Alliance president, stated that [...] "by default, we may have contributed to a climate of opinion which gives rise to terrorism.

500|$|In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy {{to reduce}} its 300-member staff, suspecting {{that many of them}} were spies. The U.S. responded by ending {{diplomatic}} relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills. Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On April 15, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed 3 Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation. Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries, publicly proclaiming, [...] "What the imperialists cannot forgive <b>us,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we have made a Socialist revolution under their noses", his first announcement that the government was socialist.|$|E

500|$|Philadelphia Inquirer {{television}} critic Jonathan Storm strongly {{criticized the}} show, {{calling it a}} flat, [...] "miscast mess" [...] with serious structural problems. Storm also said the Leslie character lacked energy and Poehler was playing the part against her comedic strengths. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said, [...] "Poehler's show unfortunately isn't worthy of her. It's dry and hesitant when one longs {{for it to be}} raucous and madcap." [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News said the show was not funny enough to deserve Poehler's comedic talents, and compared the dialogue to a Saturday Night Live sketch that he said could not sustain a whole sitcom. New York Post television critic Linda Stasi said the pilot lacked laughs and was so similar to The Office that [...] "it's starting to look like a one-trick pony outfit that's gonna keep dressing that horse up in new saddles, hoping that no one will guess it's been around the track so many times, it's worn a ditch in the dirt." [...] The pilot episode premiered in Australia on Channel Seven on December 1, 2009, when episodes from the critically acclaimed second season were already playing in the United States.

500|$|He {{started in}} Oxford's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 1–0 home win against Forest Green Rovers, coming on at half-time. Eight days later, he scored his first goal of the {{campaign}} in the club's 2–1 away win at the Pirelli Stadium against Burton Albion, latching onto Eddie Odhiambo's cross to score from six yards. He started his first game in a 0–0 draw against Stevenage at Broadhall Way in late August 2007, and started once more in a game against Altrincham at Moss Lane a month later, scoring in injury-time to seal a 3–1 victory, having previously assisted the first goal. Odubade's third goal of the campaign came in Oxford's 2–1 home win against Salisbury City, scoring from just inside the area. He also scored a consolation goal for Oxford in the club's 3–1 away loss to relegation candidates Droylsden, as well as scoring twice in the following game as Oxford raced into a three-goal lead against Torquay United, although the game ended 3–3. Odubade scored again against Northwich Victoria in the FA Cup in November 2007, but failed to net again until January 2008 – scoring Oxford's goal in a 3–1 loss away to Salisbury City. After a 0–0 draw against Grays Athletic, a game in which Odubade was substituted on 64 minutes, he failed to start a game for three months. Subsequently, in March 2008, he was transfer-listed by manager Darren Patterson. Shortly after Odubade had been transfer-listed, it was announced that he had played his last game for the club, with Patterson saying [...] "I think the best thing for him and <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we go our separate ways". However, just a week later, Odubade was told by Patterson that he [...] "must start producing performances" [...] if he wants to be taken off the transfer list. He was taken off of the list after scoring three goals in four games {{at the end of the}} season, as well as starting in the club's last two games of the season. Patterson said that Odubade was removed from the transfer list because [...] "he's now putting in a shift" [...] every game. He finished the season as Oxford's top goalscorer, as Oxford finished the season in ninth place. In total, Odubade played 43 games in all competitions, scoring 11 times as Oxford finished in ninth place.|$|E
