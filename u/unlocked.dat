5000|$|Some {{companies}} offer an online <b>unlocking</b> service. This service requires {{that individuals who}} wish to <b>unlock</b> a handset provide their IMEI number and sometimes also country and operator details to the company, either via email or a web site. The company will then provide the <b>unlock</b> code for the handset. For some brands such as Nokia and Samsung various services also offer special remote <b>unlock</b> software with instructions where a cable is needed to remove the SIM lock at home. Such companies may email the <b>unlocking</b> code or software which will remotely <b>unlock</b> the device. Some companies also offer <b>unlocking</b> services that require sending IMEI number. Other companies sell <b>unlocking</b> hardware, including devices which fit between the SIM card and the phone to spoof the original network id during registration and devices to read and edit the handset's firmware. The pricing for <b>unlocking</b> a device will {{vary depending on the}} network it is locked to and the model itself, as each <b>unlock</b> code is unique to the handset. On average it typically costs around 15 depending on model and make, but for newer phones the price can go as high as $50 (for Apple <b>unlocking</b> even as high as $150).

5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the <b>unlocked</b> patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be <b>unlocked</b> only from inside, so the parents had left them <b>unlocked</b> to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E

40|$|The lockup {{agreement}} prohibits insiders and pre IPO shareholders {{from selling}} {{any of their}} {{stake in the company}} prior to the <b>unlock</b> date. Field and Hanka (2001) find that the <b>unlock</b> day is associated with significant abnormal returns. During the period of the Field and Hanka (2001) study the public was almost never reminded of the <b>unlock</b> date, other than the <b>unlock</b> date being available in the company's prospectus. However, as of October 1999, reminders of the <b>unlock</b> date have been widely available via internet sources. This study investigates if the greater degree of public information/scrutiny pertaining to the <b>unlock</b> day results in the elimination of the <b>unlock</b> day abnormal returns. Abnormal returns are found to be confined to firms having venture capital backing. Observed price adjustments tend to begin much earlier and declines appear more severe than previously reported. The study considers if the nature of the actual response observed at <b>unlock</b> is tied to the overall market sentiment at the time of IPO and <b>unlock</b> finding that firms making IPOs in cold markets are less affected at <b>unlock</b> than those firms making IPOs in hot markets. Further, many of the factors surrounding the IPO of a security act to lessen the informational asymmetries persisting {{at the time of the}} offering: the study confirms the relation of these IPO signalling factors as drivers of <b>unlock</b> day selling pressure. Furthermore, in the examination of the <b>unlock</b> day effect, consideration was also given to aftermarket price support and industry effects...|$|R

Lyrically, it deals with themes of liberation and new beginnings. Music critics gave the album mixed reviews, criticizing the originality of the songs.|$|E

Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. After the game's completion, additional episodes are <b>unlocked,</b> some of them having a higher difficulty than those found {{in the rest of the}} game.
