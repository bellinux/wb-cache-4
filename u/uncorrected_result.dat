40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a PCB-based active {{miniaturized}} MR field probe for real-time monitoring of the magnetization's phase evolution during magnetic resonance (MR) experiments. The data obtained with the presented sensor {{can be used to}} correct gradient field imperfections which <b>uncorrected</b> <b>result</b> in significant distortions in the reconstructed MR images. The presented active field probe consists of a susceptibility matched solenoidal MR coil and a complete homodyne transceiver. Thanks to the local generation of the radio frequency signal required for the excitation of the spin ensemble and the downconversion of the recorded MR signal to low frequencies, the proposed architecture significantly reduces the crosstalk between the probe head and the MR imaging object compared to existing designs. MR measurements performed in an ultra high field 9. 4 T full-body scanner prove the compatibility of the presented sensor with commercial MR imaging systems and demonstrate its excellent MR phase tracking performance...|$|E
40|$|The tight {{transverse}} emittance {{budget for}} the bright beams foreseen for the LHC era demands that all sources of emittance blow-up in the injector chain are reduced to a minimum. A critical region is the transfer between the PS Booster (PSB) and the 26 GeV PS. The four rings of the PSB run with RF harmonic one, and for the LHC beam the PS will be filled with eight bunches originating from two consecutive PSB cycles. Thus, each bunch will be different {{and has to be}} individually treated. The present recombination scheme introduces an important difference in lattice parameters between the bunches from different rings. The difference between the bunches would, if left <b>uncorrected,</b> <b>result</b> in a substantial emittance blow-up. Several possible improvements of the recombination stage have been studied, including magnet shims, correction quadrupoles and an RF quadrupole magnet. To complement the theoretical studies, the contribution of mismatch and missteering to the emittance blow-up have been measured using a LHC-type beam, measuring the emittance in the PS with a wire-grid and fast wire-scanners. Results of the calculation and the measurements will be discussed and a strategy to minimise the blow-up will be indicated. ...|$|E
40|$|Over-exposure and {{perspective}} distortion {{are two of}} the main factors underlying inaccurate feature extraction. First, based on Steger's method, we propose a method for correcting curvilinear structures (lines) extracted from over-exposed images. A new line model based on the Gaussian line profile is developed, and its description in the scale space is provided. The line position is analytically determined by the zero crossing of its first-order derivative, and the bias due to convolution with the normal Gaussian kernel function is eliminated {{on the basis of the}} related description. The model considers over-exposure features and is capable of detecting the line position in an over-exposed image. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method is not significantly affected by the exposure level and is suitable for correcting lines extracted from an over-exposed image. In our experiments, the corrected result is found to be more precise than the <b>uncorrected</b> <b>result</b> by around 45. 5 %. Second, we analyze perspective distortion, which is inevitable during line extraction owing to the projective camera model. The perspective distortion can be rectified on the basis of the bias introduced as a function of related parameters. The properties of the proposed model and its application to vision measurement are discussed. In practice, the proposed model can be adopted to correct line extraction according to specific requirements by employing suitable parameters...|$|E

40|$|We present two novel {{circuit design}} {{techniques}} that effectively reduce {{the impact of}} radiation-induced single event transients (SET) on logic circuits. Both techniques {{can be applied to}} large CMOS designs and have been verified by a recently developed soft error rate analysis (SERA) methodology [3]. Rapid scaling of integrated circuit process technology has resulted in significant improvements in power consumption and throughput. However, reduced feature sizes and voltages make current and future integrated microsystems more vulnerable to soft errors due to alpha particles, high energy cosmic ray neutrons, and neutron induced 10 B fission [1], [2]. Prior research has shown that the soft errors caused by radiation events, if <b>uncorrected,</b> <b>result</b> in a failure rate higher than all the other reliability mechanisms combined [4]. Circuit level hardening techniques have been applied to sequential logic circuits in prior work, such as dual interlocked storage cell (DICE) [5], Whitaker design [6], and Barry/Dooley design [7], [8]. These designs aim to protect the bits stored in bistable elements in the data retention mode. Other sequential circuit designs [9], [10] can block a fraction of the single event transients (SET) propagation from the logic. Such design styles will typically require delayed versions of clock or data signals, which results in drastic imapact on performance when the SET duration becomes large or when multiple SETs overlap with one another. The first design technique aims to reduce transient generation and propagation within the logic gate network, rather than blocking it after its generation and propagation. This design style can be employed in both static and dynamic CMO...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of a 90 -orbit Hubble Space Telescope treasury program to obtain near ultraviolet imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field using the Wide Field Camera 3 UVIS detector with the F 225 W, F 275 W, and F 336 W filters. This survey is designed to: (i) Investigate the episode of peak star formation activity in galaxies at 1 <z< 2. 5; (ii) Probe the evolution of massive galaxies by resolving sub-galactic units (clumps); (iii) Examine the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from galaxies at z~ 2 - 3; (iv) Greatly improve the reliability of photometric redshift estimates; and (v) Measure the star formation rate efficiency of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas at z~ 1 - 3. In this overview paper, we describe the survey details and data reduction challenges, including both the necessity of specialized calibrations {{and the effects of}} charge transfer inefficiency. We provide a stark demonstration of the effects of charge transfer inefficiency on resultant data products, which when <b>uncorrected,</b> <b>result</b> in uncertain photometry, elongation of morphology in the readout direction, and loss of faint sources far from the readout. We agree with the STScI recommendation that future UVIS observations that require very sensitive measurements use the instrument's capability to add background light through a "post-flash". Preliminary results on number counts of UV-selected galaxies and morphology of galaxies at z~ 1 are presented. We find that the number density of UV dropouts at redshifts 1. 7, 2. 1, and 2. 7 is largely consistent with the number predicted by published luminosity functions. We also confirm that the image mosaics have sufficient sensitivity and resolution to support the analysis of the evolution of star-forming clumps, reaching 28 - 29 th magnitude depth at 5 sigma in a 0. 2 arcsecond radius aperture depending on filter and observing epoch.

30|$|To {{investigate}} whether these tasks are associated, {{a series of}} correlational analyses were performed. Considering that face detection is characterised typically by response speed (Bindemann & Lewis, 2013) but matching and memory performance by accuracy (Fysh & Bindemann, 2018; Russell et al., 2009), this analysis correlated response times and accuracy measures separately but also investigated combinations of these. Note that these were not conducted for target-absent trials of the detection task, as no faces were shown in this condition. <b>Uncorrected</b> <b>results</b> are subsequently reported, with a significance threshold of 0.05. However, in line with recent work (see McCaffery, Robertson, Young, & Burton, in press), the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was also implemented with a false discovery rate of 0.20, to correct for multiple correlations (see Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).|$|R

40|$|Two {{techniques}} {{in particular are}} used to study site-specific DNA methylation: genomic sequencing after bisulfite modification and polymerase chain reaction after digestion by a methylation-sensitive endonuclease (usually HpaII). Only the former methodology assesses the methylation status of all the cytosine residues in the DNA sequence, {{but it is so}} complex and time consuming that the latter procedure, though limited to the restriction sites recognized by the endonucleasets) used, is often preferred at least for a first analysis. In this work we investigate differences between these two {{techniques in}} the assessment of DNA methylation and offer some suggestions on how to avoid <b>uncorrected</b> <b>results.</b> Although there is substantial accordance in the results obtained using these different techniques, we observed a general overestimate for methylation levels above 30 % and a general underestimate for methylation levels below this value using the HpaII/ PCR technique in the study of methylation of the 5 '-flanking region of the mouse myogenin gene in cultured muscle cells and mouse tissues.

Camera invariance {{corresponds to the}} robustness of an algorithm's performance when run on images of the same scene taken by different cameras. Accordingly, images in the database correspond to several lab and field scenes each of which are captured by three different cameras with minimal registration errors. The lab scenes are also captured under five different illuminations. The spectral responses of cameras and the spectral power distributions of the lab light sources are also provided, as they may prove beneficial for training future algorithms to achieve color constancy. For a fair evaluation of future methods, we provide guidelines for supervised methods with indicated training, validation and testing partitions. Accordingly, we evaluate a recently proposed convolutional neural network based color constancy algorithm as a baseline for future research.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{dimensional}} measurements made by industrial X-ray computed tomography (CT) {{depends on a}} variety of influence factors in the measurement process. In this paper, the effects of angular misalignments of a flat-panel detector are investigated. First, a forward projection model is applied to evaluate distortions of the radiographic pixel coordinates assigned to X-ray intensities due to various detector rotation angles. Distortion maps are presented for a set of representative detector rotations and the sensitivity of image distortions to each rotation is discussed. It is shown from a simulation study that detector angular misalignments result in systematic errors of the reconstructed volume. The distortion model is inversely applied to generate correction maps that are used to correct the simulated radiographs from a misaligned detector. A new volume is reconstructed from the corrected radiographs and the new deviations are compared to the <b>uncorrected</b> <b>results.</b> The reduction of observed volumetric errors after radiographic correction validates the efficacy of the radiographic distortion model. Additionally, the output of this study can {{contribute to the development of}} a geometrical error model for volumetric measurements made by CT. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Migration is {{a common}} {{strategy}} adopted to escape poverty and improve living standards, {{but it is not}} without risks and there are no guarantees of success. We analyse the impact of migration on the welfare of migrant-sending households in Ghana by exploring what their living standards might have been had their migrant members remained at home. We do this by estimating a counterfactual consumption distribution for households with migrants. We examine the importance of selection bias and compare results obtained with and without selection controls. We illustrate how sensitive conclusions about the welfare gains of migration are to the decision to address selection issues. We present preliminary results which suggest that estimated gains are sensitive to whether and how we address selection bias. While the <b>uncorrected</b> <b>results</b> suggest an average gain from migration for households with migrants, once we control for potential selection bias we find that on average households with migrants are worse off than they might have been had their members stayed at home. Our selection corrected results also suggest that initially better off households are more likely to experience gains from migration and that poorer households lose out. Our results are consistent with qualitative research conducted with a small sample of migrants from our migrant-sending households...|$|R

Twenty-one children with FASD aged 8 – 12 years were randomized to the Alert®-treatment (TXT; n = 10) or waitlist-control (WL; n = 11) conditions.

Refractive errors, if <b>uncorrected,</b> <b>results</b> in an impaired quality of life for millions of people worldwide, irrespective of their age, sex and ethnicity. Over the past decade, a series of studies using a survey methodology, referred to as Refractive Error Study in Children (RESC), were performed in populations with different ethnic origins and cultural settings. These studies confirmed that the prevalence of uncorrected refractive errors is considerably high for children in low-and-middle-income countries. Furthermore, uncorrected refractive error has been noted to have extensive social and economic impacts, such as limiting educational and employment opportunities of economically active persons, healthy individuals and communities. The key public health challenges presented by uncorrected refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment across the world, require urgent attention. To address these issues, it is critical to focus on the development of human resources and sustainable methods of service delivery. This paper discusses three core pillars to addressing the challenges posed by uncorrected refractive errors: Human Resource (HR) Development, Service Development and Social Entrepreneurship...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) {{is increasingly}} {{being used as}} a bedside tool for monitoring regional lung ventilation. However, most clinical systems use serial data collection which, if <b>uncorrected,</b> <b>results</b> in image distortion, particularly at high breathing rates. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the extent to which this affects derived parameters. Raw EIT data were acquired with the GOE­MF II EIT device (CareFusion, Höchberg, Germany) at a scan rate of 13 images/s during both spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation. Boundary data for periods of undisturbed tidal breathing were corrected for serial data collection errors using a Fourier based algorithm. Images were reconstructed for both the corrected and original data using the GREIT algorithm, and parameters describing the filling characteristics of the right and left lung derived on a breath by breath basis. Values from the original and corrected data were compared using paired t­ tests. Of the 33 data sets, 23 showed significant differences in filling index for at least one region, 11 had significant differences in calculated tidal impedance change and 12 had significantly different filling fractions (p = 0. 05). We conclude that serial collection errors should be corrected before image reconstruction to avoid clinically misleading results...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} evenly spaced {{constant}} {{sites on the}} distribution of the random division of a molecular sequence Motivation: A modified Sherman statistic can be used to test whether the differences between two aligned sequences are distributed at random along the sequences, or whether they are clustered, which suggests anomalies of evolution such as partial gene recombination or functional constraints. The presence of evenly spaced constant sites (such as constancy at the second codon position in genes coding for proteins) lowers the statistic and makes the significance less than it should be. Results: The magnitude of the constant-site effect is shown by simulation to depend mainly on the proportion of differences between two sequences and on the number of constant sites that are added after each variable site. This latter number can be estimated from the variance of sites in a sequence matrix at the first, second and third codon positions, to obtain a ratio that corrects the statistic. When expressed as standard errors, the <b>uncorrected</b> <b>results</b> are too low (typically half to one unit when almost all the variation is at the third codon position). Correction raises the standard errors to levels close to expectation. If the data show no marked ternary periodicity, the correction is very small. The method is illustrated with biological data that show close to random behaviour, and with data that exhibit strong clustering...|$|R

40|$|Global average {{estimates}} of the group velocity and attenuation of long-period (120 – 300 s) Rayleigh waves were made using seismograms from the epicenter's antipode (Δ≃ 180 °). Focusing at the antipode produced amplified arrivals with favorable signal-to-noise ratios. The high-quality data yielded very stable attenuation values, with excellent agreement between the results from successive Rayleigh arrivals for a single event and between the results for two different events. Lateral heterogeneities in earth structure can cause systematic biasing of attenuation measurements based on antipodal records. The initial, <b>uncorrected</b> <b>results</b> therefore provide a lower bound estimate of global Q. An ellipsoidal perturbation in shape was used to simulate the effects of lateral velocity heterogeneities on Rayleigh wave propagation. Using the agreement of repeated attenuation measurements as a constraint, we estimated both the bias in those measurements and the splitting widths of the Rayleigh modes. At a period of 200 s, the estimated splitting width is 0. 30 % this agrees closely with calculations by Luh (1974) for an earth model with different continental and oceanic velocity profiles. The estimated bias varied from 30 % to zero over the 120 - to 260 -s band. After correcting for bias, the antipodal Q values range from 108 at 120 s to 188 at 260 s. These Q are {{within the range of}} previous measurements but are lower than the mean values from typical great circle studies, implying that the globally averaged upper mantle is slightly more attenuative than has been generally recognized...|$|R

40|$|Background. Research on {{cognitive}} control suggests an age-related decline in proactive control abilities (an anticipatory form of control) whereas reactive control (consecutive to conflict detection) seems {{to remain intact}} [1]. As proactive and reactive control abilities were associated to specific brain networks [2], this study investigated age-related effects on the neural substrates associated to each kind of control. Method. A modified form of the Stroop task was administered to 16 young and 16 older adults in an event-related fMRI experiment. In {{this version of the}} Stroop task, three different contexts were created: (1) a mostly congruent context (MC, inducing reactive control) with a majority of congruent items, (2) a mostly incongruent context (MI, inducing proactive control) with mainly interfering items, (3) a neutral context (MN) with mainly neutral items. Preprocessing and statistical analyses were performed with SPM 8 (p<. 001 <b>uncorrected).</b> <b>Results.</b> Behavioral results (p< 0. 05) indicated faster processing of interferent items in the MI than MC context in young participants only. With regard to neuroimaging data, the comparison of the two groups showed that the processing of interferent items in the MI context is associated to decreased activity in (mainly right-sided) frontal and temporal areas in the older group. On the contrary, in the MC context, increased activity was observed in bilateral frontal areas for older compared to younger participants. Discussion. Behavioral results confirm that older participants have difficulties with the implementation of proactive control that is associated to decreased brain activity (compared to young participants) in areas underlying Stroop performance. However, the recruitment of supplementary frontal areas we observed in the reactive control condition suggests compensation processes. So, aging seems to differentially affect the neural networks associated to the various kinds of cognitive control. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of precision improvements using real-time internal standardization with an axially-viewed inductively coupledplasma (ICP) is presented. New findings {{are presented with}} respect {{to the nature of the}} noise in the analytical signals from theaxial ICP. It is observed that a high degree of correlation exists in the line signals from the axial ICP. Using the yttrium ion lineat 371. 030 nm as the internal standard, the analytical precision after the application of real-time internal standardization ismaintained between 0. 1 and 0. 2 % relative standard deviation (RSD) for ion lines. Precision improvement factors of 3 to 4 areobtained by comparison with the <b>uncorrected</b> <b>results.</b> With atomic lines, real-time internal standardization using the yttrium ionline is less effective, yielding precision values between 0. 2 and 0. 7 % RSD. The precision improvement factors for atomic linesare between 1. 5 and. 3. Thus, real-time internal standardization provides significant improvements in the RSDs of the linesignals. The limits of these improvements are explored and an equation is presented which yields the fundamental shot noiselimit for precision. Shot noise limited precision is demonstrated. However, this is not possible for all elements using a singleinternal standard signal. The effectiveness of real-time internal standardization is shown to be dependent on the nature of thespecific spectral line. With the axially-viewed ICP, the dominant phenomenon preventing the full benefit of internal standardizationfrom being obtained is the amplitude of the noise in the line signals and not the degree of correlation between analyteand internal standard signals. A trend is observed for atomic transitions in which lower excitation energy is correlated withhigher relative noise amplitudes. This finding is in contrast with previously published work on the radially-viewed ICP. Anexplanation of this result is proposed which takes into account the influence of vaporizing sample droplets in the observationvolume...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: IMRT of the {{prostate}} consists of multiple stages of treatment planning and dose delivery, each with inherent anatomical uncertainties. Differential filling of the bladder and rectum can displace {{the prostate}} during a course of treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of adapting to these anatomical changes using various CTimage‐guided adaptive (IGART) strategies. Methods: Our computermodel is based on the Philips Pinnacle treatment planning system. A multi‐fraction simulation of 5 ‐field IMRT (76 Gy/ 35 fractions) yields the daily dose accumulation in individual tissue elements. Using megavoltage CT studies of 13 prostate cases, cumulated dose distributions are mapped onto the reference treatment plan. Total dose‐volume histograms are then processed to estimate the changes in tumorcontrol probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for various IGART scenarios. Results: Retargeting {{of the prostate}} generally maintains the intended TCP (typically 0. 9 versus 0. 8 with No Image Guidance) but is often associated with an enhanced risk of rectal toxicity (NTCP rises to 0. 05 when Image Guidance is applied). This effect is due mainly to a systematic anterior shift caused by sag in the treatment couch (average 10 mm). Without image‐guidance, this offset goes <b>uncorrected,</b> <b>resulting</b> in poorer coverage of the target with consistent avoidance of rectal exposure. Conclusions: Geometric repositioning without dose re‐planning is sufficient to maintain the intended TCP. IGART corrects for sag in the treatment couch and this results in greater risk of rectal toxicity, compared with no IGART. Smaller PTV margins could offset this effect, emphasizing the need for integrated image guided and intensity modulated delivery for optimal results. In the extreme, daily IMRT re‐planning based on in‐room imaging could exploit maximum benefits of this technology but this would require significantly more computing resources and streamlining of procedures at the treatment console.

40|$|ABSTRACT Transposition is {{a dental}} anomaly {{characterized}} by the exchange of position between two adjacent teeth, especially {{in relation to their}} roots, or development and eruption of a tooth in a position normally occupied by a nonadjacent tooth. Transposition of the maxillary canine and first premolar has a low prevalence in the population and it primarily affects maxillary canines and premolars. The aetiology of the transposition remains unclear, although it has been associated with genetic factors. It may also be related to a combination of localised factors such as malformation of adjacent teeth, tooth agenesis, retention of the deciduous canine and a history of local trauma. If <b>uncorrected,</b> the <b>results</b> are often both functionally and esthetically unsatisfactory. This case report presents treatment of a female patient with complete bilateral transposition of maxillary canine and premolar. The patient was treated orthodontically with non-extraction fixed mechanotherapy by simulation of maxillary first premolar as canine bilaterall...|$|R
50|$|When the {{aircraft}} banks, the lift of the wings no longer acts vertically, {{and so the}} force directly upwards is reduced (by the cosine of the bank angle). If left <b>uncorrected</b> this will <b>result</b> in {{the aircraft}} descending. The nose will also usually drop. In order to maintain level flight the pilot will apply back-pressure to the stick while the wings are banked. This will maintain level flight. The airspeed will usually decrease slightly {{as a result of}} this. For steeper bank angles an aircraft pilot will usually increase the power setting to keep the speed up.|$|R
40|$|Focused {{attention}} (FA) {{is among}} the cognitive functions that decline with aging. The Stroop task was used to investigate the neural correlates underlying FA in cognitively normal older adults. Twenty-one participants underwent a novel {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) verbal Stroop task paradigm. Colour words were printed in an incongruent ink colour. Series 1 consisted of four blocks “Read the word” followed by four blocks “Say the colour of the ink”; Series 2 alternated between the two conditions. Functional data were analyzed using SPM 5 to detect anatomical areas with significant signal intensity differences between the conditions. Within-group analyses of the “Say the colour of the ink” minus “Read the word” contrast yielded significant activation in the left supplementary motor area, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precentral gyrus, left insula and right superior frontal gyrus (p < 0. 05, <b>uncorrected).</b> These <b>results,</b> using verbal responses, are consistent with previous manual modality Stroop-fMRI studies in older adults. Verbal responses may provide a more suitable modality for older adults and certain patient populations...|$|R
