The turret, hull front section and side skirts of this version are protected by the Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour capable of withstanding hits from the American M829 120mm armour-piercing depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>ammunition.</b> The main armament of the T-55MV was improved by employing the 9M117 [...] "Bastion" [...] (AT-10 Stabber) ATGM which can be launched through the barrel of the standard T-54/55 rifled gun. With an effective range of 4,000 m, the 9M117 [...] "Bastion" [...] (AT-10 Stabber) ATGM is capable of penetrating armour equivalent to 550mm of steel plate. If the missile is equipped with a tandem warhead, its armour penetration capability increases. The Volna fire control system with its digital ballistic computer was also fitted. Syria was the first country to order 200 of its T-55s upgraded into the T-55MV.|$|E

40|$|For a {{few years}} now inductively coupled plasma mass {{spectrometry}} has been increasingly used for precise and accurate determination of isotope ratios of long-lived radionuclides at the trace and ultratrace level due to its excellent sensitivity, good precision and accuracy. At present, ICP-MS and also laser ablation ICP-MS are applied as powerful analytical techniques in {{different fields such as}} the characterization of nuclear materials, recycled and by-products (e. g., spent nuclear fuel or depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>ammunitions),</b> radioactive waste control, in environmental monitoring and in bioassay measurements, in health control, in geochemistry and geochronology. Especially double-focusing sector field ICP mass spectrometers with single ion detector or with multiple ion collector device have been used for the precise determination of long-lived radionuclides isotope ratios at very low concentration levels. Progress has been achieved by the combination of ultrasensitive mass spectrometric techniques with effective separation and enrichment procedures in order to improve detection limits or by the introduction of the collision cell in ICP-MS for reducing disturbing interfering ions (e. g., of Xe- 129 (+) for the determination of I- 129). This review describes {{the state of the art}} and the progress of ICP-MS and laser ablation lCP-MS for isotope ratio measurements of long-lived radionuclides in different sample types, especially in the main application fields of characterization of nuclear and radioactive waste material, environmental research and health controls.

The results suggested that the use of depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>ammunitions</b> in Kosovo did not cause a diffuse environmental contamination in such a way to have caused a detectable U enrichment in lichens. Also isotopic 235 U/ 238 U measurements did not indicate the presence of DU particles in lichens.

40|$|Abstract. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{performed}} field surveys at 15 {{sites in}} Bosnia–Herzegovina where depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>ammunition</b> {{was used by}} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) during the Balkans conflict (1994 – 1995). During the field missions, the Italian Environmental Protection Agency (APAT) evaluated airborne contamination due to DU dusts or aerosol particles, generated {{at the time of the}} conflict by the impact of DU ammunition on hard “tar-gets, ” using lichens and tree barks as biomonitors. Each sample was analyzed by alpha-spectrometry for DU determination. The 234 U/ 238 U activity concentration ratios were used to distinguish natural from anthropogenic uranium. This paper reports the data obtained by the UNEP investigation, in-cluding (non-radioactive) metal and other element concentrations in lichen and tree bark samples measured by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The results indicated: (i) lichens and tree barks are sensitive bio-accumulators of past airborne contamination by depleted uranium dusts; (ii) 8 years after the conflict, environmental DU contamination is still present at some of the target sites; and (iii) the highest concentrations of most non-radioactive elements were found at sites used for ammunition destruction...|$|R

50|$|The M1A1 {{was capable}} of making kills at ranges in excess of 2500 m. This range was crucial in combat against {{previous}} generation tanks of Soviet design in Desert Storm, as the effective range of the main gun in the Soviet/Iraqi tanks was less than 2000 m. This meant Abrams tanks could hit Iraqi tanks before the enemy got in range—a decisive advantage {{in this kind of}} combat. In friendly fire incidents, the front armor and fore side turret armor survived direct armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) hits from other M1A1s. This was not the case for the side armor of the hull and the rear armor of the turret, as both areas were penetrated on at least two occasions by friendly depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>ammunition</b> during the Battle of Norfolk.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of several health status parameters of sheep bred in the area exposed to depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>ammunition</b> during NATO bombing of Serbia and Montenegro in 1999. The blood samples of sheep were collected randomly in the region of Bujanovac, in 2004. Complete blood count was performed according to standard laboratory procedures. Concentration of red blood cells malondialdehyde (RBC MDA) and activity of erythrocyte superoxid dismutase (SOD) were determined spectrophotometrically, while the functional activity of leukocytes was investigated by NBT reduction and adhesion test. The results of complete red blood cells count indicated normocytic hypochromic anaemia. The total number of leukocytes and the differential leukocytes count were within the physiological range. Although the leukocytes adhesiveness was not changed in DU exposed animals, their increased NBT reduction revealed stimulated leukocytes' oxidative burst. This finding, together with significantly increased RBC MDA concentrations, as well as the activity of RBC antioxidant SOD, point to the existence of oxidative stress. Although the results indicated that animals were under oxidative stress, still there are no conclusive data that it was due to the exposure of DU that entered the environment during military operations...|$|R
40|$|A {{soil profile}} was sampled in 2002 from a soil {{in which a}} {{depleted}} <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>ammunition</b> penetrator was embedded for seven years, since the Bosnian conflict in 1994 - 1995. The affinity of the uranium for six different geochemical phases within the soil profile was assessed by sequential extraction (based on Tessier et al., 1979). The highest concentrations of uranium {{were present in the}} surface layers of the soil, 10. 5 ± 0. 05 g kg⁻¹ (0 - 4 cm depth) and 7. 3 ± 0. 02 g kg⁻¹ (4 - 10 cm depth), from which the penetrator was removed. Sequential extraction results indicated that the uranium is dominantly extracted by the 'bound to carbonate' extraction, with significant concentrations also recovered using the 'readily exchangeable', 'bound to organic matter' and 'bound to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides' extraction reagents. The recovered uranium concentrations are considered to be operationally-defined. Isotopic analysis determined that ²³⁸U/²³⁵U ratios ranged from 58 - 168 compared with a natural value of 138. XPS analysis indicated that uranium at the surface of a DU fragment, sampled from the soil profile, was present in the U(VI) oxidation state, and therefore the weathered DU product at the surface of the fragment is thought to be schoepite.

40|$|Thermoluminescent MCP-N {{detectors}} {{based on}} LiF:Mg,Cu,P are by about 2 {{orders of magnitude}} more sensitive than TLD- 100 detectors based on conventional LiF:Mg,Ti, which {{makes it possible to}} use them in short-term monitoring of ionizing radiation in the environment (e. g., over a two-week period, rather than over 3 - 12 months). We describe the properties of MCP-N detectors and methods of their application in environmental monitoring. The system was tested in short and long-term exposure periods at 100 sites around Krakow region. MCP-N detectors were then applied to measure variation of radiation dose rate at four selected villages in Serbia, where depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>ammunition</b> was deployed in 1999. Together with short-term thermoluminescent dosimetry, in situ measurements using proportional counters were per formed in order to assess the range of variation of natural radiation background in these villages. The mean terrestrial kerma dose rate in these villages was found to vary between 85 and 116 nGyh– 1 and the average ambient dose equivalent rate H*(10) determined by thermoluminescent detectors and by proportional counter measurements was 160 nSvh– 1.

40|$|This books {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} international legal aspects of the use of depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>ammunition</b> and armour. The military use of DU has been surrounded by considerable controversy, mainly as regards the health and environmental risks that such use entails. The debate about DU has thus far been highly polarised, with one end of the spectrum rejecting any risk whatsoever and the other end suggesting that the use of DU leads to severe health and environmental consequences, including Gulf-War syndrome, whenever it is used. Rather than settling these controversies, the book takes as a starting point a precautionary approach in light of the considerable remaining scientific uncertainties. It examines various principles and rules of international law, which would be at play if the health and environmental concerns regarding the use of DU were to materialise. • In-depth legal analysis by a group of academics and practitioners with relevant expertise supplies a balanced view of the legal dimensions of the use of DU ammunition • The current scientific knowledge about DU is linked with relevant principles and rules of international law, thus going beyond the abstract presentation of the legal rules and principles at play • Addresses a topical problem of utmost practical and political salience, enabling the reader to further his/her understanding of the matter and become involved in the debate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Depleted <b>Uranium</b> (DU) <b>ammunitions</b> {{were used}} by the U. S. A and UK troops in an open {{environment}} {{for the first time}} in history against Iraq on civilians and military targets during Gulf wars in 1991 - 2003. Spatial distribution and risk assessment of soil in the estimated sites at Basrah Governorate with uranium contaminations have been screened using statistics and geographic information system (GIS) methods, and a performance model of predication distribution and potential distant values of DU and other polluted components were detected by data collection. An interpolation technique was practiced in order to accomplish certainties in the data set and to decrease the influence of outliers. After choosing a tailored model, parameters can be recycled with the data to estimate Uranium concentrations at unsampled locations using the kriging technique to define the weights of adjacent monitoring in the predicating underground surfaces similar to contaminated elements and radionuclides of uranium chains. The problem appears when were increased in the deaths and congenital malformations resulted from carcinogenic diseases among Basrah population, after 1994 of due to use of DU extensively in these regions. The primary purpose of this paper is to present the current state of the determine DU sites and to predict in adjacent points of specific locations using different techniques.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>ammunition</b> {{containing}} depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) was used by NATO during the Balkan conflict. To evaluate the DU origin (natural uranium enrichment of or spent nuclear fuel reprocessing) it is necessary to check the presence of activation products (236 U, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, 241 Am and 237 Np, etc.) in the <b>ammunition.</b> <b>Uranium</b> isotopes, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, 241 Am concentrations in DU were determined in the past in our Laboratory: the present paper describes a new and accurate method for the separation and determination of 237 Np ultratraces in a DU penetrator. After sample dissolution, neptunium was separated by two chromatographic columns consisting of micropourous polyethylene (Icorene) supporting tri-n-octylamine (TNOA); after elettrodeposition, Np was counted by alpha spectrometry.

40|$|Banning the world’s uranium {{weapons and}} {{providing}} medical help and compensation for their victims {{is now a}} critical and urgent issue, if we wish to stop the destruction and pollution of our planet and build a peaceful world for the future. The UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, stated in a message delivered on 6 th November 2002 marking the first observance of The International Day for Preventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War and Armed Conflict (resolution 56 / 4), that: “International conventions govern nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, but new technologies – such as depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>ammunition</b> – pose as yet unknown threats to the environment. Damage to the environment in war is also an impediment to the restoration of peace and rebuilding of society. ” We completely agree with his message and request that the UN take immediate concrete action to ban uranium weapons.

40|$|This report {{primarily}} {{deals with}} three issues: the health {{consequences of the}} use of ammunition with depleted uranium cores; the health damage that radar staff may have suffered through stray X-radiation; and the way hazardous materials such as asbestos are handled in the German army. As regards <b>uranium</b> <b>ammunition,</b> the present findings suggest that there is neither reason for concern nor blame on anyone. The 31, 000 American DU rounds that were fired over Kosovo in 1999 neither pose a health hazard to soldiers nor to the civil population. All that remains is a minimal risk of future groundwater contamination. The radar equipment currently in use in the German army poses no danger to operators, inspectors, service personnel or instructors provided that the relevant safety rules are observed. However, this cannot be said with the same degree of certainty with regard to the equipment used in the 1960 s and 1970 s. It is quite possible that X-radiation was emitted and radar staff suffered health damage from this. When the health hazards of asbestos became known the German army reacted more promptly than the German federation, Laender or municipalities did. In the meantime this hazardous material has been removed and replaced completely with few exceptions.

40|$|In 1991, {{new weapons}} {{were used for}} the first time by the American and British troops in Iraq. These weapons proved to have high {{destructive}} capability against armored machinery and tanks. Later, there were many signs of being a weapon to destroy the human beings, animals and plants, which raised huge controversy and sharp criticism among scientists, doctors and environmentalists. Despite the opacity and deception, many of the secrets of depleted <b>uranium</b> <b>ammunition</b> were exposed, and confirmed the seriousness of use and serious repercussions on the environment and public health, which stepped up the international campaign against its manufacturing and use. However, the brilliant military success and profits of the military industry tempted the Pentagon and NATO to continue production and use of these weapons. Despite the high human and environment risks DU was used in various conflicts like Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia, Afghanistan, Gaza, Lebanon and recently in Libya. It is noteworthy to mention that the public and even some scientists, researchers and news media are ignorant of the effects and risks of the use of DU in military operations. This raises the point {{that there should be a}} large campaign to raise public awareness to prevent the risk of DU weapons. Based on scientific research and updates, we would like to high light the waste of wars in Iraq: Our paper shed the light on the size of depleted uranium(DU) weapons used in the wars on Iraq and the legacy of waste (their nature, size, and the contaminated regions), as high risks on humans and the environment.

40|$|The uranium {{content and}} 235 U/ 238 U atom ratio were {{determined}} in soils and earthworms {{of an area}} of Kosovo (Djakovica garrison), heavily shelled with depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) <b>ammunition</b> during the 1999 war. The aim {{of the study was}} to reconstruct the small-scale distribution of uranium and assess the influence of the DU added to the surface environment. The total uranium concentration and the 235 U/ 238 U ratio of topsoils showed great variability and were inversely correlated. The highest uranium levels (up to 31. 47 mg/kg) and lowest 235 U/ 238 U ratios (minimum 0. 002147) were measured in topsoils collected inside, or very close to, the clusters of DU penetrator holes. Regarding the fractionation of uranium in the surface soils, the uranium concentrations in the soluble and exchangeable fractions increased as the total uranium concentration of the topsoils increased. High and rather uniform percentage contents of uranium (24 – 36 %) were associated with the poorly crystalline iron oxide phases of soils. In the U-enriched soils the elevated levels of the element were probably due to the presence of very small, unevenly distributed oxidized DU particles. The total uranium concentration in earthworms was in the range 0. 142 – 0. 656 mg/kg, with the highest concentrations in Lumbricus terrestris. The juveniles of all three studied species seemed to accumulate uranium more than adults, probably due to age-related differences in metabolism. The 235 U/ 238 U ratio in the earthworms was variable (0. 005241 – 0. 007266) and independent of both the total uranium contents in soils and the absolute uranium levels in the animals. Bioconcentration was greater at lower U concentrations in soil, probably due to an increasing rate of elimination of uranium by the earthworms as the soil contents of the element increase. The results of this study clearly indicate that DU was added to the soil of the study area. Nevertheless, the phenomenon was very limited spatially and the total uranium concentrations fell within the natural range of the element in soils. Moreover, the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{interest}} in measuring uranium isotope ratios in environmental samples (biological materials, soils, dust particles, water) {{has come from}} the necessity to assess the health impact of the use of depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) based <b>ammunitions</b> during recent military conflicts (e. g., Gulf war, Kosovo) and from the need to identify nondeclared nuclear activities (nuclear safeguards). In this context, very important decisions can arise which have to be based on measurement data of nondisputable uncertainty. The present study describes the certification to 2. 5 % (k = 2) relative combined uncertainty of n((235) U) /n((238) U) at ultralow uranium levels (similar to 5 - 20 pg g(- 1)) in human urine samples. After sample decomposition and matrix separation, the isotope ratios were measured by means of a single-detector magnetic sector-field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry instrument fitted with an ultrasonic nebulizer. Correction for mass discrimination effects was obtained by means of the certified isotopic reference material IRMM- 184. The analytical procedure developed was validated in three complementary ways. First, all major sources of uncertainty were identified and propagated together following the ISO/GUM guidelines. Second, this quality was controlled with a matrix matching NUSIMEP- 3 sample (similar to 0. 06 - 0. 7 % difference from certified). Third, the instrumental part of the procedure was proven to be reproducible from the confirmation of the results obtained for three samples remeasured 7 months later (similar to 1. 5 % difference).
