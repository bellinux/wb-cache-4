However, concerns have been raised about potential unwanted effects, despite their negligible skin penetration and inherent advantages over organic chemical <b>UV-filters.</b> To provide useful application-relevant assessments of their potential hazard with/without UVA co-exposure, we directly compared cytotoxic and immune response profiles of human THP- 1 monocytic cells to ZnO nanoparticles (30 nm) with bulk ZnO particulates (200 nm) and five conventional organic chemical <b>UV-filters</b> - butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane (avobenzone), octylmethoxycinnamate, octylsalicylate, homosalate and 4 -methylbenzylidene camphor. High exposure concentrations of both organic and particulate <b>UV-filters</b> were required to cause cytotoxicity in monocyte and macrophage cultures after 24 h. Co-exposure with UVA (6. 7 J/cm 2) did not alter cytotoxicity profiles. Particle surface area-based dose responses showed that ZnO NPs were better tolerated than bulk ZnO.

40|$|Introduction: Sunscreen products, {{containing}} UV-filters, {{are used}} worldwide to protect from the deleterious effects of sunlight. However, {{in order to}} provide this photoprotective function, they should be photostable and remain {{on the surface of the}} skin. The photostability of UVfilters, individually and in combination, using different light sources, light intensities, <b>UV-filter</b> concentrations, solvents and formulations has been extensively investigated. Regulations for sunscreen products in Australia, the USA and Europe do not require photostability testing, as per the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline Q 1 B for new drug substances and drug products. During UV-irradiation on exposure to sunlight, there is potential for chemical UV-filters to degrade by direct photolysis. Chemical UV-filters are also often used in combination with the physical <b>UV-filter,</b> titanium dioxide (TiO₂), increasing the complexity of the system, due to the ability of TiO₂ to cause photocatalytic reactions. In recent years issues have been raised that TiO₂ nano-particles may penetrate through the skin, but no evidence has been found and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) regards them as safe. However, whether these TiO₂ nano-particles may have an effect on the photostability of chemical UVfilters has not been investigated. The aim of the study was therefore to determine the photostability and skin penetration of a combination of chemical UV-filters with TiO₂, investigating the effect of particle size on photostability. Methods: Chemical UV-filters, Butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane (BMDM), Octocrylene (OC) and Benzophenone- 3 (B 3) were verified for purity by melting point determinations, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). <b>UV-filter</b> identity was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -, infrared (IR) - and ultraviolet (UV) -spectroscopy. A reverse-phase HPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of BMDM and OC in the presence of their photodegradants. Validation parameters included linearity, accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and robustness. This HPLC method was also employed for the determination of <b>UV-filter</b> B 3 during skin penetration studies and to identify photodegradants by liquid chromatography - mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Photostability studies of BMDM and OC individually and in combination were undertaken in methanol and a microemulsion. The microemulsion was adapted from a formula in the literature, with xanthan gum added to optimise the viscosity for topical application. Photodegradation profiles of chemical UV-filters in methanol were determined in a photoreactor using a medium pressure mercury lamp as light source and a pyrex glass vessel (λ ≥ 300 nm). Incorporated in a microemulsion, <b>UV-filter</b> photostability was determined in a solar simulator (λ ≥ 290 nm), according to ICH Guideline Q 1 B. The influence of silica coated TiO₂ (119 nm), uncoated micro- (0. 6 μm) and nano-TiO₂ (< 25 nm) on the photostability of both chemical UV-filters was investigated. Degradation kinetics of BMDM and OC separately and in combination were studied in methanol in the photoreactor, using a quartz glass vessel (λ ≥ 200 nm). Skin penetration of BMDM and OC, incorporated in the microemulsion, was then studied in vitro using porcine ear skin in Franz diffusion cells. Results were compared to the skin penetration of <b>UV-filter</b> B 3, which is known to penetrate the skin and cause photoallergic skin reactions. <b>UV-filter</b> concentrations were determined in the receptor fluid, the skin (stratum corneum and viable epidermis/dermis) and the remaining microemulsion on the skin surface using the validated HPLC method. The stratum corneum was separated from the viable epidermis/dermis using the tape stripping method. Results and Discussion: In methanol, photodegradation of BMDM in the presence of silica coated, micro- and nano-TiO₂ was higher than without TiO₂. In general, OC showed less photodegradation than BMDM. Both, BMDM and OC, followed mixed zero- and first-order degradation kinetics. Photodegradants of both UV-filters were identified by LC-MS and molecular weights were confirmed by Fourier transform - mass spectroscopy (FTMS). Two major photodegradants were found for BMDM. Although in the presence of nano-TiO₂ (pyrex glass), OC recovery was reduced by 38...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The sun’s UV {{radiation}} {{is necessary for}} the existence of life on earth. However, too much UV exposure can lead to the development of skin cancer. Therefore, sunscreens are often used by the general population as protection from excessive UV radiation. Unfortunately, many of the chemical UV-filters that are used in sunscreens today have the ability to induce contact and photocontact allergy. In this work two different chemical UV-filters together with the anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen, all known to induce allergic reactions, have been studied to better understand the reason for these adverse effects. In addition, a synthetic route to the natural <b>UV-filter</b> scytonemin has been developed. One of the most commonly used UVA-filters today is the well known photoallergen 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ’-methoxy dibenzoylmethane. We showed that it degrades when irradiated with UV light and that several different photodegradation products are formed. Of particular interest were arylglyoxals and benzils because they were unexplored as potential contact allergens. The benzils were found to be cytotoxic rather than allergenic, whereas the arylglyoxals were found to be strong sensitizers in the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) used to assess their allergenic potency. Photocontact allergy to dibenzoylmethanes is therefore probably caused by the arylglyoxals that are formed upon photodegradation. Chemical reactivity experiments showed that the arylglyoxals have the ability to form immunogenic complexes via an electrophilic-nucleophilic reaction with the amino acid arginine. A relatively new <b>UV-filter</b> on the market is octocrylene that has grown in popularity, due to its ability to stabilize other UV-filters such as 4 -tert-butyl- 4 ’-methoxy dibenzoylmethane. However, recent clinical reports suggest that it is the <b>UV-filter</b> that causes most allergic reactions. Patch and photopatch testing of 172 patients with suspected skin reactions to sunscreens or ketoprofen was performed and 23 of these patients displayed a positive test reaction to octocrylene. Five patients were diagnosed with contact allergy and 18 with photocontact allergy. Notably, many of these patients also displayed a photoinduced reaction to ketoprofen. Without UV radiation, octocrylene was classified as a moderate allergen in the murine LLNA and it was shown to reacted with amines like lysine via a retro-aldol condensation. In presence of UV radiation, octocrylene also reacted with amines but via acyl substitution resulting in a different product outcome than the reaction in the dark. Both the clinical studies and the chemical reactivity experiments thereby indicate that octocrylene has the ability to induce both contact and photocontact allergy. The apparent photocross-reactivity between octocrylene and ketoprofen observed in the clinical study could not be explained by the previous reactivity studies of octocrylene. Furthermore, according to other clinical reports, photosensitization to ketoprofen also leads to photocontact allergy to many other compounds. Ketoprofen was therefore irradiated in presence of five amino acid analogs and interestingly a reaction between the tryptophan and lysine analogs was substantially enhanced by ketoprofen. We believe that ketoprofen generates singlet molecular oxygen which activates the tryptophan analog that subsequently reacts with the lysine analog. The formation of an immunogenic complex not containing the allergen itself can explain many of the observed photocross allergies between ketoprofen and other structurally different compounds. In theory all compounds that are able to generate singlet molecular oxygen can promote the formation of the same immunogenic complex. Finally, the first total synthesis of the dimeric alkaloid scytonemin was developed. This natural occurring <b>UV-filter</b> enables the survival of different species of cyanobacteria in areas of intense solar radiation. The planed structure activity studies of scytonemin and derivatives thereof will hopefully lead {{to the development of a}} stable <b>UV-filter</b> that does not cause contact or photocontact allergy...|$|E

This study investigated the effect of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) particle size on the photostability of the chemical <b>UV-filters</b> butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane (BMDM) and octocrylene (OC) formulated in a microemulsion. The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline Q 1 B for photostability testing of new active substances and medicinal products was applied.

40|$|Inorganic UV-filters in {{use today}} often occur as {{nanoparticles}} and have a photocatalytic effect, {{which can be a}} problem since they can cause negative health effects. This is why Upsalite®, a mesoporous magnesium carbonate recently has been investigated as a <b>UV-filter.</b> Upsalite® itself is however not suitable as a <b>UV-filter</b> since it mainly protects in the UVC range and hence it needs to be complemented by other substances. The substance studied to functionalize Upsalite® in this thesis is titanium dioxide which is an inorganic <b>UV-filter</b> commonly used in sunscreens. In this work two different sol-gel synthesis routes of titanium dioxide have been investigated as well as a co-synthesis of Upsalite® and titanium dioxide. In the first synthesis route already synthesized Upsalite® was mixed with titanium tetra-isopropoxide and 1 -propanol. The second synthesis route was a modified version of synthesis routes described in literature where methanol solvent was used and the pressure was altered by CO 2. This route was explored due to its resemblance with the Upsalite® synthesis. Pressure, temperature and amount of water were varied to optimize incorporation of Upsalite® and investigate possibilities for a co-synthesis. Subsequently a co-synthesis of Upsalite® and titanium dioxide was performed that resulted in two amorphous composite materials depending on if water was added in the drying procedure or not. When mixing Upsalite® in the synthesis liquid of titanium dioxide, titanium dioxide seems to be deposited on Upsalite®. It is however difficult to determine whether the pores of Upsalite® have been completely filled or if they have collapsed. The acid catalyst HCl promotes formation to crystalline titanium dioxide but Upsalite® instead prevents it. The limited crystallization of titanium dioxide when synthesized with Upsalite® may be due to confinement in the Upsalite® pores. The UV-blocking properties of the TiO 2 -Upsalite® without HCl are good with an sun protection factor (SPF) of 27 for a 10 wt% blend in a lotion and an SPF of 7 for the sample with HCl. The modified synthesis route of TiO 2 showed {{that it is possible to}} perform a sol-gel synthesis with a considerably lower amount of water than found in literature and that alteration of temperature and pressure during the synthesis does not affect the crystallization temperature noteworthy.

Here, a 3 D-structural database that can be applied for virtual screening approaches to facilitate the identification of EDCs was constructed. The database was screened using pharmacophores of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17 beta-HSD 3), which catalyzes the last step of testosterone synthesis in testicular Leydig cells and plays an essential role during male sexual development. Among other chemicals, benzophenone (BP) <b>UV-filters</b> were predicted as potential 17 beta-HSD 3 inhibitors. Biological analyses revealed (2, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) -phenylmethanone (also known as benzophenone- 1, BP- 1) as an inhibitor of human 17 beta-HSD 3 (IC(50) 1. 05 microM). BP- 1 also efficiently blocked conversion of androstenedione to testosterone by mouse and rat 17 beta-HSD 3 in whole-organ enzyme assays. Moreover, BP- 1 antagonized the testosterone-dependent activation of androgen receptors (IC(50) 5. 7 microM), suggesting synergistic anti-androgenic effects of BP- 1 by preventing testosterone formation and blocking receptor activation. In addition, analyses of several commonly used <b>UV-filters</b> on estrogen- and androgen-metabolizing 17 beta-HSD enzymes revealed 3 -benzylidene camphor (3 -BC) and 4 -methylbenzylidene camphor (4 -MBC) as low micromolar 17 beta-HSD 2 inhibitors. In conclusion, screening of virtual chemical structure libraries can facilitate the identification of compounds interfering with hormone action. The potential disruption of 17 beta-HSD enzyme function by the <b>UV-filters</b> BP- 1, 3 -BC and 4 -MBC requires further investigation and should be considered for safety assessment of these chemicals...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{component}} of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is the element titanium, which {{is among the}} ten most abundant metals in the Earth’s crust. In nature, TiO 2 is present in three different crystal structures, whereby all three exhibit different physical properties that find different applications. This makes TiO 2 a widely used product component that improves the texture of paints and lacquers, cosmetics, textiles, paper, plastics as well as foods. In sunscreens, nano-TiO 2 has been incorporated as a so-called physical <b>UV-filter</b> since about 1990. The photocatalytic effect of nano-TiO 2 is also exploited {{in a wide range}} of products. The high oxidation potential of nano-TiO 2 coatings is used to produce self-cleaning surfaces because this property helps decompose organic pollutants and therefore also kills bacteria. In the future, the photochromic and electrochromic properties (reversible color changes due to light or electric current) will find greater use. Finally, current research is focusing on the use of nano-TiO 2 in alternative energy production...|$|E
40|$|Parabens, benzophenone- 3 (BP 3) and {{phthalates}} {{are commonly}} used as antimicrobial conservator, <b>UV-filter</b> and plasticizer respectively, and are thought to exhibit endocrine disrupting properties. These endocrine disrupting activities have been recently assumed to lead to cutaneous malignant melanoma. Humans are exposed to these chemicals through different sources such as food, personal care products or cosmetics. In this study we measured urinary levels of 4 parabens, BP 3 and 7 metabolites of phthalates in samples collected from 261 participants living in and around Liege (Belgium). The analyses were carried out by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using isotopic dilution. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the urinary levels of these 3 classes of chemicals are reported for the same general population in Belgium. Most of the parabens, the BP 3 and all the phthalate metabolites were detected in 82. 8 to 100. 0 % of the samples. For most of these chemicals, the exposure patterns significantly differ between children and adults, but also between males and females, especially with higher concentrations of parabens and phthalate metabolites in female and children subjects respectively.

40|$|All {{the people}} are exposed to solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation. Exposure to sun with living in an oxygen-rich atmosphere causes unwanted photodemage. Sunburned skin is a leading risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma cancers. UV exposure causes immunosuppression via multiple mechanisms in the skin. In this review the main topic is to mention new or alternative ways of photoprotection. Sunscreens are commonly used as protection against sun damage. They reduce the penetration of damaging solar UV wavelengths in skin by reflecting or absorbing them. Sunscreens are very valuable, but they have limitations. They have to be used properly to gain the full effect (application a little while before UV exposure, at frequent time points and in adequate amounts). Also, they have the problem of photoinactivation, which is the degeneration of the <b>UV-filter</b> due to exposure to UV rays resulting {{in the loss of}} absorbing capacity. Products with immune protection factor contain DNA-repair enzymes and antioxidants that may reduce mutations and enable the immune system to combat photodamage. The use of antioxidants and polyphenols may exert an anti-aging effect by preventing and even reversing sun damage. Adequate photprotection is essential to control photocarcinogenesis and photoaging...|$|E
40|$|Two new 2 -(2 ´-hydroxyaryl) {{benzotriazole}} derivatives were synthesized {{and studied}} by photophysical and photochemical techniques {{in order to}} assess their ability to act as <b>UV-filters.</b> The absorption and emission properties of both compounds were determined in solvents of different polarity. In non polar solvent, a photoinduced excited state intramolecular proton transfer was established leading to efficient non radiative dissipation of UV-energy. In addition, the compounds considered were photostable under irradiation with simulated sunlight...|$|R

The first part concerns spectral properties of the underlying shifted hermitean Wilson operator and the relation to the observed speedup of the overlap construction. Next, the localization of the filtered overlap and its axial-vector renormalization constant are discussed. Finally, results of an exploratory scaling study for m_ud, m_s and f_π, f_K are presented.

40|$|The first {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate effects of endocrine disruptors on the developing brain and gonads of bird embryos. The substances studied were the insecticide methoxychlor, and nine <b>UV-filters</b> (3 -benzylidene camphor (3 BC), 4 methyl benzylidene camphor (4 MBC), benzophenone (BP) 1, 2 and 3, 4 hydroxy benzophenone (4 HB), 4 dihydroxy benzophenone (4 DHB), benzyl salicylate (BS), and ethyl- 4 -aminobenzoate Et-PABA)), commonly used in cosmetic products. Some of these substances have no estrogenic effect in vitro, but {{have been shown to}} be estrogenic in vivo. The PCB-mixture Clophen A 50 is a well-known inducer of biotransformation enzymes and was co-administered with methoxychlor and the <b>UV-filters</b> 3 BC and 4 MBC. Exposure to 3 BC or 4 MBC caused ovotestis formation and malformations of the Müllerian ducts in Japanese quail embryos. Co-exposure to one of these compounds and Clophen A 50 enhanced the effects, indicating that Clophen A 50 potentiates the effects of the <b>UV-filters.</b> Embryonic co-exposure to Clophen A 50 and methoxychlor caused a disturbed male sexual behaviour. The metabolites of methoxychlor are estrogen receptor (ER) α-selective, which indicates that the effects on behaviour following embryonic treatment were mediated by ERα. Another objective in this thesis was to localize estrogen receptors (ERs) in the brain of adult and embryonic Japanese quail. The ER localization provides a basis for mechanistic studies on effects of endocrine disruptors, by the identification of estrogen-responsive areas in the brain. We found that ERβ, not previously implicated in sex-differentiation of the brain, was the only ER-subtype present in a sexually dimorphic brain area during differentiation. In conclusion, the estrogenic effects of 3 BC, 4 MBC and methoxychlor were increased by co-exposure to PCB. These results raise concern since many wildlife species, as well as humans, carry large body burdens of persistent organic pollutants like PCBs, which potentially can interact and enhance the effects of other endocrine disruptors...|$|R
