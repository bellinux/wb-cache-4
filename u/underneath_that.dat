Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation.

5|$|The {{miniature}} towers bear finer {{and more}} elegant details, indicating that architectural ideas traveled fast {{from the north}} to the south. Decoration and ornamentation had evolved from a moulded form to a chiseled form, the sharpness sometimes giving it a three-dimensional effect. The foliage decorations changed from bulky to thin, and {{a change in the}} miniature towers on dual pilasters is seen. The 11th century miniatures consisted of a cornice (kapota), a floor (vyalamala), a balustrade (vedika) and a roof (kuta) with a voluptuous moulding, while in the 12th century, detailed dravida miniature towers with many tiny tiers (tala) came into vogue. Some 12th-century temples such as the Kallesvara Temple at Hirehadagalli have miniature towers that do not stand on pilasters but instead are supported by balconies, which have niches <b>underneath</b> <b>that</b> normally contain an image of a deity.|$|E

500|$|As a {{republic}} of the USSR, the Armenian SSR [...] introduced its first flag in 1936. Very {{similar to the}} flag of the Soviet Union, it was red and featured a yellow hammer and sickle in the corner. <b>Underneath</b> <b>that,</b> there were [...] "H-Kh-S-H" [...] initials [...] written in Armenian serif script.

[...] In the 1940s, the flag was altered to use the Eastern Armenian language spoken in the Republic. The initials were changed to [...] "H-S-S-R" [...] meaning [...] "Hayastani Sovetakan Sotsialistikakan Respublika" [...] in the Eastern Armenian pronunciation. In 1952, a new flag was introduced. The initials were removed completely and in their place a horizontal blue stripe was added.|$|E

Several of those living there claimed to have seen a figure dressed in a black silk gown and a white cap, and described it as Hannah Beswick.

500|$|American Life became Madonna's final studio {{album with}} Maverick Records, and {{marked the end}} of an eleven-year {{recording}} history with the label. In an interview with VH1, Madonna discussed her motivations behind the record discussing her 20 years in the industry and stating that [...] "material things" [...] were unimportant, stating [...] "I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record. The album has been deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around the United States. [...] " [...] are examining things I valued and things I found myself worrying about, caring too much about, and realizing that those things aren't important and wanting to get out from <b>underneath</b> <b>that</b> cloud, the world of illusion", Madonna stated.

This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. O'Brien described the concept of the album and the song: ...|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion <b>underneath</b> <b>that</b> total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles <b>underneath.</b> <b>That</b> kind of detail took us {{a long time to get}} right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E

500|$|Alexander Wang {{designed}} a [...] "bondage body suit" [...] worn by Beyoncé during the show, {{as well as}} multiple pieces by Nicola Formichetti for Diesel. One of these included the previously mentioned denim outfit, which was [...] "made from the company's patented Jogg Jean material, accented with hand-applied hardware and studwork, Swarovski crystal elements and black leather accessories", worn {{for the performance of}} [...] "Run the World (Girls)". Formichetti commented on the outfit, saying [...] "Every classic cops and robbers story blurs the lines between the good and bad, we wanted Beyoncé's to be both. Her look is one part police officer and two parts jailbait." [...] Another piece designed by Diesel was an outfit consisting of jean-shorts and a leather jacket embroiled with the word [...] "Texas". Biker gangs that developed in the United States after World War II served as an inspiration for the outfit; Beyoncé's was meant as a tribute to her hometown and a reminder of her roots. It took 4–5 hours to add the word Texas to the leather jacket. The bondage bodysuit was described as [...] "a riff off of an urban bomber hoodie jacket that was cropped to expose a bondage bodysuit <b>underneath</b> <b>that</b> has graphic cutouts. When worn up, the oversized hood covers the face, adding an incognito element reminiscent of the On The Run theme." [...] It also contained snakeskin seamed into the sleeves of the outfit. One of the more controversial pieces worn by Beyoncé during the On the Run Tour was a black, thong leotard that [...] "put her bare rear end on display in a kind of cage-like cutout". Erica Schwiegershausen of The Cut blog wrote that the number was a [...] "somewhat disorienting look". During the performance of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", Beyoncé revisited a leotard from the song's music video in a black and gold lace bodysuit designed by Michael Costello who wanted [...] "Beyoncé to feel beautiful, strong, super sexy and ventilated" [...] with the outfit. Lebanese designer Elie Saab created a bridal-themed, white long-sleeve lace-embellished jumpsuit for Beyoncé for the performances of [...] "Resentment" [...] and [...] "Love On Top" [...] which was part of his Pre-Fall 2014 collection.|$|E

Ultimately, this was also intended as a commentary on the state of Weimar Germany; <b>underneath</b> <b>that</b> facade of prosperity and happiness, lay corruption and savagery. Under Brecht's (and to some extent Weill's) Marxist-influenced view of capitalism, it is created to provide people the goods and services they need, but it does so at the expense of reducing everything to a mere commodity.
