The Charter/International Terminal, later renamed Terminal 2, was opened in December 1991 to handle rising international traffic to Las Vegas. An additional, nine-story parking garage and an <b>underground</b> <b>tunnel</b> linking the Las Vegas Beltway to the airport were constructed as well. In June 1998, the southwest and southeast wings of the D Gates were opened.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{had been}} mined at Bradford {{since at least}} the early 17th century, when the area around the pits was largely rural; it became {{increasingly}} built-up and industrialised as nearby Manchester expanded during the 19th century. Coal was transported from the colliery by canal and railway, but most was consumed locally by the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. In the mid-20th century a 469-yard (420 m) <b>underground</b> <b>tunnel</b> was dug to supply coal directly to the Stuart Street Power Station.|$|E

5|$|After {{decades of}} {{planning}} and construction the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a next generation detector for the new proton-proton collider (7 TeV + 7 TeV) called the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which is now operational in the existing 17mi (27km) circular <b>underground</b> <b>tunnel</b> near Geneva, Switzerland at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction and operation of the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State and shipped to CERN for installation.

5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an <b>underground</b> <b>tunnel</b> from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown {{familiar}} with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E

5|$|Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1842 novel Guy Fawkes, {{wrote about}} the local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned by Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby in Ordsall Hall's Star Chamber.

5|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century {{vision of a}} university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts principles by architects McKim, Mead, and White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or , in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive <b>underground</b> <b>tunnel</b> system {{more than a century}} old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} {{economy was}} decentralized for its protection and large factories, {{located in the}} heavily populated Red River Delta region, were broken up and scattered into caves and small villages throughout the countryside. In the more heavily bombed southern panhandle, entire villages moved into <b>underground</b> <b>tunnel</b> complexes for the duration. Food shortages in North Vietnam became widespread, especially in the urban areas, as rice farmers went into the military or volunteered for service repairing bomb damage. When the nation's transportation system came under attack, destroyed bridges were repaired or replaced by dirt fords, ferries, and underwater or pontoon bridges. The system proved to be durable, well built, easily repaired, and practically impossible to shut down.|$|E
5|$|While the {{monorail}} schemes {{were all}} abandoned, {{a scheme to}} create an <b>underground</b> <b>tunnel</b> link gained momentum. SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive ‚Äî the body formed in 1969 to improve public transport for Manchester and its surrounding municipalities ‚Äì promoted the Picc-Vic tunnel project. This was a proposal to link Piccadilly and Victoria stations via a tunnel under the city centre and enable train services to run across the Manchester conurbation. Greater Manchester County Council (GMC) inherited the project and presented it to the United Kingdom Government in 1974, but the council failed to secure the necessary funding and the project was abandoned in 1977. Inter-station links were provided by the Centreline shuttle bus service for many years.|$|E
5|$|At the house, the Doctor is {{surprised}} by Caecilius's daughter Evelina, {{who seems to}} have extrasensory perception (ESP) and knows personal details about the Doctor and Donna. They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature.

Some people from the local area retell stories that have passed from generation to generation that the castle was burned 27 times. The existence of a salt cellar inside the property is also debated.

Other statements say that the southwest tower imprisons a murderess, a story denied by contemporary owners. <b>Underground</b> <b>tunnels</b> were built below the castle, known by everyone who lives nearby. These <b>underground</b> <b>tunnels</b> through the village of Olbreuse they were prolonged to the Mauz√© Mignon (located 6.6km from Olbreuse). Other <b>tunnels</b> went <b>underground</b> to the church of Our Lady of Dey (located south of the town of Prin-Deyran√ßon about 7 kilometers from Olbreuse) and some even came out in the woods of Olbreuse. These <b>underground</b> <b>tunnels</b> were used during the French religious wars to allow Protestants to hide and to flee. They were well built, and it was sometimes even possible to stand up.
