5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling <b>up</b> <b>old</b> plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E

25|$|The 1911 Census {{shows that}} the {{population}} of Skinnand was once again in decline {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, with just 28 people living in the village.

Today, just a boarded <b>up</b> <b>old</b> farm house stands where the thriving community of Skinnand once was.|$|E

Smith later wrote the play Confessions to Anne Sexton and the beginnings of a novel entitled, The Tragedy of Lake Tuscarora. To make ends meet, Smith became a taxi driver for Beck Taxi, a company in Toronto known for its orange and green taxi cabs.

25|$|The {{plan of the}} Chapel holds to the Gothic {{tradition}} of the T form, but the proportions of the interior, the arrangement of bays and buttresses outside, and the carving, are distinctly classical. Perhaps it was difficult owing to the disturbed state {{of the country to}} get carvers outside Oxford; in any case he had to use <b>up</b> <b>old</b> material. For some reason or other, perhaps because it contains swags and Classic capitals, it has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. Certainly he was in Oxford in 1656, not being elected to the Gresham Professorship till 1657, but from then onwards {{he spent most of his}} time in London, and probably did not return till his election to the Savilian Professorship in 1661. It is possible that he was interested in the matter, as an amateur: his father had very strong architectural leanings, and may have imbued his son with like interests: but there is absolutely no evidence in support of the theory, nor is there anything to show that he had any interest in architecture before his appointment to the post of Assistant Surveyor General in 1662, when the Chapel was practically completed. Beyond details of carving, there is little resemblance to his work, and the building lacks the unity and feeling for proportion and scale which are the chief characteristics of Wren's style.|$|E

Judge Colin Lamont ruled that Malema's singing of the song in a post-apartheid South Africa was [...] "derogatory, dehumanising and hurtful" [...] to the Afrikaner minority group. Lamont said [...] "People must develop new customs and rejoice in a developing society by giving <b>up</b> <b>old</b> practices which are hurtful to members who live in that society with them." ...|$|E

500|$|When Ellis {{experiences}} a rare, completely lucid day, and expresses her immense disappointment at how ordinary Meredith {{has turned out}} to be, she becomes depressed and possibly suicidal. During a ferryboat accident, Meredith is knocked into the water and chooses to give up and drown, rather than fight and swim. She flatlines at the hospital, and awakens in an [...] "afterlife", where she interacts with deceased former acquaintances. Ellis dies in the interim, and Meredith meets with her mother, who tells her that she is anything but ordinary. She is subsequently resuscitated at the insistence of Cristina. Derek distances himself from Meredith as the result of her self recklessness, prompting her to seek therapy to address her problems. Meredith sees a therapist, Dr. Wyatt (Amy Madigan), to seek happiness and begins to successfully tackle her issues. Meredith found her mother's diaries, dredging <b>up</b> <b>old</b> memories and secrets for her to work through. Meanwhile, Meredith nearly fails her intern exam after a drunken Thatcher publicly blames Meredith for the death of his wife, Susan, a distraught Grey sits through her entire test without writing a single answer. Dr. Webber gives her a second chance, saving her from destroying her career.|$|E
500|$|In November 1865, Johnson sent Grant on a {{fact-finding mission}} to the South. Grant {{recommended}} continuation of a reformed Freedmen's Bureau, which Johnson opposed, but advised {{against the use of}} black troops in garrisons, which he believed encouraged an alternative to farm labor. Grant did not believe the people of the South were ready for self-rule, and that both whites and blacks in the South required protection by the federal government. Concerned four years of war led to a diminished respect for civil authorities, Grant concluded the Army should continue their presence to maintain order. He also warned of threats by disaffected poor people, black and white, and recommended that local decision-making be entrusted only to [...] "thinking men of the South" [...] (i.e., white men of property). In this respect, Grant's opinion on Reconstruction aligned with Johnson's policy of restoring former Confederates to their positions of power, arguing that Congress should allow representatives from the South to take their seats. Believing in Confederate amnesty, Grant pressed that former Confederates be reenlisted into the U.S. military. Grant personally intervened on behalf of Lee, who had been federally indicted for treason along with other Confederate generals, keeping Lee safe from prosecution, saving the nation from opening <b>up</b> <b>old</b> war wounds. On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of General of the Army of the United States.|$|E

[...] Once after Mona’s mother took the children to a relief center for food and used clothing, Neb insisted that they return the goods, telling the family, “We’ll have to do without anything we can’t get on our own.” [...] These experiences helped instill in Mona the industriousness, determination, and discipline that would characterize the remainder of her life.|$|E
2500|$|A longer poem called [...] "The Parliament's {{assembly}} in February 1871", was posthumously printed in Helgeland's Tidings in 1899. In the poem Augustinussen is invisibly {{present at the}} opening of the Storting, and welcomes every member of parliament, one after another as they arrive. The poem has explanatory notes from Augustinussen himself. A transcript was printed in Helgeland's Yearbook in 1981 and lasted nine pages. The poem is mildly satirical, it seems to be mostly be cheerful with friendly comments. Its sting is certainly pointed against Jaabæk and his supporters, and he also brings <b>up</b> <b>old</b> political battles, that hints at the debate over the railway in Trondheim.|$|E
2500|$|The FPC was a five-member {{regulatory}} body {{appointed by the}} President and confirmed by the Senate. One of the FPC's strongest leaders was Leland Olds.

Robert Caro's book Master of the Senate describes how Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Leland's re-appointment by orchestrating a McCarthyism-style smear campaign. The tactics involved having the staff of the House Un-American Activities Committee dig <b>up</b> <b>old</b> writings, which were then taken out of context to falsely paint Olds as a communist. The subcommittee in charge of reappointment was stacked against Leland and coached by Johnson. [...] Following such episodes, the FPC was reluctant to impose price regulation on the producers.|$|E

2500|$|When Sammartino {{was about}} 51 years old, he was {{involved}} in a backstage fight with a former football player. Six men were backstage at a wrestling show in an area that was restricted, and when Sammartino spotted the men, he told them that if security saw them in this area, they might get in trouble. Dave [...] "Rooster" [...] Fleming, a former CFL player with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, stuck his hand out to Sammartino. When Sammartino went to shake his hand, Fleming began to squeeze hard, and Sammartino asked him what he was doing, to which Fleming replied, [...] "You're nothing but a washed <b>up</b> <b>old</b> man". Sammartino responded, [...] "Not too washed up to take care of you". Upon hearing that, Fleming took a swing at Sammartino, but Sammartino blocked it and knocked him down with a punch.
