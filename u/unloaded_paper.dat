Far fewer medium-format cameras are motorized, and medium-format roll film does not have sprocket holes, so loading often requires that marking on the backing paper of the film be lined up with markings on the camera, and on <b>unloading,</b> the backing <b>paper</b> must be carefully secured to protect the film from light.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompressed Air (CA) {{systems have}} a {{significant}} impact on the energy consumption and efficiency of manufacturing systems. These may be composed of a single compressor or include several compressors that work together in a logical manner. Compressors with fixed or variable drive systems have dynamic energy consumption profiles. In addition, they require complicated logic to control multiple compressors as a system. The control system reacts to the flow and pressure of the air output and determines which compressors need to be loaded and which ones to be <b>unloaded.</b> This <b>paper</b> provides an overview of techniques to model energy consumption as well as various approaches used to control the CA system. A state-base modelling technique is used to develop a simulation model that includes both fixed and variable speed drive compressors. This has been applied to analyse different scenarios for controlling the system. An industrial case study including two variable speed and one fixed speed drive compressor is used to demonstrate the dynamic of energy consumption of the system and the validity of the proposed model...|$|R

The previous three papers are specific to various commodities, such as televisions, appliances, furniture, machinery, doors and windows, and paint products. These products are known to represent high levels of freight damage and corresponding claims to carriers. Products of different sizes and weights are loaded into trailers using various methods both mechanical and manual, by various algorithms to best weigh or cube out a trailer efficiently. However improper loading and lack of load securement inside the trailer can result in damage to both packages and the products they contain, and can lead to subsequent injury during <b>unloading.</b> The <b>paper</b> discusses improperly loaded trailers, and recommends proper loading methods. In addition choice of good pallets and unitization methods is discussed. It also presents US Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations to secure loads for transport.

In a first approach a reliable protective device with functional diversity has been developed using a passive infrared sensor in combination with a capacitive field sensor. Second the distinction between skin and wood or other material is done by dedicated kind of spectral analysis in the near infrared region. With a kind of light curtain the intrusion into the dangerous zone near the blade can be prevented. The safety guard protects the operator’s hand within 50 ms.

40|$|Recent {{compression}} {{tests of}} NiTi pillars {{of a wide}} range of diameters have shown significant size dependency in the strain recovered upon <b>unloading.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we propose a numerical model supporting the previously proposed explanation that the external Ti oxide layer may be responsible for the loss of superelasticity in the small pillars. The shape memory alloy at the center of the pillar is described using a nonlocal superelastic model, whereas the Ti oxide layer is modeled as elastoplastic. Voigt average analysis and finite element calculations are compared to experiments for the available range of pillar sizes. The simulation results also suggest a size-dependent strain hardening due to the constraint on the phase transformation effected by the confining Ti oxide layer. United States.

40|$|Large knee {{adduction}} moments during gait {{have been}} implicated as a mechanical factor {{related to the}} progression and severity of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis {{and it has been}} proposed that these moments increase the load on the medial compartment of the knee joint. However, this mechanism cannot be validated without taking into account the internal forces and moments generated by the muscles and ligaments, which cannot be easily measured. Previous musculoskeletal models suggest that the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint bears the majority of the tibiofemoral load, with the lateral compartment unloaded at times during stance. Yet these models did not utilise explicitly measured muscle activation patterns and measurements from an instrumented prosthesis which do not portray lateral compartment <b>unloading.</b> This <b>paper</b> utilised an EMG-driven model to estimate muscle forces and knee joint contact forces during healthy gait. Results indicate that while the medial compartment does bear the majority of the load during stance, muscles provide sufficient stability to counter the tendency of the external adduction moment to unload the lateral compartment. This stability was predominantly provided by the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemii muscles, although the contribution from the tensor fascia latae was also significant. Lateral compartment unloading was not predicted by the EMG-driven model, suggesting that muscle activity patterns provide useful input to estimate muscle and joint contact forces. No Full Tex...|$|R

ÅF Consult is a consult organization thatprovides industrial solutions worldwide. In order to test equipment andintroduce employees and students to control systems, a PLC based lab station isnecessary. The methodology used in the project {{is based on a}} literature study,followed by the solution approach and finally an evaluation. A DistributedControl System setup using a Siemens S 7 - 300 and a Siemens S 7 - 400 PLC hasbeen developed. The PLCs communicate using PROFIBUS DP. The station isdivided into two major parts: a conveyor belt with transportation functionalityand a robotic arm with pick-and-place functionality. The station is providedwith equipment similar to systems currently used in paper and pulp industries. Existing solutions for <b>unloading</b> of <b>paper</b> reels in the paper and pulp industriesare non-universal due to extra equipment like pre-installed rails in trailers. Anautomated solution for unloading using a robotic arm is therefore presented,designed to reduce paper reel handling and to have the possibility to unload toany trailer. The lab station is implemented according to ÅF Consults demandsof a portable, field related station. The low budget resulted in cheap equipmentthat lack accuracy, mainly resulting in issues relating to the ability to control therobotic arm properly.

The paper {{originally}} sold for 10 cents and later for 25 cents. Every Thursday night around 9 pm a Volkswagen truck (the one with the fold-down sides) would arrive from the printer, pulling up to Max Scherr's house on Oregon Street, which served as the paper's offices. The waiting street vendors would help <b>unload</b> the <b>papers</b> and then get in line to get their stack. The papers would be purchased at half-price or obtained for collateral. The prospective vendor who wished to obtain papers on collateral would show Scherr something of value, such as a musical instrument or a backpack containing clothing and poems. If Scherr felt the goods were valuable enough that the owner would return to get them, he would keep the collateral in exchange for a bundle of 50 papers to sell on the street. As soon as their papers were in hand vendors would hurry off to a busy intersection or their personal favorite corner, and then spend the night waiting on the curb so that no other vendor would steal their spot and they'd be able to sell their papers during the rush hour on Friday morning. The first vendor to get to The Pic coffee house was guaranteed sales of up to 25 papers. The vendor kept half of the money, so when that bundle of papers was sold, he or she would return to the office, buy back the collateral and possibly buy more papers with cash, and then return to the street corner to sell more papers. At the time the cost of living was low, so sales of Scherr's paper kept transient and homeless people afloat.|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{aperture}} change {{under stress}} {{has long been}} considered as one of primary causes of stress sensitivity of fractured gas reservoirs. However, {{little is known about}} the evolution of the morphology of fracture apertures on flow property in loading and <b>unloading</b> cycles. This <b>paper</b> reports a stress sensitivity experiment on carbonate core plugs in which Computed Tomography (CT) technology is applied to visualize and quantitatively evaluate morphological changes to the fracture aperture with respect to confining pressure. Fracture models were obtained at selected confining pressures on which pore-scale flow simulations were performed to estimate the equivalent absolute permeability. The results showed that with the increase of confining pressure from 0 to 0. 6 MPa, the fracture aperture and equivalent permeability decreased at a greater gradient than their counterparts after 0. 6 MPa. This meant that the rock sample is more stress-sensitive at low effective stress than at high effective stress. On the loading path, an exponential fitting was found to fit well between the effective confining pressure and the calculated permeability. On the unloading path, the relationship is found partially reversible, which can evidently be attributed to plastic deformation of the fracture as observed in CT images...|$|R
40|$|As {{shown in}} [1], {{the problem of}} routing a flow subject to a {{worst-case}} end-to-end delay constraint in a packed-based network can be formulated as a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Program, and solved with general-purpose tools in real time on realistic instances. However, that result only holds for one particular class of packet schedulers, Strictly Rate-Proportional ones, and implicitly considering each link to be fully loaded, so that the reserved rate of a flow coincides with its guaranteed rate. These assumptions make latency expressions simpler, and enforce perfect isolation between flows, i. e., admitting a new flow cannot increase the delay of existing ones. Other commonplace schedulers both yield more complex latency formulæ and do not enforce flow isolation. Furthermore, the delay actually depends on the guaranteed rate of the flow, which can be significantly larger than the reserved rate if the network is <b>unloaded.</b> In this <b>paper</b> we extend the result to other classes of schedulers and to a more accurate representation of the latency, showing that, even when admission control needs to be factored in, the problem is still efficiently solvable for realistic instances, provided that the right modeling choices are made.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{indentation}} {{analysis is}} to link indentation data, typically an indentation force vs. indentation depth curve, P–h, to meaningful mechanical properties of the indented material. While well established for time independent behavior, {{the presence of a}} time dependent behavior can strongly affect both the loading and the <b>unloading</b> responses. The <b>paper</b> presents a framework of viscoelastic indentation analysis based on the method of functional equations, developed by Lee and Radok [1960, The contact problem for viscoelastic bodies, J. Appl. Mech. 27, 438 – 444]. While the method is restricted to monotonically increasing contact areas, we show that it remains valid {{at the very beginning of}} the unloading phase as well. Based on this result, it is possible to derive closed form solutions following the classical procedure of functional formulations of viscoelasticity: (1) the identification of the indentation creep function, which is the indentation response to a Heaviside load; and (2) a convolution integral of the load history over the indentation creep function. This is shown here for a trapezoidal loading by a conical indenter on three linear isotropic viscoelastic materials with deviator creep: the 3 -parameter Maxwell model, the 4 -parameter Kelvin–Voigt model and the 5 -parameter combined Kelvin–Voigt–Maxwell model. For these models, we derive closed form solutions that can be employed for the back-analysis of indentation results from the loading and holding period and for the definition of unloading time criteria that ensure that viscous effects are negligible in the unloading response...|$|R
40|$|The {{stress-strain}} {{behavior of}} clayey soil is time dependent. Laboratory study and constitutive modeling of the time-dependent stress-strain behavior {{are needed to}} understand the soil behavior and analyze displacements of reclamation works and foundations on clayey soils. The stress relaxation, {{as one of the}} significant time-dependent phenomena in clayey soils, has been observed and examined in excavations and constructions, such as the short-term change in lateral earth pressure after installation of a supporting system. In this study, Hong Kong marine deposits (HKMDs), which are clayey soils, and a sand-mixed bentonite (SMB) soil were investigated in relaxation tests. Relaxations were performed in both the loading stage and the <b>unloading</b> stage. This <b>paper</b> is focused on the testing study and modeling of the time-dependent relaxation behavior of clayey soils. Relaxation tests were carried out to measure the changes of the effective stress with time in one-dimensional (1 D) straining condition. A new 1 D elastic visco-plastic model considering swelling (1 D EVPS) was used to simulate the relaxation tests. Analytical solutions from the 1 D EVPS constitutive equations were obtained for relaxation tests. All parameters in this 1 D EVPS model were obtained from a conventional oedometer test. The analytical solutions from the 1 D EVPS model were used to simulate the relaxation behavior and compare with test data. Good agreement between the simulated curve and the measured data were found.

40|$|The load {{partitioning}} between {{surface and}} bulk was studied {{by means of}} in-situ synchrotron energy dispersive diffraction in an SAF 2507 superduplex stainless steel having a strain hardened surface layer with compressive residual stresses. Two loading cycles with a peak tensile strain of 0. 5 % and 0. 87 %, respectively, were successively applied {{and the evolution of}} stresses in the respective constituent phases (austenite and ferrite) were measured in a 0. 026 mm thick surface layer and at 0. 75 mm depth, from which the macrostress development was derived, respectively, for the two locations. It was found that the surface and the bulk followed different loading paths and that such inhomogeneous load sharing was related to variation in strength and residual stresses over the load-carrying cross-section. During macroscopic elastic loading, the load partitioning, characterized by increasing tensile stress in the bulk and decreasing compressive stress in the surface, depended mainly on the initial residual stress distribution. Upon yielding of the bulk, a rapid load transfer from the bulk to the hard surface layer started and continued until the surface also reached its elastic limit. At the 0. 87 % peak strain, the plastic incompatibility over the cross-section resulted in a much higher stress in the surface (1070 MPa) than in the bulk (680 MPa), which also led to a large tensile residual stress in the surface after <b>unloading.</b> In the <b>paper,</b> the observed inhomogeneous microscopic load partitioning was also presented...|$|R
