5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained <b>unauthorized</b> access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first <b>unauthorized</b> access by hackers occurred on 19 September. Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no <b>unauthorized</b> change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E
5|$|It also {{triggered}} the Texas legislature {{to pass the}} Antiquities Code in 1969 to prevent <b>unauthorized</b> excavation of future finds.|$|E
5|$|StarCrafts success also {{inspired}} {{third-party developer}} Microstar Software to release an <b>unauthorized</b> add-on, entitled Stellar Forces, in May 1998. Blizzard Entertainment consequently {{filed a lawsuit}} against Microstar for selling the add-on, arguing that as the product was <b>unauthorized</b> and created using StarCrafts level editing software, it was a breach of the end user license agreement.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} did {{not specifically}} address {{the constitutionality of}} the older portion of the statute which prohibits the <b>unauthorized</b> wearing, manufacturing, or sale of military medals or decorations. Under the law, the <b>unauthorized</b> wearing, manufacturing, or sale of the Medal of Honor is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to one year.|$|E

5|$|Although U.S. {{copyright}} law {{would have allowed}} him to produce an <b>unauthorized</b> adaptation, Mansfield secured the American and British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script. Sullivan had previously only written {{in his spare time}} while working as a clerk for Lee, Higginson & Co., a Boston investment bank. Although he doubted that the novella would make a good play, he agreed to help Mansfield with the project, and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, <b>unauthorized</b> versions could be staged.|$|E
5|$|Convicted {{computer}} {{criminals are}} people who are caught and convicted of computer crimes such as breaking into computers or computer networks. Computer crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (<b>unauthorized</b> access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (<b>unauthorized</b> damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, 2010, the DOE filed {{a motion}} with the NRC to {{withdraw}} its license application, however multiple lawsuits to stop this action have been filed by states, counties, and individuals across the country as being <b>unauthorized</b> by the NWPA.|$|E
5|$|A common example {{might be}} {{following}} <b>unauthorized</b> network intrusion. A specialist forensic examination {{into the nature}} and extent of the attack is performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify the attacker. Such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Before Insurrection, an <b>unauthorized</b> {{expansion}} pack, called Stellar Forces, {{was published}} by Micro Star but was recalled weeks later when Blizzard won the court case against it. It consisted of 22 single player maps and 32 multi-player maps which {{are considered to be}} rather plain.|$|E
5|$|Customers {{have complained}} that they have created {{subscriptions}} inadvertently and found them difficult to cancel. The most common complaints about Guthy-Renker, according to Truth in Advertising, are <b>unauthorized</b> billing, difficulty cancelling orders, billing for products that never arrive, unhelpful customer service, and refusing refunds despite money-back guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most <b>unauthorized</b> helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 <b>unauthorized</b> flights during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigations have}} a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probe into {{the nature and extent of}} an <b>unauthorized</b> network intrusion).|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{ranged from}} 400 to 700 to 900 <b>unauthorized</b> file disclosures. The {{incident}} caused an intense burst of criticism {{because many of}} the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top figures such as James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, and Marlin Fitzwater.|$|E
5|$|His Remarks {{upon the}} Life of Jan Zamoyski (Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego, 1787), {{published}} anonymously {{on the eve}} of the Great Sejm, transformed the little-known tutor into one of the chief political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth. It became a model for other similar works and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. It was reprinted numerous times, including in <b>unauthorized</b> editions.|$|E
5|$|In July 1984, Raiford guards {{found two}} hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy's cell.

Adoboli was arrested and later charged with fraud by abuse of position and false accounting dating {{as far back as}} 2008.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principle}} that is applied {{by the courts}} is that where statute grants a power to a decision-maker for purpose A, it is unlawful for the decision-maker to exercise the power for purpose B, because the decision-maker would be using the power for an <b>unauthorized</b> purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the DC Graphic Novel Lex Luthor: The <b>Unauthorized</b> Biography. Glen Morgan stated that he wanted the episode to show that The Smoking Man was the most dangerous human being alive. The episode was originally intended to end with The Smoking Man killing Melvin Frohike, but the show's executive staff vetoed the idea.|$|E
5|$|The first live-action film {{based on}} Spider-Man was the <b>unauthorized</b> short Spider-Man by Donald F. Glut in 1969. This was {{followed}} by Spider-Man, an American made-for-television film that premiered on the CBS network in 1977. It starred Nicholas Hammond and {{was intended as a}} backdoor pilot for what became a weekly episodic TV series.|$|E

Addington was also placed on probation until December 31, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Under the Ontario Heritage Act, {{activities}} on registered archeological sites require a license. In March 2005, the Whitefish Point Preservation Society accused the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) of conducting an <b>unauthorized</b> dive to Fitzgerald. Although {{the director of}} the GLSHS admitted to conducting a sonar scan of the wreck in 2002, he denied such a survey required a license {{at the time it was}} carried out.|$|E
5|$|Circus was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} released worldwide on December 2, 2008, Spears's twenty-seventh birthday. However, after <b>unauthorized</b> online leaks, imeem began streaming the album from their website on November 25. The album shared a release date with the similarly titled album The Circus by British group Take That. Both standard and deluxe editions of the album were released in Europe on November 28, 2008 and in the United States on December 2, 2008.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument's base. U.S. Park Police shot and killed Mayer. The monument was undamaged in the incident, and it was discovered later that Mayer did not have explosives. After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible <b>unauthorized</b> approach of motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|From 1995-1997, {{the firm}} created seven new subsidiaries. These {{included}} Guthy-Renker Radio, Internet, Select Network, International and Fitness, {{as well as}} subsidiaries like an online dating service and a psychic business that did not perform well. Guthy-Renker partnered with National Media Corp. to help market some of its fitness products, {{which led to a}} legal dispute that was settled with undisclosed terms in 1997. Guthy-Renker claimed National Media Corp. excessively aired infomercials for an exercise machine, the Fitness Flyer, and started selling an <b>unauthorized</b> imitation of the original. National claimed Guthy-Renker had not provided enough Fitness Flyers to meet demand.|$|E
5|$|However, Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon's move to Pittsburgh in 2006. While no television, {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which printed both a preview and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin's 98FM. Anthrocon still retains tight control over media access, {{not only to the}} convention grounds but to the membership, and has official policy that forbids unmonitored dealings with <b>unauthorized</b> members of the media.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Woods and golfer Arnold Palmer {{initiated}} {{a case against}} Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) {{and others in the}} effort to stop the <b>unauthorized</b> sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Palmer was also named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Target {{started selling}} an Emeco 1006 {{imitation}} product supplied by Euro Style. The supplier said it planned {{to modify the}} chair's style to avoid a legal dispute over alleged trademark infringement. In October 2012, Emeco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Restoration Hardware for allegedly making <b>unauthorized</b> reproductions of the 1006 Navy chair. Restoration Hardware removed the chair from its website, stopped selling the chair, and reached an undisclosed settlement with Emeco.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, undercarriage doors and engine cowling were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by <b>unauthorized</b> divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, {{it emerged}} that a Norwegian export credit company (Eksportfinans) {{had made a}} {{complaint}} to Norwegian police concerning the alleged embezzlement of 415 million Norwegian kroner (€47 million) by Glitnir since 2006. The Icelandic bank had acted as an agent for Eksportfinans, administering loans to several companies: however Eksportfinans alleges that, when the loans were paid off early by borrowers, Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans, effectively taking an <b>unauthorized</b> loan itself.|$|E
