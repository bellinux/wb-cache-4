2500|$|... "Unconventional resources" [...] {{exist in}} {{petroleum}} accumulations that are pervasive throughout a large area. Examples include extra heavy oil, oil sand, and oil shale deposits. Unlike [...] "conventional resources", {{in which the}} petroleum is recovered through wellbores and typically requires minimal processing prior to sale, <b>unconventional</b> <b>resources</b> require specialized extraction technology to produce. For example, steam and/or solvents are used to mobilize bitumen for in-situ recovery. Moreover, the extracted petroleum may require significant processing prior to sale (e.g., bitumen upgraders). The total amount of unconventional oil resources in the world considerably exceeds the amount of conventional oil reserves, but are much more difficult and expensive to develop.|$|E
2500|$|Peak oil as {{a proper}} noun, or [...] "Hubbert's peak" [...] applied more generally, {{refers to a}} {{predicted}} event: {{the peak of the}} entire planet's oil production. After peak oil, according to the Hubbert Peak Theory, the rate of oil production on Earth would enter a terminal decline. On the basis of his theory, in a paper he presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1956, Hubbert correctly predicted that production of oil from conventional sources would peak in the continental United States around 1965–1970. [...] His prediction of inevitable decline has been incorrect, but the 1970 peak has yet not been surpassed. Hubbert further predicted a worldwide peak at [...] "about half a century" [...] from publication and approximately 12 gigabarrels (GB) a year in magnitude. In a 1976 TV interview Hubbert added that the actions of OPEC might flatten the global production curve but this would only delay the peak for perhaps 10 years. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of <b>unconventional</b> <b>resources,</b> and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction.|$|E

40|$|In 1997, Rogner {{published}} a paper containing {{an estimate of}} the natural gas in place in unconventional reservoirs for 11 world regions. Rogner's work was assessing the <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resource</b> base, and is now considered to be very conservative. Very little is known publicly about technically recoverable <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resource</b> potential on a global scale. Driven by a new understanding of the size of gas shale resources in the United States, we estimated original gas in place (OGIP) and technically recoverable resource (TRR) in highly uncertain unconventional gas reservoirs, worldwide. We evaluated global unconventional OGIP by (1) developing theoretical statistic relationships between conventional hydrocarbon and unconventional gas; (2) fitting these relationships to North America publically available data; and (3) applying North American theoretical statistical relationships to evaluate the volume of <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resource</b> of the world. Estimated global unconventional OGIP ranges from 83, 300 (P 10) to 184, 200 (P 90) Tcf. To assess global TRR from unconventional gas reservoirs, we developed a computer program that we call <b>Unconventional</b> Gas <b>Resource</b> Assessment System (UGRAS). In the program, we integrated a Monte Carlo technique with an analytical reservoir simulator to estimate the original volume of gas in place and to predict production performance. We used UGRAS to evaluate the probabilistic distribution of OGIP, TRR and recovery factor (RF) for the most productive unconventional gas formations in the North America. The P 50 of recovery factor for shale gas, tight sands gas and coalbed methane is 25 %, 79 % and 41 %, respectively. Finally, we applied our global OGIP assessment and these distributions of recovery factor gained from our analyses of plays/formations in the United States to estimate global technically recoverable <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resource.</b> Global technically recoverable <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resource</b> is estimated from 43, 000 (P 10) to 112, 000 (P 90) Tcf...|$|R

40|$|The {{collaborative}} research program will help determine if gas hydrate accumulations {{can become an}} economic <b>unconventional</b> energy <b>resource,</b> initially in the onshore Alaska North Slope (ANS) arctic region beneath permafrost and existing production infrastructure. The cooperative research venture between BP Exploration (Alaska), Inc. (BPXA) and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilitates high levels of collaboration between industry, government, and university researchers. The mutually beneficial research activities would not otherwise have been independently conducted by industry. Collett (1998) estimates that up to 590 TCF in-place ANS gas resources may be trapped in clathrate hydrates. An estimated 44 to 100 TCF in-place ANS gas resources may occur beneath existing infrastructure (Collett, 1993). If {{a significant portion of}} this estimated in-place gas can be economically recovered, this <b>unconventional</b> <b>resource</b> could become an important part of future gas resource development in Alaska. Gas from gas hydrates may help fill the projected future gap in U. S. domestic gas production.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, various {{private and}} {{governmental}} agencies have conducted studies to assess potential <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resources,</b> particularly those resources contained in tight sands, fractured shales, and coal beds. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has assessed {{the amount of}} <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resources</b> in North America, and its estimates are used by other government agencies {{as the basis for}} their resource estimates. While the USGS employs a probabilistic methodology, it is apparent from the resulting narrow ranges that the methodology underestimates the uncertainty of these undiscovered, untested, potential resources, which in turn limits the reliability and usefulness of the assessments. The objective of this research is to develop an improved methodology to assess potential <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resources</b> that better accounts for the uncertainty in these resources. This study investigates the causes of the narrow ranges generated by the USGS analyticprobabilistic methodology used to prepare the 1995 national oil and gas assessment and the 2000 NOGA series, and presents an improved methodology to assess potential <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resources.</b> The new model improves upon the USGS method by using a stochastic approach, which includes correlation between the input variables and Monte Carlo simulation, representing a more versatile and robust methodology than the USGS analytic-probabilistic methodology. The improved methodology is applied to the assessment of potential <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resources</b> in the Uinta-Piceance province of Utah and Colorado, and compared to results of the evaluation performed by the USGS in 2002. Comparison of the results validates {{the means and standard deviations}} produced by the USGS methodology, but shows that the probability distributions generated are rather different and, that the USGS distributions are not skewed to right, as expected for a natural resource. This study indicates that the unrealistic shape and width of the resulting USGS probability distributions are not caused by the analytic equations or lack of correlation between input parameters, but rather the use of narrow triangular probability distributions as input variables. Adoption of the improved methodology, along with a careful examination and revision of input probability distributions, will allow a more realistic assessment of the uncertainty surrounding potential <b>unconventional</b> gas <b>resources...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{petroleum}} exploration {{is currently}} undergoing a strategic shift from conventional to <b>unconventional</b> hydrocarbon <b>resources.</b> <b>Unconventional</b> hydrocarbons in tight reservoirs show characteristics distinct {{from those of}} conventional hydrocarbon sources hosted in structural and stratigraphic traps. The characteristic features include the following: a hydrocarbon source and reservoir coexist; porosity and permeability are ultra-low; nano-pore throats are widely distributed; hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir bodies are continuously distributed; there is no obvious trap boundary; buoyancy and hydrodynamics have only a minor effect, and Darcy's law does not apply; phase separation is poor; there is no uniform oil–gas–water interface or pressure system; and oil or gas saturation varies. Examples of unconventional hydrocarbon accumulations are the Mesozoic tight sandstone oil province and the Upper Paleozoic tight sandstone gas province in the Ordos Basin, north-central China. Generally, continuous hydrocarbon accumulation over a large area is a distinguishing characteristic of unconventional hydrocarbon sources.
