50|$|<b>Undisclosed</b> <b>reserves</b> are not common, but are {{accepted}} by some regulators where a bank {{has made a}} profit but the profit has not appeared in normal retained profits or in general reserves of the bank. <b>Undisclosed</b> <b>reserves</b> must {{be accepted by the}} bank's supervisory authorities. Many countries do not accept <b>undisclosed</b> <b>reserves</b> as an accounting concept or as a legitimate form of capital.|$|E

5000|$|Spot: bid-based service: {{runs the}} jobs {{only if the}} spot price is below the bid {{specified}} by bidder. The spot price is claimed to be supply-demand based, however a 2011 study concluded that the price was generally not set to clear the market, but was dominated by an <b>undisclosed</b> <b>reserve</b> price.|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the role that}} reserve prices may play in residential property auctions. In comparison {{to much of the}} previous empirical work, this study has access to <b>undisclosed</b> <b>reserve</b> prices from English auctions. Consistent with theoretical arguments in the auction literature, the results obtained illustrate that whilst higher reserve prices increase the revenue obtained for the seller, they also reduce the probability of sale. The findings also highlight the importance of auction participation, with the number of individual bidders and the number of bids significant in most specifications...|$|R
5000|$|... "Version O" [...] was {{auctioned}} at Christie's New York for {{a second}} time in May 2015, and was expected to set a world record price for a work of art at auction. A pre-sale valuation of $140 million was placed by Christie's on the painting, one of the highest ever placed on an auctioned artwork. The most expensive work of art to previously sell at auction, Francis Bacon's's painting Three Studies of Lucian Freud, had sold for $142.4 million against a pre-sale estimate of c.$85 million in 2013. An <b>undisclosed</b> <b>reserve</b> price had also been placed on the painting prior to the sale. The painting was sold for $179.4 million including fees, a record price for a painting at auction. It was bought by the former Qatari prime minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.|$|R

5000|$|Capital in {{this sense}} is related to, but {{different}} from, the accounting concept of shareholders' equity. Both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital were first defined in the Basel I capital accord and remained substantially {{the same in the}} replacement Basel II accord. Tier 2 capital represents [...] "supplementary capital" [...] such as <b>undisclosed</b> <b>reserves,</b> revaluation reserves, general loan-loss reserves, hybrid (debt/equity) capital instruments, and subordinated debt.|$|E
50|$|At {{a public}} auction at Sotheby's on 29June 2016, the highest {{bid for the}} diamond was $61 million. However, this bid fell short of the <b>undisclosed</b> <b>reserve</b> price and the stone was not sold. The bidding opened at $50 million and the sell lasted for less than 15 minutes. Lukas Lundin, whose family is Lucara Diamond’s largest shareholder, noted that the {{commission}} arrangement with Sotheby’s meant the stone {{would have had to}} reach $150 million for the auctioneer to make a large profit. “Up to $100 million,” Lundin said, “they make almost nothing.” According to David Bennett of Sotheby's, {{it was the first time}} the company held an exclusive auction for one single object. It was preceded by the sale of three smaller rough diamonds. The stones were also from Lucara and the proceeds, $140,000, were donated to charity. The bid was even lower than the $63.3 million that was paid for Lucara's Constellation, the 813 carat rough diamond auctioned in May 2016. The Constellation had been found the day after the Lesedi La Rona in the same section of the mine. After the failed sale, the Lucara stock fell on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The diamond will probably be sold privately.|$|R
25|$|Back at the house, Don, {{expressing the}} {{increased}} risk {{to him and}} his team, tells Charlie that he needs Charlie's help. Later, Alan comforts Charlie by saying that Charlie's mother understood why he chose to work on P vs. NP instead of spending his final three months with her. Charlie then resumes work on the case and realizes that he failed to consider that the bank robbers spent a much longer time outside the bank after the robberies than most bank robbers would have. At the office, Charlie tells the team that the robbers were using Federal Reserve routing numbers stored on each bank's computers to locate a shipment of cash going to an <b>undisclosed</b> Federal <b>Reserve</b> location to be destroyed. The team assumes that the bank robbers need the computer programmer's knowledge to access the data. The team also learns that one shipment is scheduled to leave for the location in a few hours.|$|R
