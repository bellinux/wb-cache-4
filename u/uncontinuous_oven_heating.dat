40|$|Abstract Background Since Germany re-unified in 1990, {{substantial}} {{social and}} economic changes have happened in East Germany, the former socialist German Democratic Republic (GDR). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of these socio-economic changes in East Germany on the association between social status, measured by parental educational level, and health-related living conditions of children during the ten-year period after re-unification. Methods In total, 25, 864 6 -year-old school beginner children (51. 2 % male and 48. 8 % female) participated in cross-sectional studies which have been repeated every year from 1991 to 2000 in East Germany. Parental educational level as a social indicator was the independent variable. Dependent variables included not employed parents, small living space and health-related living conditions (e. g. damp housing, single <b>oven</b> <b>heating</b> and living at busy road). The relationships were described by odds ratios using logistic regression. Results A large overall effect of parental educational level on health-related living conditions was observed. The time trends showed that the situation regarding small living space, damp housing conditions and single <b>oven</b> <b>heating</b> improved from 1991 to 2000, while regarding not employed parents (1996 – 2000) and living at busy road (1991 – 2000) did not, but even deteriorated. 6 -year old children with low parental educational level, who lived at the time of re-unification, were often under damp housing conditions and with single <b>oven</b> <b>heating</b> at homes. Nevertheless, this social inequality has almost vanished ten years later. In contrast, we found an increasing gap between low and high parental educational level with respect to the proportion of parents who were not employed (22 %: 4 % gain), or lived under cramped housing conditions (22 %: 37 % reduction), or close to a busy road (7 % gain: 2 % reduction). Conclusion The social inequalities which already existed under the socialist system in East Germany persisted in the system of social market economy between 1991 and 2000. 6 -year-old children from families with the lowest social status were living under the worst domestic conditions (e. g. living at busy road, having damp housing conditions, single <b>oven</b> <b>heating</b> and small living space) and for some conditions (e. g. living at busy road and having small living space) the gap betweenlow and high social status was even bigger in 2000 than in 1991. </p...|$|R

40|$|Ag-nanoparticle {{thin films}} on a {{polyimide}} substrate {{were subjected to}} microwave sintering by use of a single-mode waveguide applicator. A two-step sintering process was employed.

The microwave sintering process was completed within 1. 5 min, which is significantly lower than the time required for the <b>oven</b> <b>heating</b> process. The resulting conductivity of the film, albeit only 30 % of that of the bulk material, was seven times that of a film annealed at the same temperature in a furnace. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the nanoparticles underwent both grain necking and grain growth during microwave sintering. In addition, this sintering process was equivalent to the <b>oven</b> <b>heating</b> process performed at a 50 °C higher annealing temperature.

Sodium silicate solution containing Na 2 O of 16. 45 %, SiO 2 of 34. 35 %, and H 2 O of 49. 20 % and sodium hydroxide solution of 2. 91, 5. 60, 8. 10, 11. 01, 13. 11, and 15. 08.

The temperature of oven curing was maintained at 40, 60, 90, and 120 °C each for a heating period of 24 hours and tested for compressive strength at the age of 3 days as test period after specified degree of heating. Test results show that the workability and compressive strength both increase with increase in concentration of sodium hydroxide solution for all solution-to-fly ash ratios.
