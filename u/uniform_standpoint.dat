40|$|This book gathers {{together}} {{a range of}} similar problems that can be encountered in different fields of modern quantum physics and that have common features with regard to multilevel quantum systems. The main motivation was to examine from a <b>uniform</b> <b>standpoint</b> various models and approaches {{that have been developed}} in atomic, molecular, condensed matter, chemical, laser and nuclear physics in various contexts. The book should help senior-level undergraduate, graduate students and researchers putting particular problems in these fields into a broader scientific context and thereby taking advantage of well-established techniques used in adjacent fields. This second edition has been expanded to include substantial new material (e. g. new sections on Dynamic Localization and on Euclidean Random Matrices and new chapters on Entanglement, Open Quantum Systems, and Coherence Protection). It is based on the author’s lectures at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, at the CNRS Aimé Cotton Laboratory, and on other courses he has given over the last two decades...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThough useful from a {{clinical}} and practical <b>standpoint</b> <b>uniform,</b> large-field chromatic stimuli {{are likely to}} contain luminance contributions from retinal inhomogeneities. Such contribution can significantly influence psychophysical thresholds. However, {{the degree to which}} small luminance artifacts influence the chromatic VEP has been debated. In particular, claims have been made that band-pass tuning observed in chromatic VEPs result from luminance intrusion. However, there has been no direct evidence presented to support these claims. Recently, large-field isoluminant stimuli have been developed to control for intrusion from retinal inhomogeneities with particular regard to the influence of macular pigment. We report here the application of an improved version of these full-field stimuli to directly test the influence of luminance intrusion on the temporal tuning of the chromatic VEP. Our results show that band-pass tuning persists even when isoluminance is achieved throughout the extent of the stimulus. In addition, small amounts of luminance intrusion affect neither the shape of the temporal tuning function nor the major components of the VEP. These results support the conclusion that the chromatic VEP can depart substantially from threshold psychophysics with regard to temporal tuning and that obtaining a low-pass function is not requisite evidence of selective chromatic activation in the VEP...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to gain a deeper {{understanding}} of the experiences of the contact with the ”fear of childbirth”-team (called Aurora-team) made by women who feared childbirth. Qualitative content analyses according to Graneheim and Lundman was used to analyse 91 womens own written notes made at the end of a questionnaire which (with a quantitative approach) evaluated the counseling made by the Aurora-team at a hospital in the south of Sweden. The following five categories developed during the analyses; experience of the conversation, not knowing creates fear, thoughts regarding mode of delivery, the importance of how the birth plan is managed and the personnel´s standpoint regarding fear of childbirth. These categories can be seen as parts of the themes of experiences which made the fear of childbirth easier or which made it worse. This study shows the importance of meeting the individual woman in the Aurora-consultation in order for the woman to feel respected by the midwife. In order to do so education in communicative techniques should be offered to the Aurora-midwives. It would benefit the feeling of security of the women if the personnel would treat and acknowledge fear of childbirth in the same way, ie from a <b>uniform</b> and professional <b>standpoint.</b> Most women wanted someone to talk to about the delivery experience. This show of the preventive role the postpartum-consultation could have of fear of childbirth...|$|R
