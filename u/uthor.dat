50|$|The {{wedding is}} set at Whitewalls and Lord Frey arrives with his four-year-old heir, Walder Frey, and his fifteen-year-old daughter, who weds Lord Butterwell. Egg becomes {{increasingly}} suspicious when he sees {{that most of the}} competitors belonged to the rebel party. During the wedding Dunk is drafted by John the Fiddler to carry the bride to the bedchamber. Dunk does so and later hears from John that the latter once saw Duncan himself, in a dream, in the armor of the royal guard. Dunk enters the first match of the joust under the name of 'Gallows Knight' (for a new shield acquired after the loss of his own); but is defeated in the first tilt by Ser <b>Uthor</b> Underleaf, known as the Snail Knight for his sigil. Duncan later gives Underleaf his armor and horse as forfeit, and Underleaf informs Dunk that someone bribed him to kill Dunk in the final tilt. Before the jousting continues, word spreads through the castle that the dragon egg is missing, and the blame is placed on Ser Glendon Ball, who is imprisoned by Peake. In search of the absent Egg, Duncan is wounded by Alyn Cockshaw, who claims to have bribed <b>Uthor</b> Underleaf, and throws him into a well. Maynard Plumm comes to Duncan's aid, and it is discovered that Plumm is one of Bloodraven's many spies (or possibly Bloodraven himself), and that John the Fiddler is the eponymous son of Daemon Blackfyre. Dunk finds Egg in the sept with the cowering Lord Butterwell, who on discovering Egg's true identity is terrified for his life. Lord Butterwell's son-in-law Black Tom Heddle tries to kill Egg to incite a war, and is killed by Duncan, who thereupon tells Egg to flee with Butterwell. To buy time for Egg's escape Dunk confronts the younger Daemon Blackfyre, and accuses Gorman Peake of falsely charging Ball with the theft of the dragon egg.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the Austro Hungarian list of {{standing}} tomb-stones in Bosnia and Hercegovina, published in 1897 and 1898 respectively, at {{the order of the}} Provincial Governament in Sarajevo, on the basis of which a report was written by Kosta Hörman, the then director of the mediaeval monuments in Bosnia and Hercegovina. The report was submitted to the 11 th Slavic Archaeological Congress in Kiew, in 1899. As there was no organized protection of the cultural heritage in Bosnia until {{the second half of the}} 19 th century, the mentioned report was one of the first appearances on the European scientific scene. The total number of standing tomb-stones listed by Horman was 59. 500. The author describes their geographical position and their shapes, but most of his attention is dedicated to inscriptions. Dealing with the relief motives, he divides them – according to their character – into an architectonic and an ornamental group; he is also interested in the figural representation. In addition to statistical data and descriptions of monuments, the author also presents his ypotheses and points of view in connection with the origin of the monuments. The author adheres to the idea that the standing tomb-stones are an original Bosnian cultural phonomenon, but the question of their connection with the Bogumil heresy is undecisive and locks clarity. The Hörman report included a map of Bosnia and Hercegovina in which the localities were entered with drawings and photographs. The author of the article, availing himself of new results and knowledge about the standing tomb-stones critically treats the Hörman report, correcting the data on geographical distribution, shapes, and interpretation of inscriptions. But all these objections notwithstanding, thea <b>uthor</b> considers the listing of standing tomb-stones in 1897 and 1898 a great scientific effort, not only of Hörman himself, but also of the Provincial Museum of Bosnia and Hercegovina, since the exhibition in Kiew offered the opportunity to the scientists of the world to be for the first time fully informed about the Bosnian-Hercegovinian standing tomb-stones...|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{question}} of a possible linkage between unemployment and self-management in socialist Yugoslavia. Departing from secondary sources and offering a critical literature review, the article sketches the development of unemployment in Yugoslavia from the 1950 s {{to the beginning of the}} 1980 s, outlines different points of discussion and explores concrete gaps in the existing interpretations. By proposing a differentiated view of self-management, the a <b>uthors</b> conclude that from an economic perspective the relationship between self-management and unemployment was at best an indirect one. The broader system of self-management can hardly be interpreted as an obstacle to political participation or social integration of unemployed persons. In contrast to previous interpretations of Yugoslavia's unemployment which regard it as a paradox, the authors suggest that the paradox was not the existence of unemployment in a socialist state, but the way in which the society - especially when organized on the basis of socialist self-management - reacted to it. In fact, the Yugoslav response to the problem of unemployment proved to be not really different from the way this was handled by other (capitalist) states in this period...|$|R
40|$|The Measurement of the torques of {{mechanical}} losses in an {{internal combustion engine}} 	running under power and the discrimination {{of the causes of}} occurance are exceedingly difficult, 	but very important for further engine inprovement. 	In this paper，a <b>uthors</b> present a new method of measurement and discrimination of the 	resisting torques in an engine， involving two graphical approaches derived from the differential 	equation of motion.
