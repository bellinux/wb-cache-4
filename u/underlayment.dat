In order to avoid any change {{to the sound of the}} hall, the new floor was built using same methods and materials as the original. These included tongue-in-groove, three-quarter inch, hard maple boards, a compressed wool <b>underlayment</b> and hardened steel cut nails, hammered in by hand. The vertical grain fir subfloor from 1899 was in excellent shape and was left in place. The nails used in the new floor were hand cut using the same size and construction as the originals and the back channelling on the original maple top boards was replicated as well.|$|E

Today the roadway remains the [...] "Main Street" [...] of over a dozen Michigan cities and a scenic route through one of the state's most populated corridors. In 1995, major reconstruction work along Grand River Avenue in East Lansing uncovered rotting logs, buried about [...] below the present grade, that had been used as <b>underlayment</b> for the plank road surface in a low, swampy area. The logs had been in place for nearly 150 years. In 2004, the state transferred several blocks at the eastern end of Grand River Avenue to the City of Detroit. State trunkline control now ends at the corner of Grand River Avenue, Middle Street, and Cass Avenue.|$|E

50|$|In the {{category}} of self-leveling concrete {{there are two main}} groups of materials: <b>underlayments</b> and toppings. <b>Underlayments</b> are installed over an existing subfloor to smooth it out and correct any surface irregularities prior to the installation of all types of floor coverings, including sheet vinyl, vinyl composition tile (VCT), wood, ceramic tile and carpet. Toppings perform a similar function but act as the actual finished floor without the need for a floor covering. Some typical applications for concrete toppings include warehouse floors, light industrial applications, retail stores and institutional facilities. Concrete toppings can also receive pigmented color dyes, stains, saw cuts or mechanical polishing to produce a decorative concrete finished wear surface.|$|R

50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of particleboard {{is that it}} is very prone to expansion and discoloration due to moisture, particularly when it is not covered with paint or another sealer. Therefore, it is rarely used outdoors or in places where there are high levels of moisture, with the exception of some bathrooms, kitchens and laundries, where it is commonly used as an <b>underlayment</b> - in its moisture resistant variant - beneath a continuous sheet of vinyl flooring.|$|E

5000|$|Red rosin paper (red {{building}} paper, brown rosin paper, {{slip sheet}} paper, rosin-sized sheathing paper, and building paper) is a 100% recycled heavy duty felt paper used in construction such as <b>underlayment</b> under flooring and siding. The names {{comes from the}} rosin used in the paper, the process of sizing it to add the rosin, and its use by builders. [...] "Alum-rosin size was invented by Moritz Friedrich Illig in Germany in 1807..." [...] and {{is known to have}} been used as a building paper by 1850.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of a roof is to resist water. Two broad categories of roofs are flat and pitched. Flat roofs actually slope up to 10° or 15° but are built to resist standing water. Pitched roofs are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming. Typically residential, pitched roofs are covered with an <b>underlayment</b> material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. Domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation.|$|E
5000|$|Wind damage: Asphalt {{shingles}} come {{in varying}} resistance to wind damage. Shingles {{with the highest}} fastener pull through resistance, bond strength of the self seal adhesive, properly nailed will resist wind damage the best. Extra precautions can be taken in high wind areas to fasten a durable <b>underlayment</b> and/or seal the plywood seams in the event the shingles are blown off. UL 997 Wind Resistance of Prepared Roof Covering Materials class 1 is best Wind Resistance roof standard and ASTM D 3161 class F is best for bond strength.|$|E
50|$|Laminate is a floor {{covering}} that appears similar to hardwood but {{is made with}} a plywood or medium density fiberboard ("MDF") core with a plastic laminate top layer. HDF laminate consists of high density fiberboard topped {{by one or more}} layers of decorative paper and a transparent protective layer. Laminate may be more durable than hardwood, but cannot be refinished like hardwood. Laminate flooring is available in many different patterns which can resemble different woods or even ceramic tile. It usually locks or taps together. <b>Underlayment</b> is required for laminate flooring to provide moisture and noise control.|$|E

50|$|Building {{papers and}} {{membranes}} {{are used for}} many reasons in construction. One of the oldest building papers is red rosin paper which {{was known to be}} in use before 1850 and was used as an <b>underlayment</b> in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. Tar paper was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and for gravel roofs. Tar paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt felt paper. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by housewraps.|$|E
50|$|Roof {{shingles}} {{are almost}} always highly visible and so are {{an important aspect of}} a building's aesthetics in patterns, textures and colors. Roof shingles, like other building materials on vernacular buildings, are typically of a material locally available. The type of shingle is taken into account before construction because the material affects the roof pitch and construction method: Some shingles can be installed on lath where others need solid sheathing (sheeting) on the roof deck. All shingle roofs are installed from the bottom upward beginning with a starter course and the edge seams offset to avoid leaks. Many shingle installations benefit from being placed on top of an <b>underlayment</b> material such as asphalt felt paper to prevent leaks even from wind driven rain and snow and ice dams in cold climates. At the ridge the shingles {{on one side of the}} roof simply extend past the ridge or there is a ridge cap consisting of boards, copper, or lead sheeting. An asphalt shingle roof has flexible asphalt shingles as the ridge cap. Some roof shingles are non-combustable or have a better fire rating than others which influence their use, some building codes do not allow the use of shingles with less than a class-A fire rating to be used on some types of buildings. Due to increased fire hazard, wood shingles and organic-based asphalt shingles have become less common than fiberglass-based asphalt shingles. No shingles are water-tight so the minimum recommended roof pitch is 4:12 without additional <b>underlayment</b> materials.|$|E
5000|$|Roofing felt (similar to tar paper) is {{the base}} {{material}} {{used to make}} roof shingles and roll roofing. Used for decades as waterproof coverings in residential and commercial roofs, these bitumen compositional membranes incorporate two layers. The first underside polymer membrane {{is used as a}} solid background, often reinforced with glass fibers. Mineral granules make up the self-protective top layer, with a final bituminous mixture encapsulating them both. Typical uses of felt paper are as an <b>underlay(ment)</b> (sarking) beneath other building materials, particularly roofing and siding materials, and is one type of membrane used in asphalt built up roofing (BUR) systems. The purposes are to [...] "...separate the roof covering from the roof deck...shed water...and provide secondary weather protection..." [...] Also, the rapid application of roofing underlay protects the roof deck during construction until the roofing material is applied and is required for roofs required to meet Underwriters Laboratory (UL) fire ratings. The separation of the roof covering from the roof deck protects the roof covering from resins in some sheathing materials and cushions unevenness and old nails and splinters in re-roofing applications. The <b>underlayment</b> also sheds water, which penetrates the roof covering from an ordinary leak, a leak from wind-driven rain or snow, wind damage to the roof covering, or ice dams. However, the application of underlays may increase the roof temperature, which {{is the leading cause of}} ageing of asphalt shingles and felt paper wrinkles when it gets wet, which (rarely) shows through asphalt shingles. Not installing an underlay may void the roof covering warranty.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, iron, {{electroplated}} with zinc {{to improve}} its resistance to rust, became a light-weight, easily transported, waterproofing material. Its low cost and easy application made it the most accessible commercial roofing, worldwide. Since then, many types of metal roofing have been developed. Steel shingle or standing-seam roofs last about 50 years or more depending on both the method of installation and the moisture barrier (<b>underlayment)</b> used and are between the cost of shingle roofs and slate roofs.In the 20th century {{a large number of}} roofing materials were developed, including roofs based on bitumen (already used in previous centuries), on rubber and on a range of synthetics such as thermoplastic and on fibreglass.|$|E
