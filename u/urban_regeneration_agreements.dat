Cities, which have been result of the social, economical, physical and cultural interaction, have developed urban policies for urban areas where have experienced rapid change and transformations not only to keep step with this transformation and solve urban problems revealed after these changes but also to provide new urban requirements of people. <b>Urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> issue has been key element for renewing, re-evaluating of places where have been lost their economic activity, social and physical functions. In this framework, firstly {{aim of this}} study has been identified and definition of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> has been made as an introduction. Motives and results of transformation of cities have been determined. Evaluation of general framework of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> has been described with basic definitions of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> tools.

40|$|In Turkey, rapid {{population}} growth, informal settlements, and buildings and infrastructures vulnerable to natural hazards {{are seen as}} the most important problems of cities. Particularly disaster risk cannot be disregarded, as large parts of various cities are facing risks from earthquakes, floods and landslides and have experienced loss of lives in the recent past. <b>Urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> is an important planning tool implemented by local and central governments in order to reduce to disaster risk and to design livable environments for the citizens. The Law on the Regeneration of Areas under Disaster Risk, commonly known as the <b>Urban</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Law, was enacted in 2012 (Law No. 6306, May 2012). The regulation on Implementation of Law No. 6306 explains the fundamental steps of the <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> process. The relevant institutions furnished with various authorities such as expropriation, confiscation and changing the type and place of your property which makes <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> projects very important in terms of property rights. Therefore, <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> projects have to be transparent, comprehensible and acceptable for all actors in the projects. In order to understand the <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> process, the legislation and projects of different municipalities in Istanbul have been analyzed.

In big Turkish cities, particularly in the past decade, <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> practices, processes and consequences have sparked several debates. The ‘new’ gained or converted spaces in the city are also significant in terms of their impacts on urban identity. In this context, this study aims to identify the impacts of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> which occurred in historical city centres, on urban identity in the case of Turkey. The study determines general framework of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> and then defines a conceptual framework of urban identity.

40|$|Under the {{transformation}} from “rural China” to “urban China”, cities {{in this country}} are confronting with the increasingly complicated problems of urban decline, not just physical decay as well as functional deterioration. The approach prevalently adopted, however, is of tearing down the old and starting the new from scratch, which relies on immediate measures of physical construction but neglects the objectives of social inclusion and heritage protection. For Chinese cities, it is necessary to reconsider the issue on <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> from a more holistic and multidimensional perspective. Since the late 1990 s, a new concept—creative industries—has attracted interest over the world. In recent years, many big cities in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, have clearly seen a rapid growth of this new industrial sector; a variety of creative industrial clusters (CICs) have emerged in these cities, showing wide potentials for promoting <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration.</b> The recent rise of creative industries and CICs may provide us a new perspective to rethink the issue on <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> in Chinese cities. This study tries to explore the relationships between creative industries, CICs and <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> in Shanghai. Through the exploration, it expects to find an effective approach to promote comprehensive <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> in Chinese cities under {{the transformation}} context. As “creative industries” is a relatively fresh concept and the boom of creative industries and clusters just happened in China in recent years, there is a big lack of research related to creative industries in the Chinese context. The research that links creative industries with <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> is much less. This study is an effort to fill this research gap. Around an analytical framework developed from the understanding of three key concepts—creative industries, CICs and <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> this study conducts two-level analyses. Firstly, it discusses some key issues on <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> creative industries and clusters respectively at the municipal level. Secondly, it carries out the case study of M 50 —a CIC in Shanghai—at the local level, based on questionnaire survey and deep interviews. Through the two-level analyses on Shanghai, this study suggests that the policy makers in Chinese cities should recognize the complexity of urban decline problems and view the issue of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> from a more comprehensive, holistic and multidimensional perspective. Considering the significant implications of the creative industries and CICs for <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> this study also suggests that the policy makers should adopt the creative industries and CICs as an important strategy to promote <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> and produce an integrated and systematic plan specifically on CICs that is oriented to <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> and incorporated in the city’s master plan. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> {{acquired}} a powerful {{role in the}} shaping {{of the future of}} the cities in the Globalization era. It could be considered a public action in a market governed by different powers introducing a more strategic approach in the contemporary urban planning theory and practice. If integration can be considered one of the main objective to get through <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> and complexity as the peculiarity of urban dynamics related to the context they belong to, we might see the community involvement as crucial toward sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> initiatives. The intent of generating wider effects in terms of economic development at macro-level (regional thereby) through <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> initiatives has been eluded by the strong local interests even if not homogenous among each others. In order to reach a feasible consensus among all actors involved, the common objective became the job creation to which converge all different urban problems and solutions. Consequently, the sustainability of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> initiatives is still at the centre of political and academic debate. Economic sustainability, environmental sustainability and social sustainability provide criteria to measure the <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> performance.

40|$|By {{the means}} of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> {{municipalities}} aim to increase the current value of an urban area. This so called ‘value improvement’ is obtained when extra performances achieved by <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> outrun the life cycle costs for it. This implies that if both parameters are quantified the decision making process becomes more transparent. Nevertheless, practice at municipalities show differently. On the one hand, decisions regarding <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> are based solely on investment costs. On the other hand, extra performances obtained by <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> are described in qualitative manners. It is hypothesized that both shortcomings result in sub-optimal decision making. More optimal decision making {{is believed to be}} achieved by applying Value Engineering (VE) during the earlier stages of the design process. Herein, it aims to improve the value of a design by providing modifications that either eliminate costs that do not contribute much to the performance of a project, or adding extra performances for relatively low costs. Most successful implementations showed the use of VE in the product industry.
