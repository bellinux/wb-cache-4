50|$|When beekeepers {{extract the}} honey, they {{cut off the}} wax caps from each {{honeycomb}} cell with an <b>uncapping</b> <b>knife</b> or machine. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, {{and the type of}} flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the brood comb of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called slumgum.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{extraction}} process is to break or remove all of the cappings. This may be accomplished using an automated uncapper machine or with a manually-operated <b>uncapping</b> <b>knife.</b> Usually, these tools are used together, along with a pronged cappings fork. To facilitate cutting off these wax cappings, the knife is often heated. The removed bits of wax, called cappings, are rich in honey which can be slowly drained off with the help of some heating. This 'cappings wax' is very valuable and often used to make candles or other products. Automated uncapping machines normally work by abrading the surface of the wax with moving chains or bristles or hot knives. This, while messy, makes the process easier than doing this task manually.|$|E
