Most transport enters and leaves the city through Enugu's Ogbete Motor Park, Garki Motor Park serves as a transport pick-up point as well. <b>Unregistered</b> taxis are known as Kabu Kabu and are differentiated with registered ones through the lack of yellow paint on the <b>unregistered</b> vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{registered}} marketplace merchants had a {{very low}} social status and were often subject to additional restrictions. Emperor Gaozu passed laws levying higher taxes, forbidding merchants from wearing silk, and barring their descendants from holding public office. These laws were difficult to enforce. Emperor Wu targeted both the registered and <b>unregistered</b> merchants with higher taxes. While registered merchants {{were not allowed to}} own land, if they broke this law their land and slaves would be confiscated. However, wealthy <b>unregistered</b> merchants owned large tracts of land. Emperor Wu significantly reduced the economic influence of great merchants by openly competing with them in the marketplace, where he set up government-managed shops that sold commodities collected from the merchants as property taxes.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the <b>unregister</b> attack, {{a new kind}} of a denial of service attack on SIP servers. In this attack, the {{attacker}} sends a spoofed “unregister” message to a SIP server and cancels the registration of the victim at that server. This prevents the victim user from receiving any calls. We have tested common implementations of SIP servers and show that the <b>unregister</b> attack is easily performed on SIP servers which do not use authentication. Even on SIP servers with authentication, an attacker able to sniff the traffic between the client and server can still successfully attack common servers. We show that the root causes behind this vulnerability are either buggy implementations, or the SIP specification RFC which does not require sufficient security from the implementations. We present a solution, the SIP One-Way Hash Function Algorithm (SOHA), motivated by the onetime password mechanism [6]. SOHA prevents the <b>unregister</b> attack in all situations. The algorithm is easy to deploy since it requires only a minor modification, namely adding one header field into the SIP messages. Furthermore, the algorithm is fully backwards compatible and requires no additional configuration from the user or the server. ...|$|R

5|$|To promote ethnic harmony, in 1648 an {{imperial}} decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese civilians to marry {{women from the}} Manchu Banners, {{with the permission of}} the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or the permission of their banner company captain if they were <b>unregistered</b> commoners. Only later in the dynasty were these policies allowing intermarriage rescinded.|$|E
5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being <b>unregistered</b> or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of SLP differs considerably, {{depending on whether}} a Directory Agent (DA) is in the network or not. When a client first joins a network it multicasts a query for DAs on the network. If no DA answers it will assume {{that it is in}} a network without DAs. It is also possible to add DAs later, as they multicast a 'heartbeat' packet in a predefined interval that will be received by all other devices. When an SA discovers a DA, it is required to register all services at the DA. When a service disappears the SA should notify the DA and <b>unregister</b> it.|$|R
30|$|This {{functionality}} {{is implemented}} by the trigger communication module shown in Figure 2. This module {{has a number of}} responsibilities. First, to enable both local and nonlocal communications the module provides a UDP interface. Using this interface, adaptation layers can register themselves to receive triggers from a certain pipe. The trigger communication module keeps a list of all registered adaptation layers to enable multiple adaptation layers to subscribe to the same trigger. Second, whenever a trigger is fired within KauNet, the module transmits the trigger information to the registered adaptation layers. The communication of triggers is also done using UDP. Finally, the trigger communication module also provides the means for adaptation layers to <b>unregister</b> themselves.|$|R
