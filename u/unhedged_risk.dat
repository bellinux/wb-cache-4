As an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between IBM on the NYSE and IBM on the London Stock Exchange, they may purchase {{a large number of}} shares on the NYSE and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the LSE.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} iterative {{algorithm is}} constructed for indifference prices of claims in a multiperiod incomplete model. At each time step, a nonlinear pricing functional is applied that isolates and prices separately {{the two types}} of risk. It is represented solely in terms of risk aversion and the pricing measure, a martingale measure that preserves the conditional distribution of <b>unhedged</b> <b>risks,</b> given the hedgeable ones, from their historical counterparts.

40|$|We use convex risk {{measures}} to assess <b>unhedged</b> <b>risks</b> for American-style contingent claims in a continuous-time non-Markovian economy using reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs). A two-stage approach is adopted {{to evaluate the}} risk. We formulate the evaluation problem as an optimal stopping-control problem and discuss the problem using reflected BSDEs. The convex risk measures are represented as solutions of RBSDEs. In the Markov case, we relate the RBSDE solutions to the unique viscosity solutions of related obstacle problems for parabolic partial differential equations. 20 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the terms}} of the peace treaty only {{required}} the United States to accept the loss of Kenya and Diego Garcia, the defeat and the ongoing war between Iran and Saudi Arabia cause the price of imported oil, already high, to skyrocket, and the United States faced an energy crisis. Weed, knowing that his navy is obsolete and U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf are vulnerable, evacuates them, effectively shutting the U.S. out of Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian Ocean. As investors around the world realized that the United States was no longer a hyperpower, they began selling dollar denominated investments, causing the dollar to fall sharply. This led to high inflation and a major economic crisis in the United States. The problem becomes worse when several large investment banks, who had taken <b>unhedged</b> <b>risks</b> that had been intended to pay off when the United States won the war, became insolvent. With the dollar in free fall, the federal government could not bail out the banks without risking a total collapse of the dollar, and so they went out of business, and the United States entered an economic depression. Weed resigns the presidency and commits suicide.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} hedging {{effectiveness}} of a dynamic moving window OLS hedging model, formed using wavelet decomposed time-series. The wavelet transform is applied to calculate the appropriate dynamic minimum-variance hedge ratio for various hedging horizons {{for a number of}} assets. The effectiveness of the dynamic multiscale hedging strategy is then tested, both in- and out-of-sample, using standard variance reduction and expanded to include a downside risk metric, the time horizon dependent Value-at-Risk. Measured using variance reduction, the effectiveness converges to one at longer scales, while a measure of VaR reduction indicates a portion of residual risk remains at all scales. Analysis of the hedge portfolio distributions indicate that this <b>unhedged</b> tail <b>risk</b> is related to excess portfolio kurtosis found at all scales. ...|$|R
40|$|International {{investing}} {{and trade}} has one unintended consequence; namely, {{the creation of}} currency risk which causes the local currency value of the foreign receivables or investments to fluctuate dramatically because of pure currency movements. The academic literature on currencies has typically misunderstood currency risk and suggested that currencies have no long term return, are difficult to predict, and difficult {{to take advantage of}} as the markets are extremely liquid. Hence, typical recommendations include either that companies and investors should remove this uncompensated volatility by naively hedging back into the base currency or leaving the <b>risk</b> <b>unhedged</b> (which is often misinterpreted and, as a result, left unmanaged). The effective financial management of such cash flows or investments provides a completely different perspective as na�ve hedging (<b>unhedging)</b> of currency <b>risk</b> implies a strong view that the base currency will appreciate (depreciate) against the foreign currency. Moreover, the currency market has many non-profit participants and while exact currency levels cannot be predicted, the future direction of currencies can be anticipated through relatively simple models and non-profit participants can be exploited. We demonstrate how Japanese corporations and investors can develop a much more robust and SMART (Systematic Management of Assets Using a Rules Based Technique) approach to manage currency risk, thereby adding value from currency fluctuations while managing currency risk. In short, they can easily improve performance, risk management and governance. Such transactions are easy to implement with currency forwards and while the current paper focuses on USD exposures, a more general multi-currency approach can be developed for a more comprehensive analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of DVA in the fair-value of derivative transactions {{has now become}} standard accounting practice {{in most parts of}} the world. Furthermore, some sophis-ticated banks are including an FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment), but since DVA can be interpreted as a funding benefit the oft-debated issue regarding a possible double-counting of funding benefits arises, with little consensus as to its resolution. One possibility is to price the derivative by replication, by constructing a portfolio that completely hedges all risks present in the instrument, guaranteeing a consistent {{inclusion of}} costs and benefits. However, as has recently been noted, DVA is (at least partially) unhedgeable, having no exact market hedge. Furthermore, current frame-works shed little light on the controversial question, raised by Hull (2012), of whether the effect a derivative has on the riskiness of an institution’s debt should be taken into account when calculating FVA. In this paper we propose a solution to these two problems by identifying an in-strument, a fictitious CDS written on the hedging counterparty which, although not available in the market for active hedging, is implicitly contained in any given deriva-tives transaction. This allows us to show that the hedger’s <b>unhedged</b> jump-to-default <b>risk</b> has, despite not being actively managed, a well-defined value associated to a funding benefit. Carrying out the replication including such a CDS, we obtain a price for the derivative consisting of its collateralized equivalent, a CVA contingent on the survival of the hedger, a contingent DVA, and an FVA, coupled to the price via the hedger’s short-term bond-CDS basis. The resulting funding cost is non-zero, but substantially smaller than what is obtained in alternative approaches due to the effect the derivative has on the recovery of the hedger’s liabilities. Also, price agreement is possible for two sophisticated counterparties entering a deal if their bond-CDS bases obey a certain relationship, similar to what was first obtained by Morini and Prampolini (2010) ...|$|R
