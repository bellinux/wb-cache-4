25|$|Planetary {{ejection}} — For lithopanspermia to occur, {{researchers have}} suggested that microorganisms must survive ejection from a planetary surface which involves extreme forces of acceleration and shock with associated temperature excursions. Hypothetical values of shock pressures experienced by ejected rocks are obtained with Martian meteorites, which suggest the shock pressures of approximately 5 to 55GPa, acceleration of 3Mm/s2 and jerk of 6Gm/s3 and post-shock temperature increases of about 1 K to 1000 K. To {{determine the effect of}} acceleration during ejection on microorganisms, rifle and <b>ultracentrifuge</b> methods were successfully used under simulated outer space conditions.|$|E

50|$|Ultracentrifugation {{makes use}} of high {{centrifugal}} force for studying properties of biological particles. Compared to microcentrifuges or high-speed centrifuges, <b>ultracentrifuges</b> can isolate much smaller particles, including ribosomes, proteins, and viruses. <b>Ultracentrifuges</b> {{can also be used}} in the study of membrane fractionation. This occurs because <b>ultracentrifuges</b> can reach maximum angular velocities in excess of 70,000 rpm. Additionally, while microcentrifuges and supercentrifuges separate particles in batches (limited volumes of samples must be handled manually in test tubes or bottles), <b>ultracentrifuges</b> can separate molecules in batch or continuous flow systems.|$|R

2500|$|Sucrose {{gradient}} centrifugation [...] {{a linear}} concentration gradient of sugar (typically sucrose, glycerol, or a silica based density gradient media, like Percoll) is generated in a tube {{such that the}} highest concentration is {{on the bottom and}} lowest on top. Percoll is a trademark owned by GE Healthcare companies. A protein sample is then layered on top of the gradient and spun at high speeds in an <b>ultracentrifuge.</b> This causes heavy macromolecules to migrate towards the bottom of the tube faster than lighter material. [...] During centrifugation in the absence of sucrose, as particles move farther and farther from the center of rotation, they experience more and more centrifugal force (the further they move, the faster they move). [...] The problem with this is that the useful separation range of within the vessel is restricted to a small observable window. [...] Spinning a sample twice as long doesn't mean the particle of interest will go twice as far, in fact, it will go significantly further. [...] However, when the proteins are moving through a sucrose gradient, they encounter liquid of increasing density and viscosity. [...] A properly designed sucrose gradient will counteract the increasing centrifugal force so the particles move in close proportion to the time {{they have been in the}} centrifugal field. [...] Samples separated by these gradients are referred to as [...] "rate zonal" [...] centrifugations. [...] After separating the protein/particles, the gradient is then fractionated and collected.|$|E

40|$|Ultracentrifugation of very dilute {{suspensions}} of {{herpes simplex}} virus directly onto monolayer cells grown in centrifuge tubes was studied. Enhanced infectivity by ultracentrifugation was similar at 4 degrees C and at 35 to 37 degrees C.

At 4 degrees C, the numbers of infectious centers in control (noncentrifuged) cultures were almost 100 -fold fewer than in control cultures at 37 degrees C.

40|$|The {{immunoglobulin}} G antibody {{response to}} Helicobacter pylori was assessed in 78 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia using five different antigen preparations.

The <b>ultracentrifuged</b> cell sonicate, acid glycine extract, and 120 kilodalton protein antigens were specific in diagnosing infection (95 - 98 %), but had only moderate sensitivity (70 - 84 %). By mixing either of the two complex antigens with the 120 kilodalton protein, the sensitivity of the test was increased to 97 % without affecting the high specificity.

40|$|Introduction: Reducing {{laboratory}} {{errors and}} improving patient safety is receiving {{a lot of}} attention. Lipaemic samples are cause of analytical errors and present challenges for laboratories, particularly for those without <b>ultracentrifuges.</b> Lipaemia can originate from physiological (postprandial metabo-lism), para-physiological causes (e. g. IV administration of lipids) as well as metabolic disturbances (e. g. hypertriglyceridaemia). Materials and methods: We have evaluated a procedure with 10 native lipaemic sample pools (triglyceride concentration range 11. 6 - 42. 7 mmol/L) for the ability to reduce lipid concentration using a high speed micro-centrifuge (double centrifuged at 21. 885 x g for 15 min) compared with an ultracen-trifuge, and provide accurate results. Results of sodium, creatinine, urate, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LD), magnesium and, cholesterol and triglyceride analysis on a Beckman DxC 800 analyser are presented. Results: Data from our tertiary level hospital showed ~ 0. 7 % of the samples received for lipid studies have triglyceride levels > 10 mmol/L which can potentially cause analytical interference. The mean differences from the neat aliquot to the <b>ultracentrifuged</b> and high speed centrifuged sample pools were: cholesterol 4. 9 mmol/L and 3. 1 mmol/L; and triglycerides 17. 4 mmol/L and 15. 0 mmol/L respectively. The data confirms high speed centrifugation is almost as effective as ultracentrifugation in lipid reduction. Conclusion: The procedure utilized in this study using a high speed micro-centrifuge showed it is effective in reducing lipid levels and provides a suitable alternative to <b>ultracentrifuged</b> samples to pro-vide accurate results...|$|R
