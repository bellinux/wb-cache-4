50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of most spy {{satellites}} is to monitor visible ground activity. While resolution and clarity of images has improved greatly over the years, this role has remained essentially the same. Some other uses of satellite imaging have been to produce detailed 3D maps for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> and missile guidance systems, and to monitor normally invisible information such as the growth levels of a country's crops or the heat given off by certain facilities. Some of the multi-spectral sensors, such as thermal measurement, are more electro-optical MASINT than true IMINT platforms.|$|E
5000|$|According to Edmonds, Gladio B identified, {{among other}} things, regular {{meetings}} between senior US intelligence and current leader of Al Qaeda Ayman al-Zawahiri at the U.S. embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan between 1997 and 2001, with al-Zawahiri and other mujahideen being transported by NATO aircraft to Central Asia and the Balkans {{to participate in}} Pentagon-backed destabilisation operations. She added that in 1997, NATO asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to release from prison Islamist militants affiliated with Ayman al-Zawahiri. They were flown by U.S. intelligence orders to Turkey for training and <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> by the Pentagon. Additionally, she reported that an Al-Qaeda leader had been training some of the 9-11 hijackers at a base in Turkey. These and related allegations were seemingly confirmed by Sunday Times journalists in 2008 who spoke to Pentagon and MI6 sources.However, according to Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, the journalists were prevented from publishing many of these allegations when {{the second half of}} their four-part series was dropped, possibly due to pressure from the U.S. State Department. She suggests that the objectives of Gladio B are [...] "projecting U.S. power in the former Soviet sphere of influence to access previously untapped strategic energy and mineral reserves for U.S. and European companies; pushing back Russian and Chinese power; and expanding the scope of lucrative criminal activities, particularly illegal arms and drugs trafficking." [...] Former FBI special agent Dennis Saccher states Edmonds's story [...] "should have been front page news" [...] because it is [...] "a scandal bigger than Watergate".|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Nick has {{a medical}} degree from [...] "Hollywood Upstairs Medical College", in the 1970s, where he {{apparently}} {{spent much of}} his time using his ability to acquire prescription drugs to impress women. Thus far, none of the patients he has swindled, maimed, or given useless or dangerous medical advice seems to have sued him—although a few have come after him in person. For example, in [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", a large angry man grabs him, and Riviera says [...] "Well if it isn't my old friend Mr. McGregg—with a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg"; the man literally has an arm where a leg should be and a leg where an arm should be, and it is implied that this is Riviera's fault. Riviera is a stereotype of shady doctors who perform medical procedures for money with little or no regard for medical ethics, or their patients' well-being. His motto is, You've tried the best, now try the rest! In [...] "The Girl Who Slept Too Little", he is seen digging up corpses in the graveyard for body parts, presumably to <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> on patients. In the same episode he tells Lisa [...] "you have a check-up on Thursday!", to which she replies [...] "We don't go to you anymore, we have a better doctor!" [...] and receives a congratulation from him. In [...] "Treehouse of Horror IX", he injects himself with anesthetic after punching Homer in the face in order to knock him out before performing a hair transplant on him, using a pizza cutter.|$|E
5000|$|In 1854, Sayre {{performed}} {{his first}} operation for the cure of hip ankylosis, which involved removal {{of part of}} the femur (at its head) to facilitate movements of the hindered joint. It was the first successful operation of the kind in the US. In 1871 he made a tour in Europe, and by invitation gave demonstrations of his method before numerous medical societies. Five years later he was a delegate to the International Medical Congress at Philadelphia, and performed before that body an operation for hip disease. Joseph Lister, the founder of antiseptic surgery, was quoted saying, [...] "I feel that this demonstration [...] itself have been a sufficient reward for my voyage across the Atlantic." [...] The next year, 1877, he was sent by the American Medical Association to {{the meeting of the}} British Medical Association at Manchester, where he demonstrated his new treatment of diseases and deformities of the spine by suspension and the application of plaster-of-Paris bandages, which demonstrations were then repeated, by request, in the principal hospitals throughout England. Dr. Sayre has been a voluminous writer, chiefly on topics related to surgery. He has invented many instruments for <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> and for the relief of deformities. Sayre was consulting surgeon to St. Elizabeth's Hospital, the Northwestern Dispensary, and the Home for Incurables in New York. He was an honorary member of several leading American and European societies. In recognition for his work, the King of Sweden made him a Knight of the Order of Vasa in 1872.|$|E

The citation for his VC read: Corporal Mackey was in charge of a section of the 2/3rd Australian Pioneer Battalion in the attack on the feature known as Helen, east of Tarakan town. Led by Corporal Mackey the section moved along a narrow spur with scarcely width for more than one man when it came under fire from three well-sited positions near the top of a very steep, razor-backed ridge. The ground fell away almost sheer {{on each side of the}} track making it almost impossible to move to a flank so Corporal Mackey led his men forward. He charged the first Light Machine-Gun position but slipped and after wrestling with one enemy, bayoneted him, and charged straight on to the Heavy Machine-Gun which was firing from a bunker position six yards to his right. He rushed this post and killed the crew with grenades. He then jumped back and changing his rifle for a sub-machine-gun he attacked further up the steep slope another Light Machine-Gun position which was firing on his platoon. Whilst charging, he fired his gun and reached with a few feet of the enemy position when he was killed by Light Machine-Gun fire but not before he had killed two more enemy. By his exceptional bravery and complete disregard for his own life, Corporal Mackey was largely responsible for the killing of seven Japanese and the elimination of two machine-gun posts, which enabled his platoon to gain its objective, from which the Company continued to engage the enemy. His fearless action and outstanding courage were an inspiration to the whole battalion.|$|E

The original virtual safety stock definition embeds two major problems: a double Gaussian integral in the formulation together with the heritage of the unrealistic assumptions already included in the earliest Hadley and Whitin’s safety stock conception. This paper describes an alternative approach in which the virtual safety stock is defined with a closed-form expression much easier to compute and <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations</b> management practice...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} {{size and}} availability of web data make data quality a core challenge in many applications. Principles of data quality are recognized as essential to ensure that data fit for their intended <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>operations,</b> decision-making, and planning. However, {{with the rise of}} the Semantic Web, new data quality issues appear and require deeper consideration. In this paper, we propose to extend the data quality principles to the context of Semantic Web. Based on our extensive industrial experience in data integration, we identify five main classes suited for data quality in Semantic Web. For each class, we list the principles that are involved at all stages of the data management process. Following these principles will provide a sound basis for better decision-making within organizations and will maximize longterm data integration and interoperability...|$|E
