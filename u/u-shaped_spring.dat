40|$|At the University of Twente a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>spring</b> {{has been}} used to {{investigate}} the mechanical properties of a large variety of superconducting tapes and wires. Several mechanisms are responsible for the degradation of critical current as a function of applied strain. A change in its intrinsic parameters causes a reversible critical current dependence in Nb 3 Sn. The critical current reaches a maximum at a wire-dependent tensile strain level, and decreases when this tensile strain is either released or further increased. In Bi-based tapes the critical current is virtually insensitive to tensile strain up to a sample-dependent irreversible strain limit. When this limit is exceeded, the critical current decreases steeply and irreversibly. This behaviour is attributed to microstructural damage to the filaments. This cracking of the filaments is verified by a magneto-optical strain experiment. Recent experiments suggest that in MgB 2 the degradation of critical current is caused by a change in intrinsic properties and damage to the microstructure. Magneto-optical imaging can be used to investigate the influence of applied strain on the microstructure of MgB 2, as is done successfully with Bi-based tapes. In all these conductors the thermal precompression of the filaments plays an important role. In Nb 3 Sn it determines the position of the maximum and in Bi-based and MgB 2 conductors it is closely related to the irreversible strain limit...|$|E
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Posterior lumbar spinal dynamic {{stabilisation}} {{devices are}} intended to relieve the pain of spinal segments while prolonging the lifespan of adjacent intervertebral discs. This study focuses {{on the design of}} such a device, one that has the correct stiffness to stabilise the spinal segment by the correct amount. An initial literature survey covers contemporary topics related to the lumbar spine. Included topics are lumbar anatomy and kinematics, pathology of degenerative disc disease and treatment thereof, other spinal disorders such as spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, as well as the complications associated with lumbar dynamic stabilisation. The influence of factors such as fatigue and wear, as well as the properties of appropriate biomaterials are considered when determining the basis of the device design and development. Stabilising the spinal segment begins with correct material selection and design. Various designs and biomaterials are evaluated for their stiffness values and other user requirements. The simplest design, a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>spring</b> composed of carbon fibre-reinforced poly-ether-ether-ketone (CFR-PEEK) and anchored by polyaxial titanium pedicle screws, satisfies the most critical user requirements. Acceptable stiffness is achieved, fatigue life of the material is excellent and the device is very imaging-friendly. Due to financial constraints, however, a simpler concept that is cheaper and easier to rapid prototype was chosen. This concept involves a construct primarily manufactured from the titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V extra-low interstitial (ELI) and cobalt-chrome-molybdenum (CCM) alloys. The first rapid prototype was manufactured using an additive manufacturing process (3 D-printing). The development of the device was performed in three main stages: design, verification and validation. The main goal of the design was to achieve an acceptable stiffness to limit the spinal segmental range of motion (ROM) by a determined amount. The device stiffness was verified through simple calculations. The first prototypeâ€™s stiffness was validated in force-displacement tests. Further validation, {{beyond the scope of this}} study, will include fatigue tests to validate the fatigue life of the production-ready device. Master...|$|E

The <b>U-shaped</b> bending <b>spring</b> back and its thickness change are analyzed. The influence law of main parameters of die structure to sheet thickness change and the spring back amount are obtained by combining with the orthogonal analysis method. Finally a set of the optimal parameter combination is found, the <b>spring</b> back of <b>U-shaped</b> piece and the change of the thickness are controlled in a reasonable range...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} current density in Nb 3 Sn conductors is described with an improved scaling formula for the temperature, magnetic field and strain dependence. In an earlier study, {{it is concluded}} that the largest uncertainties in this description arise from the temperature dependence that is described with various slightly different empirical relations. For the optimization of the numerical codes, used to predict the stability of large magnet systems, a more accurate description is required. Therefore, two different bronze processed conductors for the ITER CS model coil are analyzed in detail. The {{critical current}} is measured at temperatures from 4. 2 K up to the critical temperature, in magnetic fields from 1 T to 13 T and with an applied axial strain from - 0. 6 % to + 0. 4 %. The axial strain is applied by a <b>U-shaped</b> bending <b>spring</b> and a comparison is made between brass and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, as substrate materia...|$|R
40|$|For high-current REBCO superconductors in high magnet {{fields with}} {{currents}} {{on the order}} of 50 kA, single coated conductors must be assembled in a cable. Under operating conditions, such cables are subjected to combined torsion, axial, and transverse loads in the tapes and tape joints. As such, the single tape performance under applied axial strain is crucial to understand cable limitations, and important for choosing an appropriate tape geometry and tape supplier. The critical current (Ic) versus applied uniaxial strain and the relative strain irreversibility limit were measured on HTS tapes produced by five manufacturers. The Ic measurements were performed at 77 K in self-field with the sample tapes soldered to the <b>U-shaped</b> bending <b>spring</b> (U-spring). It has been observed that most of the tapes perform well under applied compressive strain. The dependence of Ic on applied strain and the irreversibility limits were found to be unique for each tape. The n-values of the tapes, unlike the Ic, are less sensitive to applied strain in the reversible regime. The results of different tapes are presented and compared...|$|R
40|$|The intrawire {{resistance}} and alternating current (AC) loss of two MgB 2 wires with filaments surrounded by Nb barriers have been measured and analyzed. Relatively high values of filament-to-matrix contact resistivity {{are found in}} the MgB 2 wires; the values are two or three orders higher than those commonly found in NbTi or Nb 3 Sn wires. Considering the high porosity of the MgB 2 filaments, cold high-pressure densification has been applied on the two MgB 2 wires to investigate its impact on intrawire {{resistance and}} AC loss. The intrawire resistance is measured with a direct four-probe voltage-current method at various temperatures. The AC loss is measured by vibrating sample magnetometer measurements at 4. 2 K. In addition to the intrawire resistance measurements, the critical current of MgB 2 wires before and after densification is measured with a <b>U-shaped</b> bending <b>spring</b> at 4. 2 K as function of axial strain. The critical current in densified MgB 2 wires is found to be higher than that in the same wire without densification; it is also less sensitive to the applied axial strain...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the design and {{prototyping}} of a compact external pipe-crawling device that aids the inspection of pipes in hazardous environments and areas that are inaccessible to humans. The novel aspect of the design is a compliant mechanism that is actuated using Ni-Ti-Cu shape memory alloy (SMA) wire and strip. The device consists of two rings that are attached to each other along the longitudinal axis of the pipe by three pairs of circumferentially arranged <b>U-shaped</b> SMA and <b>spring</b> steel (AISI 1080) strips. Each ring consists of a compliant mechanism and housing. The compliant mechanism transforms the circumferential motion to radial motion at three points that are in contact with the pipe. The design of this compliant mechanism is derived from a radially deployable linkage. The SMA wire attached to the compliant mechanism and embedded within the housing with proper electrical isolation creates the circumferential motion for the compliant mechanism. When there is no actuation, the contact points of the compliant mechanisms of the two rings tightly hold the pipe. When an SMA wire of a ring is activated, that ring releases the grip on the pipe. At this time, the SMA strips are actuated to bring the rings closer together. After this, the first ring is de-activated to create the grip again. This is followed by releasing the grip on the second ring by the SMA wire activation. The spring steel strips, which are compressed during the SMA strip actuation, now extend back creating a displacement along the pipe. This cycle is repeated to create a...|$|R
