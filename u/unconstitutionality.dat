5|$|In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} {{fundamental}} rules of natural justice {{embodied in the}} concept of law in constitutional provisions such as Articles 9(1) and 12(1) are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in administrative law, except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. The former invalidate legislation on the ground of <b>unconstitutionality</b> and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.|$|E
5|$|Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists {{pushed for}} this letter to be {{printed in the}} Vermont Journal, which Spooner did, thus adding {{additional}} charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts. Lyon's defense {{was to be the}} <b>unconstitutionality</b> of the Acts, as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner {{as well as that of}} Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution's safeguards against ex post facto laws. This defense was not allowed.|$|E
5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{proved to}} be the most {{controversial}} of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to national pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation, while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside Charles Horsky, although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the <b>unconstitutionality</b> of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed. The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans, although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in coram nobis proceedings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Since the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931, all the Commonwealth realms {{have been}} {{sovereign}} kingdoms, the monarch and governors-general acting {{solely on the}} advice of the local ministers, who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills. They therefore are unlikely to advise the sovereign, or his or her representative, to withhold assent. The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta's lieutenant governor, John C. Bowen, in 1937, in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart's Social Credit party. Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province, thereby interfering with the federal government's powers. The third, the Accurate News and Information Bill, purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected. The <b>unconstitutionality</b> of all three bills was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for <b>unconstitutionality</b> in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E

25|$|The French {{constitutional}} law of 23 July 2008 amended article 61 of the Constitution. It now allows for courts to submit questions of <b>unconstitutionality</b> of laws to the Constitutional Council. The Court of Cassation (supreme court over {{civil and criminal}} courts) and the Council of State (supreme court over administrative courts) filter the requests coming from the courts under them.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 2016, {{a married}} {{same-sex}} couple filed an action of <b>unconstitutionality</b> seeking to recognise same-sex marriages performed abroad.

25|$|December 9, 2006 – Lebanon's pro-Syrian President Émile Lahoud {{rejected}} {{the proposal to}} create the Hariri tribunal, citing the Cabinet as unconstitutional. The Cabinet is expected to seek parliamentary approval for the tribunal without the President's signature, however Nabih Berri, the Speaker of the Parliament {{and leader of the}} pro-Syrian opposition group Amal, is not expected to convene the Parliament for a vote, citing similar <b>unconstitutionality</b> grounds.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September, Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court upheld {{an earlier}} Supreme Constitutional Court ruling, which {{had ordered the}} {{dissolution}} of the lower house of Egypt's parliament (People's Assembly) based on the <b>unconstitutionality</b> of some of the parliamentary elections law. The administrative court said that since the electoral laws on which the People's Assembly was elected were found to be unconstitutional, the entire composition of the assembly is invalid.|$|E
25|$|The Second Amendment {{provided}} that a prisoner has only {{the right to}} apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the <b>unconstitutionality</b> of a law the judge must refer the matter to the Supreme Court, and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.|$|E
25|$|Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U.S. 564 (2002) (also called Ashcroft v. ACLU), was a 2002 United States Supreme Court case {{involving}} the American Civil Liberties Union and the United States government regarding the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). The <b>unconstitutionality</b> {{of the law}} was ultimately upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, while earlier injunctions against the law by that same court were at first dismissed by but later upheld by the Supreme Court. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) dealt with a similar law, the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA).|$|E
25|$|The Magistrates and Judges are {{appointed}} by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of <b>unconstitutionality</b> against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over {{by one of the}} Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, the American {{abolitionist}} movement {{split into two}} camps {{over the issue of}} the United States Constitution. This issue arose in the late 1840s after the publication of The <b>Unconstitutionality</b> of Slavery by Lysander Spooner. The Garrisonians, led by Garrison and Wendell Phillips, publicly burned copies of the Constitution, called it a pact with slavery, and demanded its abolition and replacement. Another camp, led by Lysander Spooner, Gerrit Smith, and eventually Douglass, considered the Constitution to be an anti-slavery document. Using an argument based upon Natural Law and a form of social contract theory, they said that slavery existed outside the Constitution's scope of legitimate authority and therefore should be abolished.|$|E
25|$|Part Four, Section Two of the Turkish Constitution has {{established}} the Constitutional Court of Turkey that rules on the conformity {{of laws and}} decrees with the Constitution. It can rule on issues referred to it by the President of the Republic, the government, the members of Parliament, or any judge before whom an exception of <b>unconstitutionality</b> has been raised by a defendant or a plaintiff. The Constitutional Court {{has the right to}} both a priori and a posteriori review (respectively, before and after enactment), and it can invalidate whole laws or governmental decrees and prevent their application in future cases. Challenges to a law must be made within the first two months of its promulgation.|$|E
25|$|Douglass {{also came}} to {{consider}} Garrison too radical. Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison's position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of its compromises related to apportionment of Congressional seats, based on partial counting of slave populations with state totals; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807. Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion. But, Lysander Spooner published The <b>Unconstitutionality</b> of Slavery (1846), which explored the United States Constitution as an anti-slavery document. Douglass's change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 {{became one of the}} abolitionist movement's most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.|$|E
25|$|James Nabrit Jr., a {{professor}} of law at Howard School of Law, a historically black university, filed suit on behalf of Bolling and the other students in the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking assistance in the students' admission. When the court dismissed the claim, the case was granted a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court. While Nabrit's argument in Bolling rested on the <b>unconstitutionality</b> of segregation, the much more famous Brown v. Board of Education (decided on the same day) argued that the idea of 'separate but equal' facilities sanctioned by Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) was a fallacy as the facilities for black students were woefully inadequate. The lead attorney for Bolling was George E. C. Hayes.|$|E
25|$|A prohibiting order (formerly {{known as}} a prohibition) {{prevents}} an unconstitutional act from being carried out by a public body. Hence, a key difference between a quashing order and a prohibiting order is that the former operates retrospectively while the latter operates prospectively. Where applicants are aware that <b>unconstitutionality</b> can potentially arise, a prohibiting order can be sought to stop the public body from acting unconstitutionally. Such an order will also prevent the same decisions from occurring in the future. In Singapore, there {{has yet to be}} any reported case in which an applicant sought a prohibiting order in a constitutional matter. However, in the administrative law context, in Re Fong Thin Choo (1991) the High Court stated that the legal principles which apply to quashing orders are equally applicable to prohibiting orders.|$|E
25|$|Bimba's attorney, Harry Hoffman, {{called for}} a {{dismissal}} of the prosecution's charges owing to their <b>unconstitutionality,</b> but Judge C. Carroll King ruled against the motion since {{the question of the}} blasphemy charged based on the archaic Massachusetts law was beyond the purview of his court and he would not rule on the sedition complaint until evidence was presented. In presenting Bimba's defense, Hoffman first addressed the blasphemy charge, defending atheism as akin to a religion and declaring that there was a constitutional right to belief in the non-existence of a God. With respect to the allegation of sedition, Hoffman again based his defense upon the notion of constitutionally-protected individual liberty, denying any act of incitement in Bimba's actual words and stating that even if Bimba did say the words ascribed to him, he was merely expressing personal beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Hamdeen Sabahi, {{a former}} presidential {{candidate}} in the 2012 presidential election, officially announced his presidential bid on 8 February 2014. However, the Sabahi campaign has criticized the presidential elections law promulgated by the interim government, deeming its characteristics troubling for the transparency and fairness of the election. The pro-Sabahi Revolution's Candidate campaign has also expressed reservations {{about the nature of}} the presidential elections law, suggesting that the provision establishing inviolability for the decisions of the Supreme Electoral Committee raises doubts about the integrity of the election process and could potentially force a reassessment of the Sabahi candidacy. On 14 March, Hamdeen Sabahi's presidential campaign announced that Sabahi has decided to continue his candidacy in the presidential election, despite the perceived <b>unconstitutionality</b> of the presidential elections law. Sabahi has taken the medical tests needed to run for presidential office. Sabahi acquired 31,555 endorsements.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2016, {{an action}} of <b>unconstitutionality</b> was filed before the Mexican Supreme Court. The action seeks to legalize {{same-sex}} marriage in Chiapas, similarly to Jalisco (where the Supreme Court struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a unanimous ruling in early 2016). On 11 July 2017, the Court {{ruled that the}} man-woman definition of marriage in the Chiapas Civil Code was unconstitutional, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage {{in the state and}} specifying that an amparo is not required. The first same-sex marriage ceremony celebrated in Chiapas following the ruling occurred in late July 2017, though the couple still married using an amparo. The Civil Registry began accepting marriage applications from same-sex couples on 30 October 2017. The first couple to marry (without an amparo) did so in San Cristóbal de las Casas that day.|$|E
25|$|FATCA was the revenue-raising {{portion of}} the 2010 {{domestic}} jobs stimulus bill, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, and was enacted as Subtitle A (sections 501 through 541) of Title V of that law. FATCA is controversial because foreign banks {{have been forced to}} comply under threat of a 30% withholding penalty on all their U.S. transactions. The U.S. has yet to comply with FATCA itself, because as of 2017, it has not yet provided the promised reciprocity to its partner countries and it has failed to sign up to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). FATCA has also been criticised for its impacts on Americans living overseas, and implicated in record-breaking numbers of U.S. citizenship renunciations throughout the 2010s. Bills to repeal FATCA have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, citing its <b>unconstitutionality,</b> particularly its breach of 4th amendment rights, as well as its high implementation costs and lack of revenue generation. A hearing on the unintended consequences of FATCA was held by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on 26 April 2017.|$|E
25|$|The People's Party-led Spanish {{government}} under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy {{announced that it}} would appeal the bill to the Constitutional Court, which agreed to hear all four of its <b>unconstitutionality</b> appeals and subsequently suspended the law and the referendum until it could rule upon the matter. Despite the referendum suspension, the Catalan government announced it would proceed with the vote anyway. This prompted Attorney General José Manuel Maza to ask security forces to investigate possible preparations from the Catalan government to hold the vote, as well as announcing he would present criminal charges against members of both the regional parliament and government for voting and signing off the referendum. The national government proceeded to deploy a series of legal measures intended to nullify the referendum, while also warning local councils in Catalonia to either impede or paralyse efforts to carry out the vote. Previously, local mayors had been given 48 hours by the regional government to confirm the availability of polling stations for 1 October. On 7 September and under a similar procedure as the day previously, pro-independence lawmakers in the Parliament of Catalonia passed the legal framework that was to prevail the Spanish one should a majority vote for the 'Yes' to independence choice.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{rejected}} the argument on the <b>unconstitutionality</b> of the UPF statute, noting that all courts that had addressed this issue {{had found that}} persons under 21 could be barred from possessing firearms. [...] The conviction for UPF was affirmed, and the case was remanded.|$|E
500|$|The {{article was}} {{eventually}} published {{after the government}} lawyers dropped their case during the appeals process, calling it moot after other information was independently published.

500|$|In {{defense of}} Virginia Democratic-Republicans and the Resolutions, Madison {{emphasized}} {{that even if}} one disagreed with the compact theory, the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests, which states were surely entitled to produce. Madison indicated that a declaration of <b>unconstitutionality</b> would be an expression of opinion, with no legal force. The purpose of such a declaration, said Madison, was to mobilize public opinion. Madison indicated that {{the power to make}} binding constitutional determinations remained in the federal courts: ...|$|E
500|$|... any {{provision}} of that law designed to stop or prevent that action or any amendment to that law is valid {{even if it}} is inconsistent with specified fundamental liberties, including the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association guaranteed by Article 14.

500|$|From a legal standpoint, {{the case}} [...] "proved to be {{a victory for}} no one", due to the indecisive nature of its conclusion. Yet it remains a celebrated case nonetheless.

Law students still study the case, which [...] "could have been a law school hypothetical designed to test the limits of the presumption of <b>unconstitutionality</b> attached to prior restraints." ...|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court {{declined}} {{to rule on}} the constitutionality of any federal law regarding the Free Speech Clause until the 20th century. For example, the Supreme Court never ruled on the Alien and Sedition Acts; three Supreme Court justices riding circuit presided over sedition trials without indicating any reservations. The leading critics of the law, Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, argued for the Acts' <b>unconstitutionality</b> based on the First Amendment and other Constitutional provisions. Jefferson succeeded Adams as president, {{in part due to}} the unpopularity of the latter's sedition prosecutions; he and his party quickly overturned the Acts and pardoned those imprisoned by them. In the majority opinion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), the Court noted the importance of this public debate as a precedent in First Amendment law and ruled that the Acts had been unconstitutional: [...] "Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{those taking}} a thick {{conception}} {{of the rule of}} law, the existence of the [...] ("ISA") is widely regarded as a breach of the doctrine. The Act, which provides for detention without trial for people regarded by the executive as a risk to national security, is shielded from <b>unconstitutionality</b> by Article 149 of the Constitution. Although the Court of Appeal held in the 1988 case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs that the courts could review the legality of detentions under the Act, the effect of the case was reversed through amendments to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989. The ISA amendments were determined to be effective by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs in 1989 and 1990 respectively. While the executive's largely unconstrained discretion to detain under the ISA has been criticized as contrary to the rule of law, the Government has justified the statute as a crucial measure of last resort for preserving security.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Andrew Harding {{has argued}} that the idea of {{substantive}} natural justice is vague and subjective, and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature. In his opinion, Article 12(1) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation. To determine whether legislation is discriminatory, a [...] is applied. It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice. Therefore, the extension of Article 12(1) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense. Further support for this argument {{can be found in the}} Privy Council's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981) which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context, their Lordships stating that they had to consider [...] "whether the consequence of the alteration [...] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice". The substantive review of legislation by the court was also rejected in Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor (1995), the Court of Appeal holding that [...] "any law which provides for the deprivation of a person's life or personal liberty, is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament. The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well." [...] Subsequently, in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law [...] "are the same in nature and function, except that they operate at different levels of our legal order, one to invalidate legislation on the ground of <b>unconstitutionality,</b> and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles".|$|E
