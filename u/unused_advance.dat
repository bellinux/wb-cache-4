50|$|Earlier, in March 2008, VlaisavljeviÄ‡ {{estimated}} Jat's fleet to {{be worth}} around US$100-120 million. He also mentioned on the same occasion that the amount owed to Jat by other parties (MAT Macedonian Airlines, Nigerian Sosoliso Airlines, <b>unused</b> <b>advance</b> paid to Airbus, General Sales Agent for Middle Eastern destinations, etc.) {{adds up to a}} combined US$50 million. Among the additional assets in company's ownership, he listed 14 slots at London's Heathrow Airport as well as slots at other European airports. On the other hand, he confirmed Jat's debt to be around US$209 million.|$|E
50|$|Seaters has a two part {{solution}} to the empty seat problem, which {{has been found to}} occur at virtually all sold-out events, at a rate of 2-10% vacant seats. Both parts involve aggregating demand for <b>unused</b> tickets in <b>advance</b> of an event, so tickets can be distributed easily when they become available, even at the last minute.|$|R
40|$|Learning from Heritage is a {{place of}} {{comparison}} among the topics of preservation and of development of the cultural heritage. Every disciplinary contribution (from history to restoration, from composition to economic estimate) intertwines on specific problems, by generating a discussion with local workers and by formulating a concrete hypothesis of intervention. At the Master Course in Architecture (Conservation) at Politecnico di Torino, the communal territory of Candiolo has proposed to deal with the Parpaglia site, in the background of parco di Stupinigi. This site is composed by a rural, agricultural, still working complex and by the close, isolated castle of medieval background, <b>unused</b> and in <b>advanced</b> decay. The work has been achieved through a workshop, addressed to the students attending the Master Course in Architecture, who wanted to discuss the interdisciplinary questions with some proposals. The activities since 28 th November 2015 have concerned a seminar day, a direct inspection to heritage, and some meetings at the site with experts. In addition, the planning activity, not only about the settlement of themes and solutions established in advance, but about disciplinary contributions to investigate and solve the implied issues. Conclusions have been presented {{at the end of the}} activity, on 30 th October 2015, at Castello del Valentino and, then, at Candiolo's municipality during a public meeting between Managers and citizens. The experience gathers in this volume, in order to summarize and divulgate the "metaprojects" about Parpaglia, to evidence the variety of the concerned subjects and their useful collaboration. The text is divided into two parts, the first one concerning the definition of territorial and architectural assets in a diachronic vision, to identify values and weaknesses, towards measures of preservation and chances of restoration. The second one concerns the project and the gathering of student's seven proposals, with a sequence of reflections, like the need of establishing priorities of intervention or valuing the potential of the castle to introduce new functions. We also considered the infrastructural and local company levels, until we outlined the operative backgrounds and we have identified the active subjects and problems of future management, to settle the heritag...|$|R
