5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many <b>uncritical</b> and {{unproven}} speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E
5|$|Molly Haskell {{has argued}} that nevertheless, women are mostly <b>uncritical</b> of the scene, and that by and large it is {{consistent}} with what women have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} and insist on having sexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} personal identity is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against <b>uncritical</b> acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
5|$|The biography, Lindbergh, {{was highly}} anticipated; {{prior to its}} publication, the book's film rights were bought, sight unseen, by Steven Spielberg, who planned to direct a movie of it. Published in 1998, Lindbergh sold about 250,000 copies in hardcover, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Berg was noted for his {{exhaustive}} research, {{as well as his}} sympathetic, but by no means <b>uncritical,</b> approach to Lindbergh, whose alleged anti-Semitism he addressed in a straightforward, unblinking manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the <b>uncritical</b> borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could {{be traced to the}} prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, the political and social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E
5|$|The trend {{continued}} with other <b>uncritical</b> biographies, such as Rommel as Military Commander (1968), {{by the former}} British soldier and author Ronald Lewin, and Knight's Cross: A Life of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (1994), by the high-ranking British officer David Fraser. These works focused on Rommel's military career, depoliticising it and presenting him strictly as a soldier.|$|E
5|$|The <b>uncritical</b> {{acceptance}} of Price's reports prompted a formal {{study by the}} Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E
5|$|Others {{point out}} that in philosophy, a {{critical}} and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out {{the negative consequences of}} <b>uncritical</b> acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments {{can be traced back to}} 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but <b>uncritical</b> lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat <b>uncritical</b> use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too <b>uncritical</b> of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|The {{gender roles}} {{of men and}} women, as well as societies' conceptions of the {{associated}} concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the <b>uncritical</b> depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control ‘his’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is “an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably {{from the work of}} African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe’s women some agency and prominence.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be <b>uncritical</b> and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
25|$|Robert Sharf also {{mentions}} charisma {{from which}} institutional power is derived, {{and the need}} to balance charismatic authority with institutional authority. Elaborate analyses of these scandals are made by Stuart Lachs, who mentions the <b>uncritical</b> acceptance of religious narratives, such as lineages and dharma transmission, which aid in giving <b>uncritical</b> charismatic powers to teachers and leaders.|$|E
25|$|But Jung {{was also}} critical, warning against an <b>uncritical</b> {{borrowing}} from Asian spirituality.|$|E

25|$|A then {{complete}} but <b>uncritical</b> {{list of the}} vicarii in spiritualibus in urbe generales {{was published}} by Ponzetti (Rome, 1797); it was added to and improved by Moroni (Dizionario, XCIX).|$|E
25|$|Although Brethren leaders {{throughout}} New Zealand unanimously {{rejected the}} Charismatic movement in 1964, attitudes today {{are much more}} diverse. Complete rejection, and <b>uncritical</b> acceptance, of this movement are both minority positions among New Zealand Brethren today.|$|E

25|$|The 19th-century idea, {{gained from}} <b>uncritical</b> {{reading of the}} Gallic Wars, that under cultural-military {{pressure}} from Rome the druids formed the core of 1st-century BCE resistance among the Gauls, was examined and dismissed before World War II, though it remains current in folk history.|$|E
25|$|Nyíri's {{proposition}} {{was immediately}} criticised by Ottó Gyürk, {{pointing to the}} fact that with such a permissive deciphering method one can get anything out of the code. Also, the mere fact that Nyíri makes an <b>uncritical</b> allusion to the fringe theory that the Hungarian language descended from Sumerian, discredits his enterprise.|$|E
25|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{held during}} Saakashvili's second term were condemned by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe election monitoring mission for being marred by ballot stuffing, violence against opposition campaigners, <b>uncritical</b> {{coverage of the}} president and his party from the state-controlled media, and public officials openly campaigning for the president's party.|$|E
25|$|After Kodály's {{death in}} 1967 Bashir {{spent some time}} in Beirut again. But he was {{repelled}} by the development of the Arabian music, which was marked by progressive degeneration and commercialisation, due to the incompetent and <b>uncritical</b> dealing with western influences. Considering, that the popular chanters were responsible for these trends, he refused to take engagements from them.|$|E
25|$|The Carpenters disaffiliated {{from the}} AFL-CIO in 2001, citing {{complaints}} about the National Federation's failure {{to follow up on}} its program to organize the unorganized. Other observers attributed the Carpenters' departure to its unhappiness with jurisdictional awards and other restrictions on its ability to raid the jurisdictions of other unions, as well as the AFL-CIO's <b>uncritical</b> and exclusive support of the Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|For all her censures of Communism, however, West {{was hardly}} an <b>uncritical</b> {{supporter}} of the Western democracies. Thus in 1919–1920, she excoriated the U.S. government for deporting Goldman and for the infamous Palmer raids. She was also appalled at the failure of Western democracies {{to come to the}} aid of Republican Spain, and she gave money to the Republican cause.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{claim that}} {{standardized}} tests are misused and <b>uncritical</b> judgments {{of intelligence and}} performance, but supporters argue that these aren't negatives of standardized tests, but criticisms of poorly designed testing regimes. They argue that testing should and does focus educational resources {{on the most important}} aspects of education— imparting a pre-defined set of knowledge and skills— and that other aspects are either less important, or should be added to the testing scheme.|$|E
25|$|After the 1992 famine, {{international}} donors {{made their}} aid conditional on the re-establishment of political pluralism by 1994. One party formed by Malawian exiles opposed to Banda returned to Malawi in 1993, {{and others were}} formed within the country. The United Democratic Front (UDF) won most votes in 1994 and 1999, but not a majority. Its governments were weak and only retained power in alliance with smaller parties. They were accused of corruption, clientism and the <b>uncritical</b> acceptance of World Bank policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{press has}} {{received}} praise from North American and German writers for professionally produced text and picture books. J.J. Fedorowicz has been profiled by the American historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies in their 2006 work The Myth of the Eastern Front, where they describe Fedorowicz {{as a leading}} press of war-romancing literature and criticise it for providing a platform for authors who present an <b>uncritical</b> and ahistorical portrayal of the German war effort during the Soviet-German war of 1941–1945.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, {{after two}} false starts in poetry and fiction, {{he made his}} first {{noteworthy}} appearance as a writer with The Season: a Satire, which contained incisive lines, and was marked by some promise both in wit and observation. In 1870 he published a volume of criticism, The Poetry of the Period, which was conceived in the spirit of satire, and attacked Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold and Swinburne in an unrestrained fashion. The book aroused some discussion at the time, but its judgments were extremely <b>uncritical.</b>|$|E

25|$|Into {{the later}} twentieth century, scholars' usual {{explanation}} {{for the lack of}} Celtic influence on English, supported by <b>uncritical</b> readings of the accounts of Gildas and Bede, was that Old English became dominant primarily because Germanic-speaking invaders killed, chased away, and/or enslaved the previous inhabitants of the areas that they settled. In recent decades, a few specialists have continued to support this interpretation, and Peter Schrijver has said that 'to a large extent, it is linguistics that is responsible for thinking in terms of drastic scenarios' about demographic change in late Roman Britain.|$|E
25|$|Social ecology is a {{philosophy}} developed by Murray Bookchin in the 1960s; it holds that present ecological problems {{are rooted in}} deep-seated social problems, particularly in dominatory hierarchical political and social systems. These have resulted in an <b>uncritical</b> acceptance of an overly competitive grow-or-die philosophy. It suggests that this cannot be resisted by individual action such as ethical consumerism but must be addressed by more nuanced ethical thinking and collective activity grounded in radical democratic ideals. The complexity of relationships between people and with nature is emphasised, along with the importance of establishing social structures that take account of this.|$|E
25|$|The {{larger context}} in which Wittgenstein's {{philosophy}} is seen to develop considers his uncompromising opposition to essences, mental entities {{and other forms of}} idealism which were accepted {{as a matter of fact}} in continental philosophy at the turn of the preceding century. In his view, the main cause for such errors is language and its <b>uncritical</b> use. In the received view, concepts, categories or classes are taken to rely on necessary features common to all items covered by them. Abstraction is the procedure which acknowledges this necessity and derives essences, but in the absence of a single common feature, it is bound to fail.|$|E
25|$|Into {{the later}} twentieth century, scholars' usual {{explanation}} {{for the lack of}} Celtic influence on English, supported by <b>uncritical</b> readings of the accounts of Gildas and Bede, was that Old English became dominant primarily because Germanic-speaking invaders killed, chased away, and/or enslaved the previous inhabitants of the areas that they settled. In recent decades, a few specialists have continued to support this interpretation. Indeed, Peter Schrijver has said that 'to a large extent, it is linguistics that is responsible for thinking in terms of drastic scenarios' about demographic change in late Roman Britain., Routledge Studies in Linguistics, 13 (New York: Routledge, 2014), quoting p. 16.|$|E
25|$|While George Odgers' volume covered only RAAF {{operations}} against Japan, {{the other two}} authors of the Air series, and particularly John Herington, faced the challenge of covering the diverse experiences of the EATS graduates who served in over 500 British squadrons. Herington's solution to this challenge was to write a comprehensive short history of British air warfare, {{with a focus on}} the small number of Australian squadrons and the main activities of Australian personnel in RAF units. Gillison and Herington also wrote about how EATS operated and its implications for Australia. Herington's account of EATS is generally considered superior to that provided by Gillison, whose account is regarded as relatively <b>uncritical</b> of the scheme.|$|E
