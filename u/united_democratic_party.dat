5|$|In 1944, the Democratic Party and Commonwealth Party merged as the <b>United</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> {{which became}} the NSW {{division}} of the Liberal Party of Australia a year later. The merged party's first state leader in NSW, Weaver, died in office in November 1945. Mair succeeded him, with Treatt succeeding Athol Richardson as Deputy Leader. After five months as Leader, Mair resigned in March 1946 and Treatt was then elected to succeed him as party leader and hence, Leader of the Opposition.|$|E
5|$|As the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce {{to run as}} a {{compromise}} candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a <b>united</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> The split Democrats were soundly defeated for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing {{to the people of}} Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the tariff worked to the Republicans' {{advantage}} in 1888. The legislative revisions {{of the past four}} years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business. Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to James Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a <b>united</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> to carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.|$|E
