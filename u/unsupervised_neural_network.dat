40|$|Abstract—We {{propose the}} {{application}} of independent component analysis (ICA), via <b>unsupervised</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks,</b> to authenticity protection for multimedia products. We give {{an overview of the}} current state of multimedia authenticity protection, including the requirements of various multimedia applications, current approaches to the problem, and the robustness of the approaches. For watermark security, a covert independentcomponent watermarking signal can serve as a “vaccination” against a dormant digital “bacteria ” protecting the multimedia data. An unauthorized removal of the watermark triggers the bacteria payload, which then degrades the quality of the unauthorized data. We argue that such digital bacteria meet all the established requirements for beneficial virus-like programs, and their payload would merely affect pirated media. We show how these new approaches contribute to a flexible, robust, and secure system for protecting the authenticity of multimedia products.
