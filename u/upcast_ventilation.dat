50|$|The Fletchers owned {{several small}} pits which {{eventually}} became the Howe Bridge Collieries. In 1845 Howe Bridge Collieries owned by John Fletcher sank three deep shafts to the Seven Feet mine, the Victoria pit where coal was wound was sunk to 447 feet, the Puffer for pumping water to 435 {{feet and the}} Volunteer, the <b>upcast</b> <b>ventilation</b> shaft. These last three pits were taken over by Manchester Collieries, {{became part of the}} National Coal Board in 1947 and closed in 1959.|$|E
50|$|A mines {{inspector}} {{report of}} 1881 {{is the first}} to describe a mine called the Big Pit due to its elliptical shape with dimensions of 18 ft by 13 ft, the first shaft in Wales large enough to allow two tramways. On completion it became the coal-winding shaft, while the older Coity shaft was used for <b>upcast</b> air <b>ventilation.</b>|$|R

The Coity shaft was abandoned, with the Big Pit shaft used for <b>upcast</b> air <b>ventilation</b> and emergency extraction.|$|R
50|$|The {{third and}} most famous Bowburn Colliery was sunk in 1906 by Bell Bros. Ltd., using the 1840 shaft as the <b>ventilation</b> <b>upcast</b> shaft (and, later, for manriding). Its first coal was drawn in 1908. It merged with Tursdale {{colliery}} in 1931 and grew {{to be one}} of the largest in the Durham coalfield, working six seams and with over 2,500 employees in the 1950s. Meanwhile the village was growing around it. Hardly anything now remains of the colliery complex which closed in July 1967. The colliery yard is now the site of the Bowburn South Industrial Estate.|$|R

50|$|The {{largest of}} the early pits owned by the Fletchers which {{eventually}} became the Howe Bridge Collieries were Lovers' Lane Colliery which lasted until 1898 and the Eckersley Fold pits. The Crombouke Day-Eye, a drift mine or adit dates from the 1840s when a drift was driven into the Crombouke and the Brassey mines at a gradient of 1 in 5. The Crombouke and Eckersley Fold pits closed in 1907. The company sank the deep mines of Howe Bridge Colliery in 1845. Three shafts were sunk to the Seven Feet mine, the Victoria pit where coal was wound at 447 feet, the Puffer for pumping water at 435 feet and the Volunteer, the <b>upcast</b> <b>ventilation</b> shaft.

50|$|The Steuben Shaft at Avondale Colliery is {{situated}} on the right bank of the Susquehanna River, four miles from Plymouth, PA in Luzerne County. It was developed in 1867 by the Nanticoke Coal Company, {{a subsidiary of the}} Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The 327 ft shaft allowed access to the 9-foot Red Ash Vein, which yielded a commercially desirable grade of anthracite. The shaft was lined with wooden timber, and partitioned into two sections. One section was reserved for <b>upcast</b> <b>ventilation</b> provided by a furnace. The breaker was built directly on top of the mouth of the shaft, and coal was extracted by use of the room and pillar method. There was only one exit from the mine, namely, the shaft. This practice had been banned in England, but was common for anthracite coal mines in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Industrialisation - {{particularly}} the cotton trade - {{helped shape the}} town, but its rapid development destroyed its former pasture and meadow land. Two cotton mills were built before 1794 and by 1825 there were seven. The industry continued to expand {{and by the end}} of the 19th century 14 spinning mills of varying sizes were in operation. The largest mills were built in brick during the 1890s with four or five storeys, large windows, ornamental towers, engine houses and tall brick built chimneys. They included Tower, Tame Valley, River, Park Road and Queen Mills. Most of the cotton mills have now been demolished, but some have been preserved and converted into flats.Coal pits exploiting the underlying coal measures to the south of the Lancashire Coalfield were a major part of Dukinfield's industrial history, one pithead was located on Birch Lane, now the site of All Saints' Catholic College, with another near the northern border with Ashton-under-Lyne. Francis Dukinfield Astley developed two collieries in the town, Dukinfield and Astley Deep Pit, and both had explosions killing many workers. Dukinfield Colliery (also known as Lakes Pit or Victoria Colliery)was owned by Astley's Dukinfield Colliery Company. The colliery had two shafts, the downcast was 1,020 feet deep to theBlack mine (coal seam) and was connected to the <b>upcast</b> <b>ventilation</b> shaft. On 4 June 1867, 38 men and boys died of suffocation following an explosion caused by a faulty safety lamp and poor management.|$|E
