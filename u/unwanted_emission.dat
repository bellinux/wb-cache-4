40|$|Modified phase-generated carrier {{homodyne}} demodulation {{technique for}} fiber-optic sensors is presented. Nowadays phase-generated carrier homodyne demodulation technique {{is one of}} the most widespread. One of its drawbacks is the temperature dependence of the output signal because of the modulator scale factor temperature dependence. In order to compensate this dependence an automatic adjustment of the phase modulation depth is necessary. To achieve the result, additional harmonics analysis is used with the help of the Bessel functions. For this purpose the known demodulation scheme is added with the branch, where interferometric signal is multiplied by the third harmonic of the modulation signal. The deviation of optimal ratio of odd harmonics is used as a feedback signal for adjusting the modulation depth. Unwanted emissions arise in the feedback signal, when the third harmonic possesses a value close to zero. To eliminate <b>unwanted</b> <b>emission</b> in the feedback signal, the principle scheme is added with one more branch, where interferometric signal is multiplied by the forth harmonic of the modulation signal. The deviation of optimal ratio of even harmonics is used as a feedback signal alternately with the deviation of optimal ratio of odd harmonics.

Results of modeling have confirmed that suggested method gives the possibility for an automatic adjustment of the phase modulation depth and makes it possible to compensate temperature dependence for the modulator scale factor and output signal magnitude...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the era of}} sustainability, {{utilization}} of livestock wastes as soil amendment to provide micronutrients for crops is very economical and sustainable. It is well understood that livestock wastes are comparable, if not better, nutrient sources for crops as chemical fertilizers. However, the large concentrated volumes of animal manure produced from livestock operations and the limited amount of available nearby agricultural land areas necessitated the need for volume reduction of these animal wastes. Composting of these animal manures is a viable option for biomass and pathogenic reduction in the environment. Nevertheless, composting also increases the potential loss of available nutrients for crop production as well as <b>unwanted</b> <b>emission</b> of anthropogenic air pollutants due {{to the loss of}} ammonia and other compounds via volatilization. In this study, we examine the emission of ammonia and nitrous oxide from swine manure windrows to evaluate the benefit of biomass reduction in conjunction with the potential loss of available nutrients. The feedstock for the windrows was obtained from swine farm in Kentucky where swine manure was mixed with wood shaving as absorbent material. Static flux chambers along with photoacoustic gas analyzer were used to monitor ammonia and nitrous oxide concentrations during the composting process. The results show that ammonia and nitrous oxide fluxes were quite high during the initial composting process and after the turning of each compost pile. Over the period of roughly three months of composting, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) decreased by about 90 %. Although composting of animal waste is quite beneficial for biomass reduction, composting may not be economically feasible from an agronomical point of view due to time, nutrient loss (N loss), and potential environmental pollution (ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions). Therefore, additional studies are needed to assess and validate the economics and environmental impact of animal (swine) manure composting (e. g., crop yield or impact on climate change).

Along {{this line of}} thought, these compounds {{can be considered as}} ordinary ionic compounds. The corresponding pseudo-binary phase diagram comprises a great variety of phases with a high ionic mobility of Li-cations as well as pseudo-anions as measured by diffusion gradients. Using this equilibrium preparation method, we are able to discriminate between stable and meta-stable phases such as Li 2 BH 4 NH 2 formed during high-energy ball-milling. We identify Li 2 BH 4 NH 2 as a mobile intermediate during phase formation. Hydrogen desorption as relevant for their potential use as hydrogen storage does not take place below 200 °C as measured by gravimetry. In particular amides, but also borohydrides emit hydrogen, and nitrogen and boron, respectively, containing species (NH 3 and BHx, respectively). We probe the bulk and surface exchange of hydrogen in such subunits in LiNH 2 and Li 2 BH 4 NH 2 by hydrogen-deuterium experiments. In contrast to bulk exchange, surface exchange processes occur at very low temperatures - lower than a significant decomposition rate but coincidentally with the appearance of Li 2 NH comprising high ionic conductivity. The rate limiting step is thus the bulk transport - in agreement with the empirical correlation that the mobility of ions is linked to the hydrogen desorption kinetics of a material (P. A.

One of the EMC requirements is to control <b>unwanted</b> <b>emission</b> of electromagnetic (EM) energy. However, as the clock frequency goes higher, it is a greater challenge to design EMC-complied circuitry due {{to the problem of}} rahation in the harmonic frequencies. Consequently, it is crucial to understand the basic concepts of the emission mechanisms and the suitable mitigation techniques to ensure EMC compliance. This research was to characterise the sources of radiated emissions from a hgital circuit and investigate the effects of employing EMC design practices on the reduction of emission. The novelty of this research is athibuted to the comprehensive study on the sources of emission and mitigation techniques of digital circuits on double-sided board at 0. 125 MHz, 0. 25 MHz, 1. 25 MHz, 2. 5 MHz, 12. 5 MHz and 25 MHz. The radiated emissions are measured for various mitigation techmques such as the size of loop area, length of cable and signal currents. The measurement results are then compared with the radiated emission limits of European Norm (EN) 55022 and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Part 15 Class B. Nine Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layouts with different design are designed and fabricated by using the IsoPro software and the Quick Circuit milling machine.

5000|$|The adjacent-channel {{interference}} which receiver A experiences from a transmitter B {{is the sum}} of {{the power}} that B emits into A's channel—known as the [...] "unwanted emission", and represented by the ACLR (Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio)—and the power that A picks up from B's channel, which is represented by the ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity). B emitting power into A's channel is called adjacent-channel leakage (<b>unwanted</b> <b>emissions).</b> It occurs for two reasons. First, because RF filters require a roll-off, and do not eliminate a signal completely. Second, due to intermodulation in B's amplifiers, which cause the transmitted spectrum to spread beyond what was intended. Therefore, B emits some power in the adjacent channel which is picked up by A. A receives some emissions from B's channel due to the roll off of A's selectivity filters.

First, we introduce the concept of radiative energy transfer between two objects of different temperatures in the near field, and theoretically argue that the radiation tunneling of evanescent surface modes can enable energy transfer that is orders of magnitude stronger than the energy transfer in the far field. Specifically, we develop a new computational approach-based on a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method that incorporates the Langevin approach to Brownian motion-which enables calculations of heat transfer for arbitrary geometries and materials. Second, we study the near-field heat transfer between two sheets of graphene and show that thermally excited plasmon-polariton modes can strongly mediate, enhance, and tune the energy exchange in this system. We predict maximum transfer at low doping and for plasmons in two graphene sheets in resonance, with orders-of-magnitude enhancement over the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Third, we develop {{the concept of a}} near-field thermophotovoltaic (NFTPV) system, and analyze several different implementations that use plasmonic materials as thermal emitters. In particular, we quantify the properties of an optimal near-field photovoltaic cell, argue that large plasmonic losses can-contrary to intuition-be helpful in enhancing the overall heat transfer, and propose and develop the concept of graphene as a tunable thermal emitter for a NFTPV system. Fourth, we tailor the far-field thermal emission from objects at high temperatures and experimentally demonstrate a method where the emission spectrum is controlled on the cold-side by implementing a nano-layer structure that surrounds the hot emitter and recycles <b>unwanted</b> <b>emission.</b> We find that this approach can enable lighting sources with luminous efficiencies close to the fundamental limit for lighting applications. Finally, we study opto-thermal effects in asymmetric nanoparticles. Specifically, we show that a type of metal-dielectric (Janus) particle in uniform light field exhibits a new class of stable rotational dynamics. We demonstrate (in a simulation) opto-thermal guiding of a composite asymmetric particle by switching the light beam frequency, without regard to the direction or the shape of the light beam. by Ognjen Ilic.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{theoretical}} and {{experimental studies of}} wavelength-selective waveguide structures for high-power Nd 3 +- and Yb 3 +-doped fibre lasers. Cladding-pumped high-power fibre lasers based on these novel waveguide designs and operating at desired unconventional wavelengths were investigated through numerical simulations and fibre laser experiments. Rare earth doped fibres have typically multiple emission bands of different effective strengths. Stimulate emission from strong bands dominates over, and via a reduced population inversion normally even suppresses, emission from weaker bands in conventional step-index waveguides. For efficient emission and laser operation on the weaker emission bands, {{it is necessary to}} suppress unwanted stimulated emission on the strong transitions by preventing power from building up at the unwanted wavelengths. Discrete "bulk" (non-waveguide) devices at a single or a few points are ineffective, if the gain at unwanted wavelength is sufficiently high to generate high-power amplified spontaneous emission even between filters. In such cases, waveguide structures which reduce the gain at unwanted wavelengths and prevent build-up of <b>unwanted</b> <b>emission</b> can be considered. The fibre itself acts as a distributed wavelength-selective filter, and a compact all-fibre laser can be made. For short-wavelength operation when the gain at longer wavelengths needs to be suppressed, a helical core fibre is proposed. This induces a large bending loss at unwanted longer wavelengths while the bending loss at desired shorter wavelength remains relatively low. The required bending loss properties, for efficient operation at the desired shorter wavelength, can be achieved by designing the helix pitch and offset along with fibre core diameter and NA (numerical aperture). A Nd 3 +-doped helical fibre laser operating at 0. 92 µm was investigated through computer simulations. Alternatively, there are fibres in which the fundamental mode can be cut off at a certain wavelength. I have studied fibres with a W-type refractive index profile and fibres with a hollow (air-filled) central region surrounded by a core and then a region with depressed refractive index, known as depressed-clad hollow fibre. With these fibre designs, the doped core guides the desired shorter wavelength but not the unwanted longer wavelengths. Nd 3 +-doped W-type fibre lasers operating at 0. 92 µm were simulated and experimentally demonstrated. Also Yb 3 +-doped depressed-clad hollow fibre lasers operating at 0. 98 µm were simulated and experimentally demonstrated. For long wavelength operation, with a suppressed gain at shorter wavelengths, modified W-type designs are proposed. By designing the refractive index profile and using ring-shaped gain regions, the net gain on an intrinsically weak long-wavelength transition may become larger than that on an intrinsically stronger short-wavelength transition. Adopting this technique, Nd 3 +-doped fibre amplifiers and lasers operating at 1. 38 µm were simulated. While fibre lasers that generate a nearly diffraction-limited single-mode beam are normally targeted, a multimode output is often obtained, e. g., in development stages with nonideal fibres. Then it is important to characterise the modal properties of the beam. For this, two different modal power decomposition methods based on intensity measurements are proposed. The first method is based on a tomography technique that uses a Wigner function followed by an inverse Radon transform. The second method adopts a wavelength-sweeping optical source which induces beat patterns after propagation through a certain length of fibre. The feasibilities of the two proposed ideas were verified through numerical simulations...|$|E

In this study, to gain a deep insight into the combustion properties of co-firing ammonia/methane fuel blends for the power and steel industry, a detailed chemical-kinetics mechanism model was developed for comprehensively modelling ammonia/methane fuels combustion. Characteristics of ignition delay time, unstretched laminar burning velocity and NO, CO 2 and CO emissions in the exhaust gas were obtained over a wide range of equivalence ratios and ammonia fractions. High NO emissions will be a main problem as CO and CO 2 emissions tend to drop when adding ammonia into methane. To gain a further understanding of the effect of ammonia substituting methane for combustion use, analyses of laminar premixed flame structures were performed. The impact of ammonia substitution was illustrated by analysing relevant specific radicals.
