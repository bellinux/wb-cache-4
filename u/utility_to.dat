5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E
5|$|They {{also agreed}} to fixed limits on how many pop-ups they can {{generate}} on a computer (maximum of 5 per day, 1 per hour), the requirement to provide a mute button for any sound content in the pop-ups {{and be able to}} close the windows, and provide a hyperlink with toll-free number and email <b>utility,</b> <b>to</b> request stopping the pop-ups under certain conditions. The defendants also promised to clearly label any single-click download or install buttons, and not pre-select these as the default.|$|E
5|$|In interrogation, Wexler, {{a former}} Stasi colonel, {{explains}} to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable {{because of its}} <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. Even if he succeeds in bringing the IBBC down {{there are hundreds of}} other banks which will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to go outside the system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and have White killed.|$|E

Luján also required <b>utilities</b> <b>to</b> diversify their renewable use to include solar, wind and biomass.|$|R

5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E

25|$|Despite his influence, however, Mazzoni {{has been}} subject to some criticism. Some see, for example, a contradiction in trying to assign both {{pleasure}} and social <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> poetry at the same time, while others question {{his use of the}} distinction between icastic and phantastic mimesis (Leitch, 301).|$|E
25|$|In his 1881 work , Francis Ysidro Edgeworth {{presented}} the indifference curve, deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. Later work attempted to generalize to the indifference curve formulations of utility and marginal utility in avoiding unobservable measures of utility.|$|E

25|$|According to {{standard}} conceptions of economic value (see the subjective theory of value), {{the goods and}} services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value. Since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money (monthly fees) in exchange for these resources, by definition they have demonstrated <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> the user.|$|E
25|$|The {{first modern}} analog {{computer}} was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, in 1872. It used {{a system of}} pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location and was of great <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> navigation in shallow waters. His device was the foundation for further developments in analog computing.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there were}} some improvements. In 2006 the {{revenues}} collected by the regional utility in Puerto Plata was 2.5 times higher than in 2002 due to tariff increases and better bill collection. This allowed the <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> generate a moderate surplus {{to contribute to the}} financing of investments. The utility has also signed a performance and financing agreement with the national government, providing more transparency and incentives to improve efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Dynamic demand {{plans have}} devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the {{electrical}} grid. This method may {{work very well}} with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers would {{need to have a}} smart meter in order for the <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> calculate credits.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} {{throughout}} Southeast Alaska, the Juneau area is susceptible to damage caused by natural disasters. The 2014 Palma Bay earthquake caused widespread outages to telecommunications in the area due to damage to a fiber optic cable serving the area. In April 2008, a series of massive avalanches outside Juneau heavily damaged the electrical lines providing Juneau with power, knocking the hydroelectric system offline and forcing the <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> switch to a much more expensive diesel system.|$|E
25|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the {{numerous}} goals {{will require the}} policy impacts to be expressed {{using a variety of}} metrics that are not readily comparable. In such cases, the policy analyst may draw on the concept of <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> aggregate the various goals into a single score. With the utility concept, each impact is given a weighting such that 1 unit of each weighted impact is considered to be equally valuable (or desirable) with regards to the collective well-being.|$|E

25|$|A {{high power}} factor is {{generally}} desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an electric power transmission <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|These loan {{conditions}} {{ensure that}} the borrowing country {{will be able to}} repay the IMF and that the country will not attempt to solve their balance-of-payment problems {{in a way that would}} negatively impact the international economy. The incentive problem of moral hazard—when economic agents maximise their own <b>utility</b> <b>to</b> the detriment of others because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of a consumer good, the {{point on the}} demand curve indicates the value, or marginal <b>utility,</b> <b>to</b> consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer {{would be prepared to}} pay for that unit. The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market, supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.|$|E
