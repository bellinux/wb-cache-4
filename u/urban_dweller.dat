30|$|The study {{evaluated}} {{determinants of}} consumption intensity of leafy AIVs in rural and <b>urban</b> <b>dwellers</b> using the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. Findings indicated a higher consumption intensity of leafy AIVs in rural <b>dwellers</b> compared to <b>urban</b> <b>dwellers</b> {{with a mean}} of four and two times a week, respectively. Higher diversity of leafy AIVs at retail outlets increased their consumption intensity in both rural and <b>urban</b> <b>dwellers.</b> In <b>urban</b> <b>dwellers,</b> formal employment of the household cook reduced the consumption intensity of leafy AIVs while increased distance to retail outlets had a contrary effect. In rural dwellers, elderly decision-makers with more information on AIVs’ medicinal benefits increased vegetable consumption intensity. However, large households with a greater proportion of income allocated for food use reduced vegetable consumption intensity.|$|R

[...] Literary historian Sami Damian sees Cioculescu and several of the others among the [...] "eminent" [...] group of authors directly influenced by the older Lovinescu, opting to [...] "apply a program of aesthetic independence". Similarly, critic and historian Mircea Iorgulescu discussed Cioculescu as a member of Lovinescu's [...] "first posterity". Şerban Cioculescu's own literary style was judged by Alex. Ştefănescu to represent a peak of the interwar tradition, and a link with classical mindset, characterized by calm and erudition, as well as by [...] "the [...] individualism of an <b>urban</b> <b>dweller</b> with a sense of humor". He found its [...] "pedantic and digressive style" [...] similar to that of 19th-century writer Alexandru Odobescu, author of the complex essay Pseudo-cynegetikos, but noted that Cioculescu matched Odobescu's [...] "reverie" [...] with [...] "malicious soberness." [...] In a 1989 essay, literary reviewer Ion Simuţ spoke about [...] "the ironic style" [...] of articles and studies authored by Cioculescu, as well as by his colleagues Călinescu and Cornel Regman, and identified by him as inspired by the comediography of Ion Luca Caragiale. However, Cioculescu did not relate to criticism as an integral aspect of literature, believing that it lacked a creative dimension, and warned against the danger posed by subjectivity.|$|E
