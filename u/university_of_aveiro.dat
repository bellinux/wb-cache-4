25|$|However, {{by the end}} of the 19th {{century the}} {{illiteracy}} rate was over 80 percent and higher education was reserved for a small percentage of the population. 68.1 percent of Portugal's population was still classified as illiterate by the 1930 census. Portugal's literacy rate by the 1940s and early 1950s was low for North American and Western European standards at the time. From the 1960s, the country made public education available for all children between the ages of six and twelve, expanded a robust network of industrial and commercial technical schools aimed at intermediate education of future skilled workers (ensino médio), recognized the Portuguese Catholic University in 1971, and by 1973 a wave of new state-run universities were founded across mainland Portugal (the Minho University, the New University of Lisbon, the University of Évora, and the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aveiro</b> - Veiga Simão was the Minister in charge for education by then).|$|E
25|$|In 1972 the ISCTE, {{a public}} {{university}} institute, {{was created in}} Lisbon by the decree Decreto-Lei nº 522/72, of 15 December, {{as a first step}} towards a new and innovative public university in the city. Due to the carnation revolution of 1974 this first facility of a never-completed projected larger university stayed alone. In 1973 a new wave of state-run universities opened in Lisbon - the New University of Lisbon, Braga - the Minho University and Évora - the University of Évora. These last days of the Estado Novo regime were marked by the most significant growth in enrolments for both secondary and university education in Portugal. After 1974, the anti-Estado Novo revolution's year, new public universities were created in Vila Real - the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Aveiro - the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aveiro,</b> Covilhã - the University of Beira Interior (upgraded from the former Polytechnic Institute of Covilhã which was created in 1973), Faro - the University of the Algarve, Madeira - the University of Madeira, and the Azores - the University of the Azores.|$|E

40|$|Brands undeniably {{constitute}} a significant asset {{for a company}} and are usually specified in its organisational strategy. Typically, employees are not {{invited to participate in}} debates or decisions about branding since they access brand information in a unidirectional way. Many of them do not even know how to convey appropriate messages and fail to recognise the importance of brand consistency. In this article we propose a heuristic for an interaction structure aimed at brand artefact co-design, through a computer-mediated platform, so that employees may learn about the brand, develop brand knowledge, propose meaningful brand artefacts and manage the evaluation of their peers’ proposals. We prepared a non-functional prototype of a Participatory Brand Centre and tested it in focus group sessions with the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aveiro's</b> employees.

Following previous collaborations of these two Portuguese Universities in RoboCup simulation league and associated competitions, this project intends to fully adapt the coordination methodologies developed by FC Portugal simulated soccer team to the search and rescue scenario. After FC Portugal’s first successful participation in RoboCup rescue simulation league (Osaka, 2005), the team aimed at introducing new high-level strategic analysis tools in the Rescue league and developed FCPx tool. This tool enables an easy comparison of different teams’ strategies, and the use of learning methodologies for high-level strategic decisions in rescue. The tool also enabled us to evaluate our coordination methodologies, analysing the results achieved in several rescue parameters, and conclude that they are very promising for the search and rescue domain. FC Portugal Rescue team results are very promising achieving first place in RoboCup European Championship 2006 (Dutch Open) held in Eindhoven...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- There is {{considerable}} educational literature {{to suggest that}} the way universities conceive and manage the relationship between research and teaching, impacts negatively or positively teaching practices and student learning in Higher Education. Although the relevance of linking research and teaching is perceived as of central importance by many authors and university leaders, empirical findings suggest that research does not always influence the teaching quality and vice versa. The purpose of this communication is to analyse how institutional policies and practices can help or hinder engineering faculty members to link their teaching and research and how academics perceive the teaching/research nexus with the broader objective to enhance quality teaching and learning in Higher Education. More specifically the objective of this research is to investigate a range of institutional policies and practices at the <b>Universities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aveiro</b> (PT) and San José State (USA) aiming at understanding how engineering faculty use research-based teaching in their classes. Empirical findings suggest that a research-based teaching model engages more actively the students in the daily tasks and develops deeper critical thinking...|$|R

This study encompassed two moments of clinical internships in the Nursing, Physical Therapy, Radiology and Radiotherapy majors. The Clinical Internship I provided the 123 students with a global view of the health care professional activities. The Clinical Internship II, with 119 students, developed competences of each health professional. Questionnaires with categorical scales from 1 to 5 evaluated the organization and efficiency of the two internships. The results revealed averages over 3 in all items. In conclusion, the Ecological Model of Clinical-Reflective Training was well accepted by students and clinical supervisors. Applications in the health care area were demonstrated...|$|R
