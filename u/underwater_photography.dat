5|$|He was the {{preferred}} director of photography of early film star Richard Dix, and served on several Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) committees, {{as well as}} being selected by the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) to test new types of film stock. Cronjager pioneered several new techniques and types of cinematography, developing new camera angles in the 1920s, working on one of the earliest film noirs in the 1940s, and using Cinemascope in <b>underwater</b> <b>photography</b> in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a camera for <b>underwater</b> <b>photography,</b> and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the most}} useful points for diving are the coast off Playa del Matorral in the South, and the zone between Lobos Island and Corralejo in the north. It is here in Corralejo that the International Sea and Submarine Photography Festival takes places, known as Fimarsub Corralejo - Lobos. During the festival there are beginners' lessons, {{professional}} dives, lessons in <b>underwater</b> <b>photography,</b> screenings and other events related to the sport.|$|E
25|$|Where {{intrusive}} underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can {{be removed}} from an area of investigation using a water dredge or airlift. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the investigation. It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. <b>Underwater</b> <b>photography</b> can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer John McPherson also {{supervised}} the underwater unit, which was headed by Pete Romano. Whereas <b>underwater</b> <b>photography</b> was normally filmed with an anamorphic lens, requiring overhead lighting, Romano filmed these [...] "sequences with Zeiss, a 35 mm super-speed lens, {{which allows the}} natural ambiance to come through on film." [...] Additional <b>underwater</b> <b>photography</b> was completed in a water tank, measuring [...] by [...] across, and [...] in depth, [...] in Universal Studio's Stage 27. Also, a replica of Nassau's Clifton Bay and its skyline was created on the man-made Falls Lake on the studio backlot.|$|E

The technology required to house and protect large format cameras was not yet widely available, leading Dweck to design his own cases for the project, using weights and pulleys to manipulate the camera. To obtain the desired angles for the shots, Dweck used two different techniques, diving into the water with his subjects, either with a long snorkel or unaided, and shooting from behind a glass wall placed within the river.

50|$|Peter Stackpole was an American photographer. Along with Alfred Eisenstaedt, Margaret Bourke-White, and Thomas McAvoy, {{he was one}} of Life Magazines first staff {{photographers and}} {{remained}} with the publication until 1960. He won a George Polk Award in 1954 for a photograph taken 100 feet <b>underwater,</b> and taught <b>photography</b> at the Academy of Art University. He also wrote a column in U.S. Camera for fifteen years. He was the son of sculptor Ralph Stackpole.|$|R
500|$|Cronjager filmed a dozen {{pictures}} {{during the}} first half of the 1950s, culminating in another Oscar nomination, his seventh and final, for 1954's Beneath the 12-Mile Reef, which featured his <b>underwater</b> <b>photography</b> using the [...] "Aquaflex", a French underwater camera, the first use of CinemaScope underwater. He lost again, this time to Loyal Griggs for his filmwork on Shane. [...] His color work on the location shooting for the 1953 film, Treasure of the Golden Condor, was lauded as stunning. In the remaining six years of his career, he would work on only five films, the fifth of which would be released after his death. In the late 1950s and 1960 he also worked on several television series, including Sea Hunt and Sam Peckinpah's The Westerner.|$|E
500|$|Robert Gottschalk founded Panavision in late 1953, in {{partnership}} with Richard Moore, Meredith Nicholson, Harry Eller, Walter Wallin, and William Mann; the company was formally incorporated in 1954. Panavision was established principally for the manufacture of anamorphic projection lenses to meet the growing demands of theaters showing CinemaScope films. At the time of Panavision's formation, Gottschalk owned a camera shop in Westwood Village, California, where many of his customers were cinematographers. [...] A few years earlier, he and Moore—who worked {{with him in the}} camera shop—were experimenting with underwater photography; Gottschalk became interested in the technology of anamorphic lenses, which allowed him to get a wider field of view from his underwater camera housing. The technology was created during World War I to increase the field of view on tank periscopes; the periscope image was horizontally [...] "squeezed" [...] by the anamorphic lens. After it was unsqueezed by a complementary anamorphic optical element, the tank operator could see double the horizontal field of view without significant distortion. Gottschalk and Moore bought some of these lenses from C. P. Goerz, a New York optics company, for use in their <b>underwater</b> <b>photography.</b> As widescreen filmmaking became popular, Gottschalk saw an opportunity to provide anamorphic lenses to the film industry—first for projectors, and then for cameras. Nicholson, a friend of Moore, started working as a cameraman on early tests of anamorphic photography.|$|E

5000|$|Recently, Dweck has {{revisited}} themes {{from his}} first two bodies of work, The End and Mermaids, to create customized surfboards emblazoned with black-and-white silhouette images of mermaids. Dweck {{describes himself as a}} casual surfer, and the boards are ridable as well as works of art. [...] The surfboards measure six feet and six inches in length and are handcrafted in California, where silk-screen prints of Dweck's photographs are coated with fiberglass and high-gloss resin to create what ArtDaily describes as “beautiful, handmade surfboard-shaped sculptures that seamlessly merge Dweck’s subject and medium.” [...] They are named after figures who have influenced Dweck's career, such as Harold [...] "Doc" [...] Edgerton, who developed techniques for <b>underwater</b> flash <b>photography</b> used extensively in Mermaids, and Duke Kahanamoku who is widely credited with popularizing the sport of surfing.

It is incorporated as a Guarantee Company Without Share Capital under the name 'Comhairle Fo-Thuinn - Irish Underwater Council'.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Utah but {{raised in}} Riverside, California, Boren was {{interested}} in both <b>underwater</b> diving and <b>photography.</b> He built his own helmet as a teenager and in 1943 {{became a member of}} the San Diego Bottom Scratchers Diving Club. Membership of the club required Boren to dive 30 feet, capture three abalone in one dive, grab a five-foot horn shark by the tail and bring up a [...] "good sized" [...] lobster. He constructed a case for his 16mm camera to film underwater and in 1952 built a 35mm underwater camera that led him to begin his feature film career shooting the undersea sequences for Underwater! (1955).|$|R

2500|$|Blake {{also contributed}} {{substantially}} {{to the field}} of <b>underwater</b> <b>photography.</b> In 1929, he purchased a Graflex camera from Duke Kahanamoku, then built a waterproof housing that allowed him to take photographs underwater or while surfing. Although it is often stated that Blake [...] "built the first underwater camera," [...] in fact, there had been sporadic attempts to do so since as early as 1856. Nonetheless, Blake’s innovations were significant, and a photo spread of his work that was published in 1935 in National Geographic magazine helped call attention to the potential his device offered.|$|E

5000|$|The {{movie was}} {{released}} in the US in 1969. Los Angeles Times called the film [...] "a rather formless and old fashioned display of sentimental heroics." [...] However the New York Times liked the film saying it:Has a surprise around every bend. Tightened and aimed a little more purposefully, this attractive French drama of two adventurer-pals and their lovely tag-along comrade, might have hit the jackpot. What it does have, under Robert Enrico's imaginative direction, is spontaneous flow, striking pictorial sweep and three people who become more credible and persuasive as the picture moves along... It is beautifully handled, with some superb color <b>photography</b> <b>underwater</b> and on shore, and a consistent air of fresh reality.
