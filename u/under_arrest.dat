5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not <b>under</b> <b>arrest,</b> could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many {{opposition}} figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe {{was sentenced to death}} in absentia and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held <b>under</b> <b>arrest</b> in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{reformed}} {{local government}} taxes by replacing domestic rates (a tax {{based on the}} nominal rental value of a home) with the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident. The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year, and proved {{to be among the}} most unpopular policies of her premiership. Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong demonstration in London on 31 March 1990; the demonstration around Trafalgar Square deteriorated into riots, leaving 113 people injured and 340 <b>under</b> <b>arrest.</b> The Community Charge was abolished in 1991 by her successor, John Major. It has since transpired that Thatcher had herself failed to register for the tax, and was threatened with financial penalties if she did not return her form.|$|E
