40|$|Calcium {{blockade}} versus ACE inhibition in clipped and <b>unclipped</b> kidneys of 2 K- 1 C rats. ACE inhibitors {{have been}} shown to worsen the kidney damage occurring distal to a renal artery stenosis. To determine if this effect was due to the decrease of arterial pressure or to an inhibition of the formation of angiotensin, we compared the effects of equihypotensive doses of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and a long-acting calcium antagonist (Ro 40 - 5967) in 2 K- 1 C rats. The rats were treated for five weeks with either enalapril, Ro 40 - 5967, or were left untreated. A group of sham operated rats was used as control. At the end of the five-week treatment period, proteinuria, plasma urea and creatinine were measured and quantitative morphometry of the clipped and <b>unclipped</b> kidneys was performed. Ro 40 - 5967, despite an absence of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, worsened the lesions of the clipped kidney to the same extent as enalapril. In contrast, the effects of both drugs on the <b>unclipped</b> kidney were different. Ro 40 - 5967, and not enalapril, increased the weight and the glomerular surface area of the <b>unclipped</b> kidney. Ro 40 - 5967 did not change the glomerulosclerosis index, which was improved by enalapril. In contrast with enalapril, Ro 40 - 5967 decreased plasma urea and creatinine concentrations. Only enalapril decreased proteinuria which originated from the <b>unclipped</b> kidney as shown by nephrectomy experiments. We conclude that during ACE inhibition the fall in renal perfusion pressure seems to be the main determinant of the renal damage distal to a renal artery stenosis, independently of a blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. However, pharmacological effects other than the decrease of arterial pressure {{play an important role in}} the <b>unclipped</b> kidney...|$|R

5000|$|Carabiners {{are also}} made {{specially}} for via ferratas, their design typically allowing a larger-than-normal opening {{and having a}} spring locking mechanism that can be opened with one hand. They are also strong enough to withstand high fall factors. Such carabiners are marked with a K in a circle, the K standing for Klettersteig, the German term for via ferrata. These are the only types of carabiner that should be used {{on the end of}} the safety lines. A typical design uses a spring-loaded sleeve on the carabiner gate. While the gate is closed, the sleeve is held in place over the gate opening by its spring; to unlock and open the gate, the sleeve slides directly down the gate shaft away from the opening. The ease of opening these devices makes them suitable for via ferrata climbing, with its constant clipping and <b>unclipping,</b> but not for applications where more secure locking mechanisms (automatic or manual) are called for. However, locking sleeves on via ferrata carabiners have been known to hang up in the gate opening and prevent the gate from closing properly. Care must be taken to maintain (clean and lubricate) and/or replace the carabiners as needed to avoid this potentially unsafe situation. Also, these carabiners are not true [...] "locking carabiners", as employed in roped climbing and caving systems, and should not be used as such.|$|E

5000|$|Quickdraws (often {{referred}} to as [...] "draws") are used by climbers to connect ropes to bolt anchors, or to other traditional protection, allowing the rope {{to move through the}} anchoring system with minimal friction. A quickdraw consists of two non-locking carabiners connected together by a short, pre-sewn loop of webbing. Alternatively, and quite regularly, the pre-sewn webbing is replaced by a sling of the above-mentioned dyneema/nylon webbing. This is usually of a 60 cm loop and can be tripled over between the carabiners to form a 20 cm loop. Then when more length is needed the sling can be turned back into a 60 cm loop offering more versatility than a pre-sewn loop. Carabiners used for clipping into the protection generally have a straight gate, decreasing the possibility of the carabiner accidentally <b>unclipping</b> from the protection. The carabiner into which the rope is clipped often has a bent gate, so that clipping the rope into this carabiner can be done quickly and easily. Quickdraws are also frequently used in indoor lead climbing. The quickdraw may be pre-attached to the wall. When a climber ascends the wall, (s)he must clip the rope through the quickdraw in order to maintain safety. The safest, easiest and most effective place to clip into a quickdraw is when it is at waist height.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Clipping {{the winter}} coat in horses {{is done to}} improve heat {{dissipation}} during exercise and make grooming easier. It is often combined with blanketing to keep the horse warm. The aims {{of the present study}} were to investigate how clipping and the use of blankets affect thermoregulation during exercise and recovery in horses. Methods One Gotland pony, one New Forest pony, and one warm-blooded horse exercised one after the other on a 6450 m long track. The horses walked, trotted and cantered according to a predetermined scheme, which took about 50 minutes including three stops. The scheme was repeated on five consecutive days when horses were: 1) <b>unclipped</b> 2) unclipped[*]+[*]blanket during recovery, 3) left or right side clipped, 4) clipped, and 5) clipped[*]+[*]riding blanket[*]+[*]blanket during recovery. Heart rate (HR) was measured with telemetry, respiratory rate (RR) by counting flank contractions, skin temperatures by thermistor probes, and rectal temperature with a digital thermometer. Skin wetness (SW) was estimated by ocular inspection (dripping[*]=[*] 5, dry[*]=[*] 0). Results Mean outdoor temperature varied from - 1. 1 to - 8. 7 Â°C. HR increased progressively during exercise with no difference between treatments. Maximum RR was 77 Â± 30 breaths/min (<b>unclipped)</b> and 49 Â± 27 breaths/min (clipped). The lowest skin temperature was 17. 5 Â± 2. 7 Â°C in a hind leg during exercise, which increased to 34. 5 Â± 0. 1 Â°C during recovery. Rectal temperature was elevated during recovery in <b>unclipped,</b> but not in clipped horses and skin temperature at base of tail was elevated during recovery except in <b>unclipped</b> horses without blanket. Moisture after exercise scored 3. 2 Â± 0. 8 in <b>unclipped</b> and zero in clipped horses. Discussion and conclusion Leg skin temperature initially dropped at onset of exercise in clipped horses, and then increased after about 30 minutes due to internal heat from the working muscles. These changes were not significant when clipped horses had riding blankets, whereas <b>unclipped</b> horses became overheated as judged from respiratory rate and elevated rectal temperature. Providing clipped horses with blankets dampened the changes in leg skin temperature during exercise. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The unusual {{appearance}} of the Parnall Imp was entirely due to its wings, for it was otherwise a conventional two-seat, single-engined biplane of its time. Harold Bolas stated that he designed them to be simple and to allow the best possible view from {{either of the two}} cockpits. The simplicity came from the complete absence of the rigging wires that braced conventional biplanes and needed constant attention. Instead, the Imp had a cantilever lower wing which had not only to support itself but also most of the forces on the upper wing. These lower wings were unswept and rectangular, with an aspect ratio of about 4.9, though the ailerons occupied the whole of the trailing edge and about 40% of the chord. Since as cantilevers they had to be internally braced, the airfoil section was fairly thick, a variation on RAF31. Rather than the usual (in Britain) double-spar and rib construction, Bolas used multiple spanwise stringers or false spars, with longitudinal formers or airfoil shaped ribs, the whole covered in stress-bearing spruce veneer. [...] This stressed skin chiefly carried the bending loads. The Imp was a single-bay biplane, with a single, strongly outward-leaning wide chord streamlined strut on each side, connecting the centre of the lower wing to the upper one. [...] Though the upper wing was not a cantilever, it was constructed {{in the same way as}} the lower and joined to the fuselage from below at mid wing with a pair of N-shaped cabane struts. This upper wing was also straight and parallel-edged, with the same chord as the lower one, but greater in span and strongly swept at about 14.5o. [...] As a result, the leading edge at the centre was above the engine bulkhead, and the trailing edge at the tips beyond and aft of those of the lower plane. With the assistance of a large cutout in the trailing edge, this arrangement provided a clear upward view from both cockpits.The wings did not fold, but two people could dismantle both sets in about two minutes, first <b>unclipping</b> the bottom of the interplane strut, folding it and unhooking the centre section from the cabane for each upper wing in turn. The absence of ailerons on the upper plane simplified this procedure. The lower wings could then be detached with the release of catches and the removal of pins.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY <b>Unclipping</b> the one-kidney, one-clip {{hypertensive}} rat {{during a}} {{free flow of}} urine caused the blood pressure to return to normal levels within about 3 hours. We found that administration of captopril plus <b>unclipping</b> caused the blood pressure to return to normal in minutes (17 Â± 4). Ureterocaval anastomosis plus captopril plus <b>unclipping</b> also caused the blood pressure to return to normal in minutes (8. 8 Â± 2). Thus, the potentiation of the drop in blood pressure {{does not seem to}} be due to a volume effect. Administration of indomethacin and aprotinin did not prevent a rapid decline of the blood pressure after <b>unclipping,</b> but the decline was less rapid than that occurring after captopril and <b>unclipping,</b> which suggests that prostaglandin may have some effect on this mechanism. Saralasin administration did not potentiate the antihypertensive action of captopril plus <b>unclipping.</b> Chemical papillectomy prevented the drop in blood pressure after <b>unclipping.</b> The bolus dose of captopril to the hypertensive rat often caused a transient depressor effect resembling that due to the antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid, which suggests secretion of this lipid into the blood. The renomedullary interstitial cells accumulated large lipid granules after captopril administration.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{in this thesis}} were designed {{to examine the effects}} of surgical reversal of 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertension on baroreflexes and vascular capacitance. In the first set of experiments, baroreflex function was studied using a 'steady state' technique in conscious early phase 2 -kidney, 1 -clip rats before and 24 hours after surgical reversal of hypertension by <b>unclipping</b> or after pharmacological reduction of blood pressure by an infusion of hydralazine or captopril. A further group was studied 3 weeks after <b>unclipping.</b> With reduction of the blood pressure, the baroreflex was reset within 24 hours, irrespective of the method of blood pressure reduction, the degree of resetting being dependant on the level of blood pressure achieved. This resetting occurs without a change in baroreflex sensitivity. However, at 3 weeks after <b>unclipping,</b> the baroreflex sensitivity had returned to normal. In the second set of experiments, vascular capacitance was studied in conscious 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertensive rats and sham-clipped controls. Two further groups of 2 -kidney, 1 -clip rats were studied before and 6 hours after <b>unclipping</b> or a sham operation. Mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) was measured during a brief circulatory arrest by inflation of a right atrial balloon. Blood volume (BV) was measured by a radioisotopic dilution method and vascular compliance derived from the MCFP-BV curve. There was reduced vascular capacity in 2 -kidney, 1 -clip hypertension. Within 6 hours of <b>unclipping,</b> there was a marked reduction in mean circulatory filling pressure, with no change in blood volume or compliance, indicting a rapid increase in vascular capacity and reduction in venous tone. The third set of experiments explored the possible contribution of the renomedullary vasodepressor mechanisms to changes in vascular capacitance The model of chemical renal medullary damage secondary to bromoethylamine was used.

40|$|Increased {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} activity has been demonstrated in established one-kidney one-clip hypertension in the rat. We have found that renal denervation in this model results in an attenuation of hypertension, unassociated with alterations in sodium or water balance or renin activity. To determine whether the depressor effect of renal denervation is associated with changes in peripheral {{sympathetic nervous system}} activity, sham operation (n = 12), renal denervation (n = 13), or <b>unclipping</b> (n = 13) was carried out 2 wk after the onset of one-kidney one-clip hypertension. Normotensive unine-phrectomized age- and sex-matched rats were used as controls (n = 14). Renal denervation resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} systolic blood pressure (201 Â± 7 to 151 Â± 6 mm Hg), while <b>unclipping</b> lowered systolic blood pressure to normotensive levels (130 Â± 6 mm Hg). 8 d after operation plasma norepinephrine and mean arterial pressure before and after ganglionic blockade with 30 mg/kg hexamethonium bromide were measured in conscious, unrestrained, resting animals, as indices of peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly higher in hypertensive sham-operated rats (422 Â± 42 pg/ml) compared with normotensive controls (282 Â± 25 pg/ml) (P < 0. 01). Both renal denervation and <b>unclipping</b> restored plasma norepinephrine to normal levels (273 Â± 22 and 294 Â± 24 pg/ml, respectively). Ganglionic blockade in hypertensive sham-operated animals resulted in a significantly greater decrease in mean arterial pressure than occurred in renal denervated, unclipped, or control rats. The data suggest that the depressor effect of renal denervation or <b>unclipping</b> in the one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rat is associated with a decrease in peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{antihypertensive}} neutral renomedullary lipid, {{derived from}} the renal papilla, causes a vasodepressor effect when injected into a peripheral vein, such as the inferior vena cava, after a lag period of 1 to 2 minutes. The blood pressure tracing is skewed (cuplike effect). The lag period is significantly reduced after injection of the antihypertensive lipid into the portal vein. The vasodepres-sor configuration (cuplike) is the same whether the lipid is injected into the vena cava or portal vein. Removal of the liver from the circulation prevents the depressor effect. Thus, passage through the liver is essential for antihypertensive lipid activity. Renoportal shunting of blood potentiates the antihypertensive function of the kidney after <b>unclipping</b> in the one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rat. Lack of a hepatic circulation prevents the antihypertensive function of the kidney after <b>unclipping.</b> Antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid and the renal venous effluent after <b>unclipping</b> have the same biological behavior. We conclude that antihypertensive neutral renomedullary lipid is a promol-ecule, the putative prohormone of the renal papilla and its renomedullary interstitial cells. The liver converts the antihypertensive prohormone of the kidney to an active antihypertensive substance. A renohepatic axis of blood pressure control appears to exist.

40|$|SUMMARY One-kidney, one clip (1 K 1 C) {{hypertension}} {{is often}} associated with an expanded plasma volume and (once the arterial clip is removed) with natriuresis. Blood pressure (BP), atrial and plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor (AND, hematocrit, and renal glomerular ANF receptors were therefore studied in 1 K 1 C rats and in their normotensive uninephrectomized controls before and after <b>unclipping.</b> Six hours after removal of the clip, BP was normal in the 1 K 1 C group and plasma ANF presented a sharp decline but was still significantly higher than in the normotensive controls, with a slight difference being evident 24 hours after <b>unclipping.</b> Hematocrit was lower in the 1 K 1 C rats than in their control counterparts, but this difference tended to disappear once the clip was removed, indicating a contraction of plasma volume in these undipped 1 K 1 C animals. The renal glomerular ANF receptor population was markedly smaller in 1 K 1 C rats than in the uninephrecto-mized controls but showed a twofold increase in number and affinity 24 hours after <b>unclipping.</b> It is concluded that the up-regulation and enhanced affinity of glomerular ANF receptors (probably secondary to the decrease in plasma levels of ANF) may contribute to the natriuresis reported in hypertensive 1 K 1 C animals on removal of the arterial clip.
