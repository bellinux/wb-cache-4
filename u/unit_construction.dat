25|$|Rover {{supplied}} 499cc {{single cylinder}} motorcycles to the Russian Army during the First World War. The company {{began to focus}} on car production {{at the end of the}} war, but Rover still produced motorcycles with 248cc and 348cc Rover overhead valve engines and with JAP engines, including a 676cc V-twin. In 1924 Rover introduced a new lightweight 250cc motorcycle with <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> of engine and gearbox. This had lights front and rear as well as a new design of internal expanding brakes.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a center front crankcase, a center rear gearbox, a right side cavity {{gearcase}} [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row primary drive chain. A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the cam timing, and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the rocker arms.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>construction</b> {{since its}} {{introduction}} has defined {{the development of}} the modern kitchen. Pre-manufactured modules, using mass manufacturing techniques developed during World War II, greatly brought down the cost of a kitchen. Units which are kept on the floor are called [...] "floor units", [...] "floor cabinets", or [...] "base cabinets" [...] on which a kitchen worktop – originally often formica and often now made of granite, marble, tile or wood – is placed. The units which are held on the wall for storage purposes are termed as [...] "wall units" [...] or [...] "wall cabinets". In small areas of kitchen in an apartment, even a [...] "tall storage unit" [...] is available for effective storage. In cheaper brands, all cabinets are kept a uniform color, normally white, with interchangeable doors and accessories chosen by the customer to give a varied look. In more expensive brands, the cabinets are produced matching the doors' colors and finishes, for an older more bespoke look.|$|E

2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> three-speed {{manual gearbox}} without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
