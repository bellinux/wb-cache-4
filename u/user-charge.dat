40|$|The major Shuttle-related testing {{currently}} in progress includes: static testing of all major elements, full scale ground vibration testing, {{main propulsion system}} testing, software verification and validation, qualification testing of many components and subsystems, and SSME verification testing. This paper reviews {{the current status of}} the Shuttle program and gives attention to the transition to operations, near-term traffic plans, <b>user-charge</b> policies, and payload integration. It is concluded that the transition from individual space-research projects to a fully integrated Space Transportation System, providing low-cost routine access to space for many users, involves a complete rethinking of the role NASA and the user will play...|$|E
40|$|This work derives an {{effluent}} taxation {{structure for}} meeting a specified level of regional environmental quality. It is {{demonstrated that the}} nonlinearity of the proposed charge scheme flaunts equilibrium results identical to linear <b>user-charge</b> programs but elicits superior dynamic characteristics. Moreover, {{through the use of}} an iterative stimulus-response algorithm we are able to minimize the technical information transfer among sectors by mapping response surfaces for polluter behavior. These continuously updated response patterns are then used to guide the system to a social optimum. Recognizing that the optimal allocation of environmental resources {{is likely to be a}} vacillating target, and that the existence of adjustment lags must be reckoned with in any operational context, we argue that meaningful policing of environmental quality will require the nonlinear taxation approach. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to provide a theoretical framework for future commercial vehicle <b>user-charging</b> using real-time vehicle weight and configuration information collected using weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems. This work provides an extensive review of both mechanisms and technologies employed for commercial and passenger vehicle <b>user-charging</b> worldwide. Existing commercial vehicle-user charging structures use only broad vehicle classifications to distinguish between vehicles for the pricing of user-fees. The methodology proposed in this study employs highway cost allocation methods for development of an “Axle-Load ” toll structure. A theoretical case study, based on information from Texas State Highway 130, is performed to explore the equity improvements that could be achieved through implementation of this proposed structure. Some sensitivity analysis is also performed to examine the potential revenue impacts due to uncertainties in different data inputs under existing and propose...|$|R
40|$|This article proposes using a {{flexible}} price system to allocate computer {{time and to}} determine charges for computer users. The proposal {{is presented in the}} context of a central university computing center (UCC) although it may be applicable, with some modifications, to a wide range of queueing problems. At present, <b>user-charges</b> in most UCC's are based on average costs with little or no attention to speed of service. This leads to high charges and under-utilization when there is excess capacity, low charges and long queues when capacity is short, and to other problems. Under the proposed fiexible price systems, <b>user-charges</b> are dynamically determined by overall system demand and by user selected turn-around priority. The complexity of the price system can be varied to meet the needs of a particular instillation. The main reason for proposing flexible pricing for computer service is that this approach is consistent with an efficient use of scarce resources, including both the computer and users' time. This conclusion is justified in terms of a formal economic analysis which also serves to clarify the conditions under which revenue from {{a flexible}} pricing system would cover the full costs of the computer installation. The pricing of specialized computer hardware and software is also discussed. Finally, consideration is given to possible applications of fiexible pricing to other problems that have traditionidly been discussed in terms of queueing theory. ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{charging}} is {{a technique}} of transmitting power through an air gap to an electrical device {{for the purpose of}} energy replenishment. Recently, the wireless charging technology has been significantly advanced in terms of efficiency and functionality. This article first presents an overview and fundamentals of wireless charging. We then provide the review of standards, i. e., Qi and Alliance for Wireless Power (A 4 WP), and highlight on their communication protocols. Next, we propose a novel concept of wireless charger networking which allows chargers to be connected to facilitate information collection and control. We demonstrate the application of the wireless charger network in <b>user-charger</b> assignment, which clearly shows the benefit in terms of reduced cost for users to identify the best chargers to replenish energy for their mobile devices...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand {{government}} {{introduced a}} Primary Health Care Strategy (PHCS) in 2001 {{aimed at improving}} access to primary health care, improving health, and reducing inequalities in health. The Strategy represented a substantive increase in health funding by government and a move from a targeted to a universal funding model. This paper uses representative national survey data to examine the distribution of fees paid for primary health care by different individuals under the mixed public-private financing model in place prior {{to the introduction of}} PHCS. Using multivariate regression analysis, we find that fees do vary, with people who might be expected to have greater needs paying less. However, apart from people with diabetes, there is no direct link between self-reported health status and fees paid. The findings indicate that a mixed public-private financing model can result in a fee structure which recognises differences across different population groups. The findings also provide a baseline against which changes in funding brought about by the PHCS can be evaluated.

40|$|Transport is a {{key factor}} for {{economic}} growth. It has enabled both the economic scale of production {{and an increase in}} competition. No one can question this role of transportation. There is, however, a back-side to the coin: the environmental challenge. Present trends show that transportation is not compatible with sustainable development. The need to internalise the external effects from trans-portation has been well documented during the last decade, i. e. the traditional ‘command and control’ approach should be supplemented, where appropriate, by economic and fiscal measures. This is the philosophy of Swedish transport policy since 1988, which states that traffic user-charges for road- and rail traffic should include explicit charges for the external effects of traffic accidents, air pollution, climate change, and noise. The total social costs for road- and rail transportation, in the form of traffic accidents, air pollution, and noise, amounted to 4. 2 % of GNP in 1995. The external costs for 1995 amount to 8. 9 billion SEK for road traffic and 0. 3 billion SEK for rail traffic. The total transportation for road traffic is, however, higher than for the railway. Accordingly, for traffic in its entirety the external effects in relation to the traffic work are nearly 6 times higher for road traffic than for railway traffic. The thesis analyses existing taxes and user-charges in order to internalize the external effects in transportation. One of the conclusions is that diesel-driven road vehicles pay considerably less of their socio-economic costs in comparison to petrol-driven vehicles. Also, the difference between the external costs for different diesel vehicles is much too great for one to be able to apply a uniform fuel charge. Only a <b>user-charge</b> system based on variable vehicle-related charges (such as the earlier kilometer tax) can attain an appropriate internalization of the external effects. In general, the conclusion is that fuel taxes are too blunt as steering instruments. The optimal fuel taxes and train-kilometer taxes, etc. vary with a factor of up to ten and more between different vehicles and modes of traffic, so that they correspond to the external costs with a low degree of preciseness. Even if sufficient knowledge exists about the costs and evaluations of external effects in transportation, there is an inertia in the process of implementing necessary measures to cope with the external effects of transportation. It is difficult to gain broad acceptance about the necessity for increasing fuel taxes, for example. In order to overcome the barriers and roadblocks impeding the pursuit of sustainable transportation, it is necessary to consider the following three claims on externality charges: they must be explicit, which means that current petrol taxes must be substituted for traffic accident charges, air pollution charges, etc; they must be distinguished from taxes, which implies, for example, that a reduction of speed limits is coupled to a reduction of petrol price through a reduced traffic accident charge; they must be generally adopted, which means that the charges are not only implemented for externalities in transportation but applied to all other sectors...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} the incidence and progressivity of Vietnamese state income transfers using survey {{data from the}} Vietnamese Household Living Standards Survey 2004. Data quality and sample selection issues are highlighted, especially in the coverage of rural-urban migrants. Simple income-based profiles of incidence are matched to several influences that confound and complicate the measurement of progressivity. The issue of the informal economy is highlighted through analysis of both the extent of private inter-household transfers and remittances and their relationship with state transfers, and in the informal charges that accompany uptake of state services and other petty corruption. Second, the issue of <b>user-charges</b> for health and education services is considered, as a considerable portion of state transfers {{are related to the}} take up of schooling and health care. Third, the issue of behavioral effects is also considered, concentrating on private interhousehold transfers. The paper concludes by drawing together the evidence and the obstacles to measurement and progressivity to argue a range of data collection, methodological and policy recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The Baltic countries’ {{local governments}} have been functioned {{during the last decade}} in a {{permanently}} changing environment. Like other transition countries, they inherited from the past extremely centralized administrative system. Along with radical reforms, administrative system was decentralized and various functions were devolved from central to lower levels of government. Despite that, municipalities are still fiscally strongly dependent from central authorities. Often their fiscal capacity is not adequate to act in accordance with functions stipulated by laws. Many local governments’ revenues from taxes and <b>user-charges</b> are insufficient to finance efficiently their expenditures. Disparities in municipalities’ fiscal situation are correlated with unbalanced regional growth, social degradation in the low-income regions and growing differentiation by municipalities’ residents on access to education and healthcare. Membership of the European Union brings new tasks and responsibilities for the Baltic local governments. Municipalities should increase their economic sustainability and enhance administrative capacity to explore EU accession funds and implement EU policies. Considering the above-mentioned problems, the paper focuses on current fiscal situation of local governments in the Baltic countries. The main interest is to analyze local municipalities’ revenue level and structure, expenditure composition and fiscal autonomy conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} a broad {{cross-section of}} regulatory problems in local government and puts forward key principles for regulatory reform. Regulatory problems are identified and discussed at two levels: The first {{is at the}} process stage where key problems include the inability to effectively identify regulatory objectives, the lack of consideration of non-regulatory alternatives, poor stakeholder participation and the general lack of awareness {{of the importance of}} internalizing cost-benefit analysis into policy process. The second is the product of the policy process, namely the use of specific regulatory or fiscal instruments that negatively impact upon business, such inappropriately priced and targeted <b>user-charges,</b> trade and competition distorting taxes and charges, as well regulations that crowd-out private sector participation and/or discriminate against outsiders. Decentralization is not the main cause of regulatory problems in the regions, but does present new problems and challenges, most notably those associated with the pressure to raise own-source revenues and the new, yet problematic institutional arrangements governing the supervision of local regulations. Equally if not more important is the opportunity that decentralization brings to improve economic governance through regulatory reform. The regions should assume greater responsibility in analyzing and justifying the regulatory impact of proposed legislation, allowing the provinces to play {{a more active role in}} supervising lower level local regulations and in overseeing the development and standardization of the regulatory review process, and usin...|$|R
40|$|Policy-makers are {{increasingly}} considering charging users different fees between {{primary and secondary}} care (differential user charges) to encourage utilisation of primary health care in health systems with limited gate keeping. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the impact of introducing differential user charges on service utilisation. We reviewed studies published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, EconLIT, HMIC, and WHO library databases from January 1990 until June 2015. We extracted data from the studies meeting defined eligibility criteria and assessed study quality using an established checklist. We synthesized evidence narratively. Eight studies from six countries met our eligibility criteria. The overall study quality was low, with diversity in populations, interventions, settings, and methods. Five studies examined the introduction of or increase in user charges for secondary care, with four showing decreased secondary care utilisation, and three showing increased primary care utilisation. One study identified an increase in primary care utilisation after primary care user charges were reduced. The introduction of a non-referral charge in secondary care was associated with lower primary care utilisation in one study. One study compared user charges across insurance plans, associating higher charges in secondary care with higher utilisation in both primary and secondary care. Overall, the impact of introducing differential <b>user-charges</b> on primary care utilisation remains uncertain. Further research is required to understand their impact as a demand side intervention, including implications for health system costs and on utilisation among low-income patients...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{the assets}} of older people is a common and {{potentially}} complex task of informal care with legal, financial, cultural, political and family dimensions. Older people are increasingly recognised as having significant assets, but the family, the state, service providers and the market have competing interests in their use. Increased policy interest in self-provision and <b>user-charges</b> for services underline the importance of asset management in protecting the current and future health, care and accommodation choices of older people. Although ‘minding the money’ has generally been included as an informal care-giving task, there is limited recognition of either its growing importance and complexity or of care-givers' involvement. The focus of both policy and practice have been primarily on substitute decision-making and abuse. This paper reports an Australian national survey and semi-structured interviews that have explored the prevalence of non-professional involvement in asset management. The findings reveal {{the nature and extent}} of involvement, the tasks that informal carers take on, the management processes that they use, and that ‘minding the money’ is a common informal care task and mostly undertaken in the private sphere using some risky practices. Assisting informal care-givers with asset management and protecting older people from financial risks and abuse require various strategic policy and practice responses that extend beyond substitute decision-making legislation. Policies and programmes are required: to increase the awareness of the tasks, tensions and practices surrounding asset management; to improve the financial literacy of older people, their informal care-givers and service providers; to ensure access to information, advice and support services; and to develop better accountability practices. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{does not}} deny the World Bank’s effort in getting water {{management}} right in developing countries. It, however, raises some concerns with the Bank’s water policies that may have undesirable impact on poor people’s access to water and livelihoods on the ground. It unpacks the assumptions of the ideas, such as community participation, decentralisation, <b>user-charging,</b> good governance and strict rule enforcement. It suggests that poor people may have to bear disproportionately high costs if these policies do not work. Particularly, this paper challenges the Bank’s water model which assumes that water users are rational and opportunistic and inadequately considers the complexity of human motivations and structural forces in shaping effective water governance. The economic understanding of institutions and the over-emphasising of laws, regulations and formal groups, plays down the role of socially-embedded institutions in influencing water-user behaviour. It draws on examples and case studies of the water sector in developing countries and underlines the importance of building a more socially-informed model by incorporating human values into water governance and seeking {{a deeper understanding of}} social context and cultural diversity. This paper highlights the needs to achieve water sustainability, without compromising poor people’s social networks and livelihoods of the poor. This paper lays out five principles that matter to the success of water interventions: (1) history and culture of social relations; (2) existing relations of cooperation that shape water participation; (3) people’s livelihood priorities; (4) individuals’ preferred institutional environment; (5) the interlay between new and old institutions that channels that people can get access to resources and exercise agency...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} approaches {{to health care}} seeking and financing by households living in communities in two poor rural districts of Uganda. It seeks to explore differences {{in the choice of}} provider and methods of funding care between the two districts, and the economic circumstances and social attitudes which influence these differences. It considers the impact on households budgets of health care charges, both at public facilities (licit and illicit) and by private sector providers. Qualitative fieldwork was used to determine attitudes to the introduction of user charges, {{the extent to which they}} have influenced health care seeking behaviour and whether attempts by households to find sustainable coping strategies, either individually or through community organisations, have been successful in ensuring adequate health care for all their members. The research raised issues as to the appropriate definition of utilisation of services in circumstances where profession staff are often substituted by 'assistants' and drugs are frequently prescribed in public facilities but then have to be purchased from private suppliers. It stresses the relative autonomy of facility staff and constraints on effective supervision. Under these circumstances there is room for considerable confusion between sanctioned <b>user-charges</b> and illicit demands by providers. Many households face difficulties with what they see as a multiplicity of demands for cash payments, of which education and health charges are a major component. Community organisations do not appear to make a major direct contribution to meeting such charges. However, community based savings and credit societies, where they exist, appear to play a central role in overcoming seasonal fluctuations in cash availability. Making these more accessible to poor households or developing effective and sustainable systems for providing services on credit might alleviate current problems...|$|R
