40|$|A {{comprehensive}} methodology {{to physically}} and numerically model <b>upsetting</b> in cold <b>heading</b> was developed. The physical model was a Drop Weight Test with a guided pocket-die set capable of approximating industrial cold heading conditions. The {{results show that}} the test is sensitive to the critical parameters for cold heading. These include surface quality, residual element level, nitrogen content, microstructure, decarburization, and specimen geometry. The test is capable of assessing the fracture behavior of cold heading materials. One goal {{of the study was to}} reveal differences in fracture behavior with varying steel sources. Accordingly, the matrix of test materials consisted of grade 1038 steels from three different steel sources. Material preparation and conditioning of test materials approximated industrial procedures for cold heading materials. These procedures included hot rolling, controlled rod cooling, descaling, straightening, lime coating and lubricating, and wire drawing. Spheroidization of test specimens was performed in an industrial batch furnace using an industrial heat treatment cycle. A finite element program (FEM) enabled the simulation of <b>upsetting</b> in cold <b>heading.</b> The inputs required to model the cold heading process include flow stress behavior and friction conditions representative of cold heading. These inputs were obtained using the CANMET Cam Plastometer and the Friction Ring Test. The Cockcroft and Latham fracture constants for an as-rolled and a spheroidize annealed 1038 material were computed by FEM modeling and the critical values were calibrated using the Drop Weight Test. The fracture criterion constant was found to be independent of strain path for <b>upsetting</b> in cold <b>heading</b> and thus is material-related...|$|R

This study aims to investigate the effect of friction in cold forging operations using different friction models. In the analyses, the forging operations are simulated using the Coulomb and con-stant friction models, {{and the results are}} compared with the simulation results obtained by using the variable friction models developed by Wanheim–Bay (general friction model) and Levanov, which are integrated into the program. Cylinder <b>upsetting</b> and bolt <b>head</b> forging are numerically simulated and the cylinder upsetting results are compared with the experimental data. The results showed that depending on the workpiece geometry and the contact pressure, the coefficient of friction may change significantly during the process and the constant coefficient of friction may not simulate the actual friction condition in the cold forging process...|$|R
50|$|The Society was <b>upset</b> at the <b>Head</b> Tax {{imposed on}} them by the Port Moresby Administration, believing they weren't getting {{their fair share of}} the {{benefits}} from the tax. As a group, the Society vowed to pay the tax to their own organisation, rather than the Port Moresby Administration. The Port Moresby Administration responded in February 1962. They recruited 500 police officers from throughout Papau New Guinea. When the police officers were flown to Buka, they faced off against a crowd of 1,000 Society members, including men, women, and children. The ensuing confrontation ended with the injury of 40 Society followers and 25 police officers, as well as the arrests of Teosin, Hagai, and nearly 600 Society members. Following the mass arrest, many supporters were released on appeal, after which the Society agreed to begin paying the tax again. Tensions eased at that point, and the government left the Society alone afterward.|$|R
