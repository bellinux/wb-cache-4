40|$|A {{major problem}} of mobile agents is their {{inability}} to authenticate transactions in a hostile environment. Users will not wish to equip agents with their private signature keys when the agents may execute on untrusted platforms. <b>Undetachable</b> signatures were introduced {{to solve this problem}} by allowing users to equip agents with the means to sign signatures for tightly constrained transactions, using information especially derived from the user private signature key. However, the problem remains that a platform can force an agent to commit to a sub-optimal transaction. In parallel with the work on <b>undetachable</b> signatures, much work has been performed on threshold signature schemes, which allow signing power to be distributed across multiple agents, thereby reducing the trust in a single entity. We combine these notions and introduce the concept of an <b>undetachable</b> threshold signature scheme, which enables constrained signing power to be distributed across multiple agents, thus reducing the necessary trust in single agent platforms. We also provide an RSA-based example of such a scheme based on a combination of Shoup's threshold signature scheme, [7] and Kotzanikolaou et al's <b>undetachable</b> signature scheme, [3]...|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{security}} of both the customers’ hosts and the eShops’ servers, we introduce {{the idea of a}} key-insulated <b>undetachable</b> digital signature, enabling mobile agents to generate <b>undetachable</b> digital signatures on remote hosts with the key-insulated property of the original signer’s signing key. From the theoretical perspective, we provide the formal definition and security notion of a key-insulated <b>undetachable</b> digital signature. From the practical perspective, we propose a concrete scheme to secure mobile agents in electronic commerce. The scheme is mainly focused on protecting the signing key from leakage and preventing the misuse of the signature algorithm on malicious servers. Agents do not carry the signing key when they generate digital signatures on behalf of the original signer, so the key is protected on remote servers. Furthermore, if a hacker gains the signing key of the original signer, the hacker is still unable to forge a signature for any time period other than the key being accessed. In addition, the encrypted function is combined with the original signer’s requirement to prevent the misuse of signing algorithm. The scheme is constructed on gap Diffie–Hellman groups with provable security, and the performance testing indicates that the scheme is efficient...|$|E
40|$|It is {{expected}} that mobile agent will be widely used for electronic commerce as an important key technology. If a mobile agent can sign a message in a remote server {{on behalf of a}} customer without exposing his/her private key, it can be used not only to search for special products or services, but also to make a contract with a remote server. To construct mobile agents, [KBC 00] used an RSA-based <b>undetachable</b> signature scheme, but it does not provide server's non-repudiation because the <b>undetachable</b> signature does not contain server's signature. Mobile agent is a very good application example of proxy signature, and the <b>undetachable</b> signature can be considered as an example of proxy signature. In this paper we show that secure mobile agent can be constructed using strong non-designated proxy signature [LKK 01] which represents both the original signer's (customer) and the proxy signer's (remote server) signatures. We provide RSA-based and Schnorr-based constructions of secure mobile agent, and moreover we show that the Schnorr-based scheme can be used very eciently in multi-proxy mobile agent situation.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{security}} in multi-agent systems for mobile communication. Mobile {{as well as}} non-mobile agent technology is addressed. A general security analysis based on properties of agents and multi-agent systems is presented along with an overview of security measures applicable to multi-agent systems, and in particular to mobile agent systems. A security architecture, designed for deployment of agent technology in a mobile communication environment, is presented. The security architecture allows modelling of interactions at all levels within a mobile communication system. This architecture is {{used as the basis}} for describing security services and mechanisms for a multi-agent system. It is shown how security mechanisms {{can be used in a}}n agent system, with emphasis on secure agent communication. Mobile agents are vulnerable to attacks from the hosts on which they are executing. Two methods for dealing with threats posed by malicious hosts to a trading agent are presented. The rst approach uses a threshold scheme and multiple mobile agents to minimise the eect of malicious hosts. The second introduces trusted nodes into the infrastructure. <b>Undetachable</b> signatures have been proposed as a way to limit the damage a malicious host can do by misusing a signature key carried by a mobile agent. This thesis proposes an alternative scheme based on conventional signatures and public key certicates. Threshold signatures can be used in a mobile agent scenario to spread the risk between several agents and thereby overcome the threats posed by individual malicious hosts. An alternative to threshold signatures, based on conventional signatures, achieving comparable security guarantees with potential practical advantages compared to a threshold scheme is proposed in this thesis. <b>Undetachable</b> signatures and threshold signatures are both concepts applicable to mobile agents. This thesis proposes a technique combining the two schemes to achieve <b>undetachable</b> threshold signatures. This thesis denes the concept of certicate translation, which allows an agent to have one certicate translated into another format if so required, and thereby save storage space as well as being able to cope with a certicate format not foreseen at the time the agent was created...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Davidson’s {{anomalous}} monism, {{his argument}} for the identity between mental and physical event tokens, has been frequently attacked, usually demanding {{a higher degree of}} physicalist commitment. My objection runs in the opposite direction: the identities inferred by Davidson from mental causation, the nomological character of causality and the anomaly of the mental are philosophically problematic and, more dramatically, incompatible with his famous argument against the third dogma of empiricism, the separation of content from conceptual scheme. Given the anomaly of the mental and the absence of psychophysical laws, there are no conceptual resources to relate mental and physical predicates. We fall in the third dogma if we claim that the very same token event is mental and physical. One of the premises must be rejected: I will claim that we do not need a law to subsume cause and effect to be entitled to speak of causation. Davidson has never offered an argument to back this premise. Against such a dogma I will sketch some ideas pointing towards a different conception of causality, singularist and <b>undetachable</b> from explanatory practices. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of Spanish periphrastic passive constructions in a corpus of written-press and radio {{discourse}} from a Peninsular town. Their statistical patterning and their contextual effects are analyzed {{across a variety of}} textual genres and speaker socioprofessional groups within the domain of the media. The construction turns out to be more frequent as discourse approaches the prototype of written, informational communication, such as in press news items and radio news reports, {{as well as in the}} speech of journalists and broadcasters. A relationship is then hypothesized between such distribution and the inherent discursive meaning of the passive. Its basic motivation appears to be the enhancement of the salience of a semantic patient by placing it in the position of the clause subject, which is parallel to a notional blurring of the agent. This largely explains the usual occurrence of passive constructions across informational discourse dealing with external third-person referents, as well as their association with the speech of the socioprofessional groups that most often produce such kind of discourse. It is concluded that the patterns of variation found among social groups and situations are <b>undetachable</b> from the discursive meanings generated by linguistic choices. </p...|$|E

The internal energy increases during the fusion welding especially in the heat affected places around the welded joint, which become initiating spot of corrosion degradation. The aim of the experiment is to put a welded joint produced by the MAG method to a test of corrosion degradation under the conditions of the norm ČSN ISO 9227 (salt-spray test). Organic and inorganic anticorrosion protections were applied on welded beads. First of all, there were prepared welded beads using the method MAG; secondly, metallographical analyses of welded metal, heat affected places and base material were processed. Further, microhardness as well as analysis of chemical composition using the EDS microscope were analysed. Based on a current trend in anticorrosion protections, there were chosen three types of protective coatings. First protective system was a double-layer synthetic system, where the base layer is formed by paint Pragroprimer S 2000 and the upper layer by finishing paint Industrol S 2013. Second protective system is a duplex system formed by a combination of a base zinc coating with Zinorex paint. The last protective system was formed by zinc dipping only. Corrosion resistance of the individual tested samples was evaluated based on degradation of protective coating.

This research wishes to show how Nietzsche responds to existing understanding on traditional morality, which to him {{is no more than a}} kind of slave morality. Nietzsche, with his own view on morality is basically orbiting to one of his main theses, Will to Power (der Wille zur Macht); other morality related concerns like self and self-interest are also <b>undetachable</b> to this Will to Power. Within the context of traditional morality, thing like self-interest is considered taboo in contrast with altruistic behaviour (self-less behaviour by emphasizing concerns to others).

40|$|This is theatre. It {{may sound}} trite {{to say that}} when one of the actors pukes a mouthful of water over a member of the {{audience}} (his reaction for me was part of the performance!) you know you are not in a cinema but there is something so utterly physical and <b>undetachable</b> about the experience of having the arguments in your face, of having actors simulate buggery three feet from you that speaks to a deeper engagement. That deeper engagement is a moral one. In a cinema, the audience‟s experience is essentially a passive one. What the audience sees on the screen and how they see it has already been decided by the director. There is nothing creative about the experience and hence nothing moral. David Rabey is a subtle director. By which I mean that he doesn‟t use the event of his play to show off his talents but instead uses it to get the actors to reveal the arguments. If there is a space between the audience and the action in the play – and here there is not much! – it‟s one that‟s fraught with the arguments of the piece and we are engaged creatively and morally with those arguments. In cinema, the space between the audience and the screen, apart from the dust particles caught in the projector‟s light, is empty.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} research considers {{the difficulties that}} are associated with understanding market knowledge in a micro firm. The majority of micro firms gain their rewards from mutual beneficial exchange with their customers. The focus of this mutual exchange is often the product that is the basis of their business. The gaining of new customers is often difficult and requires a considerable degree of effort. The standard business approach is to apply cognitive rationality to this task. Some businesses succeed with this approach, but it is possible that other approaches might reveal a greater understanding of the small business situation. Research suggests that small business owners/managers develop tacit utilitarian, cognitively immediate and <b>undetachable</b> knowledge. In a developing business this is contingent with the entrepreneurial task. It can usefully be conjectured that this task is related to the introduction of new business areas. The entrepreneurial task can be seen as involving a qualitative introduction of new business into a market that has not existed before. The situational interplay of these two factors is investigated using a phenomenological research method and deep analysis of a small number of interviews. This research has found evidence that the development of market knowledge in a micro business can result from a leap into a new engagement. The possible grounding for such a leap is explored {{in the light of the}} philosophy of Heidegger which is noted for the exploration of being and time. He adopted hermeneutic and phenomenological approaches to discuss the leap into the grounding question of being. This leap into a new engagement requires a break from the content but not the methods of small business understanding and can be enabled by the developing attunement of the business owner. This is a different method of investigating the nature of market development in the small business. It is expected that this work will be found to be of value when undertaking further research in this type of business situation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Tawhid (the {{belief in}} transcendent oneness or unity of divinity) is the {{culmination}} of all Islamic teachings and has a special place in Islamic sciences. The unity of essence begins by the unity of existential necessity and ends in unity of existence as many theosophers and mystics suggest. This essay discusses unity of essence as understood by two Sadraean thinkers (Hakim Mudarres Zunuzi and Banu Amin) according to Mulla Sadra&# 39;s principles. Undoubtedly, these two theosophers have no discord as far as they speak about necessity of existence and unity of Necessary Existence. Dispute erupts when Banu voices her Sadraean sympathy with transcendent oneness of existence while Mudarres takes another position.       According to Sadra, the being which has no limitation whatsoever leaves no room for other being to come into existence and be its second or third and thus it is unique and uncountable. In this world, thus, there is no existence but one of which the rest are manifestations (Mulla Sadra, 1382, 67). This view which has been mentioned by Sadra in different positions is the very idea of individual unity of existence. It needs to be explained that in Mulla Sadra&# 39;s works there are two accounts of effect: 	Existence in itself for something-else (relational existence) 	Existence for something-else (copulative existence)      At first sight which is thought to be elementary as compared to the second one, effect enjoys a reality and existence of its own the whole identity of which is though being related to and depended on cause and this dependency is its very essence and <b>undetachable</b> but the effect like the cause is counted among  beings. This is the position which is also held by Mudarres Zunuzi as to contingent beings (Mudarres Zunuzi, 1376 : 357). He seem to have understood Mulla Sadra&# 39;s words implying this very sense alone without presuming the possibility of a second sense. To put it otherwise, he has indeed fathomed effect&# 39;s copulative existence as its relational existence although he outwardly claims a lot of denying the individual unity of existence (ibid: 94 & Ubudyyat, 1385, 214). While in Banu&# 39;s works both takings of effect as copulative and relational existence could be found (Amin, 1373, 115, 96).        There are some phrases in Hakim Mudarres&# 39;s words which appear to be at odds with his idea of diversity of existence: 	Like Mulla Sadra, Mudarres is of the opinion that not only God does not share the notion of "necessity of existence" with anything but this is also true with such notions as existence, knowledge, power and the like; while Zunuzi still believes in the existence of contingent beings and diversity of existence!! (Mudarres Zunuzi, 1376, 72 & 82). 	Like Mulla Sadra and many other theosophers, Zunuzi reduces causation into existential gradation [Tashuun] (ibid, 359). While we know that causation is based on the reality of diversity. The authors believe these phrases and Zunuzi&# 39;s accounts and glosses on them need to be interpreted. As to the first group they accept the position held by Zunuzi and Banu as such but they have other view of the second group. The authors do not find a solid ground for Zunuzi&# 39;s idea of Tashauun and see it as an extension of failure of keeping the pace with one&# 39;s principles. The belief in diversity is a premise which leads to the idea of causation not that of existential gradation. One can replace existential gradation with causation when he has already replaced unity of existence with diversity and copulative existence with relational existence. For instance, in Shawahid, Mulla Sadra turns to individual unity of existence when he has already proved the principiality of existence, made-ness of existence and existential gradation (Mulla Sadra, 1382 : 66). While Zunuzi interprets causation in terms of manifestation despite his denial of transcendent unity of existence...|$|E
