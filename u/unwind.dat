The effective <b>unwinding</b> angle was calculated by equating the reduction in mobility of the DDP-modified DNA to the removal {{of a number of}} superhelical turns.

40|$|Abstract Background Human Rad 51 (RAD 51), {{analogous}} to its bacterial homolog, RecA, binds and <b>unwinds</b> double stranded DNA (dsDNA) {{in the presence}} of certain nucleotide cofactors. ATP hydrolysis is not required for this process, because even ATP non hydrolysable analogs like AMP-PNP and ATPγS, support DNA <b>unwinding.</b> Even ADP, the product of ATP hydrolysis, feebly supports DNA <b>unwinding.</b> Results We find that human Rad 52 (RAD 52) stimulates RAD 51 mediated DNA <b>unwinding</b> {{in the presence of}} all Adenine nucleotide cofactors, (except in AMP and no nucleotide conditions that intrinsically fail to support <b>unwinding</b> reaction) while enhancing aggregation of RAD 51 -dsDNA complexes in parallel. Interestingly, salt at low concentration can substitute the role of RAD 52, in facilitating aggregation of RAD 51 -dsDNA complexes, that concomitantly also leads to better <b>unwinding.</b> Conclusion RAD 52 itself being a highly aggregated protein perhaps acts as scaffold to bring together RAD 51 and DNA molecules into large co-aggregates of RAD 52 -RAD 51 -DNA complexes to promote RAD 51 mediated DNA <b>unwinding</b> reaction, when appropriate nucleotide cofactors are available, presumably through macromolecular crowding effects.

40|$|A {{new method}} for helicase-catalyzed DNA <b>unwinding</b> is described. This assay takes {{advantage}} of the substantial change in fluorescence polarization (FP) upon helicase binding and DNA <b>unwinding.</b> The low anisotropy value, due to the fast tumbling of the free oligonucleotide in solution, increases abruptly upon binding of helicase to the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. The high anisotropy of the helicase– DNA complex decreases as the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide is released from the complex through helicase-catalyzed DNA <b>unwinding.</b> This FP signal can be measured in real time by fluorescent spectroscopy. This assay can simultaneously monitor DNA binding and helicase-catalyzed DNA <b>unwinding.</b> It {{can also be used to}} determine the polarity in DNA <b>unwinding</b> mediated by helicase.

5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to <b>unwind</b> and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E

Here we explore two hypotheses for how Mss 116 p promotes group II intron splicing: by using its RNA <b>unwinding</b> activity {{to act as}} an RNA chaperone or by stabilizing RNA folding intermediates. We show that an Mss 116 p mutant in helicase motif III (SAT/AAA), which was reported to stimulate splicing without <b>unwinding</b> RNA, retains ATP-dependent <b>unwinding</b> activity and promotes unfolding of a structured RNA. Its <b>unwinding</b> activity increases sharply with decreasing duplex length and correlates with group II intron splicing activity in quantitative assays. Additionally, we show that Mss 116 p can promote ATP-independent RNA <b>unwinding,</b> presumably via single-strand capture, also potentially contributing to DEAD-box protein RNA chaperone activity.

5000|$|In {{order for}} an {{intercalator}} to fit between base pairs, the DNA must dynamically open a space between its base pairs by <b>unwinding.</b> The degree of <b>unwinding</b> {{varies depending on}} the intercalator; for example, ethidium cation (the ionic form of ethidium bromide found in aqueous solution) <b>unwinds</b> DNA by about 26°, whereas proflavine <b>unwinds</b> it by about 17°. This <b>unwinding</b> causes the base pairs to separate, or [...] "rise", creating an opening of about 0.34 nm (3.4 Å). This <b>unwinding</b> induces local structural changes to the DNA strand, such as lengthening of the DNA strand or twisting of the base pairs. These structural modifications can lead to functional changes, often to the inhibition of transcription and replication and DNA repair processes, which makes intercalators potent mutagens.

40|$|DNA <b>unwinding</b> is a central, but poorly {{understood}} process that facilitates {{the establishment of}} bi-directional replication. Sustained DNA <b>unwinding</b> is {{carried out by the}} replicative helicase. Most helicases require some single-stranded or untwisted DNA in order to function, and it is this initial DNA <b>unwinding</b> that this study aimed to characterise. There are two possible timepoints when DNA <b>unwinding</b> could occur: during loading of the helicase onto DNA or during the activation of that helicase, as the replisome forms. During this project each possible timepoint for initial <b>unwinding</b> was investigated in chronological order in vitro and S phase was scanned for the appearance of DNA <b>unwinding</b> in vivo. Techniques for in vitro DNaseI, nuclease P 1 and potassium permanganate footprinting using supercoiled plasmid DNA were established within {{the first part of this}} project. These were implemented to reveal that no DNA <b>unwinding</b> occurs during helicase loading, but on completion of loading origin DNA is distorted. The latter part of this study comprised two methods for investigating DNA <b>unwinding</b> during helicase activation. The first method employed an in vitro approach to reconstitute the process of helicase activation during replisome formation. Here, purified proteins were used to supplement S phase yeast extracts. These mixtures were incubated with helicase pre-loaded onto origin DNA and the resulting complexes analysed using Western blotting. A novel in vivo footprinting approach, designed to access potentially unstable unwound DNA within the yeast nucleus was also executed. A single-stranded DNA-specific nuclease was expressed within yeast to target unwound DNA. DNA was extracted throughout S phase and analysed by primer extension. This study highlighted many of the obstacles associated with characterising DNA <b>unwinding.</b> Nevertheless, it reports the development of in vitro and in vivo assays for DNA <b>unwinding.</b> In addition, several new reagents were produced that will benefit future studies.

50|$|RNA helicases that do exhibit <b>unwinding</b> {{activity}} {{have been}} characterized by at least two different mechanisms: canonical duplex <b>unwinding</b> and local strand separation. Canonical duplex <b>unwinding</b> is the stepwise directional separation of a duplex strand, as described above, for DNA <b>unwinding.</b> However, local strand separation occurs by a process wherein the helicase enzyme is loaded at any place along the duplex. This is usually aided by a single-strand region of the RNA, and the loading of the enzyme is accompanied with ATP binding. Once the helicase and ATP are bound, local strand separation occurs, which requires binding of ATP but not the actual process of ATP hydrolysis. Presented with fewer base pairs the duplex then dissociates without further assistance from the enzyme. This mode of <b>unwinding</b> {{is used by the}} DEAD/DEAH box helicases.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHelicases, {{involved}} {{in a number of}} cellular functions, are motors that translocate along single-stranded nucleic acid and couple the motion to <b>unwinding</b> double-strands of a duplex nucleic acid. The junction between double- and single-strands creates a barrier to the movement of the helicase, which can be manipulated in vitro by applying mechanical forces directly on the nucleic acid strands. Single-molecule experiments have demonstrated that the <b>unwinding</b> velocities of some helicases increase dramatically with increase in the external force, while others show little response. In contrast, the <b>unwinding</b> processivity always increases when the force increases. The differing responses of the <b>unwinding</b> velocity and processivity to force have lacked explanation. By generalizing a previous model of processive <b>unwinding</b> by helicases, we provide a unified framework for understanding the dependence of velocity and processivity on force and the nucleic acid sequence. We predict that the sensitivity of <b>unwinding</b> processivity to external force is a universal feature that should be observed in all helicases. Our prediction is illustrated using T 7 and NS 3 helicases as case studies. Interestingly, the increase in <b>unwinding</b> processivity with force depends on whether the helicase forces basepair opening by direct interaction or if such a disruption occurs spontaneously due to thermal fluctuations. Based on the theoretical results, we propose that proteins like single-strand binding proteins associated with helicases in the replisome may have coevolved with helicases to increase the <b>unwinding</b> processivity even if the velocity remains unaffected...|$|R
