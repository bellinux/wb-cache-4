Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material.

It is universally recognized and proved that the nanofluids will be more stable after proper supersonic vibration and it can be proved once again by the summary of the dispersion stability TiO 2 nanofluids. It can be seen from Table  2 that almost all the preparation processes have involved some physical treatments. Li et al.

They found that the nanofluids could keep stable for 48  h with mechanical agitation without adding dispersant. Tajik et al. [86] investigated the effects of different ultrasonic types (continuous or discontinues pulses) on the suspending behavior of water-based TiO 2 nanofluids. The results showed that the continuous pulses had better breaking effects than the discontinuous ones, while the latter could not separate some big aggregations. Silambarasan et al. [66] investigated experimentally the effect of stirred bead milling and ultrasonication on the suspending behavior of water-based mixture containing submicron TiO 2 particles. They found that stirred bead milling can produce stable suspensions containing submicron particles, and ultrasonication can be further applied to control the transport behavior of the TiO 2 suspensions.

40|$|Quartz {{extraction}} and purification from rocks, sediment, {{soil and}} dust samples {{is essential for}} the successful measurement of 10 Be and 26 Al by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The common procedure used involves initial water washing to remove fines then Aqua Regia treatment followed by density separation using lithium silicon tungstate then magnetic separation and finally selective etching of powder samples by <b>ultrasonic</b> heating and <b>agitation</b> in a dilute aqueous (~ 2 % w/w) hydrofluoric acid solution (HF). This technique has proven adequate for quartz rich rock types (ie granite, quartzite). The etching method alone typically involves 4 - 5 cycles of HF 2 % etchings and the result is ~ 10 - 30 % mass loss. However for fine grained and or low quartz (non-felsic) bearing samples such as flint, silcrete, andesite, diorite) density and magnetic separation are inefficient. Furthermore, HF etching will readily dissolve fine quartz grains and thus severely affects yields. We have developed an alternative method using hot phosphoric acid (~ 250 °C), which preferentially dissolves silicates and many other minerals but not quartz. Differentiation of quartz from other minerals (e. g., feldspars, plagioclase) is excellent, density and magnetic separation is not required and usually fewer cycles are required than with conventional HF etching. Hence the hot phosphoric acid method is particularly effective on rocks containing fine grain quartz, e. g., greywacke, silcrete and chert, to enhance quartz recovery. As a bonus this method will bulk extract zircons if required. The technique is far more cost effective by using cheap commercial grade reagents and reduced risk compared to handling highly hazardous HF solutions. We present semi-quantitative data that compares the efficiency and the benefits of the two methods. Copyright (c) 2011 AMS 1...|$|R

This study examined the effects of gaseous ozone delivered into saline on biofilms of E. faecalis in root canals of extracted teeth with and without the use of passive <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation.</b> Methods: Biofilms of E. faecalis were established over 14 days in 70 single roots that had undergone biomechanical preparation followed by gamma irradiation. The presence and purity of biofilms were confirmed using scanning electron microscopy and culture. Biofilms were treated with saline (negative control), 1 % sodium hypochlorite for 120 seconds (positive control), ozone (140 ppm ozone in air at 2 L/min delivered into saline using a cannula for 120 seconds), saline with passive ultrasonic activation (70 kHz and 200 mW/cm(2) applied to an ISO 15 file held passively within the canal, for 120 seconds), and ozone followed immediately by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation.</b> After treatment, samples were taken from the biofilm and serially diluted for plate counting. Results: Analysis revealed that 1 % sodium hypochlorite was the most effective disinfecting agent followed by ozone combined with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation,</b> ozone alone, and finally ultrasonic alone. Conclusions: Although none of the treatment regimes were able to reliably render canals sterile under the conditions used, ozone gas delivered into irrigating fluids in the root canal may be useful as an adjunct for endodontic disinfection.

40|$|In {{conventional}} endodontic treatment, alkaline solutions {{of sodium}} hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) {{are used in}} combination to disinfect the root canal system and to eliminate debris and smear layers. An important concept that has emerged over recent years {{is the use of}} active physical methods for agitating these fluids to improve their penetration within areas that are not reached by endodontic instruments and to accelerate the chemical actions of these alkaline fluids against planktonic microorganisms, biofilms, soft tissue remnants and smear layers. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation</b> and more recently pulsed lasers have emerged as two promising methods for activating endodontic irrigation fluids. <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation</b> with piezoelectric devices employs a moving tip, while laser agitation uses a stationary tip. Both methods cause cavitation, followed by implosions and shear forces which assist with debridement. Fluid streaming further enhances the activity of the fluids. While agitation enhances performance of irrigants, extrusion of fluids from the root canal during activation is a hazard that must be controlled...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to investigate and develop suitable surface treatment methods applicable to bio-medical devices. In particular, {{attention is focused on}} incorporating the electro-etching procedure into the manufacturing process for cardiovascular stents. The project aims to replace the currently preferred chemical etching procedure with electro-etching. At present, the surface treatment processes incorporates: chemical etching followed by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation</b> in a purified water bath, and by electro-polishing. The Taguchi Method is applied to identify the optimum parameter settings in the electroetching process. These parameters include: time, temperature, potential difference between electrodes, acidity level of electrolyte and the amount of agitation applied to the electrolyte by stirring. The experimental equipment employed to determine the optimum electro-etching parameters include: low-noise DC power supply, fumehood, electroetching unit with electrodes and ultrasonic bath. The optimised electro-etching process has been incorporated into a manufacturing production line with great success. The overall duration of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation</b> during the entire manufacturing process of stents is decreased by 37...|$|E
40|$|The etch-back of anodic bonded silicon-on-glass wafer using <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation</b> {{to obtain}} uniform silicon film and good surface finish in deeply {{dissolved}} silicon-on-glass (DDSOG) {{process has been}} studied in KOH solution. Etch-back characteristics of ptype (100) 4 inch SOG wafer have been explored under the different ultrasonic power. It has been observed that the characteristics of etch-back such as the etch rate, etch uniformity and surface roughness were evidently improved under 120 W ultrasonic power agitation. The etching uniformity was less than +/- 1 % on the whole wafer. And the root-mean-square roughness (R(rms)) of 20. 6 nm was achieved after 360 mu m thickness silicon being etched. Some shortcomings of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation</b> such as damaging membrane and reducing the bonding intensity are observed and how to overcome these disadvantages in DDSOG process is also discussed.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the tissue dissolution ability of different irrigating solutions associated or not to <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation.</b> Ninety bovine pulp fragments (n= 10 per group) were weighed and then placed individually in Eppendorf test tubes containing the following irrigants: G 1 - 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); G 2 - 2. 5 % NaOCl + <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation</b> (US); G 3 - 2. 5 % NaOCl + 0. 2 % cetrimide (CTR); G 4 - 2. 5 % NaOCl + 0. 2 % CTR + US; G 5 - 400 ppm Sterilox (SX); G 6 - SX + US; G 7 - 0. 2 % CTR; G 8 - 0. 2 % CTR + US; G 9 - saline solution. Two blinded observers assessed the samples continuously for the first 4 h, and then every hour for the next 12 h. Dissolution speed was calculated by dividing the initial pulp weight (mg) by the period of time until complete dissolution (min). Data were compared by ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test with a 5 % significance level. G 1 to G 4 dissolved pulp fragments completely and G 2 was significantly faster than the other groups. G 5 to G 9 did not exhibit dissolving activity. In conclusion, only groups containing NaOCl were capable of pulp tissue dissolution, which was enhanced by <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>agitation,</b> but did not alter when 0. 2 % cetrimide was associated. This isolated solution and Sterilox showed no dissolving capacity, regardless the use of ultrasound...|$|E
