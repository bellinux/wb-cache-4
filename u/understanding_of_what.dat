He received his bachelor's degree but financial problems {{after his father}} became ill prevented him obtaining a master's degree. He returned to Bahrain to find employment. During his college years, he remained independent of political affiliations. According to Rajab, despite lacking a clear <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes a culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights standards and norms, he was active within the general Bahraini students union, speaking out against all forms of injustice. He also became involved in international campaigning on specific issues.|$|E
5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they were buying.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I offer a {{critical}} feminist interrogation of how sports fandom has been defined. Much {{of the literature}} on gender and sports fandom has been based on assumptions about the `proper 2 ̆ 7 ways to be a sports fan. Since sports fandom has traditionally been coded as a masculine activity that has historically excluded women, these assumptions about sports fandom in the literature often reproduce that gendered exclusion. Using semi-structured interviews with eleven women who identified as sports fans, I argue that rather than relying on dominant <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it means to be a}} sports fan, scholars should instead foreground the voices of sports fans themselves as they describe their own <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> sports fandom means. Those meanings are multiple, contradictory, and profoundly gendered. ...|$|R

40|$|Within the South African context, early {{childhood}} development (ECD) is receiving increasing attention at both government {{and civil society}} levels. This has resulted in children accessing ECD services in increasing numbers. But although access may open the doors to learning, it does not ensure a quality early learning experience for children. The pivotal factor is quality. Quality ECD {{has the potential to}} drive redress and realise the promise inherent in the South African Constitution. The study draws on the three dimensions of a community of practice, to explore how new dialogic spaces are emerging, spaces that have the potential to generate innovation, reflection and new <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> could constitute quality ECD throughout South Africa. Using an action research design, this study will trace how <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes quality ECD in South Africa have already begun to be interrogated by a number of different stakeholders...|$|R

This difference <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> is more than a conflict over definitions; it is an epistemic divergence à la Fuller (2002 : 220), where already defined groups hold divergent <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes <b>understanding.</b> While a substantial body of work has been based on the idea of epistemic communities in the context of science and expert organizations in general (e. g. Knorr-Cetina 1999, Haas 1992) little empirical research exists to demonstrate the validity and adaptability of the concept of epistemic communities in comparative political communication research. Here, we show the cross-national validity of the concept of epistemic communities in the context of professional groups of politicians and political journalists. We treat these empirical findings as an aspect of the functions of the public sphere as conceptualized by Habermas and others...|$|R
