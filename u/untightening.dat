40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) Abstract: The {{document}} {{reports on}} research conducted on titanium bolt assemblies {{pertaining to the}} surface friction behaviour between the sliding surfaces of a screw and nut within a fastener assembly. The research was motivated by problems encountered in the dental implant industry whereby the prescribed preload after application of the fixation torque was not achieved. The insufficient preload in the abutment screw led to implant failure due to the dynamic nature of its maxillofacial function and resulting in tissue growth into micro-spaces because of joint separation between the abutment and implant. Commercially pure Grade 4 titanium screws were sulphurically anodised to various oxide layer thicknesses {{in an attempt to}} reduce the coefficient of friction within the implant assembly. Testing procedures involved the design and manufacturing of the experimental specimen and testing fixture, anodising of screws, friction coefficient measurement, oxide layer thickness measurement, surface hardness measurement, and surface typography investigation. The design process of the specimen and the testing fixture included various FEA (Finite element analysis) in optimising both of the aforementioned systems of the research and conclusively generate accurate results and findings to compare with each other. Oxide layer thickness measurement was conducted by wavelength reflectance theory and visual measurement of the oxide layer using a scanning electron microscope. The surface hardness of the material was measured using a Vickers hardness tester while surface typography investigation was performed using a scanning electron microscope. Findings of the experiments revealed that the coefficient of friction reduces by 10 % to 40 % as the anodising voltage is increased up to an oxide layer thickness of 0. 4 μm, where after the surface friction coefficient increases to eventually surpass the coefficient of friction for untreated fastener assemblies. <b>Untightening</b> examination exhibited similar behaviour to fixation, where the removal friction coefficient reduces to attain a minimum of 0. 69 at an oxide thickness of 0. 06 μm. The <b>untightening</b> coefficient of friction was at a maximum at the increased oxide layer thicknesses of 0. 97 μm to 3. 4 μm. Oxide layer thickness investigation revealed that the thickness of the oxide layer increases exponentially as the anodising voltage is increased. The increase in anodising voltage also [...] ...|$|E

By exploiting the known stabilizing effects of aqueous alcoholic solvents on the unique collagen fold, deuterated ethylene glycol/water (1 : 1) {{is used as a}} solvent to investigate the effect of the light-switchable trans/cis-azobenzene clamp on the stability of the triple helix in terms of H/D exchange rates and thermal unfolding. Results of this comparative analysis clearly reveal only a minor destabilization of the triple helix by the hydrophobic azobenzene moieties compared to the reference collagen peptide as reflected by a lower midpoint of the thermal unfolding and higher rates of H/D exchange. However, it also reveals that the driving force exerted by the trans-to-cis photoisomerization of the azobenzene moieties is insufficient for unfolding of the compact triple-helical collagen fold. Only temperature-dependent <b>untightening</b> of this fold with heating results in a reversible photomodulated unfolding and refolding of the azo-collagen peptide into the original triple helix...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of fully edentulous mandibles {{by means of}} implant-supported hinging overdentures has become a routine therapy, although long-term data on the success rate of implants and prostheses are lacking. This longitudinal study examined 207 consecutively treated patients who received, during the past 10 years, 449 Brånemark implants to retain a mandibular hinging overdenture, mainly on a Dolder bar. Clinical parameters and standardized radiographs taken at every recall visit with an interval of 6 - 12 months were used to judge the implant rigidity in the jawbone, the marginal bone level, and attachment level changes. The cumulative implant failure rate at 9 years was 3 %. After loading, implant loss was concentrated during the first 12 months, with only one failure observed at 22 months. A radiographically determined bone loss of 0. 7 mm was observed during the first year. From the second year, a mean annual bone loss of 0. 05 mm occurred. The attachment loss, calculated as the sum of probing pocket depth plus the recession, was 0. 07 mm/year and paralleled the changes in marginal bone level over time. The rigidity of the implant-bone interface revealed an increase over time, as shown by a decrease in Periotest values. The bar-overdenture complications were related to relining (23 %), <b>untightening</b> of the retention clip (10 %), and renewal of the prosthesis (7 %). When magnets or ball attachments were used, more aftercare was needed. Fracture of the antagonistic full denture occurred in 7 % of patients. The present data indicate that the mandibular overdenture therapy on two (Brånemark) implants is a very reliable and cost-effective treatment, even in a long-term perspective for the fixed full mandibular prosthesis and especially in elderly patients. status: publishe...|$|E

Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to <b>untighten.</b> This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks.

5000|$|Height Adjustment: The {{depth of}} a facet is {{determined}} by how high or low the head assembly is relative to the lap. The way this is determined is by choosing an angle, lowering the quill, with dop inserted, to that angle, and then observing whether and how deeply the piece of rough is contacting the lap. Generally the first adjustment will set the rough just touching the lap, so that a very shallow facet will be placed. The head can then be lowered by a micro-adjustment and the facet can be cut and re-cut until it is of a desired depth. Many machines allow the head to be <b>untightened</b> from the mast and slid up and down for gross adjustments, and then have a separate mechanism for making fine adjustments up and down.|$|R
30|$|However, {{social capital}} may also cause lock-in effects in maladaptive situations. Organizations {{attempting}} to adopt their social capital due to environmental changes or endogenous forces {{are limited in}} their actions by previous established ties (e.g. Gargiulo and Benassi 1999; Sorensen and Waguespack 2006; Rowley et al. 2000). Ties with alters – especially when they have been considered as successful in the past – have been proven difficult to <b>untighten</b> since actors may feel a social obligation to preserve them (Coleman 1988, p. 98; Uzzi 1997, p. 36). Furthermore, firms tend to be inert in realizing that social capital may have lost value since strong bonds lead to a cognitive lock-in from developments outside the network (e.g. Kim et al. 2006). Strong interorganizational ties are characterized by relation-specific assets, e.g. institutionalized assets and human capital, which have initially been intended to induce competitive advantages (Dyer and Singh 1998). Dissolving or replacing these ties is therefore perceived as costly, which makes them extremely resilient despite losses in social capital.|$|R
3000|$|Symptomology of spastic Cerebral Palsy (CP) includes, but is {{not limited}} to, muscular weakness, overactivity and {{contracture}} [1]. Muscular contractures are thought to some degree to reflect muscle tissue that fails {{to keep up with}} bone growth [2]. Plantarflexors are typically seriously affected. Apart from altered neural control, they are intrinsically very stiff [3], resulting in equinus, the most common musculoskeletal impairment in CP [4]. Equinus gait compromises balance and is fatiguing, since it requires more activity of the triceps surae [5]. During childhood of children with CP, the loss in passive dorsiflexion is progressive [6]. Thus, muscle contracture of the triceps surae also seems to deteriorate. On a long-term painful bony foot deformities can result. Temporary immobilization of the stretched calf using casts or braces with or without botulinum toxin injections is a popular treatment [7, 8]. Braces are commonly applied in non-rigid deformities. By holding joints near their end-range, progressive contracture should be counteracted and spastic muscles are assumed to <b>untighten</b> and grow at a rate more equal [...] to that of the bone. Eventually, the gait pattern should also improve. Yet, it is unclear how bracing actually affects the muscle morphometrics in spastic equinus deformity.|$|R

Obtained parameters devalue sense of engine tuning in exploitation which based only on comparative tests of indicating pressure curves...|$|R

40|$|Bolted flange joints form {{a part of}} {{pressure}} vessels and piping components, and are used extensively in the chemical, petrochemical and nuclear power industries. They are simple structures and offer the possibility of disassembly, making them attractive for connecting pressurized equipment and piping. In addition of being prone to leakage, they often require maintenance while in operation, {{in which case the}} bolts are either retightened, as in hot torquing, or <b>untightened</b> for replacement. Although such maintenance work prevents costly shutdowns, it can nevertheless expose the operator to a potential risk because altering the bolt load can produce a gasket load unbalance, which results in a local gasket contact stress drop below a critical value, causing a major leak, and putting the operator’s life at risk. This proposal addresses flange deflection variation as it investigates the flange contact stress level unbalance around the flange when the bolts are subjected to a load alteration during operation. This study may serve to help limit the degree of load increase in hot torquing or the maximum number of bolts to be replaced at a time, and to identify the flanges whose bolts cannot be replaced while they are in operation. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine a theoretical approach for identifying and analyzing the effects of initial bolt-up and pressurization on the bolted flange joints, in order to obtain a solution for bolt spacing calculation, according to different gasket contact stress variation levels. Our research breaks down into three parts. The first part, an analytical method based on the theory of circular beams resting on a linear elastic foundation, is developed to predict the circumferential distribution of gasket contact stresses. Finite element model of symmetry bolted flange joints is created for use in evaluating the analysis. Then, as a second step of this research, an approach based on the theory of a ring on a non-linear elastic foundation behavior is applied in order to get more accurate results than linear model solution. This part is applied to non-linear solution and then validated by finite element analysis. In the third part, a linear regression model is developed to propose bolt spacing calculation procedures for bolted flange joint connections. In industrial practice, this work should help in designing, maintaining and operating technical pressure vessels and piping systems...|$|R
