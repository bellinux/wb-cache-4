40|$|Purpose – Many service {{providers}} feel confident about their service quality and thus offer service guarantees to their customers. Yet service failures are inevitable. As guarantees {{can only be}} invoked when customers report service failures, firms are {{given the opportunity to}} redress the original failure potentially influencing customer outcomes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide the first empirical investigation of whether excellence in service recovery affects customers’ intentions to invoke a service guarantee, thereby discriminating between conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>guarantees</b> and testing for the impact of customers’ individualistic vs collectivistic cultural orientation. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 171 respondents from four continents (spanning 23 countries) were recruited to participate in a quasi-experimental study in a hotel setting. A three-way analysis of variance was used to test the hypotheses. Findings – All customers are very likely to invoke the service guarantee after an unsatisfactory service recovery. When customers are satisfied with the service recovery, they report lower invoke intentions, except for collectivistic individuals who are still inclined to invoke an <b>unconditional</b> service <b>guarantee</b> after a satisfactory service recovery. The finding supports an in-group/out-group rationale, whereby collectivists tend to behave more opportunistically toward out-groups than individualistic customers. Originality/value – The study highlights the importance of excellence in service recovery, cultural differences and different types of service guarantees with respect to customers’ intentions to invoke the guarantee. The paper demonstrates how service guarantees should be designed in conjunction with service recovery strategies. Also, the paper shows that an <b>unconditional</b> service <b>guarantee</b> creates the condition in which collectivists might engage in opportunistic behavior; global {{service providers}} concerned about opportunistic customer claiming behavior thus might benefit from using conditional service guarantees. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} use, {{there is}} a void {{in our understanding of}} why, when, and how customers use service guarantees to evaluate service firms. Most previous research has focused on the effects of service guarantees prior to purchase, ignoring their beneficial effects on customer evaluations after the service has been experienced. This paper develops three conceptual frameworks that elaborate the psychological and economic effects of service guarantees on customers, {{both before and after the}} service has been experienced. In addition, a fourth framework explains how implementing guarantees enables firms to positively influence employees and improve performance. This rather unique perspective that examines both external (customer) and internal (employee) markets contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of service guarantee effects and provides an effective basis for the design and management of service guarantees. The take-away is encapsulated in an inventory of propositions. A review of the literature revealed lack of consensus regarding the definition of a service guarantee. This inconsistency is resolved by considering a service guarantee as comprised of two elements, a service promise and a compensation offer. Two types of service guarantees are examined in this paper: specific and <b>unconditional.</b> Specific <b>guarantees</b> promise superior firm performance on specific attributes (e. g. price, delivery), while <b>unconditional</b> <b>guarantees</b> promise performance on all aspects of service.

40|$|The service-profit chain (SPC) is a {{framework}} for linking service operations, employee assessments, and customer assessments to a firm's profitability (Heskett et al. 1994). The SPC provides an integrative framework for understanding how a firm's operational investments into service operations are related to customer perceptions and behaviors, and how these translate into profits. For a firm, it provides much needed guidance about the complex interrelationships among operational investments, customer perceptions, and the bottom line. Implementing the SPC is a pervasive problem among most service firms, and several {{attempts have been made}} to model various aspects of the SPC. However, comprehensive approaches to model the SPC are lacking, as most studies have only focused on discrete aspects of the SPC. There is a need for approaches that combine data such as measures of operational inputs, customer perceptions and behaviors, and financial outcomes from multiple sources, providing the firm with not only comprehensive diagnosis and assessment but also with implementation guidelines. Importantly, an approach that is sensitive to and can accommodate the strengths and weaknesses of such data sets is required. We outline and illustrate such an approach in this paper. Our approach has the potential to both identify and quantify the benefits of implementing a service strategy, especially for firms having multiple units (e. g., banks with branches, retail outlets, and so forth). The implementation approach is illustrated using data from a national bank in Brazil. We used customer surveys from more than 500 branches of the bank. Each individual customer's marketing survey data was linked to a number of operational metrics. First, behavioral measures of retention, such as the length of the customer's relation with the bank, the deposit amount, and number of transactions with the bank, were obtained and merged with the survey data. Second, the main branch used by each customer was identified and operational inputs (e. g., number of employees, number of available automated teller machines (ATMs)) used at that branch were obtained and merged with the data set. This data set was used to model the SPC at a and level. The analysis consisted of a structural-equation model that identified the critical conceptual relationships that parsimoniously articulate the SPC for this bank. For instance, from among a variety of attribute-level perceptions, the bank was able to identify those perceptions that were critical determinants of behavioral intentions. Similarly, from a variety of available behavioral metrics, the bank was able to identify those behaviors most relevant to profitability. The utilized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and provides customized feedback to each branch in implementing the strategic model. It provides each branch with a metric of its relative efficiency in translating inputs such as employees and ATMs into relevant strategic outcomes such as customer intentions and behaviors. Our illustration shows how top management can use the strategic and operational analysis in tandem. Whereas the strategic model provides the key relationships and metrics that are needed to ensure that all subunits of the firm follow a consistent strategy, the operational analysis enables each branch to benchmark its unique position so that the branch can implement the strategic model in the most efficient way. Thus,. For this bank, the operational analysis shows that for a branch to achieve superior profitability, it is important that the branch manager not only be efficient in achieving superior satisfaction (as indicated in positive behavioral intentions) but also be efficient in translating such attitudes and intentions into relevant behaviors. In other words, superior satisfaction alone is not an <b>unconditional</b> <b>guarantee</b> of profitability.

It is the idea of society-level knowledge management premised on a universal and <b>unconditional</b> <b>guaranteed</b> basic income (GBI; or social wage). Basic income represents not just a social investment in knowledge, which Drucker himself called for, but also compensation for biolabour’s augmented social productivity.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a {{guaranteed}} income is not only consistent with the principle of reciprocity but is required for reciprocity. This conclusion follows from a three-part argument. First, if a guaranteed income is in place, all individuals have the same opportunity to live without working. Therefore, those who choose not to work do {{not take advantage of}} a privilege that is unavailable to everyone else. Second, {{in the absence of an}} unconditional income, society is, in effect, applying the principle "He who does not work, will not eat. " If the application of this principle is to be consistent with reciprocity, it must be applied to everyone. Most modern industrial societies exempt many citizens from that choice. For example, the owners of external assets do not face the work-or-starve choice and do take advantage of a privilege that is not available to others. An <b>unconditional</b> <b>guaranteed</b> income is one way to eliminate that violation of reciprocity. Third, this paper addresses the criticism that the guaranteed income exploits middle-class workers by demonstrating that a basic income will have a positive effect on wages, which will at least partially counteract the effect of the taxes needed to pay for it. ...|$|R

He further added that there are two types of performance bonds: Conditional bond or default bond; and Unconditional bond or on-demand bond. However, in Malaysia, for the past 20 years and since the famous case of Teknik Cekap Sdn Bhd v Public Bank Berhad [1995] 3 MLJ 449 to the recent Suharta Development Sdn Bhd v United Overseas Bank (M) Bhd & Anor [2005] 2 MLJ 762, the question of whether the performance bond in a construction contract is a conditional or an <b>unconditional</b> <b>guarantees</b> is still one of the issues relating to performance bond that has been discussed.

Where the determination of quality after the sale is cut-and-dried, brand names and <b>unconditional</b> <b>guarantees</b> will bond contract performance. When the problem is more subtle or confounded by the extent of consumer inputs, requiring risk-sharing by the contracting parties, these bonding devices typically are not sufficient. Under the circumstances, seller financing may be an efficient contracting solution for bonding the quality dimension of the contract. This form of financing makes both the buyer and the seller share the risk that the product may not suit the buyer’s needs in the way promised by the seller. This paper provides further empirical evidence on the quality assurance role of seller financing. We consider seller-financed second mortgages in the National Association of Realtors database. Seller financing in second mortgages may be a supplement to first mortgages supplied by conventional lenders. The role of seller financing as a quality assurance mechanism in second mortgages is more complex than its role in first mortgages, but is also less subject to an alternative interpretation of credit rationing than is its role in seller-financed first mortgages. To avoid further complexities, we do not consider second seller financing transactions that supplement first assumption mortgage transactions. Dogan Tirtiroglu and David N. Laban...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of economy in the world, {{people would like to}} spend more money to enjoy their life. In this way, service industry becomes more popular than manufacturing industry. In addition, although the main business of a company is production, it will provide additional services, such as after-sales services, to increase its products’ selling volume. At the same time, a good service quality should be improved and guaranteed by applying service guarantee. However, China is a developing country, and service industry has developed for just a few years, so companies in China are not familiar with how to provide services to their customers to satisfy their needs and wants. As a result, the main topic of this dissertation is to investigate the drivers and risks of applying service guarantee in three different sectors-Healthcare, white goods, and hotel in China, and put forward the suitable types of service guarantees to these sectors by analysing three influencing factors (consumer behaviour, industry characteristics, and operational issues). In order to achieve above objectives, both empirical data and secondary data should be collected. In the literature review, the researcher used secondary data and found gaps which need to be filled through using evidences in the real world. The researcher found that almost all kinds of service guarantees can reduce purchasing risks and protect consumers’ rights. In addition, different kinds of service guarantees have different benefits. While, designing a good service guarantee is difficult, and it needs to consider many factors, and different companies need to design different service guarantees according to their conditions. At the same time, the researcher found that some Chinese consumer behaviours, such as collectivism and cheating, characteristics of manufacturing industry, such as product-related services, and operational issues, such as distribution channel and some specific operations in hotel are the obstacles of implementing service guarantee in China. In the empirical researches, Siemens Healthcare, Elekta, Siemens electronic household appliances, Hilton hotel, KUNLUN hotel were analysed to give the further in-depth understanding of theories in literature review and put forward evidences of previous statements. The main findings of researcher were that manufacturing companies should use conditional service guarantee which needs to base on customers’ requirements, while service companies should use <b>unconditional</b> service <b>guarantee,</b> but they also need to understand their customers to reduce risks.
