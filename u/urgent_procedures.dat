5000|$|The most {{frequent}} complication associated with chest tubes is chest tube clogging, which is commonly caused by thrombus formation inside the chest tube, {{and can cause}} major subsequent complications. After cardiac surgery, chest tube clogging has been observed in 36% of patients, and is significantly associated with increased rates of atrial fibrillation and renal failure. Since {{a portion of the}} chest tube is inside the patient, 86% of the time chest tube clogging goes unobserved. In the setting of bleeding, chest tube clogging can cause blood to be retained around the heart and lungs, known as retained blood syndrome, or RBS. This can lead to a complex of complications including pericardial tamponade, hemothorax, pleural effusion, decreased cardiac output, and death. In the presence of air production, chest tube clogging can cause tension pneumothorax, and in the setting of infection, empyema. Chest tube clogging after cardiac surgery is more common in reoperations and <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures,</b> and is associated with statistically significantly higher rates of atrial fibrillation.

40|$|Objective: To assess factors {{influencing}} operative and tong-term outcome in octogenarians undergoing aortic valve surgery (AVR). Methods: Records of 220 consecutive octogenarians having AVR between 1992 and 2004 were reviewed, and follow-up obtained (99 % complete). Of the group (mean age: 82. 8 years; 174 females), 142 patients (65 %) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, 22 (10 %) had previous myocardial infarction, 11 (5 %) had previous {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG), and 8 (4 %) had percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty. There were 44 <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures</b> (20 %), and additional CABG was performed in 58 patients (26 %). Results: Operative mortality was 13 % (9 % for AVR, 24 % for AVR + CABG). Among the 29 patients who died, 14 (48 %) were operated on urgently (32 % mortality for <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures).</b> Causes of hospital death were respiratory insufficiency or infection in 16 patients (16 / 29 = 55 %), myocardial, infarction in 8 (28 %), stroke in 2 (7 %), sepsis in 2 (7 %), and renal failure in 1 (3 %). Significant postoperative complications were atrial fibrillation in 48 patients (22 %), respiratory insufficiency in 46 (21 %), permanent atrio-ventricular bloc in 12 (5 %), myocardial infarction in 10 (5 %), hemodialysis in 4 (2 %), and stroke in 4 (2 %). Mean hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stays were 17. 6 +/- 5. 2 and 6. 9 +/- 3. 4 days, respectively. Multivariate predictors (p < 0. 05) of hospital death were urgent procedure, associated CABG, NYHA class IV, and percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty. Age, associated CABG, and urgent procedure were predictors of prolonged ICU stay. Mean follow-up was 58. 2 months and actuarial 5 -year survival was 73. 2 +/- 6. 9 %. Age, preoperative myocardial infarction, urgent procedure, and duration of ICU stay were independent predictors of late death. Among 130 patients alive at follow-up, 91 % were angina free and 81 % in class I-II. Conclusions: AVR in octogenarians can be performed with acceptable mortality, although significant morbidity.

40|$|For years, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{has been}} {{overloaded}} with requests for preliminary rulings, given that these proceedings make {{up more than}} three-quarters of the Court caseload. Such circumstances constitute a significant constraint to the operation of the Court, which is unable to quickly and effectively respond to the preliminary questions which are referred to this Court by the national courts of Member States. In addition, the duration of the regular preliminary ruling proceedings jeopardizes the European standards {{not only in terms of}} the lengthy procedure but also in terms of observing the right of each individual to effective judicial protection within a reasonable time. In order to make the proceedings faster and more effective, the procedural rules have been repeatedly amended and supplemented. The applicable Rules of Procedure of the Court stipulate some exceptions from the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The first one is the so-called simplified procedure, where the Court renders a final decision in the form of a reasoned order, without scheduling an oral hearing and obtaining the written opinion of the Advocate-General. The Court may also decide to institute the expedited procedure, by means of which the case at issue is given absolute priority over other cases. The last exception is the <b>urgent</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is applicable only in the area of freedom, security and justice; it implies the omission of certain stages of the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The analyses presented in this paper show that the results achieved in terms of reducing the length of the regular preliminary ruling procedure are generally positive. Thus, the average time required for rendering a decision in the expedited procedure is approximately four and a half months, which is certainly a significant improvement as compared to the length of the regular procedure which takes sixteen to seventeen months. The initial results accomplished by instituting the <b>urgent</b> <b>procedure</b> are even more encouraging, as the average duration of this procedure is approximately two months.

40|$|Direct oral {{anticoagulants}} (DOACs) {{have been}} licensed worldwide {{for several years}} for various indications. Each year, 10 - 15 % of patients on oral anticoagulants will undergo an invasive procedure and expert groups have issued several guidelines on perioperative management in such situations. The perioperative guidelines have undergone numerous updates as clinical experience of emergency management has increased and perioperative studies including measurement of residual anticoagulant levels have been published. The high inter-patient variability of DOAC plasma levels has challenged the traditional recommendation that perioperative DOAC interruption should be based only on the elimination half-life of DOACs, especially before invasive procedures carrying {{a high risk of}} bleeding. Furthermore, recent publications have highlighted the potential danger of heparin bridging use when DOACs are stopped before an invasive procedure. As antidotes are progressively becoming available to manage severe bleeding or <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures</b> in patients on DOACs, accurate laboratory tests have become the standard to guide their administration and their actions need to be well understood by clinicians.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that a drop in the systolic blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery of 70 % or more, measured by transcranial Doppler, is a better criteria in the detection of cross-clamp intolerance than electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring. After exclusion of patients with a recent stroke, <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures</b> and combined procedures, a transcranial Doppler with compression test was scheduled in 85 patients. In 13 patients the drop was 70 % or more and in these patients a transcranial Doppler was also performed during the reconstruction of the internal carotid artery (the study group) under general anaesthesia. A shunt was used because of EEG and SSEP abnormality in one patient. No changes were observed in the remaining patients and no intraoperative strokes were seen. The transcranial Doppler monitoring was unreliable in three patients. During cross-clamp, the systolic blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery dropped less than 70 % in four and 70 % or more in six patients. It is concluded that using a drop of 70 % or more of the systolic blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery during internal carotid artery cross-clamp, as an indicator of cross-clamp intolerance, will lead to unnecessary shunting. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectiveDespite the {{increase}} of latex allergy in general population, severe anaphylactic events during some surgical procedures are still rare; however, they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients affected by this event represent a challenge for anesthesiologists. The objective of this report was to describe a case of severe latex induced anaphylactic reaction and discuss its diagnosis and treatment. Case reportThis is a 39 -year-old Caucasian female patient, with a diagnostic suspicion of appendicitis, who underwent an emergency surgery under spinal anesthesia. Approximately 30 minutes after beginning the surgery, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction with cardiorespiratory arrest, which was reversed after treatment. Possible causative agents were isolated and, posteriorly, the patient {{was transferred to the}} intensive care unit, evolving without sequelae. Latex-specific IgE-RAST (Radioallergosorbent Test) was positive. The patient was referred to an allergist for follow-up. ConclusionsAnesthesiologists should focus on patient's history, even in <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures,</b> being aware of the limitations arising on these situations. The prognosis of anaphylaxis depends on prompt initiation of adequate treatment; diagnosis {{is not limited to the}} event occasion, but to the determination of the causative factor.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} acute coronary syndrome clearly recommend that clopidogrel should be started before diagnostic coronary angiography. If patients undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) early after clopidogrel loading or during continued exposure, it seems reasonable to expect an increase in bleeding complications. RECENT FINDINGS: Earlier studies may have overestimated the risk of bleeding in patient undergoing CABG with prior clopidogrel exposure (5 - 10 -fold increase). Some conflicting results are reported in literature. As reexploration because of excessive bleeding is concerned, a two to three-fold increase must be expected, which is demonstrated in actual trials properly matched to confounding factors. Discontinuation of clopidogrel for 5 - 7 days prior to urgent CABG as recommended by guidelines is not well adopted in clinical practice for several reasons. SUMMARY: There is a moderately elevated risk of bleeding complications after CABG due to prior clopidogrel exposure alone. However, in clinical practice this risk is added often to patients who carry already elevated surgical risks (<b>urgent</b> <b>procedures,</b> worse coronary anatomy, history of previous myocardial infarction and prior percutaneous intervention), and after bleeding complications singular patients may suffer from consecutive adverse outcome. Cessation of clopidogrel in patients before CABG clearly prolongs hospitalization time and has an estimated 1 % risk of coronary events during the waiting period. Risk and benefit have to be balanced in every individual case...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Because {{the elderly}} are {{increasingly}} referred for operation, we reviewed the results of cardiac surgery in patients of 80 years or older. METHODS AND RESULTS: Records of 182 consecutive octogenarians who had had cardiac operations between 1992 and 1998 were reviewed. Follow-up was 100 % complete. Seventy patients had coronary grafting (CABG), 70 aortic valve replacement, 30 aortic valve replacement+CABG, and 12 mitral valve repair/replacement. Rates of hospital death, stroke, and prolonged stay (> 14 days) were as follows: CABG: 7 (10 %), 2 (2. 8 %) and 41 (58 %); aortic valve replacement: 6 (8. 5 %), 2 (2. 8 %) and 32 (45. 7 %); aortic valve replacement+CABG: 8 (26. 5 %), 1 (3. 8 %) and 14 (46. 6 %); mitral valve repair/replacement: 3 (25 %), 1 (8. 3 %) and 5 (41. 6 %). Multivariate predictors (P< 0. 05) of hospital death were New York Heart Association functional class, <b>urgent</b> <b>procedure,</b> prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and, after aortic valve replacement, previous percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty. Ascending aortic atheromatous disease was predictive of stroke, while pre-operative myocardial infarction was predictive of prolonged hospital stay. Actuarial 5 -year survival was as follows: CABG, 65. 8 +/- 8. 8 %; aortic valve replacement, 63. 6 +/- 7. 1 %; aortic valve replacement+CABG, 62. 4 +/- 6. 8 %; mitral valve repair/replacement, 57. 1 +/- 5. 6 %; and total, 63. 0 +/- 5. 6 %. Multivariate predictors of late death were pre-operative myocardial infarction, and <b>urgent</b> <b>procedure.</b> Ninety percent of long-term survivors were in New York Heart Association class I or II, and 87 % believed having a heart operation after age 80 years was a good choice.

40|$|Background: Invasive {{coronary}} {{procedures are}} increasing {{in number and}} complexity over time. This trend translates in an increased need for economical and human resources, among which is nurse staffing the most affected. Aims: To identify possible predictors of nurse workload, during and after diagnostic and interventional procedures. Methods: Two hundred and sixty consecutive patients were included: 52 and 208 patients underwent femoral and radial access, respectively. Nurse workload was calculated with a self-developed model. Results: Cathlab nurse workload was 103 [63 - 156] min. Independent predictors of increased Cathlab nurse workload were: femoral access, failed radial access and cross-over, interventional procedures, procedural time, <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures.</b> Cathlab nurse workload was 174 [134 - 218] and 86 [58 - 126] min, for femoral and radial access, respectively (p < 0. 001). Among the overall population, 174 / 260 patients (44 females, mean age 66 ± 11 years) were hospitalised at our Center after the procedure. Fifty-six and 118 patients had femoral and radial access, respectively. Ward nurse workload was 457 [226 - 954] min. Independent predictors of increased Ward nurse workload were: access-site complication, length of in-hospital stay, admission to CCU, interventional procedures. Ward nurse workload was 386 [226 - 652] and 720 [314 - 1375] min, respectively for radial and femoral access (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: A systematic radial access is an effective strategy for reducing nurse workload, both during, by simplifying nurse tasks in the CathLab, and after coronary invasive procedures, by preventing access-site complications, shortening in-hospital stays, and reducing admissions to CCU...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{expected}} {{with all}} antithrombotic agents, {{there is a}} risk of bleeding complications in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) because of the DOAC itself, acute trauma, invasive procedures, or underlying comorbidities. For many bleeding events, a prudent course of action will be to withdraw the DOAC, then “wait and support” the patient, with the expectation that the bleeding event should resolve with time. Likewise, DOAC therapy may be interrupted ahead of a planned procedure, the stopping time being dependent on the agent involved and the patient’s renal function. However, urgent reversal of anticoagulation is required in patients with serious or life-threatening bleeding or in those requiring urgent surgery or procedures. Novel specific reversal agents, either under development or recently approved, will need to be incorporated into local anticoagulation reversal protocols. For dabigatran-treated patients, idarucizumab recently has been approved for clinical use in cases of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding or when patients require emergency surgery or <b>urgent</b> <b>procedures,</b> both associated with a high risk of bleeding. As clinical experience with individual specific reversal agents grows, their roles in managing major bleeding events in DOAC—treated patients will become better defined. Future research, as well as ongoing use of idarucizumab, should help establish when it is appropriate to re-dose with idarucizumab, coadminister with prothrombin complex concentrates, or re-initiate DOAC after idarucizumab use. Ongoing trials should help identify the appropriate doses and expected durations of effect for andexanet alfa and ciraparantag, which are likely to vary depending on the individual oral anticoagulants...|$|E

Stent implantation into the vertical vein {{is an alternative}} treatment for rescue in critical patients with TAPVC and severe pulmonary congestion. We performed a stent implantation into the supra-cardiac vertical vein for rescue and stabilization of a critical newborn with TAPVC. The internal jugular vein was selected for sheath insertion under echo guidance in an <b>urgent</b> <b>procedure,</b> which took 11 min from venous puncture to stent implantation. The internal jugular approach is optimal for stent implantation in patients with supra-cardiac TAPVC in a critical condition. <Learning objective: Learning alternative methods are valuable for rescue and treatment against critical conditions with congenital heart disease in neonates. This report can provide useful and optimal technique for rescuing a critical patient with total anomalous venous connection with severe pulmonary venous obstruction. ...|$|R
