Laine and Pete search Deb's attic and find a box of old photographs {{that belonged to the}} previous residents. While researching the previous family's history, they learn of a little girl named Doris Zander who went missing, and whose mother was suspected in her disappearance. Laine visits Doris's sister, an old woman named Paulina, who is now committed to a psychiatric hospital. Paulina explains that her mother was a medium and used Doris as a vessel for the dead to speak through. Their mother went mad and sewed Doris's mouth shut before killing her. She tells Laine that there is a secret room in the house where Laine must find Doris's hidden body and <b>unstitch</b> her mouth in order for the girl to banish their mother. The remaining friends go back to the Galardi house, where Laine finds Doris's corpse and cuts the stitches on her mouth. [...] "Doris"'s spirit appears and chases away the ghost of her mother. Pete becomes possessed and is killed in his home, appearing as a soulless ghost with his mouth stitched up.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stitching}} parameters on the puncture resistance properties of high strength fabric system was investigated. There are three objectives in this study; {{to investigate the}} effect of stitching patterns on the puncture resistance properties of the high strength fabric system, to investigate the effect of stitch density on the puncture resistance properties of the high strength fabric system, and to suggest the mechanism of penetration of the high strength fabric system. Four types of stitching patterns used in this study;vertical, diagonal, square and diamond stitched patterns. The samples were stitched with the nylon thread in two types of stitch density; 4 stitch/em and 8 stitch/em. The puncture resistance test was conducted and the conical shape probe {{was used in the}} test. The probe moved downward at 100 mrnlmin and stopped automatically when the maximum puncture load achieved. The results showed that diagonal, vertical and <b>unstitch</b> patterns gave much highest puncture resistance performance. Fabrics that were stitched with high stitch density offer higher puncture load value from 2 -layer to 4 -layer. There is a possibility of fabric slippage on the 5 -layer and 6 -layer fabric because the fabric samples became thicker and the clamping gap increased. The shape of the probe also contributed to the mechanism of penetration. The conical probe was able to push aside the principal yams. The sharp tip of the conical probe stretched the fibers and the stitch yams, break the fibers and stitch yarns, and then penetrate into the fabric. The local yam rupture was the fabric failure mode in this study. The puncture resistance of the high strength fabric system is dependent upon the number of fabric layers, types of stitching patterns, and the number of stitch density used to the fabric syste...|$|E

40|$|Five through-the-thickness stitch {{configurations}} {{are analyzed}} {{to determine the}} effect of impact resistance and interlaminar fracture toughness on T 3000 / 3501 - 6 graphite/epoxy. The test specimens were stitched with either polyester or Kevlar yarns and with various stitch parameters. Tension and compression mechanical, impact and compression-after-impact, and double cantilever beam tests were conducted. It is observed that the stitched laminates have tension and compression strengths 20 - 25 percent lower than the strengths of <b>unstitched</b> laminates, the tension strength of stitched laminates is reduced with increasing number of stitches, and the compression strength increases as the number of stitches are increased. The impact data reveal that the Kevlar stitched laminates have less damage than <b>unstitched</b> laminates; the most effective configuration for suppressing impact damage and improving interlaminar fracture toughness consists of Kevlar yarns 1 / 4 inch apart with eight stitches per inch.

The AS 4 / 3501 - 6 uniweave material had a quasi-isotropic layup, whereas the AS 4 /E 905 L materials were braided in a (+/- 30 deg/ 0 deg) (sub s) orientation. Data presented include compression strengths and compression-compression fatigue results for uncycled composites and cycled composites (160, 480, 720, and 1280 cycles from 140 deg F at 95 percent relative humidity to - 67 deg F). To observe the presence of microcracking within the laminates, photomicrographs were taken of each material type {{at the end of}} each cycling period. Microcracks were found to be more prevalent within stitched laminates, predominantly around individual stitches. The glass stitched laminates showed significant microcracking even before cycling. Less microcracking was evident in the Kevlar stitched materials, whereas the <b>unstitched</b> uniweave material developed microcracks only after cycling. The 3 -D braid did not develop microcracks. The static compression strengths of the <b>unstitched</b> and Kevlar stitched uniweave materials were degraded by about 10 percent after 1280 temperature/humidity cycles, whereas the reduction in compression strength for the glass stitched uniweave was less than 3 percent. The reduction in compression strength for the glass stitched 2 -D braid was less than 8 percent. The <b>unstitched</b> 2 -D and 3 -D braids did not lose strength from temperature/humidity cycling.

The objectives of the studies are {{to determine the effects}} of stitching node position, stacking sequence, and hygrothermal environment on the bearing strength and the load–displacement curves of stitched laminates. A three-dimensional finite element model is also developed to investigate the bearing properties of mechanically fastened joints in <b>unstitched</b> and stitched laminates. Hashin’s three-dimensional failure criterion is used to predict the progressive ply failure. The stitching node position effect is of primary interest. A good agreement between experimental results and numerical predictions is observed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to characterize the effect of modified chain stitching on the delamination growth under mixed-mode I/II loading conditions. Delamination toughness under mode I is experimentally determined, for <b>unstitched</b> and stitched laminates, by using untabbed and tabbed double cantilever beam (TDCB) tests. The effect of the reinforcing tabs on mode I toughness is investigated. Stitching improves the energy release rate (ERR) up to 4 times in mode I. Mode II delamination toughness is evaluated in end-notched flexure (ENF) tests. Different geometries of stitched specimens are tested. Crack propagation occurs without any failure of stitching yarns. The final crack length attains the mid-span or it stops before and the specimen breaks in bending. The ERR is initially low and gradually increases with crack length to very high values. The mixedmode delamination behaviour is investigated using a mixed-mode bending (MMB) test. For <b>unstitched</b> specimens, a simple mixed-mode criterion is identified.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of stitching in increasing the damage resistance of polymer composites against ballistic projectiles and explosive blasts is determined. Glass-reinforced vinyl ester composites stitched in the through-thickness direction with thin Kevlar(r) - 49 yarn were impacted {{with a bullet}} travelling at 0. 9 km s- 1 or an underwater explosive shock wave moving at 1. 5 km s- 1. The amount of delamination damage to the composite caused by a ballistic projectile was reduced slightly with stitching. Stitching was highly effective in increasing the damage resistance against explosive blast loading. The increased damage resistance {{was due to the}} stitching raising the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the composite. While the stitched composites experienced slightly less damage, their flexural modulus and strength was similar to the properties of the <b>unstitched</b> composite after ballistic impact testing. The post-blast flexural properties of the stitched composites, on the other hand, were degraded less than the properties of the <b>unstitched</b> material...|$|R
