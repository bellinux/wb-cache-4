5|$|According to {{research}} into {{the effects of the}} F94L mutation, live weights of progeny are <b>unaffected</b> by random inheritance of the mutation.|$|E
5|$|Every line stays {{unchanged}} by the curve-shortening flow. Lines are {{the only}} curves that are <b>unaffected</b> by the curve-shortening flow, although there exist more complex stable networks of curves, such as the hexagonal tiling of the plane.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2013, Greinke {{was hit in}} {{the head}} and neck area by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. Because Greinke did not {{participate}} in the brawl, he was <b>unaffected.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely <b>unaffected</b> by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E
5|$|Android 4.1.1, used {{in various}} {{portable}} devices. Chris Smith writes in Boy Genius Report that {{just this one}} version of Android is affected {{but that it is}} a popular version of Android (Chitika claim 4.1.1 is on 50 million devices; Google describe it as less than 10% of activated Android devices). Other Android versions are not vulnerable as they either have heartbeats disabled or use an <b>unaffected</b> version of OpenSSL.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all <b>unaffected</b> by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, AML {{became the}} first cancer genome to be fully sequenced. DNA {{extracted}} from leukemic cells were compared to <b>unaffected</b> skin. The leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously {{been associated with the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of final}} short vowels in verbs, {{pre-stress}} lengthening in open syllables. Pre-stress lengthening/lowering becomes a surface filter that remains {{as a rule}} in the language, automatically affected any new short vowels in open syllables as they appear (but ultra-short vowels are <b>unaffected).</b>|$|E
5|$|Security experts {{found that}} the {{ransomware}} {{did not use the}} EternalBlue exploit to spread, and a simple method to vaccinate an <b>unaffected</b> machine running older Windows versions was found by October 24, 2017. Further, the sites that had been used to spread the bogus Flash updating have gone offline or removed the problematic files within a few days of its discovery, effectively killing off the spread of Bad Rabbit.|$|E
5|$|Seven years later, in 542, {{a devastating}} {{outbreak}} of Bubonic Plague, {{known as the}} Plague of Justinian and second only {{to that of the}} 14th century, laid siege to the world, killing tens of millions. As ruler of the Empire, Justinian, and members of his court, were physically <b>unaffected</b> by famine. However, the Imperial Court did prove susceptible to plague, with Justinian himself contracting, but surviving, the pestilence.|$|E
5|$|Several dry valleys {{originate}} on Llullaillaco, including Quebrada de las Zorritas on the north-northeastern slope, Quebrada El Salado and Quebrada Llullaillaco on {{the northwestern}} slope, and Quebrada La Barda on the southwestern slope. The Quebrada Llullaillaco drains into the Salar de Punta Negra {{northwest of the}} volcano. The volcano is relatively <b>unaffected</b> by water erosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs and}} nymphs are {{under attack by}} parasitoids {{including}} blow flies, flesh flies, and tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites. Female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer eggs and thus have fewer offspring than <b>unaffected</b> individuals.|$|E
5|$|The first chiral Lewis acid {{promoted}} asymmetric Nazarov cyclization {{was reported}} by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper (II) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98% ee. The enantiomeric excess was <b>unaffected</b> by use of 50mol% of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of partially competitive inhibition {{is similar to}} that of non-competitive, except that the EIS complex has catalytic activity, which may be lower or even higher (partially competitive activation) than that of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex. This inhibition typically displays a lower Vmax, but an <b>unaffected</b> Km value.|$|E
5|$|The present {{shape of}} the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full {{independence}} from Venetian suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted {{from the beginning of}} the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century. Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally <b>unaffected</b> by a strong earthquake occurring in 1667.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} from B. rufimanus seems <b>unaffected</b> by management practices and cultivar although little data is available. Because B. rufimanus biology is highly linked to crop development and climatic conditions, pest damage and pressure {{the next year}} can vary according to sowing and harvesting date. In addition, sanitation can help decreasing the source of B. rufimanus in production areas.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{was largely}} <b>unaffected</b> by war, though some animals were euthanised for safety reasons during the Second World War. After the war the park housed a brown bear named Voytek {{who had served}} with the Polish military. In 1972 one of the zoo's king {{penguins}} {{was adopted by the}} Norwegian military.|$|E
5|$|There are {{substantial}} fossil records of jawed fishes across the K–Pg boundary, which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates. While {{the deep sea}} realm was able to remain seemingly <b>unaffected,</b> there was an equal loss between the open marine apex predators and the durophagous demersal feeders on the continental shelf.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after Babs struck the Philippines, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared four provinces as a state of calamity and ordered the release of ₱200million (PHP) in emergency funds. Estrada later released an additional ₱50million (PHP) specifically for Catanduanes, as well as ₱10,000 sent {{to the family of}} each storm fatality. The Philippine Navy sent rubber boats to Bato, Catanduanes to help with relief there. The president ordered agencies to work together to respond to the disaster and for his Trade Secretary to watch for price gouging. However, food prices tripled following Babs and Zeb, especially after roads were blocked from agriculture areas, and ferries from <b>unaffected</b> areas were unable to travel due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively <b>unaffected</b> by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in <b>unaffected</b> samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly <b>unaffected</b> by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|As in ski jumping, team {{competitions}} {{are often}} included at ski flying events. These are contested {{as part of}} the World Cup, but points instead count towards a separate Nations Cup for teams; athletes' individual World Cup standings are <b>unaffected.</b> A national team is made up of four athletes selected by their head coach. There can be upwards of eight teams from different countries, providing they are able to field a full team of four.|$|E
5|$|As they travel, a {{man named}} Baxter (Michael Smiley), who is also <b>unaffected,</b> picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where there are crucified and hanged bodies. As the woman {{is about to be}} tortured, Jem kills Baxter. They {{continue}} traveling to the transmitter, while the woman has visions of past events. When they reach the transmitter, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti.|$|E
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, <b>unaffected</b> parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, the Slavs {{had settled}} the Baltic coast in Pomerania, which {{subsequently}} {{developed into a}} commercial and military power. Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively <b>unaffected</b> by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wiślanie), based in Kraków and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{moved to}} a farm in modern the Buenos Aires {{neighborhood}} of Núñez. The farm had some agriculture fields and a small brick factory. He lived next to other influential people like Cornelio Saavedra, Juan Larrea, Miguel de Azcuénaga, and attorney José Darragueira. The meetings of the secret society continued, <b>unaffected</b> by the departure of Burke. On June 2, 1806, Castelli's mother died, {{and he was still}} in mourning when the city learned of a British landing in Quilmes.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be <b>unaffected</b> by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become increasingly aggressive, while women increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain <b>unaffected,</b> since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet <b>unaffected</b> race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|First-series scenes {{featuring}} Fry driving an Alvis TE 21 {{were placed}} in jeopardy when the actor was caught speeding in May 2006. His counsel successfully postponed the hearing until December, allowing filming to resume <b>unaffected</b> (Fry was eventually banned from driving for six months). The first two episodes were directed by Robin Sheppard, {{the third and fourth}} by Metin Hüseyin and the final two by Sandy Johnson. A making-of special was filmed for the ITV3 Behind the Scenes strand and was broadcast on 27 May 2007, immediately following the end of episode six on ITV.|$|E
5|$|For his {{performance}} in the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. McKee completed 16 of 20 passes {{for a total of}} 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he had little effect on the game. Against the urging of his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee. He left {{near the end of the}} game, and was later discovered to have broken his previously <b>unaffected</b> leg in multiple places.|$|E
5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are <b>unaffected.</b> Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is <b>unaffected.</b> Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by a sequel, , which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001. Voiced by Dan Green in English with Ichimura reprising the role in Japanese, Mewtwo and the clones have since found peace in another region. However, Giovanni, whose memories were left intact after the first film, locates and pursues Mewtwo. Assisted by Ash and his companions, Mewtwo comes to terms with its existence and defeats Giovanni, removing any memory of itself from his and his soldiers' minds, while leaving the others <b>unaffected.</b> As everyone departs, Mewtwo sets out on its own.|$|E
5|$|In September 1989, Peterson outbid two challengers {{to acquire}} Stereo Super Stores, whose parent company had filed for {{bankruptcy}} the month before, paying $940,000 plus another $1,000,000 for inventory. The acquisition included a car stereo specialty shop at Mall 205, Car Stereo East. Peterson continued to operate the franchise's locations at Jantzen Beach and Washington Square Too without a branding change until March 1991, when he renamed them Tom Peterson Super Stores, as he did his original home electronics store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson explained that the original stores were performing better than the newly acquired outlets, {{so he decided to}} combine them. His other two stores and car specialty store were <b>unaffected.</b>|$|E
