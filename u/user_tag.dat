Generally, IPS are deployed in environments covered with obstacles such as furniture, walls, people and electronics influencing the signal propagation.

The geometry of the beacons {{is limited to the}} available infrastructure that can be deployed (number of beacons, basestations and tags), which leads to the following challenge: Given a limited number of beacons, where should they be placed in a specified indoor environment, such that the geometry contributes to optimal positioning results? This paper aims to propose a statistical model that is able to select the optimal configuration that satisfies the user requirements in terms of precision. The model requires the definition of a chosen 3 D space (in our case 7 &times; 10 &times; 6 meter), number of beacons, possible <b>user</b> <b>tag</b> locations and a performance threshold (e. g. required precision). For any given set of beacon and receiver locations, the precision, internal-and external reliability can be determined on forehand. As validation, the modeled precision has been compared with observed precision results. The measurements have been performed with an IPS of BlooLoc at a chosen set of <b>user</b> <b>tag</b> locations for a given geometric configuration.

This trend {{is driven by the}} assumption that <b>user</b> <b>tags</b> will improve video search. In this paper we study whether this is indeed the case. To this end, we create an evaluation dataset that consists of: (i) a set of videos <b>tagged</b> by <b>users</b> via video labelling game, (ii) a set of queries derived from real-life query logs, and (iii) relevance judgements. Besides <b>user</b> <b>tags</b> from the labelling game, we exploit the existing metadata associated with the videos (textual descriptions and curated in-house tags) and closed captions. Our findings show that search based on <b>user</b> <b>tags</b> alone outperforms search based on all other metadata types.

This leads to the following challenge: Given a limited number of beacons, where should they be placed in a specified indoor environment, such that the geometry contributes to optimal positioning results? This challenge is approached by using theoretical design computations. The design computations require the definition of a chosen 3 D space, the number of beacons, possible <b>user</b> <b>tag</b> locations and a performance threshold (e. g. required precision). For any given set of beacon and receiver locations, the precision, internal- and external reliability can be determined on forehand. The results of a given geometry have been validated by deploying an IPS of BlooLoc and comparing the observed precision with the modeled precision for a chosen set of <b>user</b> <b>tag</b> locations. The theoretical model showed a precision pattern with several equivalent precision patterns of the measured data, however, some significant differences could not be explained physically and the model has to be adapted further. Besides determining the precision based on a set of beacon and receiver locations, the model is able to select the optimal geometric configuration based on a performance threshold (e. g. required precision). Depending on the performance threshold, the optimal configurations can either be a single solution or consist of multiple solutions that satisfy the performance threshold of the customer. The performance threshold varies depending on the use case and the user requirements. Therefore, the amount of possible combinations in terms of 3 D space, amount of available beacons, possible beacon locations, <b>user</b> <b>tag</b> locations and performance thresholds are limitless and the model can thus be used for all kind of applications. All in all, the initial model (design computations) can be used by IPS customers for all kind of applications. The model is able to select the optimal geometric configuration in terms of precision based on a performance threshold specified by the user. Furthermore, the model requires user specified input parameters and the amount of possible combinations are therefore unlimited. Although the initial model has to be adapted further to account for the differences in modeled and measured data as a consequence of environmental factors, the initial model is a good initiative for the rising indoor positioning market and its customers. Therefore, the model can be adapted further such that it can explain significant differences between the modeled and the measured data by including factors that influence the system performance in real life, such as materialistic properties, signal attenuation, interference, multipath, NLOS etc...|$|E

Previous {{research has shown that}} tags may facilitate improved web search in an environment where each tagging action generates a (<b>user,</b> <b>tag,</b> resource) triple. For websites operated by a public institution, operational or privacy concerns may prevent the recording of data capable of identifying individuals. This leads to a simpler anonymous tagging system but is likely to reduce user motivation for tagging, since the user cannot access their own set of tags. It also means that votes for tags are not counted, and a potentially useful joining attribute is not available. Using webpage, metadata, query, click, anchortext and tag data provided by a public museum, we demonstrate that, despite these limitations, tag data collected by an anonymous tagging system has the potential to improve retrieval effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Tag {{clouds are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular with websites that utilize social tagging to categorize ever expanding collections of digital information. Tagging {{has been found to}} be more adaptable than traditional classification, as well as more prone to serendipitous information discovery. The flexibility of tagging systems allows users to rapidly adopt new terms and engage in extremely dynamic tagging practices, yet tag clouds are not able to represent agile shifts in tagging patterns. Over time, semantic and linguistic changes can modify the meaning and form of tags, and changes in tagging behavior can create disconnects between related tags. By conceiving tagging as a triad: object, <b>user,</b> <b>tag,</b> we completely miss the critical notion of time. Time leads to changes in semantics, vocabulary, behavior, and syntax. In order to address the problem of aging tags and aging folksonomies, we really need to include time as a critical facet of tagging: object, <b>user,</b> <b>tag,</b> time. The adaptive behavior of tags requires that there is a constant influx of new descriptive data about an object, but time-related changes have to overcome the weight of the pre-existing tags. In this poster we propose a new tag-cloud visualization technique that attempts to address these issues by including a dynamic factor: the changing weight of tags over time. Background The number of websites that support tagging has rapidly increased since 2003, with sites such as Del. icio. us, Flickr. com, Technorati. com, and Librarything. com, gaining increasing popularity. Each of the sites is specialized, allowing users to store, organize, and later retrieve specific digital resources. For example, Del. icio. us was designed for the sole purpose of tagging URLs, Flickr. com allows tagging of photographs, Technorati. com tracks the tagging of blogs, and Librarything. com of personal book collections. These tags produce a flat namespace, meaning that there is no hierarchy among terms, and no specified parent-child relationship between terms. Although the flat namespace frees users from a rigid structure, it also creates complexity around resource retrieval. Tools such as tag clouds- which visually display tags by frequency- attempt to aid retrieval through a compact representation that "draws the eye towards the largest, and presumably most important items, " (Hearst and Rosner 2008) ...|$|E

Empirical analysis shows that each interpretation scheme forms a distinct data representation which eventually affects the recommendation result.

The usage represents the characteristic of <b>user</b> <b>tagging</b> behaviour in the system. The results also demonstrate how the scheme is able to address the cold-start user problem...|$|R

Third, the logic offers several operators to combine the assessments made over the statements of our interest.

40|$|As the {{popularity}} of the web increases, particularly the use of social networking sites and Web 2. 0 style sharing platforms, users are becoming increasingly connected, sharing more and more information, resources, and opinions. This vast array of information presents unique opportunities to harvest knowledge about user activities and interests through the exploitation of large-scale, complex systems. Communal tagging sites, and their respective folksonomies, are one example of such a complex system, providing huge amounts of information about users, spanning multiple domains of interest. However, the current Web infrastructure provides no mechanism for users to consolidate and exploit this information since it is spread over many desperate and unconnected resources. In this paper we compare user tag-clouds from multiple folksonomies to: (a) show how they tend to overlap, regardless of the focus of the folksonomy (b) demonstrate how this comparison helps finding and aligning the user’s separate identities, and (c) show that cross-linking distributed user tag-clouds enriches users profiles. During this process, we find that significant user interests are often reflected in multiple Web 2. 0 profiles, even though they may operate over different domains.
