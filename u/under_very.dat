5|$|In 1950, Reynolds won 16 games, {{even though}} he pitched with bone chips in his elbow for the entire season. His {{remarkable}} 1951 season began <b>under</b> <b>very</b> difficult conditions. Floating chips in his elbow prevented him from throwing a single pitch in spring training. He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost him {{at least half of}} the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University recommended against surgery. Reynolds appeared in his first game one week after the season started.|$|E

Although wounded himself, Lieut. DENNY personally obtained assistance for two of his men who were wounded. He then reorganised his command and succeeded in reaching his destination. Lieut. DENNY after delivering this water then went to the dressing station where he dictated a report to D.H.Q. before being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|On 12–13 April 1916 near Beit Ayeesa, Mesopotamia, Naik Shahamad Khan was {{in charge}} of a machine-gun {{covering}} a gap in our new line within 150 yards of the entrenched enemy. He beat off three counter-attacks and worked his gun single-handed after all his men, except two belt-fillers, had become casualties. For three hours he held the gap <b>under</b> <b>very</b> heavy fire and when his gun was knocked out, he and his two belt-fillers held their ground with rifles until ordered to withdraw. With help he then brought back his gun, ammunition and one severely wounded man, and finally all remaining arms and equipment.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September, {{a platoon}} of the 2/25th Infantry Battalion came <b>under</b> <b>very</b> heavy fire from a {{concealed}} Japanese machine gun near Heath's Plantation that wounded a number of Australians, including Corporal W. H. (Billy) Richards, and halted the platoon's advance. Private Richard Kelliher suddenly, on his own initiative, dashed toward the post and hurled two grenades at it, which killed some of the Japanese defenders but not all. He returned to his section, seized a Bren gun, dashed back to the enemy post and silenced it. He then asked permission to go out again to rescue the wounded Richards, which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position. Kelliher was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|The 55 Cancri {{system is}} located fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: the Hipparcos {{astrometry}} satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 81.03 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 12.3 parsecs (40.3 light years). 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just {{visible to the naked}} eye <b>under</b> <b>very</b> dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one thousand times the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.|$|E
5|$|The new {{industrial}} workforce often {{lived and}} worked <b>under</b> <b>very</b> poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left their jobs in protest could find themselves arrested by the mounted police {{under the terms of}} the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the vagrancy laws. Although the position of organised labour was weak in Canada – the trade unions only had very limited legal rights – the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly used for this purpose, but the mounted police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be more politically reliable.|$|E

5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play <b>under</b> <b>very</b> unfavourable conditions, notably that {{he would need to}} finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match, and he would need to win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge {{of one of the}} main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity <b>under</b> <b>very</b> trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Most historians sharply criticize Davis for his flawed {{military}} strategy, {{his selection}} of friends for military commands, and his neglect of homefront crises. Until {{late in the}} war, he resisted efforts to appoint a general-in-chief, essentially handling those duties himself. On January 31, 1865, Lee assumed this role, but it was far too late. Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources of the South and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater (e.g., the capture of New Orleans in early 1862). He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were <b>under</b> <b>very</b> heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg, Vicksburg simultaneously fell, and the Union {{took control of the}} Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi River rested primarily on Davis's inability to create a harmonious departmental arrangement or to force such generals as Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and Theophilus H. Holmes to work together.|$|E

5|$|Six {{hours after}} being {{declared}} a tropical disturbance, MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status, {{and the agency}} predicted the system would eventually reach peak winds of 130km/h (80mph) before moving ashore. Its track was expected to follow that of another tropical cyclone east of Madagascar, which would become Tropical Storm Eric. Late on January18, the system briefly became disorganized, only to re-organize and attain tropical storm status on January19; upon doing so, the Malagasy Weather Service named it Fanele. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing advisories on the storm. The agency noted uncertainty in the future track of the storm, due to interaction with Tropical Storm Eric east of Madagascar, and Fanele was located within an area of weak steering currents. Tropical Storm Fanele quickly strengthened, developing an eye feature, and late on January19 the JTWC estimated sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph); the agency predicted further strengthening to peak winds of 140km/h (85mph). Around that time, Fanele began rapid deepening <b>under</b> <b>very</b> favorable environmental conditions, and the MFR upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status with winds of 150km/h (95mph). Upon attaining tropical cyclone status, the MFR forecast Fanele would intensify further to peak winds of 185km/h (115mph).|$|E
