50|$|The classic {{inverted}} pendulum is {{an example}} of a trivially <b>underactuated</b> system: it has two degrees of freedom (one for its support's motion in the horizontal plane, and one for the angular motion of the pendulum), but only one of them (the cart position) is actuated, and the other is only indirectly controlled.

50|$|Underactuation is a {{technical}} term used in robotics and control theory to describe mechanical systems that cannot be commanded to follow arbitrary trajectories in configuration space.

50|$|Typically three coils are used, {{although}} reduced {{configurations of}} two or even one magnet can suffice where full attitude control is not needed or external forces like asymmetric drag allow <b>underactuated</b> control. The three coil assembly usually {{takes the form of}} three perpendicular coils, because this setup equalizes the rotational symmetry of the fields which can be generated; no matter how the external field and the craft are placed with respect to each other, approximately the same torque can always be generated simply by using different amounts of current on the three different coils.|$|E

50|$|The {{desire to}} build {{tall and narrow}} mobile robots that do not tip over led to {{development}} of balancing mobile robots like the ballbot. A ballbot generally has a body that balances {{on top of a}} single spherical wheel (ball). It forms an <b>underactuated</b> system, i.e., there are more degrees of freedom (DOF) than there are independent control inputs. The ball is directly controlled using actuators, whereas the body has no direct control. The body is kept upright about its unstable equilibrium point by controlling the ball, much like the control of an inverted pendulum. This leads to limited but perpetual position displacements of the ballbot. The counter-intuitive aspect of the ballbot motion is that in order to move forward, the body has to lean forward and in order to lean forward, the ball must roll backwards. All these characteristics make planning to achieve desired motions for the ballbot a challenging task. In order to achieve a forward straight line motion, the ballbot has to lean forward to accelerate and lean backward to decelerate. Further, the ballbot has to lean into curves in order to compensate for centripetal forces, which results in elegant and graceful motions.|$|E

40|$|The {{particular}} {{category of}} the <b>underactuated</b> grippers is chosen for the automation of the item picking in distribution centers. The <b>underactuated</b> grippers have fewer degrees of actuation than degrees of freedom, so they are mechanically simpler than the fully-actuated grippers, and {{they are able to}} adapt to objects regardless of their shapes. However, the existing <b>underactuated</b> grippers found in the literature are regarded overdesigned because more than enough passive elements are included. This paper is aimed to design and build a more simplified but still workable <b>underactuated</b> gripper for the item picking. The designed gripper contains a cable-pulley driven <b>underactuated</b> finger which has two phalanges, and an opposite fixed finger. Moreover, the fingertip of the <b>underactuated</b> finger is intended to move along the ground where the target object is laid. The dimensions of the gripper are selected in order to achieve the following two tasks: picking the cylindrical objects from the ground and retaining the grasp during a lifting transportation. The experiment setup fails to drive the fingertip of the <b>underactuated</b> finger moving along the ground, but it is shown that the designed gripper is still able to fulfill these two tasks, except for the case that when the initial spacing between the moving <b>underactuated</b> finger and the object is rather large.

Control of <b>underactuated</b> systems is currently an active field of research due to their broad applications in Robotics, Aerospace Vehicles, and Marine Vehicles. The examples of <b>underactuated</b> systems include flexible-link robots, nobile robots, walking robots, robots on mobile platforms, cars, locomotive systems, snake-type and swimming robots, acrobatic robots, aircraft, spacecraft, helicopters, satellites, surface vessels, and underwater vehicles. Based on recent surveys, control of general <b>underactuated</b> systems is a major open problem. Almost all real-life mechanical systems possess kinetic symmetry properties, i. e. their kinetic energy does not depend on a subset of configuration variables called external variables. In this work, I exploit such symmetry properties as a means of reducing the complexity of control design for <b>underactuated</b> systems. As a result, reduction and nonlinear control of high-order <b>underactuated</b> systems with kinetic symmetry is the main focus of this thesis. By "reduction", we mean a procedure to reduce control design for the original <b>underactuated</b> system to control of a lowerorder nonlinear or mechanical system. One way to achieve such a reduction is by transforming an <b>underactuated</b> system to a cascade nonlinear system with structural properties. If all <b>underactuated</b> systems in a class can be transformed into a specific class of nonlinear systems, we refer to the transformed systems as the "normal form" of the corresponding class of <b>underactuated</b> systems. Our main contribution is to find explicit change of coordinates and control that transform several classes of <b>underactuated</b> systems, which appear in robotics and aerospace applications, into cascade nonlinear systems with structural properties that are convenient for control design purposes. The obtained cascade normal forms are three classes of nonlinear systems, namely, systems in strict feedback form, feedforward form, and nontriangular linear-quadratic form. The names of these three classes are due to the particular lower-triangular, upper-triangular, and nontriangular structure in which the state variables appear in the dynamics of the corresponding nonlinear systems. The triangular normal forms of <b>underactuated</b> systems can be controlled using existing backstepping and feedforwarding procedures. However, control of the nontriangular normal forms is a major open problem. We address this problem for important classes of nontriangular systems of interest by introducing a new stabilization method based on the solutions of fixed-point equations as stabilizing nonlinear state feedback laws. This controller is obtained via a simple recursive method that is convenient for implementation. For special classes of nontriangular nonlinear systems, such fixed-point equations can be solved explicitly [...] . by Reza Olfati-Saber. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{property}} of form-closure of a grasp, as generally {{defined in the}} literature, {{is based on the}} assumption that contact points between the hand and the object are fixed in space. However, this assumption is false when considering a grasp exerted by an <b>underactuated</b> hand, since in this case, it is not possible to control the position of each phalanx independently. In spite of researchers' interest in studying form-closure, none of the available published work on this subject takes into consideration the particular kinematics of <b>underactuated</b> hands. Actually, there are few available tools to qualify or quantify the stability of a grasp exerted by an <b>underactuated</b> hand, thus the design of <b>underactuated</b> hands mostly results from an intuitive approach. This paper aims to reduce this gap. A classification of <b>underactuated</b> hands is proposed, based on the expression of contact forces. This highlights the influence of non-backdrivable mechanisms introduced in the transmission of the closing motion of the hand on the stability of the grasp. The way to extend the original definition of form-closure to <b>underactuated</b> grasps is illustrated. A more general definition is formulated, which checks the stability of the set "object + hand". Using this new definition, a simple rule is proposed for designing a hand capable of achieving 1 st order form-closed grasps.
