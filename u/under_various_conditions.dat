Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years <b>under</b> <b>various</b> <b>conditions</b> but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E

The pipette is filled with ionic solution, and a silver wire {{is placed in the}} solution to conduct and amplify electrical signals. The ion solution can be varied and drugs can be delivered through the micropipette to study the effects of current <b>under</b> <b>various</b> <b>conditions.</b> Receptor and voltage-gated channel antagonists are often applied (i.e. nickel used to block NMDA receptors) in order to study the effects of ion channels on dendritic spike initiation. Current injection is often paired with patch clamp recordings in order to observe current modulation due to various experimental factors.|$|E
