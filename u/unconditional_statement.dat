6000|$|The last {{allegation}} evinces Rousseau's usual {{ignorance of}} history, and {{need not be}} discussed, any more than his proposition on which he lays so much stress, that Christians cannot possibly be good soldiers, nor truly good citizens, because their hearts being fixed upon another world, they must necessarily be indifferent to {{the success or failure}} of such enterprises as they may take up in this.[252] In reading the Social Contract, and some other of the author's writings besides, we have constantly to interpret the direct, positive, categorical form of assertion into something of this kind--"Such and such consequences ought logically to follow from the meaning of the name, or the definition of a principle, or from such and such motives." [...] The change of this moderate form of provisional assertion into the <b>unconditional</b> <b>statement</b> that such and such consequences have actually followed, constantly lands the author in propositions which any reader who tests them by an appeal to the experience of mankind, written and unwritten, at once discovers to be false and absurd. Rousseau himself took less trouble to verify his conclusions by such an appeal to experience than any writer that ever lived in a scientific age. The other remark to be made on the above section is that the rejection of the Christian or ecclesiastical division of the powers of the church and the powers of the state, is the strongest illustration that could be found of the debt of Rousseau's conception of a state to the old pagan conception. It was the main characteristic of the polities which Christian monotheism and feudalism together succeeded in replacing, to recognise no such division as that between church and state, pope and emperor. Rousseau resumed the old conception. But he adjusted it in a certain degree to the spirit of his own time, and imposed certain philosophical limitations upon it. His scheme is as follows.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a review and {{evaluation}} of a policy argument {{in a recent issue}} of Management Science. Mitroff, Mason and Barabba presented a case study of a policy model, built around the problem of undercounting minorities in the U. S. Census, in a Toulmin format. We restructure this model as a Boolean system with both conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>statements,</b> preserving both the MMB arguments and the Toulmin format. It is shown that there is an error in the buildup of the MMB model. This error does not change the end result that their model is a contradiction, however it is much earlier to see this fact with the Boolean formulation than with a verbal presentation only. We discuss the potential usefulness of this type of modelling for policy capture, including some of the difficulties of employing the Toulmin format. symbolic logic, Boolean, policy, Toulmin, policy capture...|$|R

40|$|Scholarly work on {{population}} includes many mechanisms accounting {{for changes in}} the components of population: births, deaths, and migration. Very little of this is used by forecasters, or even referred to in the forecasting texts. The present review of the more promising theory and empirical reports in demographic journals has as its object their incorporation in forecasting techniques. Some of the theory relates population to variables pertaining to the economy, to technology, or to social change; to use such models would require forecasts of the independent variables of the models. We know much about how fertility depends on income, but until we can forecast income (say 20 years ahead) that relation tells nothing about future population. Some theory relates population to variables difficult to measure, like the utility of children. Other parts again, like the demographic transition, are of uncertain timing. Much of mathematical demography constitutes comparative statics, which are conditional, whereas the user of forecasts requires <b>unconditional</b> <b>statements.</b> The perspective of usefulness for forecasting provides an illuminating, if severe, review of contemporary population research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In 2005, Ginger Myles and Hongxia Jin {{proposed}} a software watermarking {{scheme based on}} converting jump instructions or <b>unconditional</b> branch <b>statements</b> (UBSs) by calls to a fingerprint branch function (FBF) that computes the correct target address of the UBS {{as a function of}} the generated fingerprint and integrity check. If the program is tampered with, the fingerprint and integrity checks change and the target address will not be computed correctly. In this paper, we present an attack based on tracking stack pointer modifications to break the scheme and provide implementation details. The key element of the attack is to remove the fingerprint and integrity check generating code from the program after disassociating the target address from the fingerprint and integrity value. Using the debugging tools that give vast control to the attacker to track stack pointer operations, we perform both subtractive and watermark replacement attacks. The major steps in the attack are automated resulting in a fast and low-cost attack...|$|R
25|$|Assignment statements, in {{imperative}} paradigm, {{perform an}} operation on information located in memory and store {{the results in}} memory for later use. High-level imperative languages, in addition, permit the evaluation of complex expressions, which may consist {{of a combination of}} arithmetic operations and function evaluations, and the assignment of the resulting value to memory. Looping statements (as in while loops, do while loops, and for loops) allow a sequence of statements to be executed multiple times. Loops can either execute the statements they contain a predefined number of times, or they can execute them repeatedly until some condition changes. Conditional branching statements allow a sequence of statements to be executed only if some condition is met. Otherwise, the statements are skipped and the execution sequence continues from the <b>statement</b> following them. <b>Unconditional</b> branching <b>statements</b> allow an execution sequence to be transferred to another part of a program. These include the jump (called goto in many languages), switch, and the subprogram, subroutine, or procedure call (which usually returns to the next statement after the call).|$|R
25|$|The PDU was {{especially}} {{critical of the}} National Jewish Council, a triumvirate of Jewish politicians in Bukovina: Ebner, Pistiner, Benno Straucher. When the Council, reacting against Romania's failure to emancipate its Jewish communities, called for international sanctions, Glasul Bucovinei resorted to antisemitic campaigning. In the 1919 suffrage, Nistor enlisted (or, according to Flondor's supporters, coerced) Jewish inspector Heini Teller into registering in as a traveling companion of the PDU, but Teller eventually withdrew from the race when faced with his coreligionists' indignant reaction. The PDU list of Senate candidates then included Jewish entrepreneur Jakob Hecht. Hecht spoke in favor of complete and <b>unconditional</b> union, in <b>statements</b> which, at the time, infuriated the Jewish Council. The Senate list was completed by another Jew, Iosif Vihovici of Coțmani.|$|R
40|$|In 2006, Gaurav Gupta and Josef Pieprzyk {{presented}} {{an attack on}} the branch-based software watermarking scheme proposed by Ginger Myles and Hongxia Jin in 2005. The software watermarking model is based on replacing jump instructions or <b>unconditional</b> branch <b>statements</b> (UBS) by calls to a fingerprint branch function (FBF) that computes the correct target address of the UBS {{as a function of the}} generated fingerprint and integrity check. If the program is tampered with, the fingerprint and/or integrity checks change and the target address is not computed correctly. Gupta and Pieprzyk's attack uses debugger capabilities such as register and address lookup and breakpoints to minimize the requirement to manually inspect the software. Using these resources, the FBF and calls to the same is identified, correct displacement values are generated and calls to FBF are replaced by the original UBS transferring control of the attack to the correct target instruction. In this paper, we propose a watermarking model that provides security against such debugging attacks. Two primary measures taken are shifting the stack pointer modification operation from the FBF to the individual UBSs, and coding the stack pointer modification in the same language as that of the rest of the code rather than assembly language to avoid conspicuous contents. The manual component complexity increases from O (1) in the previous scheme to O (n) in our proposed scheme. </p...|$|R

Theoretical survey revealed that, in scientific literature, financial ratios are analysed in order to designate which ratios of the financial statements are the most sensitive in relation with the motifs of executive managers and employees of companies to commit frauds. Empirical study included the analysis of the following: 1) 40 sets of fraudulent financial statements and 2) 125 sets of non-fraudulent financial <b>statements</b> (<b>unconditional</b> audit report was issued for the sets {{of financial}} statements of these companies). The aim of the research is to distinguish financial ratios, the values of which could indicate the fraud in financial statements. Moreover, the logistic regression model of fraud detection in financial statements has been developed. The research is unique for being the first empirical study of its type in Lithuania...|$|R

It can model basic programming and verification constructs such as conditional tests, while loops, and Hoare triples, thus providing {{a relatively simple}} equational approach to program equivalence and partial correctness. In this paper we show how KAT {{can be used to}} give a rigorous equational treatment of control constructs involving nonlocal transfer of control such as <b>unconditional</b> jumps, loop <b>statements</b> with multi-level breaks, and exception handlers. We develop a compositional semantics and a complete equational axiomatization. The approach has some novel technical features, including a treatment of multi-level break statements that is reminiscent of de Bruijn indices in the variable-free lambda calculus. We illustrate the use of the system by giving a purely calculational proof that every deterministic flowchart is equivalent to a loop program with multi-level breaks...|$|R
