40|$|Background: Increased {{frequency}} of arbovirus outbreaks in East Africa necessitated {{the determination of}} distribution of risk by entomologic arbovirus surveillance. A systematic vector surveillance programme spanning 5 years and covering 11 sites representing seven of the eight provinces in Kenya and located in diverse ecological zones was carried out. Methods: Mosquitoes were sampled bi-annually during the wet seasons and screened for arboviruses. Mosquitoes were identified to species, pooled by species, collection date and site and screened for arboviruses by isolation in cell culture and/or RT-PCR screening and sequencing. Results: Over 450, 000 mosquitoes in 15, 890 pools were screened with 83 viruses being detected/isolated that include members of the alphavirus, flavivirus and orthobunyavirus genera {{many of which are}} known to be of significant public health importance in the East African region.

40|$|Two {{species of}} {{arbovirus}} vector, Culex torrentium and Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae), occur in several European countries, but difficulties in their accurate identification and discrimination have hampered both detailed and large-scale distribution and abundance studies. Using a molecular identification method, we identified to species 2559 larvae of Cx. [*]pipiens/torrentium collected from 138 sites in 13 European countries ranging from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean coast. In addition, samples of 1712 males of Cx. [*]pipiens/torrentium collected at several {{sites in the}} Czech Republic were identified to species based on the morphology of their hypopygia. We found that the two species occur together in large areas of Europe, and that Cx. [*]torrentium dominates in northern Europe and Cx. [*]pipiens dominates south of the Alps. The transition in dominance occurs in central Europe, where both species are roughly equally common. There was {{a strong correlation between}} the length of the growing season at different sites and occurrences of the two species. As the growing season increases, the proportion and detection of Cx.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{circulation}} of West Nile virus and <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> was {{detected in the}} Emilia-Romagna region in 2008 and 2009. To evaluate the extent of {{circulation of}} both viruses, environmental surveillance, based on bird and mosquito testing, was conducted in 2008 and gradually improved over the years. METHODS: In February-March 2009 - 2011, 5, 993 hibernating mosquitoes were manually sampled, out of which 80. 1 % were Culex pipiens; none {{tested positive for the}} viruses. From 2008 to 2011, 946, 213 mosquitoes, sampled between May and October, were tested; 86. 5 % were Cx. pipiens. West Nile virus was detected in 32 Cx. pipiens pools, and <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> was detected in 229 mosquito pools (217 Cx. pipiens, 10 Aedes albopictus, one Anopheles maculipennis s. l., and one Aedes caspius). From 2009 to 2011, of 4, 546 birds collected, 42 tested positive for West Nile virus and 48 for <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus.</b> West Nile virus and <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> showed different patterns of activity during the 2008 - 2011 surveillance period. West Nile virus was detected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but not in 2011. <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus,</b> however, was continuously active throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The data strongly suggest that both viruses overwinter in the surveyed area rather than being continually reintroduced every season. The lack of hibernating mosquitoes testing positive for the viruses and the presence of positive birds sampled early in the season support the hypothesis that the viruses overwinter in birds rather than in mosquitoes. Herd immunity in key bird species could explain the decline of West Nile virus observed in 2011, while the persistence of <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> may be explained by not yet identified reservoirs. Reported results are comparable with a peri-Mediterranean circulation of the West Nile virus lineage 1 related strain, which became undetectable in the environment after two to three years of obvious circulation...|$|E
40|$|Mosquito {{species of}} the Culex genus are the {{enzootic}} vectors for several bird-associated viruses that cause disease in humans. In Europe, these viruses include Sindbis (SINV), West Nile and <b>Usutu</b> <b>viruses.</b> The morphologically similar females of Cx. torrentium and Cx. pipiens are potential vectors of these viruses, but difficulties in correctly identifying the mosquito species have caused confusion regarding their respective distribution, abundance, ecology, and consequently their importance as vectors. Species-specific knowledge from correctly identified field material is however of crucial importance since previous {{research shows that the}} relatively unknown Cx. torrentium is a far more efficient SINV vector than the widely recognized Cx. pipiens. The latter is involved in the transmission of several other viruses, but its potential importance for SINV transmission is debated. In this thesis I describe the development of a molecular method for species identification, based on reliably identified males of Cx. torrentium and Cx. pipiens. This identification method was then used in consecutive studies on the distribution and relative abundance of the two species in Sweden and 12 other European countries, SINV field infection rates in mosquitoes identified to species level, and evaluation of potential trap bias associated with common sampling techniques. The results showed that Cx. torrentium is a far more common species in Europe than previously assumed. In Sweden and Finland, it is the dominant species, accounting for 89 % of the sampled Culex population. In central Europe, it is equally common to Cx. pipiens, while Cx. pipiens dominates south of the Alps Mountain range. Larvae of both species are often found together in both artificial containers (e. g. car tires) and natural sites. Also, a trapping bias against Cx. torrentium was revealed for CDC-traps. For the first time, SINV was isolated from species-identified Cx. torrentium and Cx. pipiens mosquitoes caught in the field, with Cx. torrentium being superior in infection rates (36 / 1, 000 vs. 8. 2 / 1, 000). Future studies on SINV, as well as other mosquito-borne bird viruses in Europe, can hopefully gain from the baseline information provided here, and from principles of vector discrimination discussed in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The Flavivirus is a genus of RNA {{viruses that}} {{includes}} multiple long known human, animal and zoonotic pathogens such as Dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus or Japanese encephalitis virus, {{as well as}} other less known viruses that represent potential threats for human and animal health such as <b>Usutu</b> or Zika <b>viruses.</b> Flavivirus replication is based on endoplasmic reticulum-derived structures. Membrane remodeling and accumulation of viral factors induce endoplasmic reticulum stress that results in activation of a cellular signaling response termed unfolded protein response (UPR), which can be modulated by the viruses for their own benefit. Concomitant with the activation of the UPR, an upregulation of the autophagic pathway in cells infected with different flaviviruses has also been described. This review addresses the current knowledge of the relationship between endoplasmic reticulum stress, UPR and autophagy in flavivirus-infected cells and the growing evidences for an involvement of these cellular pathways in the replication and pathogenesis of these viruses...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, many flaviviruses are endemic (West Nile, <b>Usutu,</b> tick-borne {{encephalitis}} <b>viruses)</b> or occasionally imported (dengue, yellow fever viruses). Due to the temporal and geographical co-circulation of flaviviruses in Europe, flavivirus differentiation by diagnostic tests {{is crucial in}} the adaptation of surveillance and control efforts. Serological diagnosis of flavivirus infections {{is complicated by the}} antigenic similarities among the Flavivirus genus. Indeed, most flavivirus antibodies are directed against the highly immunogenic envelope protein, which contains both flavivirus cross-reactive and virus-specific epitopes. Serological assay results should thus be interpreted with care and confirmed by comparative neutralization tests using a panel of viruses known to circulate in Europe. However, antibody cross-reactivity could be advantageous in efforts to control emerging flaviviruses because it ensures partial cross-protection. In contrast, it might also facilitate subsequent diseases, through a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement mainly described for dengue virus infections. Here, we review the serological methods commonly used in WNV diagnosis and surveillance in Europe. By examining past and current epidemiological situations in different European countries, we present the challenges involved in interpreting flavivirus serological tests and setting up appropriate surveillance programs; we also address the consequences of flavivirus circulation and vaccination for host immunity...|$|R

(3 – 5). Also, <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> was isolated once from a man with fever and rash (3). In Africa, Culex mosquitoes and birds are responsible for transmission and circulation of the virus in nature; however, the infection does not cause overt disease in the local host species. Since its introduction to Europe, <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> has shown substantial pathogenicity for several wild bird species and causes severe die-offs, especially in the Eurasian blackbird (T. merula) populations.

Prompt identification and discrimination between WNV and JEV provides critical epidemiological data for prevalence studies and public and animal health management policies. Here we describe a quantitative one-step duplex TaqMan RT-PCR, targeting non-structural protein 2 A gene (NS 2 A-qRT-PCR), based on only one primer pair and two probes for differential diagnosis of WNV and JEV. Also this assay enables the detection of both WNV lineages (WNV- 1 and WNV- 2). To access the specificity of NS 2 A-qRT-PCR a panel of different arboviruses were used. The assay was shown to be specific for both WNV lineages (WNV- 1 and WNV- 2), WNV related Kunjin virus and JEV, since no cross-reactions were observed with other tested arboviruses. Sensitivity of the assay was determined using serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA from WNV and JEV. The duplex NS 2 A-qRT-PCR assay was shown to be very sensitive, being able to detect 10 copies of WNV and JEV RNA. This assay is a suitable tool for the diagnosis of WNV and JEV, and provides a valuable addition to the methods currently available for routine diagnosis of these zoonoses and for surveillance studies...|$|R

Mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been isolated and characterized in Northern Italy: West Nile virus and <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> were detected in mosquitoes and in different host species and recent studies provided evidence about the circulation of “insect Flavivirus” strains. Methods In order to clarify the diffusion {{and the distribution of}} the mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses in Italy, we analyzed Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes collected in 2009 and 2010 in an area divided evenly between hills and plains and where the landscape is dominated by mixed agricultural patches, rice fields, deciduous tree forests, and urban environments. Each mosquito pool was tested for the presence of Flavivirus strains and we characterized positive samples by genetic sequencing. Results Positive mosquito pools revealed low infection prevalence, but suggested a continuous circulation of both <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> and insect Flavivirus. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses based on NS 5 gene partial sequences showed a closer relationship among new <b>Usutu</b> <b>virus</b> strains from Piedmont and the reference sequences from the Eastern Europe, with respect to Italian samples characterized so far. Moreover, NS 5 gene phylogeny suggested that mosquito flaviviruses found in Italy could belong to different lineages.

USUV is transmitted by mosquitoes and, as any other flavivirus, is an enveloped plus-strand RNA virus. The virus was first isolated from Culex neavei mosquitoes in South Africa in 1959 near the Usutu River, from where it takes its name. Since then, the virus was confined to Africa until its first detection in Austria in 2001, although it was probably present in Europe since 1996 or even earlier. After that, USUV has spread throughout Europe, causing a considerable mortality among birds and a few neurologic cases in humans. The main USUV natural hosts are birds, but infection has also been reported in other vertebrate species, including humans. The fast spread of the virus through the continent, the relatively high mortality caused in birds, and the recent neuroinvasive human cases related to USUV infection reported in Europe have raised serious concerns about its possible consequences for public health.
