50|$|The Queen granted {{consent for}} the design in April 2010 and the States of Jersey opened a public {{consultation}} for the new ensign. Following the consultation the States of Jersey unanimously agreed to introduce the Jersey red ensign in June 2010. The Economic Development Minister, Alan Maclean, stated that adoption of the new Jersey Red Ensign would be voluntary and Jersey registered vessels could continue to fly the British red ensign if they wished to. Owners of <b>unregistered</b> <b>ships</b> would be obliged to register them should they wish {{to use the new}} Jersey Red Ensign.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is still}} unclear whether US or other naval vessels {{were present in the}} {{vicinity}} of the disaster. At the time of the collision, radio recordings and verbal accounts imply that <b>unregistered</b> <b>ships</b> were probably present, and transfers from cargo ships bearing munitions were alleged. The presence of U.S. Navy ships [...] - [...] or military ships from other nations [...] - [...] was repeatedly reported, but their real presence, identity and activities are currently unknown. American ships frequently visited the harbor, as Camp Darby is nearby. The presence of undercover military ships was not unusual; neither was the use of fake names when ships were employed in secret military activities. Arms traffic in the Livorno harbor was allegedly linked to the disaster, as an explanation of the covert ship movements and of bureaucratic hurdles encountered when seeking official documents from the military commands.|$|R
5000|$|Some time earlier, Gainsbourg was {{investigating}} an <b>unregistered</b> Russian <b>ship</b> that had mysteriously docked in Neo Kobe Harbor. With {{the help of}} cowardly security guard, Steevo (Tetsuya Yanagihara), the two board the vessel, {{only to find the}} entire crew slaughtered. Gainsbourg tells Steevo to run off, and soon afterward meets another Rug Hunt member named Robin Goodman (Takehito Koyasu). Goodman claims that he was ordered to eliminate all those on board and to [...] "secure the cargo." [...] When asked about the contents of the cargo, Goodman cryptically states that the ship holds [...] "great fear." ...|$|R

50|$|James Busby {{proposed}} that New Zealand {{should have a}} national flag, after an <b>unregistered</b> New Zealand <b>ship</b> was seized in Australia. A selection {{of three or four}} designs was sent from Australia, and one was chosen by the Māori chiefs at a meeting at his residency on 20 March 1834; see United Tribes of New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Becoming {{aware of}} the lawless nature of European {{settlement}} and of increasing French interest in the territory, the British government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832. Busby failed to bring law and order to European settlement, but did oversee {{the introduction of the}} first national flag on 20 March 1834, after an <b>unregistered</b> New Zealand <b>ship</b> was seized in Australia. The nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand later, in October 1835, sent the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand to King William IV of the United Kingdom, asking him for protection. Ongoing unrest and the legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to New Zealand to claim sovereignty for the British Crown and negotiate a treaty with the Māori. The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840. The drafting was done hastily and confusion and disagreement continue to surround the translation. The Treaty however remains regarded as New Zealand's foundation as a nation and is revered by Māori as a guarantee of their rights.|$|R
