5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed.

Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
