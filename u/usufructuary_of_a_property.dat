40|$|<b>Usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> {{building}} and {{other ways of}} erecting house on the land of another The purpose of this thesis is to analyse comprehensively the institute <b>of</b> <b>usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> {{building and}} other ways of erecting house on the land of another. Other legal institutes {{that can be used}} to set up home on a foreign land are easements, lease, usufructuary lease, precarious loan and loan for use. The Civil Code, after more than sixty years, is returning to the superficial principle, with which is the <b>usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> building inherently connected and which represents an exception from that principle. Thesis is divided into four parts. The largest is the first part, which deals with the <b>usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> building. The second part is devoted to other institutes, which enable the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house on a foreign land. The third part is the comparison <b>of</b> the <b>usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> building with other institutes. The fourth part focuses on the <b>usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> building legislation abroad. The focus of this thesis is in the first part, which consists of nine chapters. The first chapter defines the basic concepts and institutes related to the <b>usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> building. The second chapter describes the history <b>of</b> the <b>usufructuary</b> right <b>of</b> building. The third to the seventh chapter [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I attempt to show, against certain {{versions}} of trope theory, that properties with analyzable particularity cannot be merely exactly similar: such properties are either particularized properties (tropes) that are dissimilar to every any other trope, or else universalized properties (universals). I argue {{that each of}} the most viable standard and nonstandard particularizers that can be employed to secure the numerical difference between exactly similar properties can only succeed in grounding the particularity of properties, that is, in having properties be tropes, at the expense of ruling out the possibility of their exact similarity. Here are the four nonstandard particularizers that I examine: the genealogy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>property,</b> the history <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>property,</b> the causal effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>property,</b> and the duration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>property.</b> And here are the two standard particularizers that I examine: the bearer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>property,</b> by which I mean either a bare particular or a spatiotemporal location, and the property itself, by which I mean that the property is self-particularized. In my concluding remarks, I explain that the only remaining hope for preserving the possibility of exactly similar tropes is regarding properties as primitively particular, and that this must mean not that properties are selfparticularize...|$|R
