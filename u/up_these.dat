5|$|Although the Japanese were {{experiencing}} similar problems {{in relation to}} supplies, they began their advance once again on 26 August and despite several rugged defensive actions the Australians were forced back again, first to Eora Creek on 30 August, then Templeton's Crossing on 2 September, and finally to Efogi three days later. Exhausted from their efforts and {{no longer able to}} be considered an effective fighting force, the 39th was relieved and sent down the track to Koitaki to rest. They had done the job that was required of them, having stalled the Japanese advance in order to allow reinforcements to be brought <b>up.</b> <b>These</b> reinforcements came {{in the shape of the}} 25th Brigade, comprising the 2/25th, 2/31st and 2/33rd Battalions. Bitter fighting ensued around Ioribaiwa and the Australians withdrew once again on 17 September, this time to Imita Ridge; however, the Japanese had reached their limit and on 24 September began to withdraw. The Australians subsequently launched a counter-offensive in October and by 2 November, Kokoda was back in Australian hands.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for how to set <b>up</b> <b>these</b> councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode {{the power of the}} traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E

5|$|By {{this stage}} of the war, the New Zealand Government had {{authorised}} the raising of the 3rd Division for service in the Pacific against the Japanese. To be formed in New Zealand, the division was based around the recently returned 8th and 14th Brigades, and the battalions making <b>up</b> <b>these</b> formations, and commanded by Major General Harold Barrowclough. Barrowclough set about organising the new division and implemented training programs to prepare his new command for fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific. However, at the request of Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area of Operations, the 34th Battalion was selected in October 1942 to garrison Tonga. The move was to replace American forces that had moved to Guadalcanal. The battalion was withdrawn from divisional exercises in the Waikato Region of the North Island and shipped to Tonga's main island of Tongatapu aboard the SS President Jackson. Now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Eyre, the battalion remained here under American control for a period of five months.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives <b>up</b> <b>these</b> three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel <b>up.</b> <b>These</b> vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E

5|$|The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) {{justified}} the {{continued use of}} tolls by suggesting they were necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers {{in the event of}} collision in the Firth. The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was hollow) and had hydraulic rams jack <b>up</b> <b>these</b> sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the Elementary Education Act 1870 (applying to England and Wales), commonly known as Forster's Education Act having been drawn up by William Edward Forster, created the concept of compulsory education for children under thirteen, although the decision to make education compulsory was {{at the discretion of}} school boards; education was compulsory in approximately 40% of schools by 1873. In areas where education was considered a problem, elected school boards could be set <b>up.</b> <b>These</b> boards could, at their discretion, create local by-laws, confirmed by Parliament, to require attendance and fine the parents of children who did not attend. There were exemptions for illness, living more than a certain distance (typically one mile) from a school, or certification of having reached the required standard (which varied by board) which were made mandatory across England and Wales by the 1880 Act.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build <b>up,</b> <b>these</b> neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took <b>up</b> <b>these</b> offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E
5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear <b>up</b> <b>these</b> potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the crest of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E
5|$|Two essay {{collections}} {{were published}} during Orwell's lifetime—Inside the Whale and Other Essays in 1940 and Critical Essays in 1946 (the latter {{published in the}} United States as Dickens, Dali, and Others in 1958.)

The first significant publications in the United States were Doubleday's A Collection of Essays by George Orwell from 1954, 1956's The Orwell Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and Penguin's Selected Essays in 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title Inside the Whale and Other Essays and in abridged form as Why I Write in 2005 {{as a part of}} the Great Ideas series. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections Books v. Cigarettes (2008), Some Thoughts on the Common Toad (2010), and Decline of the English Murder (2009). The later does not contain the same texts as Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays, published by Penguin in association with Secker & Warburg in 1965.
