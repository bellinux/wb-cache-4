5|$|Advertising on the Internet was liberalized by the Government in {{time for}} the 2011 general elections. Two forms of {{political}} advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E
5|$|Candidates may <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> publish {{election}} advertising, including posting {{content on}} electronic media applications (such as digital banners, instant messaging software, mobile applications, RSS feed readers and widgets), social networking services and other websites, and sending e-mails. SMS and MMS messages {{can also be}} sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet {{that is used to}} publish election advertising within 12 hours after the start of the campaign period (that is, the time when the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents must use their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election advertising on the Internet is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E

25|$|By the 2010s, the {{circumstances}} of computer crime had changed along with legitimate computer use. Criminals {{were more likely to}} <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> facilitate their crimes, and as such needed to remain online most of the time. To do so, and still keep their activities discreet, they used computer security features like lock screens and password protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} Internet and {{technology}} in general provide new challenges for modern and homosexual couples. According to the Global Internet Statistics in 2003, Internet population around the world has grown exceptionally fast {{in less than a}} decade, rising from 16 million users in 1995 to approximately 680 million in late 2003. Millions of such users are married individuals who <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> meet strangers, flirt, and many times engage in highly sexualized conversations.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{therapeutic}} effectiveness and proven success of CBT, treatment availability is significantly limited {{by a lack}} of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, and expense. One way to potentially overcome these barriers is to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> deliver treatment, making this effective intervention more accessible and less costly. The Internet has already become a critical source of health-care and medical information. Although the vast majority of health websites provide general information, there is growing research literature on the development and evaluation of Internet interventions.|$|E

25|$|In an American {{study in}} 2005, the {{percentage}} of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of {{the percentage of}} women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and {{were more likely to be}} broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.|$|E
25|$|The {{second level}} digital divide, also {{referred}} to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the internet from the producers of content. As the technological digital divide is decreasing between those with access to the internet and those without, the meaning of the term digital divide is evolving. Previously, digital divide research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption. However, with an increasing number of the population with access to the Internet, researchers are examining how people <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>to</b> create content and what impact socioeconomics are having on user behavior.|$|E
25|$|The Internet has {{achieved}} new relevance {{as a political}} tool. The presidential campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to Internet activism, most notably practiced by rebels in the Arab Spring. The New York Times suggested that social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information.|$|E

25|$|Organized criminals can {{generate}} {{up to several}} thousand dollars per day from one trafficked girl, and the Internet has further increased profitability of sex trafficking and child trafficking. With faster access to a wider clientele, more sexual encounters can be scheduled. Victims and clients, according to a New York City report on sex trafficking in minors, increasingly <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> meet customers. Because of protests, Craigslist has since closed its adult services section. According to authorities, Backpage is now the main source for advertising trafficking victims. Investigators also frequently browse online classified ads to identify potential underage girls who are trafficked.|$|E

25|$|Another area {{of leisure}} {{activity}} on the Internet is multiplayer gaming. This form of recreation creates communities, where {{people of all ages}} and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as GameSpy and MPlayer. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.|$|E

25|$|WMUR was {{the first}} {{television}} station {{in the country to}} develop a significant Internet presence beginning in 1996. It {{was the first}} television station to hire a full-time employee dedicated to streaming its newscast live and archived online for later viewing. It was also the first television station to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> supplement its broadcast news by posting additional information online like the Megan's Law list. After posting a 3D virtual tour of its TV studio facilities online it briefly became the most visited attraction online in the world. Beginning in 1998 the station made significant financial, technical and staff investments into its internet strategy. This included 24-hour original news segments, weather coverage from a professional meteorologist and Sales Executive dedicated to TV and online advertising. In 2000 WMUR, CNN and WMUR.COM simulcasted their New Hampshire Primary Debates held at the TV station. This was the first widely promoted and executed worldwide live streaming video event.|$|E
500|$|The {{marketing}} {{budget for}} Deadpool {{was smaller than}} usual, like the production budget, so Reynolds worked closely with Fox domestic marketing chief Marc Weinstock to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>to</b> their advantage {{and come up with}} cheaper, [...] "Deadpool-based" [...] ways to market the film. Weinstock noted that it was unusual for an actor in a film to do this. Reynolds kept one of the Deadpool costumes for himself, and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign. Visual effects vendor Image Engine animated Deadpool's mask for these appearances, using a similar process to that used by Weta Digital for the film.|$|E
500|$|Pratchett {{started to}} use {{computers}} for writing {{as soon as}} they were available to him. His first computer was a Sinclair ZX81; the first computer he used properly for writing was an Amstrad CPC 464, later replaced by a PC. Pratchett was one of the first authors routinely to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> communicate with fans, and was a contributor to the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett from 1992. However, he did not consider the Internet a hobby, just another [...] "thing to use". He had many computers in his house, with a bank of six monitors rigged up to ease writing. When he travelled, he always took a portable computer with him to write.|$|E
