40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the effects of {{excessive}} sonication during surfactant-assisted multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) dispersion in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) by way of monitoring molecular arrangements upon progressive straining. Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy confirms the structural damage on the graphitic layers upon prolonged sonication. The resulting lack on MWCNT alignment is shown by atomic force microscopy. Further, molecular interface dynamics in progressively strained EVA|MWCNT composites have been studied through Raman and NEXAFS spectroscopies. NEXAFS spectra have identified graphitic amorphization and further C-vacancy rehybridization by way of hydrogen passivation as the damage mechanism to the graphitic structure upon sonication. In this scheme, MWCNTs did not align despite the range of composite strains discussed due to stick and slip dynamics of surrounding EVA. Ultimately, damaged MWCNTs rendered the necessary dispersant Ï�â��Ï� interactions suboptimal and insufficient for nanomechanically interlocked polymerâ��filler interactions. Remarkably, upon large strains, polymer chains are seen to <b>unlatch</b> <b>from</b> the MWCNT and undergo mechanically induced backbone twisting. The possibility of mechanically induced backbone twisting might offer alternative processing routes in photovoltaic systems, where chemically induced conjugated backbone twisting yields increased power conversion efficiency...|$|E
50|$|N. reddelli, {{like all}} other ticks, must consume the host's blood as food. It cannot jump or fly, so it latches onto the ghost-faced bat and makes {{a hole in the}} bat's {{epidermis}} to drink blood. N. reddelli releases a numbing agent to keep the bat from becoming aware of the ticks presence, and releases an anticoagulant to keep the blood from clotting. When the tick is finished feeding, it <b>unlatches</b> <b>from</b> the bat and disembarks, where it will prepare for its next feeding.|$|R

Her tour included a keynote presentation on academic publishing {{and the future of}} the monograph at Queensland University of Technology, arranged by Dr. Lucy Montgomery, who would go on to become Deputy Director of Knowledge Unlatched. While at QUT, Pinter met with DVC for Technology, Library and Information Services, Professor Tom Cochrane. This trip played a key role in securing support for Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> <b>from</b> three founding Australian libraries: Queensland University of Technology, The University of Melbourne and The University of Western Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Following the war, Shiny Brite {{introduced}} {{a line of}} ornaments with a newly designed metal hook that provided the user with two lengths of hanger. The long hook traveled {{through the center of}} the ornament and exited the bottom, where it attached to the foot of the ornament. This provided the [...] "short" [...] hanger. <b>Unlatched</b> <b>from</b> the bottom, the entire length of the hook was available, allowing the ornament to dangle at a greater distance from the tree limb to which it was attached. This arrangement was designed to allow the ornament to fill sparsely limbed areas of a natural tree.|$|R
40|$|In situ temperature-resolved Near-edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} thermo-active ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) â�� multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites 12 months following synthesis, and compared with spectra acquired shortly after synthesis to examine aging effects on non-covalent interactions. Room temperature spectra revealed no difference between unstrained and strained composites, suggesting relaxation. Further, energy shifts in Ï�* C=C resonances indicated a change in Ï�â��Ï� interactions between MWCNT walls and chemical dispersant, supported also by AFM phase imaging. Temperature-resolved NEXAFS analysis showed a lack of interaction between nanotubes and polymeric chains, suggesting the chemical dispersant <b>unlatched</b> <b>from</b> MWCNT walls. The extent of this effect is finally quantified through a comparative study of spectral trends...|$|R
50|$|The pistol's toothy surface, and grooved grips, {{provide good}} grip even with wet hands. The K100 also {{features}} ambidextrous controls, supporting both left and right-handed users. When field stripping models made prior to 2012, the forward {{part of the}} trigger guard <b>unlatches</b> <b>from</b> the gripframe and is flexed downward out of the frame. With the forward part of the trigger guard flexed downward, the slide moves farther to the rear than normal and can be pulled to the extreme rear and then lifted up and off the frame. The field strip is roughly similar to the Walther PPK/PPKS fieldstrip except that the triggerguard is not hinged on the K100, instead its polymer construction allows it to flex downward.|$|R
5000|$|Reward Challenge: One [...] "Clipper" [...] and one tribe member {{wearing a}} harness will run to a pole {{with a cloth}} wrapped around it and a clip on one end. That clip is latched onto the {{harnessed}} tribe member and is wrapped around the said tribe member; only the Clipper is allowed to touch the cloth at all times. At {{the other end of}} the cloth is another clip to be latched on the next harnessed tribe member. The process is repeated in the next four poles until all five pieces of cloth are wrapped around the five harnessed tribe members. Afterwards, the pieces of cloth are unwrapped, <b>unlatched</b> <b>from</b> the harnessed tribe members, reconnected to each other, and spread out from the fifth pole back to the starting line by the clipper. The first tribe that has all five connected cloth pieces laid out and with all members on the tribal mat wins the Reward.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} retaining devices {{which are used}} to latch two elements or parts together and, more particularly, to gate latches for use in locking a gate to a wall bracket in a water pit utilized to store or handle hazardous materials. A retaining latch is provided comprising a latch plate which is rotatably mounted to {{each end of the}} top of the gate and a recessed opening, formed in the gate frame, for engaging an edge of the latch plate. The latch plate is circular in profile with one side cut away or flat, such that the latch plate is D-shaped. The remaining circular edge of the latch plate comprises steps of successively reduced thickness. The stepped edge of the latch plate fits inside a recessed opening formed in the gate frame. As the latch plate is rotated, alternate steps of the latch plate are engaged by the recessed opening. When the latch plate is rotated such that the flat portion of the latch plate faces the recessed opening in the gate frame, there is no connection between the opening and the latch plate and the gate is <b>unlatched</b> <b>from</b> the gate frame...|$|R

Since at least the late 1970 s, when stresses {{in the market for}} scholarly literature began to show, there have been calls to redistribute how the production and dissemination of scholarly literature are paid for. The motivations are addressing the "free rider problem" of institutions without presses and, more recently, increasing overall access to the literature. In particular, the last few years have seen schemes such as SCOAP 3 and Knowledge <b>Unlatched</b> and proposals <b>from</b> K | N Consultants and a joint task force of the Association of Research Libraries and the American Association of Universities. These plans to establish new business models are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringSeadrill’s {{constant}} {{strive to}} achieve their goal in setting the standard in drilling pursues the focus on operations excellence. The company’s fleet is expanding with frequent new Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU) and this might involve challenges with keeping up operations excellence from the first day. In this thesis the main object is to perform operation efficiency analyzes across three of Seadrill’s semisubmersible rigs; West Venture, West Phoenix and West Eminence. The chosen operations for analyses are: · Unrestricted tripping of drillpipe in cased hole · Unrestricted running of casing into the well · Running and pulling BOP The analyses were based on Daily Operations Database Application (DODA) reports, which is Seadrill’s daily operation reporting system. The reports contain specified amount of hours spent to perform the operation and the tripping distance, and tripping rates were determined and compared with the rigs. In the BOP operations the analyses emphasizes in addition on operation efficiency when placing BOP on wellhead and <b>unlatch</b> BOP <b>from</b> wellhead including the related operations. The well data are based on exploration wells, except from the first analysis which contain operations from other wells...|$|R
