40|$|Magnetic {{ordering}} of itinerant fermionic systems {{is at the}} forefront of condensed matter physics dating back to Stoner's instability. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) which couples two essential ingredients of an itinerant fermionic system, namely spin and orbital motion, opens up new horizons to this long-standing problem. Here we report that the itinerant ferromagnetism is absent in 3 D Fermi gas with a Weyl SOC and various itinerant spin density waves emerge instead, which is deeply rooted in the unique symmetry and spin-momentum locking effect in spin-orbit coupled systems. What is more appealing is that, the strong SOC provides a new and efficient mechanism to realize itinerant spin density waves at extremely weak repulsion [...] -a significant benefit for present <b>ultra-cold</b> <b>atom</b> experiment.

40|$|<b>Ultra-cold</b> <b>atom</b> system {{provides}} novel technology to simulate traditional solid state physics, including boson and fermion particles. Due to {{the flexibility of}} tuning pa- rameters, people can further understand basic physics behind strongly correlated effects, especially mechanism of unconventional density wave and superfluidity. Using weak cou- pling renormalization group method, we propose and study several models which can be realized in experiments. Ranging from most well-known extended Hubbard model, to spin- polarized Fermi Hubbard model and multi-flavor Fermi-Fermi mixture, we establish solid theories to explain the origin of new states of matter, and the experimental techniques to exploit them. The effects of lattice structure and particle density in fermionic system play important roles for determining phase diagram in low energy scale. Due {{to the presence of}} lattice, these systems have insulator phase at half-filled. The density imbalance, however, prevents formation of conventional density wave state, and the screening interaction dra- matically affects other species's behavior. The interplay between screening interaction and square lattice is key ingredient of unconventional density wave and superfluidity.

40|$|We propose an {{alternative}} method to laser cooling. Our approach utilizes the extreme brightness of a supersonic atomic beam, and the adiabatic atomic coilgun to slow {{atoms in the}} beam or {{to bring them to}} rest. We show how internal-state optical pumping and stimulated optical transitions, combined with magnetic forces can be used to cool the translational motion of atoms. This approach does not rely on momentum transfer from photons to atoms, as in laser cooling. We predict that our method can surpass laser cooling in terms of flux of <b>ultra-cold</b> <b>atoms</b> and phase-space density, with lower required laser power and reduced complexity. Over the past thirty-eight years since its invention [1, 2], laser cooling has remained as the standard approach for producing <b>ultra-cold</b> <b>atoms</b> [3]. This method relies on the momentum transfer from light to atoms, as photons are repeatedly scattered, enabling the study of ultra-cold atomic gases. While laser cooling works very well, the requirement of a closed, two-level transition has limited the applicability of the method to a small subset of elements in the periodic table. For those elements, laser cooling has reached saturation in the number of <b>ultra-cold</b> <b>atoms</b> produced per second,...|$|R

We especially overcome the condition of a filling factor of exactly one, which otherwise would restrict the phase of the simulated system to a Mott-insulator. Using <b>ultra-cold</b> <b>atoms</b> in optical lattices allows simulation of the discussed models for a very wide range of parameters.

We find that the dynamic responses of the paired superfluid phase for attractive inter-species interactions and the counterflow superfluid phase for repulsive interactions are qualitatively distinct and reflect the quasi long-range order that characterizes these states. These findings suggest a clear experimental procedure to detect these phases, and give an intuitive insight into their dynamics. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

In this Letter, we observe Zitterbewegung, the simultaneous velocity (thus position) and spin oscillations, of neutral atoms between two spin-orbit coupled bands in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through sudden quantum quenches of the Hamiltonian. The observed Zitterbewegung oscillations are perfect on a short time scale but gradually damp out on a long time scale, followed by sudden and strong heating of the BEC. As an application, we also demonstrate how Zitterbewegung oscillations can be exploited to populate the upper spin-orbit band, and observe a subsequent dipole motion.
