Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels.

5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed <b>underpinning</b> to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied {{from this point of}} view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical <b>underpinning</b> of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. <b>Underpinning</b> Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{reaction}} {{ranged from}} those believing in literal creation from the Quran to many educated Muslims who subscribed to {{a version of}} theistic or guided evolution in which the Quran reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval madrasahs taught the ideas of Al-Jahiz, a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection. However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the Muslim world, as prominent figures reject evolution's <b>underpinning</b> philosophy of materialism as unsound to human origins and a denial of Allah. Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the Western world.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} <b>underpinning</b> influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
5|$|Except for Tower Bridge, {{built in}} 1894, the Albert Bridge {{is the only}} Thames road bridge in central London never to have been replaced. Intended as a {{temporary}} measure to be removed in 1978, the concrete central piers remain in place, and although in 1974 its lifespan was estimated at a maximum of 30 years, the bridge is still standing and operational. The Albert Bridge was protected as a Grade II* listed structure in 1975, granting it protection against significant alteration without consultation. It continues to deteriorate. Although proposals have been drawn up by Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council to repair and rescue it, by March 2008 funds for the repairs were unavailable. As well as structural damage caused by traffic, the timbers <b>underpinning</b> the deck are being seriously rotted by the urine of dogs crossing to and from nearby Battersea Park. With multiple measures in place to reduce traffic flow and prolong {{the life of the}} bridge, in 2009 it carried approximately 19,000 vehicles per day, the lowest usage of any Thames road bridge in London other than the little-used Southwark Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Ian Graham {{published}} {{a plan of}} the site in 1980, based on explorations in preceding years. Further explorations have taken place {{on behalf of the}} Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala and the Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project. The Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project started work at the site in 1994 with preliminary work consisted of mapping and photographing the ruins. In 1995 the ruins were cleared of undergrowth and in 1996 the Unidad de Arquelogía Regional de Guatemala (Guatemalan Regional Archaeology Unit) surveyed the ruins, recorded damage by looters and sank test pits, all under the direction of Vilma Fialko. From 1997 to 1998 looting damage was repaired and architecture deemed at risk of collapse was underpinned. In 1999 further <b>underpinning</b> work was undertaken as a result of earthquake damage and detailed plans were made of the architecture in 2000. The Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala included La Blanca in its survey of three sites in the lower Mopan valley in 2001. More recently, investigations have been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture together with the University of Valencia and the Polytechnic University of Valencia. Excavations continued in 2004 both in the city centre and in the South Group, where looting damage was recorded and repaired.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory <b>underpinning,</b> and the nature of the reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of the Securities and Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Federal Reserve Act in 1913, {{giving rise to}} the Federal Reserve System. Its {{inception}} drew influence from the Panic of 1907, <b>underpinning</b> legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a lender of last resort. The system's design also considered {{the findings of the}} Pujo Committee's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive discount market.|$|E
