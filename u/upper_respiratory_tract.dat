40|$|The {{relationship}} between serotypes and biotypes of 505 carriage strains of Haemophilus influenzae {{isolated from the}} <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of well children, children with pneumonia, and healthy adults was studied. All except serotype c {{were significantly associated with}} one or two specific biotypes (P less than 0. 001). No encapsulated organisms belonging to biotypes V, VI, or VII were encountered. No significant difference in the interaction of biotypes and serotypes isolated from well and sick children was present. Both encapsulated and nonserotypable biotype I H. influenzae strains were commonly carried in the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of healthy Melanesian children. The distribution of nonserotypable H. influenzae strains occurred throughout all biotypes, and the frequency of nonencapsulated biotype III and IV strains differed significantly from serotypable organisms with the same biotype (P less than 0. 001) ...|$|R
5|$|HSP occurs {{more often}} in {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows an <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infection. Half of affected patients are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in boys as in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract.</b> The most commonly implicated virus is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one virus is present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made, (i) {{to study the}} fungi {{isolated}} from the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of wild Pink-footed Geese at their breeding-grounds in Iceland and at their winter quarters in Scotland, in order to discover whether they harboured Aspergillus fumigatus in the wild, and (ii) to test suitable methods for collecting samples in the field under adverse conditions. Cultures were made by streaking throat-swabs on to Sabouraud’s dextrose agar slopes and neither these nor the controls revealed A. fumigatus or any other potential pathogenic fungus, but the isolates obtained showed that {{the quality and quantity}} of the fungus content of the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of the geese may be dependent on their environ ment. Suggestions are made for improving technique. A species of Ascomycete grown from the throats of three geese in Iceland appears to be new to science...|$|R
5|$|The common cold, {{also known}} simply as a cold, is a viral {{infectious}} disease of the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure. They include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days. Some symptoms may last up to three weeks. In those with other health problems, pneumonia may occasionally develop.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections is {{loosely based on}} the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> irritation—though {{this may be}} caused by the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E
5000|$|T. pyogenes {{is found}} in the urogenital, gastrointestinal, and <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of cattle, goats, horses, musk deer, pigs, and sheep, in which it may cause abscesses, mastitis, metritis, and pneumonia.

40|$|AbstractInfluenza viruses {{recognize}} sialoglycans as receptors. Although viruses isolated form chickens preferentially bind to sialic acid α 2, 3 galactose (SAα 2, 3 Gal) glycans as {{do those}} of ducks, chickens were not experimentally infected with viruses isolated from ducks. A chicken influenza virus, A/chicken/Ibaraki/ 1 / 2005 (H 5 N 2) (Ck/IBR) bound to fucose-branched SAα 2, 3 Gal glycans, whereas the binding towards linear SAα 2, 3 Gal glycans was weak. On the epithelial {{cells of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of chickens, fucose-branched SAα 2, 3 Gal glycans were detected, but not linear SAα 2, 3 Gal glycans. The growth of Ck/IBR in MDCK-FUT cells, which were genetically prepared to express fucose-branched SAα 2, 3 Gal glycans, {{was significantly higher than}} that in the parental MDCK cells. The present results indicate that fucose-branched SAα 2, 3 Gal glycans existing on the epithelial cells lining the <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> of chickens are critical for recognition by Ck/IBR...|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThere is {{increasing}} interest concerning the possible impact of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α therapeutic agents on {{the emergence of}} infections. However, these agents {{do not seem to}} increase the incidence of adverse infectious events significantly. Published observations concern mostly infections of the urinary and <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> that develop in the setting of co-morbidities, such as anterior or concomitant immunosuppressive treatment. Infliximab appears to increase the risk of tuberculosis, but this effect has not been observed with other anti-TNF-α agents. To better characterise the adverse infectious effects associated with these agents, physicians should be encouraged to notify the microbiological data relating to all cases...|$|R

50|$|Lower <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> {{infections are}} {{generally}} more serious than <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> infections. LRIs are {{the leading cause of}} death among all infectious diseases. The two most common LRIs are bronchitis and pneumonia.

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} the aetiological role and epidemiological profile of common respiratory viruses in adults with acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections (ARTIs), a 2 -year {{study was conducted}} in Beijing, China, from May 2005 to July 2007. Nose and throat swab samples from 5808 ARTI patients were analysed by PCR methods for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (IFVs) A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1 – 4, enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC 43, 229 E, NL 63, and HKU 1, and adenoviruses (ADVs). Viral pathogens were detected in 34. 6 % of patient samples, and 1. 6 % of the patients tested positive for more than one virus. IFVs (19. 3 %) were the dominant agents detected, followed by HRVs (6. 5 %), PIVs (4. 3 %), EVs (3. 2 %), and HCoVs (1. 1 %). ADVs, RSV and HMPV were also detected (< 1 %). The viral detection rates differed significantly between infections of the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>tracts</b> in the sample population: PIVs, the second most commonly detected viral agents in lower acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections (LRTIs), were more prevalent than in <b>upper</b> acute <b>respiratory</b> <b>tract</b> infections, indicating that the pathogenic role of PIVs in LRTIs should be investigated. Currently, this study is the largest-scale investigation of respiratory virus infections in China with multiple agent detection, providing baseline data for further studies of respiratory virus infections in adults with ARTIs...|$|R
