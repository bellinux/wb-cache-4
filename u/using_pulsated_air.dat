In this investigation, an attempt has been made to clear up this confusion by making experimental measurements on the rate of drying of kaolin, felt and cellulose sponge under the action of <b>pulsating</b> <b>air.</b> An introductory outline of the mechanism of drying is mentioned and an hypothesis correlating the beneficial effects of <b>pulsating</b> <b>air</b> in drying and the porous structure of the material to be dried is suggested.

Through new agricultural regulation 2015 in Germany the industry must develop new liquid manure spreader systems because the ammonia and methane emission are limited. In a research project the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and some other industry partners will develop such a new innovative liquid manure spreader. The new liquid manure spreader should <b>use</b> <b>pulsating</b> <b>air</b> to distribute the liquid manure exactly. The <b>pulsating</b> <b>air,</b> which flows through the pipelines, should be analysed at a test station. For examinations at this test station it is important to find another substitute fluid because liquid manure smells strong, is not transparent and is also not homogeneous enough for scientific investigations. Furthermore it is important to ensure that the substitute fluid is, like liquid manure, a non-Newtonian fluid. The substitute fluid must be a shear-thinning substance - this means the viscosity decrease at higher shear rate. Many different samples like soap-water-farragoes, jelly-water-farragoes, agar-water-farragoes, soap-ethanol-farragoes and more are, for the project, examined in regard of their physical properties to find the best substitute fluid. The samples are examined at the rotational viscometer for viscosity at various shear rates and then compared with the viscosity values of liquid manure...|$|R

Each instrument shares the same basic principle of operation involving the use of a closed coil helical extension spring, which is partly filled with the test powder. Particle size distribution data is obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring the mass of the discharged particles from the spring’s coils. In the case of the Handheld SPS, aimed at on the spot quality control applications, the test particles are discharged from the spring using manual shaking.

Two tractor-driven test devices were developed under this specific objective. The first one was a high capacity compressor, and the stream of air produced by it was directed onto one side of a row of plants. The second one was a device producing two counter-flowing air streams colliding in the middle of a row of plants. The frequency of the air pulses was adjusted steplessly by varying the rotational velocity of the shutters closing and opening the outlets of the fans. In the field trials with the device based on a compressor-generated air stream, two air pulse frequencies were used: 500 and 540 pulses per minute (8. 3 and 9 Hz). The mean detachment force was 0. 727 N. About 50 % of ripe raspberries were removed from the bushes.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of renewable energy such as wind and solar, the power market operation is changing. The energy producers using classic resources have to adapt. This applies to hydropower plants as well, which are more often operated away from their best efficiency point, involving a significant increase in load variations, as well as start/stop to regulate the grid frequency. During turbine operations away from the best efficiency point and at part load, the vortex breakdown phenomenon encounters in the draft tube, which lead to the formation of a rotating vortex rope (RVR). The RVR {{is the result of a}} flow instability associated with low-frequency pressure pulsations, noise and vibration, limiting the operational range of the turbine. Various methods for RVR mitigation have been investigated for many years, but so far, none has yielded outstanding results. The most popular method for decreasing pressure pulsations is air injection. Air injection methods can be divided into passive and active. This study focuses on setting the basis for a new active control method (varying air injection), using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling. Among the possible benefits of implementing <b>pulsated</b> <b>air</b> injection are, decreasing the necessary air quantity, and the mitigation or even cancellation of the pressure pulsations due to RVR. First, a numerical model is developed for part load operation, and validated using measurements performed for the Francis- 99 workshop. Next, standard air injection methods are compared, for which it is determined that the pressure amplitude associated with the RVR decreases by more than 50 % when a constant air injection of 1 % is applied. Finally, a possible method for determining the frequency, phase, and amplitude for varying air injection is described. It is shown that the system responds four times slower to air nozzle opening than to air nozzle closing, and that a <b>pulsated</b> <b>air</b> frequency equal to the RVR frequency is optimal. As for the air fluctuation, only a small variation is determined to be beneficial to the system (between 0. 9 and 1 % in this case) ...|$|R

Experimental measurements have been conducted with three temperature drops between wall and air (25, 40 and 70 K respectively) with or without pulsating and continuous expired and aspirated jets. The thickness of the boundary layer near the wall is locally reduced due to the presence of the aspirated jets or the boundary layer is destabilized near the holes by means of expired jets: both of these phenomena improve the heat transfer coefficient. The experimental results have demonstrated that the pulsating expired jets are more efficient than the aspirated ones with lower differences wall-to-air temperature; the opposite occurs when that difference is greater then 40 K.

Potential applications include the control of boundary layer separation in external flows, as well as jet engine inlet and diffuser flow control. The operating principles for such devices are typically based on either mechanical deflection of control surfaces (which include MEMS flap devices), mass injection (which includes combustion driven jet actuators), or through the use of synthetic jets (diaphragm devices which produce a pulsating jet with no net mass flow).

The heat flux of the heated air jet impinging on the plate was measured using a heat flux microsensor at different radial positions.

Results obtained show that the local Nusselt number calculated were higher at all radial position away from the stagnation point. The pulsed jet Nusselt number was higher than the average steady jet Nusselt number for all values of frequencies due to the higher localised heat transfer. The higher Nusselt number obtained at localized radial positions can be due to the higher instantaneous velocity as was shown from the velocity profile plotted in the first part of the experiment.

Minimally disruptive remediation techniques, such as air sparging, have become more attractive {{in the past decade}} compared with more traditional ex-situ remediation technologies.
