Nevertheless, the existence of absolutely exfoliated nanoclay composites is impossible in reality. Regions of intercalated nanoclay platelets can be easily formed and agglomerate as tiny clusters.

40|$|Background—Catheter-based {{therapeutic}} ultrasound thrombolysis {{was recently}} {{shown to be}} effective and safe. The purpose of this work was to study the safety and efficacy of external high-intensity focused ultrasound thrombolysis guided by ultrasound imaging in experimental settings. Methods and Results—A therapeutic transducer was constructed from an acoustic lens and integrated with an ultrasound imaging transducer. In vitro clots were inserted into bovine arterial segments and sonicated under real-time ultrasound imaging guidance in a water tank. With pulsed-wave (PW) <b>ultrasound,</b> the total <b>sonication</b> time correlated with thrombolysis efficiency (r 250. 7666). A thrombolysis efficiency of 91 % was achieved with optimal PW parameters (1 : 25 duty cycle, 200 -ms pulse length) at an intensity (Ispta) of. 3565 W/cm 2. <b>Ultrasound</b> imaging during <b>sonication</b> showed the cavitation field as a spherical cloud of echo-dense material. Within, 2 minutes, the vessel lumen evidenced neither residual clot nor damage to the arterial wall. On serial filtration, 9361 % of the lysed clot became subcapillary in size (, 8 mm). In vitro safety studies, however, showed arterial damage when an Ispta of 45 W/cm 2 was used for periods of $ 300 seconds.

Incorporation of CNFs in the composite laminate {{was performed by}} both matrix-modification and fiber-modification routes. In the matrix-modification route, vapor grown carbon nanofibers (VGCNFs) were directly mixed into the epoxy resin EPON 862 using <b>ultrasound</b> tip <b>sonication.</b> In the fiber-modification route, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were directly grown on the carbon fiber fabric using chemical vapour deposition (CVD). A wire-based 3 technique was used to measure the thermal conductivity of the CFRCs in both in-plane and through-thickness direction. Although the matrix-modification route didn’t show significant improvement in the in-plane direction, the fiber-modification route showed improvement in both in-plane and through-thickness directions. Maximum improvement in through-thickness thermal conductivity of about 10 % and 30 % was observed in the matrix-modification and fiber-modification route, respectively. It is believed that the random orientation of the CNFs on the fiber surface results in such an improvement in the in-plane direction.

40|$|<b>Ultrasound</b> <b>sonication</b> {{of protein}} and peptide {{solutions}} is routinely used in biochemical, biophysical, pharmaceutical and medical sciences to facilitate and accelerate dissolution of macromolecules in both aqueous and organic solvents. However, {{the impact of}} ultrasound waves on folding/unfolding of treated proteins, in particular, on aggregation kinetics of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins is not understood. In this work, effects of <b>ultrasound</b> <b>sonication</b> on the misfolding and aggregation behavior of the Alzheimer's A beta((1 - 40)) -peptide is studied by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) spin-echo diffusion NMR and UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Upon simple dissolution of A beta((1 - 40)) in perdeuterated trifluoroethanol, CF 3 -CD 2 -OD (TFE-d(3)), the peptide {{is present in the}} solution as a stable monomer adopting alpha-helical secondary structural motifs. The self-diffusion coefficient of A beta((1 - 40)) monomers in TFE-d(3) was measured as 1. 35 x 10 (- 10) m(2) s(- 1), reflecting its monomeric character. However, upon ultrasonic sonication for less than 5 min, considerable populations of A beta molecules (ca 40 %) form large aggregates as reflected in diffusion coefficients smaller than 4. 0 x 10 (- 13) m(2) s(- 1). Sonication for longer times (up to 40 min in total) effectively reduces the fraction of these aggregates in H- 1 PFG NMR spectra to ca 25 %. Additionally, absorption below 230 nm increased significantly upon sonication treatment, an observation, which also clearly confirms the ongoing aggregation process of A beta((1 - 40)) in TFE-d(3). Surprisingly, upon <b>ultrasound</b> <b>sonication</b> only small changes in the peptide secondary structure were detected by CD: the peptide molecules mainly adopt alpha-helical motifs in both monomers and aggregates formed upon sonication.

The NPC cell line CNE 2 was chosen as a tumor model, and curcumin concentration was kept constant at 10 µM while the cells were subjected to ultrasound exposure for 8 s at an intensity of 0. 46 W/cm 2. Cell death was evaluated using flow cytometry with annexinV-FITC and propidium iodine staining, and nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. Mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using flow cytometry with rhodamine 123 and dichlorodihydrofluorecein diacetate staining. Results. Flow cytometry showed that the combination of ultrasound and curcumin significantly increased the necrotic or late apoptotic rate by up to 31. 37 % compared with the controls. Nuclear condensation was observed in the nuclear staining, and collapse of ∆Ψm and ROS increase were found in the CNE 2 cells after the treatment with curcumin and ultrasound. Conclusions. The findings demonstrate that the presence of curcumin significantly enhances the ultrasound-induced cell death and ROS level, and induces the collapse of ∆Ψm, suggesting that <b>ultrasound</b> <b>sonication</b> can increase the cell death of NPC cells in the presence of curcumin and that the treatment using curcumin and ultrasound together is a potential therapeutic modality in the management of malignant tumors...|$|E

In this study, mouse ear tumors were employed to investigate the therapeutic effects of US, MBs, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) on tumors. Tumors started to receive treatments when they grew up to about 15 mm 3 (early stage) with injection of PLD 10 mg/kg, or up to 50 mm 3 (medium stage) with PLD 6 (or 4) mg/kg. Experiments included the control, PLD alone, PLD + MBs + US, US alone, and MBs + US groups. The procedure for the PLD + MBs + US group was that PLD was injected first, MB (SonoVue) injection followed, and then US was immediately sonicated on the tumor. The results showed that: (1) US sonication with MBs was always able to produce a further hindrance to tumor growth for both early and medium-stage tumors; (2) for the medium-stage tumors, 6 mg/kg PLD alone was able to inhibit their growth, while it did not work for 4 mg/kg PLD alone; (3) with the application of MBs + US, 4 mg/kg PLD was able to inhibit the growth of medium-stage tumors; (4) for early stage tumors after the first treatment with a high dose of PLD alone (10 mg/kg), the tumor size still increased for several days and then decreased (a biphasic pattern); (5) MBs + US alone was able to hinder the growth of early stage tumors, but unable to hinder that of medium stage tumors.

The protein fractions of α-lactalbumin were analyzed before and after ultrasound treatment by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The result showed that pH did not change significantly upon ultrasound however conductivities increased significantly after 20 kHz sonication. Electrical conductivity decreased significantly for ultrasound treatments in baths at 40 kHz and 500 kHz for all samples. Solubility increased significantly for all samples at 20 kHz.

40|$|AbstractAmong {{the primary}} brain tumors, gliomas {{are the most}} {{commonly}} found. In the United States, these tumors account for approximately 78 % of the new cases of primary malignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors diagnosed annually. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) {{is the most common}} and aggressive type of glioma, with the poorest survival duration. Although surgical techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have improved, the prognoses of patients with glioblastomas are still poor (∼ 1 year), which is largely because of the spread of tumor cells to other regions of the brain. Intravenous administration of chemotherapy drugs is the standard procedure for treat these spreaded cells, but the treatment effect is limited because of the adverse side effect and the delivery blockage from the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Thus, developing an effective treatment system to conquer this blockage will be beneficial for those who suffer from malignant brain tumor. Focused <b>ultrasound</b> (FUS) <b>sonication</b> in the presence of microbubbles (MB) may be able to promote the effectiveness of drug delivery, and help to overcome the blockage. The oscillation and destruction of microbubbles as well as microstreaming and radiation forces are the key factors capable of creating the transient rupture of the vascular barriers and subsequent increase in the tumor's vascular permeability. The success of FUS BBB disruption in delivering a variety of therapeutic molecules into brain tumors has recently been demonstrated in an animal model.

This limit of the diffusion layer thickness is shown to be essentially temperature independent and correspondingly, the highest limiting currents can be observed near the boiling point of liquid ammonia. Cavitation processes are detected even at - 70 °C and result in a considerable fluctuation in the observed mass transport controlled limiting current.

In an attempt to enhance L-BPA uptake into tumor cells, transient blood-brain barrier disruption (BBB-D) using hyperosmotic mannitol has been proposed to facilitate the uptake of L-BPA into F 98 glioma in the rat brain, thereby enhancing survival times by BNCT over the non-BBB-D control [4, 15]. Another BBB-D by focused <b>ultrasound</b> <b>sonication</b> also increased the uptake of L- 18 F-FBPA into F 98 glioma in the rat brain [16]. Since these BBB-D manipulations require treatments with drugs or sonication prior to the administration of L-BPA, the delivery of L-BPA into tumor cells may be affected by individual responses to these pre-treatments.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDelivery of {{therapeutic}} or diagnostic agents {{to the brain}} is majorly hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recently, many studies have demonstrated local and transient disruption of the BBB using low power <b>ultrasound</b> <b>sonication</b> combined with intravascular microbubbles. However, BBB opening and closure mechanisms are poorly understood, especially the maximum gap that may be safely generated between endothelial cells and the duration of opening of the BBB. Here, we studied BBB opening and closure under magnetic resonance (MR) guidance in a rat model. First, MR contrast agents (CA) of different hydrodynamic diameters (1 to 65 [*]nm) were employed to estimate the largest molecular size permissible across the cerebral tissues. Second, to estimate {{the duration of the}} BBB opening, the CA were injected at various times post-BBB disruption (12 minutes to 24 hours). A T(1) mapping strategy was developed to assess CA concentration at the ultrasound (US) focal point. Based on our experimental data and BBB closure modeling, a calibration curve was obtained to compute the half closure time as a function of CA hydrodynamic diameter. These findings and the model provide an invaluable basis for optimal design and delivery of nanoparticles to the brain...|$|E

In this study, mouse ear tumors were employed to investigate the therapeutic effects of US, MBs, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) on tumors. Tumors started to receive treatments when they grew up to about 15 mm 3 (early stage) with injection of PLD 10 mg/kg, or up to 50 mm 3 (medium stage) with PLD 6 (or 4) mg/kg. Experiments included the control, PLD alone, PLD + MBs + US, US alone, and MBs + US groups. The procedure for the PLD + MBs + US group was that PLD was injected first, MB (SonoVue) injection followed, and then US was immediately sonicated on the tumor. The results showed that: (1) US sonication with MBs was always able to produce a further hindrance to tumor growth for both early and medium-stage tumors; (2) for the medium-stage tumors, 6 mg/kg PLD alone was able to inhibit their growth, while it did not work for 4 mg/kg PLD alone; (3) with the application of MBs + US, 4 mg/kg PLD was able to inhibit the growth of medium-stage tumors; (4) for early stage tumors after the first treatment with a high dose of PLD alone (10 mg/kg), the tumor size still increased for several days and then decreased (a biphasic pattern); (5) MBs + US alone was able to hinder the growth of early stage tumors, but unable to hinder that of medium stage tumors. The results of histological examinations and blood perfusion measurements indicated that the application of MBs + US disrupts the tumor blood vessels and enhances the delivery of PLD into tumors to significantly inhibit tumor growth.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{application}} of ultrasound wave {{fields in the}} filtration and separation technology {{has been identified as}} a new and clean technology and as alternatively to the classical cleaning processes. Fouling phenomena is a major bottleneck in this separation technology, as expected in the industrial {{application of}} such finely porous media. As the filtration process continues, the concentration of solute keeps building up on the filter surface to form a filter cake. This results in a continuous declining of the flux. A number of methods are reported in preventing the fouling phenomena. In this study, the effect of intermittent application of <b>ultrasound</b> wave fields (<b>sonication)</b> on the filtration of Refined Bleached Deodorized (RBD) oil suspension will be presented. The application of ultrasound field is projected to enhance the filtration rate by reducing the thickness of the filter cake formed {{on the surface of the}} filtering medium. The main mechanism which is expected to dominate in reducing the thickness of the filter cake is the cavitation phenomenon. In carrying out the study, parameters affecting the performance of the sonicated filtration will be investigated. Among the parameters of concern is the sonication cycle time. An average flux is measured in each experiment as an indication of effectiveness of this method in reducing the filter fouling. In all cases, the application of ultrasound for filtration and separation processes has been successful by reducing the flux declining at different variables...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable drying is an {{alternative}} method to curb post harvest decay of vegetables and a process to produce dried vegetables, which can be directly consumed or used as ingredients for the preparation of soups, stews, baby foods, cakes, puddings, and many other foods. In this study, the effect of <b>ultrasound</b> frequency and <b>sonication</b> time as pre-treatment prior to air drying at 70 °C at an air velocity of 0. 5 m/s, on carrot drying kinetics, flavour, colour, and non-enzymatic browning was investigated using a 3 -level factorial response surface method. The result showed that an increase in sonication frequency and time did not significantly increase moisture diffusivity but {{in comparison with the}} control, water diffusivity increased after ultrasound application and the overall drying time was reduced. Application of the ultrasound pre-treatment in distilled water resulted in water gain and sugar loss, indicating that the ultrasonic pre-treatment can be an important step to produce low sugar content dried products. The brightness and redness to yellowness values of the ultrasonically pre-treated dried carrots were better than those without ultrasound application. In comparison with the flavour of the control, the ultrasound pre-treated samples recorded higher flavour response signals, indicating that the application of ultrasound improved the flavour of the dried carrot. The variation in sonication frequency and time did not significantly affect the non-enzymatic browning index of the dried products but were better than the control...|$|R
