40|$|Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> are multiattribute <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> of {{survival}} duration and health quality. This paper formulates six classes of QALY <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> and axiomatizes these <b>models</b> under expected <b>utility</b> (EU) and rank-dependent utility (RDU) assumptions. The QALY models investigated {{in this paper}} include the standard linear QALY model, the power and exponential multiplicative models, and the general multiplicative model. Emphasis is placed on a preference assumption, the zero condition, that greatly simplifies the axiomatizations under EU and RDU assumptions. The RDU axiomatizations of QALY models are generally similar to their EU counterparts, but in some cases, they require modification because linearity in probability is no longer assumed, and rank dependence introduces asymmetries between the domains of better-than-death health states and worsethan-death health states. 1999 Academic Press This paper concerns the foundations of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) <b>utility</b> <b>models.</b> QALY <b>utility</b> <b>models</b> are widely used in the expected utility analysis of health decisions because they provide an outcome measure that integrates the duration and quality {{of survival}}.

500|$|Engineering wise, Holden {{kept the}} changes low key. A revised {{steering}} system and tweaked suspension tuning were {{among some of}} the changes to sharpen handling precision. Further improvements were made to the Generation III V8 engine to produce peak power of [...] for sports variants. In a bid to recapture the market for low-cost, high-performance cars, Holden created a new SV8 specification level. Based on the entry-level Executive, the SV8 inherited the V8 mechanical package from the SS but made do without the luxury appointments and was sold at a correspondingly lower price. Holden also experimented by releasing a limited edition wagon version of its high-performance SS variant, of which only 850 were built. The Series II update added a front strut bar as standard to the SS, which was claimed to increase rigidity and hence handling. As became the trend, the update raised V8 power, now up [...] Amendments in the remaining models were confined to new wheels, trims and decals, however, the Calais has taken on a sports-luxury persona as opposed to the discrete luxury character seen in previous models. This repositioning in turn affected the Berlina's standing. The once second-tier model now became the sole luxury model, only overshadowed by the more expensive Calais. Coinciding with the VY II models was the first four-door <b>utility</b> <b>model</b> dubbed the Holden Crewman. Crewman's underpinnings and body structure while somewhat unusual, shared a fair amount in common with the Statesman/Caprice, One tonner and the two-door Ute.|$|E

2500|$|Ambulance {{services}} {{operating on}} a private/for profit basis {{have a long history}} in the U.S. Often, particularly in smaller communities, ambulance service was seen by the community as a lower priority than police or fire services, and certainly nothing that should require public funding. Until the professionalization of emergency medical services in the early 1970s, {{one of the most common}} providers of ambulance service in the United States was a community's local funeral home. This occurred essentially by default, as hearses were the only vehicles at the time capable of transporting a person lying down. Funeral home ambulance operations were sometimes supplemented by 'mom and pop' operations, which were not affiliated with funeral homes but rather operated on much the same basis as a taxi service. There were no national standards for ambulance services and staff generally had little, if any, medical training or equipment, leading to a high pre-hospital mortality rate. Such companies continue to operate this way in some locations, providing non-emergency transport services, fee-for-service emergency service, or contracted emergency ambulance service to municipalities, as in the public <b>utility</b> <b>model.</b> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, more than 200 private ambulance companies in the U.S. were gradually merged into large regional companies, some of which continue to operate today. As this trend continued, the result was a few remaining private companies, a handful of regional companies, and two very large multinational companies which currently dominate the entire industry. These services continue to operate in some parts of the U.S., either on a fee-for-service basis to the patient, or by means of contracts with local municipalities. [...] Such contracts usually result in a fee-for-service operation which is funded by the municipality on a supplementary basis, in exchange for formal guarantees of adequate performance on such issues as staffing, skill sets, resources available, and response times.|$|E
