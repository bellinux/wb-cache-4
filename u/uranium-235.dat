5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and <b>uranium-235</b> (0.7204%). Isotope {{separation}} concentrates (enriches) the fissionable <b>uranium-235</b> {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of <b>uranium-235</b> must impact other <b>uranium-235</b> atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of <b>uranium-235</b> needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E
5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% <b>uranium-235,</b> {{but only the}} latter is fissile. The chemically identical <b>uranium-235</b> has to be physically separated from the more plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for uranium enrichment, most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} 'enriched', the <b>uranium-235</b> fraction should be between 3% and 5%. This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of <b>uranium-235</b> {{and with a}} correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To {{be considered}} 'depleted', the <b>uranium-235</b> isotope concentration should {{be no more than}} 0.3%. The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% <b>uranium-235</b> are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|August 6: B-29 Enola Gay drops Little Boy, a gun-type <b>uranium-235</b> weapon, on {{the city}} of Hiroshima, the primary target.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), <b>uranium-235</b> (0.7198–0.7202%), {{and a very}} small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by {{emitting}} an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of <b>uranium-235</b> is 704 million years, making them useful in dating {{the age of the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|July 19: Oppenheimer {{recommends}} to Groves that gun-type design {{be abandoned}} and the <b>uranium-235</b> {{used to make}} composite cores.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranium-235</b> was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its <b>uranium-235</b> isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other <b>uranium-235</b> nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|Because <b>uranium-235</b> {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first {{material}} pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since <b>uranium-235</b> makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using <b>uranium-235</b> to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of <b>uranium-235.</b> In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), {{created a}} special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using <b>uranium-235</b> or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of <b>uranium-235.</b> He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.|$|E
5|$|No formula {{could be}} more {{accurate}} than the values put into it; the values for the cross sections were dubious, and {{had not yet been}} determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would be a priority, but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of <b>uranium-235,</b> and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (Electrostatic Generator) Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of <b>uranium-235.</b> This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of plutonium-239 was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as <b>uranium-235.</b> Titterton and Boyce McDaniel of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it took for prompt neutrons to be emitted from a <b>uranium-235</b> nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too. Confirmation of the theorists' contention that the number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both fast and slow neutrons took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.|$|E
5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} <b>uranium-235</b> and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was <b>uranium-235,</b> and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E
5|$|Technetium-99 (99Tc) {{is a major}} {{product of}} the fission of <b>uranium-235</b> (235U), making it {{the most common and}} most readily {{available}} isotope of technetium. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×108disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62GBq/g).|$|E
5|$|There {{were still}} many unknown factors. The {{properties}} of pure <b>uranium-235</b> were relatively unknown; {{even more so}} those of plutonium, a chemical element that had only recently been discovered by Glenn Seaborg and his team in February 1941, but which was theoretically fissile. The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned breeding plutonium in nuclear reactors from uranium-238 atoms that absorbed neutrons from fissioning <b>uranium-235</b> atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only microscopic quantities of plutonium were available that had been produced by cyclotrons.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. <b>Uranium-235</b> makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% <b>uranium-235</b> from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of <b>uranium-235,</b> thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural <b>uranium-235.</b> Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E
5|$|As {{little as}} 15lb (7kg) of <b>uranium-235</b> {{can be used}} to make an atomic bomb. The first nuclear bomb used in war, Little Boy, relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear {{explosive}} (the Gadget used at Trinity) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki (Fat Man) were both plutonium bombs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, <b>uranium-235</b> has been used as the fissile {{explosive}} material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses <b>uranium-235</b> and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{with the}} fission of uranium were already {{proceeding}} at universities and research institutes in the United States. Alfred Lee Loomis was supporting Ernest Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Vannevar Bush was also doing similar {{research at the}} Carnegie Institution. At Columbia, while Fermi and Szilard investigated the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction, Dunning considered the possibility, advanced by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler but discounted by Fermi, {{that it was the}} rare <b>uranium-235</b> isotope of uranium that was primarily responsible for fission. He had Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, <b>uranium-235</b> and uranium-238 using a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|For a while, the calutrons {{suffered}} {{from a series of}} debilitating breakdowns and equipment failures, exacerbated by a shortage of spare parts. Hopes that the Alpha II racetracks would be more reliable soon faded, as they were plagued by insulator failures. These problems were gradually overcome. The first shipments of enriched uranium to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory were made in March 1944, consisting of Alpha product enriched to 13 to 15 percent <b>uranium-235.</b> While of no use in a bomb, it was urgently required for experiments with enriched uranium. The last shipment of Alpha product was made on 11 May 1944. On 7 June 1944, Y-12 made its first delivery of weapons-grade Beta product, enriched to as high as 89% <b>uranium-235.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1942, Bush sent {{a report}} to Roosevelt {{outlining}} work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of <b>uranium-235.</b> Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of <b>uranium-235</b> was {{in the range of}} 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with a destructive power of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the construction requirements, Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the S-1 Section with a new S-1 Executive Committee.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} uses {{of uranium}} exploit its unique nuclear properties. <b>Uranium-235</b> {{is the only}} naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough <b>uranium-235</b> is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; <b>uranium-235</b> {{and to a lesser}} degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography.|$|E
5|$|Neutrons {{from the}} fission of <b>uranium-235</b> are {{captured}} by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; a beta decay converts a neutron into a proton to form neptunium-239 (half-life 2.36days) and another beta decay forms plutonium-239. Egon Bretscher {{working on the}} British Tube Alloys project predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12. Y-12 {{initially}} enriched the <b>uranium-235</b> content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos laboratory in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. The rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the <b>uranium-235</b> feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By April 1945 K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.|$|E
5|$|The main use {{of uranium}} in the {{civilian}} sector is to fuel nuclear power plants. One kilogram of <b>uranium-235</b> can theoretically produce about 20terajoules of energy (2joules), assuming complete fission; {{as much energy as}} 1500 tonnes of coal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranium-235</b> is {{important}} for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, {{because it is the}} only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is fissile. This means that it can be split into two or three fragments (fission products) by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Uranium-238 is {{the most}} stable isotope of uranium, with a {{half-life}} of about 4.468 years, roughly {{the age of the}} Earth. <b>Uranium-235</b> has a half-life of about 7.13 years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48 years.|$|E
5|$|Y-12 {{initially}} enriched the <b>uranium-235</b> {{content to}} between 13 and 15 percent, and shipped {{the first few}} hundred grams of this to the Manhattan Project's weapons design laboratory, the Los Alamos Laboratory, in March 1944.

Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10 percent of the <b>uranium-235</b> feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4 percent) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant, and the next month it received enhanced (5 percent) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.|$|E

5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in <b>uranium-235</b> also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent <b>uranium-235,</b> along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, {{research}} into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, and had only produced objects that looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both <b>uranium-235</b> and plutonium, and implosion technology would not be required.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of <b>uranium-235.</b> A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
5|$|Each NuScale {{reactor vessel}} is {{expected}} to be 9 feet diameter (2.74 meters) by 65 feet high (19.81 meters) and weigh 650 tons (590 metric tons). The modules would be pre-fabricated, delivered by railcar, barge or special trucks and assembled on-site. The units are designed to produce 50 megawatts of electricity each and require refueling with standard 4.95 percent enriched <b>Uranium-235</b> fuel every two years.|$|E
5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium {{is important not}} only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like <b>uranium-235,</b> is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|For natural uranium, about 49% of its {{alpha rays}} are emitted {{by each of}} 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the Earth was young, {{probably}} about one-fifth of its uranium was <b>uranium-235,</b> but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Pupin Physics Laboratories at Columbia where Zinn worked {{were the}} center of {{intensive}} research into the properties of uranium and nuclear fission, which had recently been discovered by Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. At Columbia, Zinn, Enrico Fermi, Herbert L. Anderson , John R. Dunning and Leo Szilard investigated whether uranium-238 fissioned with slow neutrons, as Fermi believed, or only the <b>uranium-235</b> isotope, as Niels Bohr contended. Since pure <b>uranium-235</b> was not available, Fermi and Szilard chose to work with natural uranium. They were particularly interested in whether a nuclear chain reaction could be initiated. This would require more than one neutron to be emitted per fission on average {{in order to keep}} the chain reaction going. By March 1939, they established that about two were being emitted per fission on average. The delay between an atom absorbing a neutron and fission occurring would be the key to controlling a chain reaction.|$|E
