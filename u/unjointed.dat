Her rod lay <b>unjointed</b> beside her, and two or three big trout gleamed in the bottom of the craft, while Weston, who knelt astern, leisurely dipped the single-bladed paddle. Dusky pines hung over the river, wrapping it in grateful shadow, through which the water swirled crystal clear, and the canoe moved slowly down-stream across the slack of an eddy. Farther out, the stream frothed furiously among great boulders and then leaped in a wild white rush down a rapid, though here and there a narrow strip of green water appeared in the midst of the latter. The deep roar it made broke soothingly through the drowsy heat, and Ida listened languidly while she watched the pines slide past.|$|E

50|$|Moro Rock is a {{dome-shaped}} granite monolith. Common in the Sierra Nevada, these domes form by exfoliation, the spalling or {{casting off}} in scales, plates, or sheets of rock layers on otherwise <b>unjointed</b> granite. Outward {{expansion of the}} granite results in exfoliations. Expansion results from load relief; when the overburden that once capped the granite has eroded away, the source of compression is removed and the granite slowly expands. Fractures that form during exfoliation tend to cut corners. This ultimately results in rounded dome-like forms.|$|E

50|$|Nearly all polychaetes have parapodia that {{function}} as limbs, while other major annelid groups lack them. Parapodia are <b>unjointed</b> paired {{extensions of the}} body wall, and their muscles are derived from the circular muscles of the body.

The main roof is surmounted by 51 cast iron chimney pots in the shape of fluted Doric columns.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{vertical}} joint planes controlled {{where and how}} fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of overlying rock via erosion. The great majority of Yosemite Valley's widening, for example, was due to joint-controlled rockfall. In fact, only 10% of its widening and 12% of its excavation {{are thought to be}} the result of glaciation. Large, relatively <b>unjointed</b> volumes of granite form domes such as Half Dome and monoliths like the 3604 feet (1098 m) high El Capitan. Closely spaced joints lead to the creation of columns, pillers, and pinnacles such as Washington Column, Cathedral Spires, and Split Pinnacle.|$|E

50|$|The setae ("hairs") of annelids project {{out from}} the {{epidermis}} to provide traction and other capabilities. The simplest are <b>unjointed</b> and form paired bundles near {{the top and bottom}} of each side of each segment. The parapodia ("limbs") of annelids that have them often bear more complex chetae at their tips - for example jointed, comb-like or hooked. Chetae are made of moderately flexible β-chitin and are formed by follicles, each of which has a chetoblast ("hair-forming") cell at the bottom and muscles that can extend or retract the cheta. The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli, fine hair-like extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta. When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta. Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae ("bristles") of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid α-chitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{radiating}} brackets {{and blocks}} {{that support the}} deep eaves of the roof are [...] "cloud-shaped" [...] (kumo tokyō (lit. cloud tokyō)), a type found only in the earliest buildings to survive to the modern period: the kondō, pagoda, and central gate (chūmon) at Hōryū-ji, and the three-storey pagodas at Hokki-ji and Hōrin-ji (the last was struck by lightning and burnt {{to the ground in}} 1944). The bracket system supports tail rafters (odaruki) that extend far into the eaves. In a full-scale building, the downward load of the eaves upon the far end of these tail rafters is counterbalanced at the other end by the main load of the roof. The simple <b>unjointed</b> purlins that support the roof covering in the eaves are circular in cross-section, as opposed to the rectangular purlins of the earliest surviving buildings. Also at the corners the purlins are arranged parallel to each other rather than in the radial setting known from excavations at Shitennō-ji. The columns or square posts are encased by their tie beams rather than pierced by the more usual penetrating tie beams ( [...] nuki).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{an attempt}} was made to assess the {{effectiveness}} of finger jointing in utilising mango wood sections for various end uses like furniture. The study was based on the estimation of Modulus of elasticity and Modulus of rupture under static bending and Maximum Crushing Stress and Modulus of elasticity under compression parallel to grain of finger jointed sections and comparing them with the values measured for clear wood sections from the same lot. For joining the sections, the Poly Vinyl Acetate and Urea Formaldehyde adhesives were used. It was found that the Modulus of elasticity of the sections joined by either adhesive showed significantly better values than that of <b>unjointed</b> clear wood sections. The Modulus of rupture values of sections joined with Urea Formaldehyde were similar to those of <b>unjointed</b> clear wood sections. However, sections jointed with Poly Vinyl Acetate adhesive exhibited lower Modulus of rupture. Under compression, the parameters of the jointed sections joined with either adhesive were either similar or better than those of the <b>unjointed</b> clear wood sections. The study demonstrates the utility of finger jointing of mango wood sections for furniture parts especially with the Urea Formaldehyde adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Fluted-core {{sandwich}} composites {{consist of}} integral angled web members spaced between laminate face sheets, {{and may have}} the potential to provide benefits over traditional sandwich composites for certain aerospace applications. However, fabrication of large autoclave-cured fluted-core cylindrical shells with existing autoclaves will require that the shells be fabricated in segments, and joined longitudinally to form a complete barrel. Two different longitudinal fluted-core joint designs were considered experimentally in this study. In particular, jointed fluted-core-composite panels were tested in longitudinal compression because longitudinal compression is the primary loading condition in dry launch-vehicle barrel sections. One of the joint designs performed well in comparison with <b>unjointed</b> test articles, and the other joint design failed at loads approximately 14 % lower than <b>unjointed</b> test articles. The compression-after-impact (CAI) performance of jointed fluted-core composites was also investigated by testing test articles that had been subjected to 6 ft-lb impacts. It was found that such impacts reduced the load-carrying capability by 9 % to 40 %. This reduction is dependent on the joint concept, component flute size, and facesheet thickness...|$|E
40|$|In glued-laminated bamboo beams loaded in bending, {{failure is}} {{initiated}} at the outermost lamination on the tension side.

Since the outermost laminations at the tension side of the beam are subjected to nearly a uniform tension force, failure in both <b>unjointed</b> and jointed laminations loaded in tension was studied. Based on an analytical study in combination with numerical simulations, it was found that failure of <b>unjointed</b> laminations for Phyllostachys pubescens is always initiated at a joint {{in such a way that}} stresses are not able to redistribute. This was confirmed by experimental tests. To lengthen the laminations, scarf-joints with a slope of 1 in 10 turned out to be very effective.

40|$|Finger {{jointing}} {{of short}} off-cuts for structural purposes particularly for lightweight roof truss and prefabricated timber house is likely an economical method of minimizing wastage and generating benefits. The {{primary goal of}} this research is on the possibility of using finger-jointed timber with metal plate connectors for structural purposes, i. e. in trusses: internal members, top and bottom chord. This research assessed the strength properties of finger-jointed Strength Group B timber and the influence of number of joints and its positioning on strength. The glue applied for finger jointing is polymer isocyanate adhesive or commercially known as Koyo glue. Bending, compression and tension tests were carried out and the results show that the efficiency of the joints in relation to the strength of the <b>unjointed</b> specimens were greatly influenced by the positioning and number of joints. The results obtained from tests indicated that modulus of rupture decreases with the presence of finger joint while modulus of elasticity is not affected. Tests on the performance of connection with metal plate using finger-jointed timber showed small difference in the basic working load as compared to the <b>unjointed</b> specimens. The study suggests that the combination use of finger-jointed timber with metal plate connector for structural purposes is acceptable depending on the joint efficiency, the position and number of the finger joint in the member, and the type of stresses (i. e. compression, tension or bending) in the member...|$|E
40|$|Effect of the PVA gluing on bending {{strength}} properties of finger jointed turkey oakwood (Quercus cerris L.) © Springer-Verlag 2005 1 Subject The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the influence of finger length, type of glue and finger orientation on {{bending strength}} (modulus of rupture and elasticity) of finger jointed turkey oak-wood (Quercus cerris L.). Limited information is available on end gluing hardwoods in contrast to softwoods, which have been extensively investigated and industrially utilized (Pena 1999). Non-structural products include furniture, cladding, fencing, in-ternal and external joinery. In structural uses finger jointing is finally the major method to end joint timber for the production of glue-laminated wood (Koch 1972, Jokerst 1981, Nestic and Milner 1993). The other methods to end joint timber (butt and scarf joint) did not find industrial acceptance (River 1994). There are no experimental results for finger-jointed oakwood in Greece. Oak is the most abundant tree species in Greece (746 400 ha) and covers 49 % of the broadleaved Greek forests (about 2. 5 mil-lion ha). Oakwood is produced from coppice forests in small dimensions and utilized almost exclusively as fuelwood and for charcoal production (Stamou 2001). Pena (1999) studied the sui-tability of producing non-structural finger joints made from Eu-ropean Oak (Quercus petraea L.). He examined the effect of the geometry of finger joint in bending strength, using two diffe-rent finger lengths (9 and 12 mm).
