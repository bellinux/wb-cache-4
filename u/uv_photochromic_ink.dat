40|$|Photochromic {{materials}} {{have often been}} categorised as a smart material as they could sense and change colour with reversibility from colourless to coloured once exposed to ultraviolet radiation. The aim of this ongoing research is to exploit the design potential of commercially available water based <b>photochromic</b> <b>inks</b> when applied onto textiles using a screen printing method. This research paper highlights the experimental design research conducted in order to design multi-colour change textile patterns and discusses an electronic activation method {{which could be used}} to activate dynamic photochromic colours. The results highlight the complex colour changing effects of <b>photochromic</b> <b>inks</b> and outline new variables which could be used to control the kinetic behaviour of photochromic prints...|$|R

In recent years we have devoted some interest {{to the study of}} coumarin chromophores, with special emphasis on their synthesis and photophysical properties. 2 Our previous result on 3 -styryl coumarins shown a promising fluorescent behavior, prompted us to study a new styryl coumarin family. Here we present the synthesis of a new coumarin family 1 with increased extension of the -delocalized system of the chromophore at the 5 -position (Fig. 1). Theoretical calculations (DFT) support our experimental findings where electron excitation leads to a reduction of the electron density around the C=C double bond and a reduction of the rotational barrier in the excited state. Likewise, simulated UV spectra shows maxima at 266, 300 and 335 (Fig. 1) which are consistent with the maxima observed experimentally at 269, 308 and 360. The synthesized compounds present E-Z isomerization around the carbon-carbon double bond which can potentially be envisaged {{to be used as a}} memory media.

40|$|Abstract. Organic dyes namely 1, 3, 3 -trimethylindolino-naphtospirooxazine (TINS) and 3, 3 -diphenyl- 3 H-napthol[2, 1 -b]pyran DNP) {{were used}} in studies of {{photochromic}} transformation in ethanol solution. The samples were exposed to UV light ranging from 5, 10 and 15 s respectively. TINS absorbs UV light at 613 nm for multiple exposure time. The absorption initiated the opening of oxazine spirostructure with formation of open merocyanine species. Irradiation of DNP with UV at 5, 10 and 15 s absorbs at 413 nm with formation of opening cyclicstucture of naphthopyran, namely allenyl-naphtol. The intensity peaks of TINS and DNP were increased with increasing the period of irradiation time. TINS and DNP dyes exhibit normal photochromic in the polar protic solvent by displaying color changes form transparent to color blue and light orange under exposed <b>UV</b> light. The <b>photochromic</b> activity of these compounds {{is due to the}} reversible light-induced cleavage of the C-O bond between the heterocyclic oxygen atom and the quaternary carbon...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the assembly and disassembly of vesicles formed by a UV-responsive poly(ethylene glycol) terminated malachite green derivative. The UV-responsive amphiphile {{with both a}} hydrophobic malachite green group and a hydrophilic PEG group can self-organize into vesicles in water before UV irradiation. However, upon <b>UV</b> irradiation, the <b>photochromic</b> moiety can be ionized to its corresponding cation, leading to the disassembly of these vesicles. In addition, the cation can thermally recover its electrically neutral form, and the disassembled species can form vesicles reversibly {{on the basis of}} a thermal reverse reaction. The reverse reaction is temperature-controlled and can be speeded up by thermal treatment. By using various characterization techniques, e. g., transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, UV-visible spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy, we have confirmed that the vesicle structures can be formed, disassembled, and recovered by the above-mentioned treatments. It is anticipated greatly that this line of research may provide new insights into the mechanism behind stimuli-responsive formation and rupture of molecular assemblies, facilitating the design and synthesis of new surface active molecules for the fabrication of stimuli-responsive materials with designed functions. status: publishe...|$|R
