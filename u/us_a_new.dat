In 1976, it occupied the Old Woodward High School building, {{on the site of}} one of the oldest public schools in the country. The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s, but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals, leadership struggles, and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium. Its reputation recovered {{in the years that followed}} and in 2009–10, the school was featured in the MTV reality series Taking the Stage, filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students. In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment to create the first kindergarten through twelfth grade (about ages five to seventeen) arts school and first private sector/public arts school in the <b>US.</b> <b>A</b> <b>new</b> facility in Over-the-Rhine was championed by the late Cincinnati Pops Maestro Erich Kunzel and funded through a unique public-private partnership that raised over $31million in private contributions to match public funding. The building features specialized facilities for the arts and three separate theaters and is the key to redevelopment plans for the area.|$|E

The Philharmonic Society of London {{offered a}} commission for a symphony, and Prince Nikolas Golitsin of St. Petersburg {{offered to pay}} Beethoven's price for three string quartets. The first of these commissions spurred Beethoven to finish the Ninth Symphony, which was first performed, along with the Missa Solemnis, on 7May 1824, to great acclaim at the Kärntnertortheater. The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung gushed, [...] "inexhaustible genius had shown <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> world," [...] and Carl Czerny wrote that his symphony [...] "breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [...] {{from the head of}} this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads." [...] Unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts, this did not make Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were significantly higher. A second concert on 24May, in which the producer guaranteed Beethoven a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that [...] "many people [...] already gone into the country."

Overall, seven different recording studios and four producers were used during the two years spent recording A New Morning, with costs estimated at around £1million. The album was a commercial disappointment which failed to enter the top 20 and it was never released in the <b>US.</b> <b>A</b> <b>New</b> Morning sharply divided fans of the band {{even more so than}} Head Music and critical reaction was decidedly lukewarm. Furthermore, the mainstream public interest had long disappeared.

Anderson has since stressed his disappointment with Suede's final album, stating [...] "We made one Suede album too many. 'A New Morning' is the only one I don't believe in as much as the other Suede records and I totally believed in the first four, even 'Head Music' which divided the fans." [...] Mat Osman told journalist Jon Cronshaw in October 2013 that: [...] "“It sounded like a Suede album that had been made by a committee – it was quite bland. We’re all quite ashamed of it".
