40|$|A {{route is}} {{presented}} for activation of hydrogen-terminated Si(100) prior to atomic layer deposition. It {{is based on}} our discovery from in situ infrared spectroscopy that organometallic precursors can effectively initiate oxide growth. Narrow nuclear resonance profiling and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry show that <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> pre-exposure to 108 Langmuir trimethylaluminum at 300 °C leads to enhanced nucleation and to nearly linear growth kinetics of the high-permittivity gate dielectrics aluminum oxide and hafnium oxide...|$|R
50|$|Plasma {{treatment}} of surfaces {{is essentially a}} dry etching of the surface. This is achieved by filling a chamber with gas, such as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine, and accelerating ions species from an ion source through plasma. The ion acceleration towards the surface forms deep grooves within the surface. In addition to the topography, plasma treatment can also provide <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> using different gases to deposit different elements on surfaces. Surface roughness {{is dependent on the}} duration of plasma etching.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{diamagnetic}} behavior exhibited by bulk ZnO and Au, a ferromagnetic-like behavior is induced in nanoparticles of both systems <b>by</b> appropriate <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization.</b> <b>By</b> capping with thiol deriva-tized molecules, magnetic hysteresis is observed even at room temperature, whereas the magnetization has a very little temperature dependence. Cap-ping induces an alteration of their electronic configuration {{that depends on the}} capping molecule, as evidenced by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, that strongly affects their magnetic properties.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulation for comprehensive analysis of friction between bilayer of 2 D crystalline nanomaterials: Graphene–Graphene, Graphene–Boron Nitride (BN) and BN–BN. For Graphene–Graphene and BN–BN friction, we investigated the effect of defect (vacancy, stone-wale) and <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> hydrogen. Our results shows that presence of defect influences the frictional properties. Moreover, hydrogen functionalization will increase the friction because of the increase of surface roughness. We investigated the variation of frictional force with <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization.</b> The last model considered the friction between Graphene–BN. The interface between Graphene–BN substrate {{plays a crucial role}} in application of nanodevices. We analyzed the energy landscape, evolution of Moire pattern and frictional force between sheets for various conditions. This comprehensive study will help understand deeply the mechanics of friction of 2 D crystalline nanomaterials...|$|R
30|$|From this work, it was {{proven that}} thermal {{evaporation}} {{can be a}} feasible alternative to e-beam evaporation for the fabrication of the AgNR array by O.A.D. And {{the important role of}} the diffusion effect in the AgNR array formation, revealed by this study, proposes the substrate temperature control for AgNR films of new morphology. It is expected that this work will {{contribute to the development of}} highly sensitive SERS films and provide more opportunities to researchers who urgently need novel SERS films. We are currently planning to apply the AgNR array films to highly sensitive multiple-gas sensing through <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> various thiol molecules.|$|R
40|$|Improvement of {{the binding}} of {{polypyrrole}} with PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) thin film using low pressure plasma was studied. The effects of various plasma gases i. e., Ar, O 2 and Ar + O 2 gases on surface roughness, surface chemistry and hydrophilicity were noted. The topographical {{change of the}} PVDF film was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy and chemical changes by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, with adhesion of polypyrrole (PPy) by abrasion tests and sheet resistance measurements. Results showed {{that the increase in}} roughness and <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> oxygen functional groups contributed to improved adhesion and Ar + O 2 plasma gave better adhesion...|$|R
40|$|A thiol-functionalized poly (phenylacetylene) {{has been}} {{synthesized}} and characterized. The {{disappearance of the}} characteristic vibrations at 3312 and 776 cm(- 1) (C=C-H) and 2106 cm(- 1) (C=C), together with the vanishing of the chemical shifts at 3. 0 (C=C-H) {{and the appearance of}} the chemical shifts at 6. 4 (C=C-H) indicate the polymerization of the thiol-containing monomer. The hybrid of thiol-functionalized poly(phenylacetylene) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) showed good solubility in organic solvents. Meanwhile,the wrapping of the polymer chains on MWNTs led to the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization.</b> <b>By</b> aid of the interactions between thiol groups and zinc cations, ZnO nanoparticles were assembled onto out-shells of the hybrids. These results suggested a novel route to the fabrication of multi-component nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> {{topographic}} micro- and nano-structures {{in order}} to achieve unique properties, like super-hydrophobicity or ultrahigh light absorption, is a common strategy in nature. In this paper, direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) is presented as a promising tool allowing for the generation of such surface patterns on technical surfaces {{in order to}} mimic these biological surfaces and effects. Friction optimization and antibacterial effects by DLIP are exemplarily described. Topographic surface patterns on the micro- and nano-scale demonstrated a significant reduction in the coefficient of friction and bacterial adhesion. It was shown that in both cases, the control of the contact area between surfaces or between surface and bacteria is of utmost importance...|$|R
30|$|In contrast, {{the major}} {{strategy}} for <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> biological molecules includes two steps, first synthesizing the small molecules or polymers functionalized NPs, and then coupled to the biomolecules by chemical bond or physical adsorption. Recently, Lee et al. [108] developed a route for conjugating the γ-Fe 2 O 3 NPs with single strand oligonucleotides. The water-soluble magnetic NPs with carboxyl groups on their surfaces were prepared at first, {{and then by}} using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimrthylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as a liker reagent, they successfully modified a protein, streptavidin, {{on the surface of}} γ-Fe 2 O 3 NPs. Streptavidin functionalized Fe 2 O 3 can catch a biotin-labeled single strand oligonucleotides through the strong affinity between streptavidin and biotin.|$|R
50|$|Because its bandgap (1.9-2.2 eV) lies in {{an intense}} {{region of the}} solar spectrum, α-Fe2O3 has been studied as a photoanode for solar water oxidation. However, its {{efficacy}} is limited by a short diffusion length (2-4 nm) of photo-excited charge carriers and subsequent fast recombination, requiring a large overpotential to drive the reaction. Research {{has been focused on}} improving the water oxidation performance of Fe2O3 using nanostructuring, <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization,</b> or <b>by</b> employing alternate crystal phases such as β-Fe2O3.|$|R
40|$|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sensors {{are widely}} used in diverse applications. For {{detecting}} heavy metal ions in water, <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of the metal surface is typically used to adsorb target molecules, where the ionic concentration is detected via a resonance shift (resonance angle, resonance wavelength or intensity). This paper studies the potential of a possible alternative approach that could eliminate the need of using <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> the application of an external electric field in the flow channel. The exerted electrical force on the ions pushes them against the surface for enhanced adsorption; hence it {{is referred to as}} “Electric-Field assisted SPR system”. High system sensitivity is achieved by monitoring the time dynamics of the signal shift. The ion deposition dynamics are discussed using a derived theoretical model based on ion mobility in water. On the application of an appropriate force, the target ions stack onto the sensor surface depending on the ionic concentration of target solution, ion mass, and flow rate. In the experimental part, a broad detection range of target cadmium ions (Cd 2 +) in water from several parts per million (ppm) down to a few parts per billion (ppb) can be detected...|$|R
30|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> {{decorating the}} {{material}} surfaces with nanoparticles {{to enhance the}} sensitivity and selectivity of the gas sensor towards the hazardous gas using chemical route has been reported elsewhere [14, 15]. However, this method is very complicated as the preparation involved many chemicals and consuming lots of reaction time to tune the desired size of the nanoparticles for the aimed applications [16]. To avoid this complication, some researchers are attempting to enhance the performance of gas sensor by using UV light to create the photogenerated electron and hole pairs as an alternate route {{because it does not}} require complicated chemical preparation and hence time efficiency [17 – 20]. Moreover, the use of UV light could be the alternate solution to avoid heating the sensor and results in reducing the power consumption and avoiding the sensor degradation due to the high temperatures as conventional gas sensor required high temperature to operate and achieve stability.|$|R
50|$|Grafting {{copolymers}} to {{a surface}} can be envisioned as fixing polymeric chains to a structurally different polymer substrate {{with the intention}} of changing surface functionality while preserving bulk mechanical properties. The nature and degree of <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> is determined <b>by</b> both the choice of copolymer and the type and extent of grafting.|$|R
40|$|Modeling electro-kinetic {{effects of}} aqueous {{solutions}} on charged polymer surfaces constitute great challenges. The interplay of water pH and salt concentration with surface charges at the nanoscale and macroscopic collective hydrodynamics {{leads to a}} rich phenomenology, including the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the polymer surface. The present work aimed at contributing to the modeling of these phenomena for a specific system: Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), including a <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> carboxylic groups. We report on molecular dynamic simulation of water interactions under imposed hydrodynamics with a flat PVDF surface functionalized with charged groups and buffered by sodium ions. Using this approach, we simulate the velocity and density profiles of water {{as a function of}} the <b>functionalization.</b> <b>By</b> using averaged charge distributions, the electrostatic surface potential at the mean field level, and hence the zeta potential, is also given. Deviations from Navier-Stokes type hydrodynamics at nanoscales are given and we found, in accord with experimental findings, that PVDF gets wet in contact with water. The observed dependencies of the hydrodynamics at nanoscales sheet light on the potential use of functionalized PVDF for instance as a membrane material for water filtration purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidative}} polymerization of 5, 6 -dihydroxybenzothiophene (DHBT), {{the sulfur}} analog {{of the key}} eumelanin building block 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole (DHI), was investigated to probe the role of nitrogen in eumelanin build-up and properties. Unlike DHI, which gives a typical black insoluble eumelanin polymer on oxidation, DHBT is converted to a grayish amorphous solid (referred to as thiomelanin) with visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance properties {{different from those of}} DHI melanin. Mass spectrometry experiments revealed gradational mixtures of oligomers up to the decamer level. Quite unexpectedly, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the early oligomer fractions indicated linear, 4 -, and 7 -linked structures in marked contrast with DHI, which gives highly complex mixtures of partially degraded oligomers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the tendency of DHBT to couple via the 4 - and 7 -positions. These results uncover the role of nitrogen as a major determinant of the structural diversity generated by the polymerization of DHI, and point to replacement by sulfur as a viable entry to regioregular eumelanin-type materials for potential applications for <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> dip coating...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{one example}} of the utilization of microplasmas formed in cavities, which are surrounded partially or completely by dielectric materials, for surface technological processes. The modification or coating of inner surfaces in already sealed polymer- or glass-based microfluidic systems is a challenging new application of atmospheric-pressure microplasmas which promises the achievement {{of a wide range of}} physico-chemical surface properties which are difficult to attain by wet-chemical or low-pressure plasma processes. Depending on the type of gas atmosphere or precursor fed into the microfluidic system, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, anionic or cationic, reactive or inert surfaces will be accessible in cost-efficient processes. After an introduction into recent developments in the area of <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharges and microplasmas, this contribution will describe the coating of inner surfaces of microfluidic devices and the evaluation of film thickness profiles along microfluidic channels using FTIR microspectroscopy. Results of thickness profile measurements are presented and discussed for hydrophilic silicon dioxide coatings as well as hydrophobic deposits obtained from hexamethyl-disiloxane...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue {{to their}} {{exceptional}} physiochemical properties, carbon nanotubes (CNT) raise great industrial and research interests in fields {{as diverse as}} biomedicine, microelectronics, or composites. <b>Surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> acid treatment {{has been described as}} an easy way to reduce the CNT hydrophobicity and biopersistance. Its impact on in vitro cellular response remained however unclear with numerous contradictions between studies. This work aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the acid functionalization effects on cellular activity. The impact of (1) the CNT purification from their catalytic impurities and (2) the presence of surface acid groups have been discriminated. A thermal desorption treatment to remove surface acid groups has been conducted after acid <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> HNO 3, H 2 SO 4. After a complete physicochemical characterization, the biological toxicity was evaluated on RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages. Results showed that acid functionalization leads to (1) a decrease of the pro-inflammatory response, oxidative stress {{and to a lesser extent}} cytotoxicity due to the CNT purification, and (2) an increase of the pro-inflammatory response due to the surface acid groups. This study underlined the necessity to weight the benefit-risk balance of such an acid purification based on the CNT primary state of purification for a safer-design approach...|$|R
30|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA {{can further}} be {{confirmed}} by XRD spectrum. Figure  1 i represents the XRD of pristine ferrite. The diffractogram exhibits d 311, d 400, d 511 and d 533 crystal planes at 31.8 °, 45.5 °, 56.7 ° and 75.7 °, respectively. A sharp crystalline peak at 31.8 ° {{is responsible for the}} increase in basal spacing (the distance between the two crystal planes) of ferrite. Figure  1 j enumerates the XRD of ferrite after the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> with FA. Here also one can observe crystalline peaks corresponding to d 311 and d 400 crystal planes [29]. After the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> reaction there is no change in the peak position. At the same time the peak intensity was suppressed. If there is any change in peak position or disappearance of d 311 crystal plane, one can come to an idea about the intercalation or exfoliation reaction. In fact such a change in peak position was not observed. This confirmed the absence of intercalation or exfoliation reaction during the <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA. The important point noted here is the peak intensity which was drastically reduced, resulted in the appearance of the peaks at 56.7 ° and 75.7 ° disappeared. By noting the decrease in the peak intensity of d 311 and d 400 one can easily predict the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA. In the case of FA one can see six different functionalities such as –NH 2, –OH, –NH–, –CO 2 –H, CO–NH, C=N. Among those, the amino group has good metal surface binding activity. Moreover, the FTIR spectrum confirmed the presence of –NH stretching. This urged us to suggest the amino group of FA which might interact with the ferrite surface in an alkaline pH. The present investigation on XRD of ferrite before and after functionalization with FA concludes the simple surface adsorptions of FA onto ferrite, i.e., <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA.|$|R
30|$|The UV–Visible {{spectrum}} of ferrite {{before and after}} <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> reaction is shown in Fig.  1 c, d, respectively. A broad peak at 334  nm [27] confirmed the presence of iron (Fig.  1 c). The ferrite after the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> exhibited {{a broad peak at}} 371  nm is corresponding to the iron atom. A shoulder at 261  nm is ascribed to the π → π* transition of FA (Fig.  1 d). The red shift in the absorbance peak at 371  nm confirmed the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> of ferrite <b>by</b> FA.

40|$|International audienceBioimaging {{and cell}} {{labeling}} using red or near infrared phosphors emitting in the ''therapeutic window'' of biological tissues have recently become {{some of the}} most active research fields in modern medical diagnostics. However, because organic and inorganic autofluorophores are omnipresent in nature, very often the background signal from fluorochromes other than targeted probes has to be eliminated. This discrimination could be available using a time-gated luminescence microscopy (TGLM) technique associated with long lifetime phosphorescent nanocomposites. Here, we report new SiO 2 nanostructured particle (50 nm in diameter) embedded luminescent nanosized [Mo 6 I 8 (C 2 F 5 COO) (6) ](2 -) metal atom clusters (1 nm in diameter), successfully prepared by the microemulsion technique. This combination provides new physical insight and displays red emission in biological based solution under UV-Vis excitation with long lifetimes of around 17 and 84 mu s. Moreover, the nanoparticles can be internalized by cancer cells after <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> transferrin protein and clearly imaged by TGLM under excitation at 365 nm.

The variation of sensor response to ammonia gas was investigated for both undoped and platinum doped WO 3 sensor layers. The response to ammonia exhibited significant improvement following surface modification with catalyzed silica. The increase {{has been attributed to}} an increase in Schottky barrier height. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo control {{specific}} {{endothelial cell}} (EC) functions, cell adhesive RGDS, EC specific REDV and YIGSR peptides, and angiogenic SVVYGLR sequences were covalently immobilized onto polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces {{for the purpose}} of cell culture. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and contact angle measurement were employed for characterization of surface modifications. The peptide density on PET surfaces was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The surfaces immobilized with peptides were exposed to human umbilical vein endothelial cells to study their specific effects onto EC functions. The results showed that the surface functionalized by these peptides enhanced the EC adhesion, spreading and migration as compared with native PET surfaces. Specifically, the RGDS peptides induced more cell adhesion than other peptides. The YIGSR and SVVYGLR sequences induced more cell spreading and cell migration, represented by intense focal adhesion at the leading edges of cell spreading and migration. The bi-functionalization of RGDS and SVVYGLR peptides (MIX) combined the advantages of both peptides and induced significant EC adhesion, spreading and migration. Our study indicates that the <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> peptides specific for ECs, especially the combination of RGDS with SVVYGLR or YIGSR peptides, has potential applications in promoting endothelialization of vascular prostheses and for construction of vascularized tissues in tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis {{is caused}} by M. tuberculosis, which may attack mainly the lungs {{surviving}} within alveolar macrophages (AM). Pulmonary route appears the most promising way to reach promptly the infected site. To achieve effective drug delivery inside AM, drugs are required to reach alveoli and to be taken up by AM. In order to fulfil this goal, respirable powders of rifampicin loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticle assemblies (SLNas) able to be internalized by AM were developed using the melt emulsifying technique and modifying conveniently pre-freezing parameters by means of Design of Experiments approach. The most favourable impact on powder respirability (> 50 % respirable fraction) was exerted by quick-freezing combined with a certain grade of sample dilution {{without the use of}} cryoprotectants [1, 2]. SLNas <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> methyl α-D-mannopyranoside (MP) recognizing mannose receptors located on infected AM was realized to facilitate cell internalization (active targeting). Mannosylated SLNas exhibited physical properties suitable for AM passive targeting, adequate rifampicin payloads (10 - 15 %), and feasible drug maintenance within SLNas along the respiratory tract before AM internalization. Concerning the active targeting, the presence of MP on SLNas surface caused a quicker internalization rate by AM. Nevertheless, respirability was impaired by the powders cohesiveness [3]. Therefore, novel more balanced amphiphiles bearing mannose residues differently arranged on SLNas surface were considered reaching improved respirability performance...|$|R

Different plasma treatment conditions, like discharge power, exposure time, sample distance and gas flow, have been varied to observe their effect on the plasma jet radial profiles.

40|$|Currently, {{the gold}} {{standard}} to repair large nerve defects is the autologous nerve graft. These solutions offer a mechanical support, adhesion substrates, and, with Schwann cells (SC), a source of neurotropic factors for axonal growth. The technical limits are the donor side damage, multiple surgical accesses, and the unavailability of large amounts of grafts. In recent years, several researchers focused their attention on the interaction between cells (nervous and glial) and physic-chemical cues that arise from the extracellular milieu. Nanotechnologies produce surfaces that mimic the topographical signals (physical stimuli) that arise from enterprise content management (ECM) to modulate the forces acting during axonal elongation. The use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) seems {{to be able to}} guide and to boost the nerve regeneration. Both research areas could be improved through <b>surfaces</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> biological molecules (proteins/peptides, growth factors, etc.). In the future, the aim will be to help recovery after peripheral nerve lesion by producing a tridimensional structured conduit, then repeat the ECM architecture and take advantage of MNPs internalized by cells and guide them through tension forces by external magnetic fields to stimulate and direct axon growing. The aims of this review were to evaluate the findings of studies that used physical stimuli (nanoscaffold surfaces and MNPs) used for peripheral nerve regeneration support.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in identifying biomacromolecules such as proteins and peptides to functionalize metallic surfaces through noncovalent binding. One method for functionalizing materials without fundamentally changing their inherent structure is using biorecognition moieties. Here, we proved a general route to select a biomolecule adhesive motif for <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> comprehensively screening phage displayed peptides. In particular, we selected a genetically engineered M 13 bacteriophage and a linear dodecapeptide derived from its pIII domain for recognizing gold surfaces in a specific and selective manner. In the phage context, we demonstrated the adhesive motif was capable to adsorb on gold in a preferential way with a morphological and viscoelastic signature of the adsorbed layer as evidenced by QCM-D and AFM investigations. Out of the phage context, the linear dodecapeptide is reproducibly found {{to adhere to the}} gold surface, and by quantitative SPR measurements, high affinity constants (K(eq) ~ 10 (6) M(- 1), binding energy ~- 8 kcal/mol) were determined. We proved that the interactions occurring at gold interface were mainly hydrophobic as a consequence of high frequency of hydrophobic residues in the peptide sequence. Moreover, by CD, molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics, we demonstrated that the molecular flexibility only played a minor role in the peptide adsorption. Such noncovalent but specific modification of inorganic surfaces through high affinity biomolecule adsorption represents a general strategy to modulate the functionality of multipurpose metallic surfaces...|$|R

The fabrication process involves two steps: (1) <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> immersion of the substrate into the ethanol solution with linker reagent in an autoclave at 373 K for 3 h; (2) zeolite deposition assembly by immersion of the functionalized substrate into the nano-zeolite suspension in ethanol under the same condition as above step. A continuous, intergrown, uniform zeolite membrane was obtained on the assembled substrate by the secondary growth. The membrane pervaporation was carried out to evaluate the performance of NaA membrane for the separation of water-benzaldehyde mixture in the microreactor assembly at room temperature and 16. 7 kPa vacuum pressure. It is shown that the membrane has. an excellent selectivity for water. The separation factors for H 2 O/benzaldehyde as high as 31033 and 11018 were obtained for benzaldehyde feed mass fraction of 99. 5 % and 97. 0 %, respectively. Influence of three linkers including AP-TMS, 3 -chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CPTMS), and 3 -mereaptopropyltriethoxysilane(SP-TMS) for the zeolite crystals assembly on the substrates was investigated. It is found that using CP-TMS as linker, only a closely packed zeolite layer can be formed on the SS, while SP-TMS as linker, a zeolite layer can not be formed {{on any of these}} substrates.

The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a flexible and facile method for surface modification of TiO(2) nanotubes to tailor new interfacial properties important in many biomedical applications. TiO(2) nanotubes were prepared by electrochemical anodization of titanium foil using ethylene glycol: NH(4) F electrolyte (2 % water and 0. 3 % NH(4) F). Plasma surface modification using allylamine (AA) as a precursor has been applied to generate a thin and chemically reactive polymer (AAPP) film rich in amine groups on top of the TiO(2) nanotube surface. This initial polymer film was used for further <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> attachment of desired molecules. Two modification techniques were used to demonstrate the flexibility for building of new functionalities on titania nanotube surface: electrostatic adsorption of poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as an example of layer-by-layer assembly (LbL), and covalent coupling of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as an example of creating a protein-resistant surface. These approaches for tailoring the surface chemistry and wettability of TiO(2) nanotubes offer considerable prospects for advancing their interfacial properties to improve existing and develop new functional biomaterials for diverse biomedical applications.

Again the magnetization value of Fe 3 O 4 –FA/starch nanocomposite system was reduced due to the encapsulation effect. The sedimentation velocity of starch {{under the influence of}} nanohybrid was enhanced in the acidic medium.|$|R
40|$|Noble metal {{nanoparticles}} (NMNPs) {{are powerful}} tools in modern nanotechnology, {{thanks to their}} peculiarities: the intense surface plasmon resonance (SPR), the chemical stability and the simple surface chemistry. Many authors showed that laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS) is a viable and versatile technique for obtaining colloidal solutions of NMNPs. [1] NMNPs can be precisely characterized in situ by UV-visible spectroscopy {{with the aid of}} the Mie theory, providing informations about the size, aggregation level and dielectric environment of particles obtained by LASiS. [2 - 5] Moreover, the ability of obtaining NMNPs free in solution by LASiS allows the real time monitoring of <b>surface</b> <b>functionalization</b> <b>by</b> UV-visible spectroscopy. [6, 7] Plasmon properties of NMNPs obtained by LASiS were exploited for a series of photonic applications: i) sodium dodecylsulphate coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were used for linear and nonlinear optical modulation of the photonic band gap in artificial opals;[8, 9, 10] ii) unprotected gold nanoparticles blended with zinc phthalocyanines showed efficient optical limiting due to the strong multiphoton absorption properties of AuNPs and to the self healing of photofragmented nanoparticles that is promoted by phthalocyanines under laser irradiation;[11, 12] iii) AuNPs conjugated with a thermoresponsive polymer were used for temperature triggered uptake in cancerous cells and were studied for photothermolysis of cancerous cells by laser irradiation;[6] iv) ultrabright surface enhanced Raman scattering labels based on NMNPs conjugated with organic dyes and stabilized with polyethylene glycol were used for quantifying the number of nanoparticles uptaken by macrophage cells.
