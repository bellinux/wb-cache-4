40|$|This little {{treatise}} has {{at least}} one characteristic which gives it unique value among equity texts. That is its treatment of the <b>union</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and equity under modern procedure. Other writers have been prone to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} systems and have helped to keep those differences alive. Professor Walsh on the other hand, expressly follo*ing the arrangement of Professor Cook 2 ̆ 7 s Cases on Equity, sets forth early in his text the administration of principles of equity in a court of the present day. He is one of those who sees the possibilities for a simplified procedure in a real merger of the two systems. These he gives, together with an historical sketch of equity, in Part One of his book. It is a distinct and thoroughly worthwhile contribution to the subject. It is not only clearly presented but is interestingly written...|$|E
40|$|The Connecticut Practice Act, {{effected}} January 1, 18 S 0, {{has established}} what {{has generally been}} {{considered one of the}} most effective systems of civil procedure in existence. There were various reasons for this success. The Act was adopted after considerable experience in the various states with the Field code or reformed procedure inaugurated in New York in 1848 as well as with the reform in England accomplished by the Judicature Acts of 1871 and 1873. Profiting by the teachings of this experience it avoided some of the pitfalls met with elsewhere and developed a simple and effective <b>union</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and equity. Fairly extensive rule-making power was continued in the courts, the benefits of which, while not fully realized, have become increasingly apparent since the creation a few years ago of a Judicial Council. But perhaps as important was the state publication of an official Practice Boo!, available to lawyers and law students, containing not merely the practice provisions,but official forms of pleadings for the guidance of bench and bar. Unfortunately even a fine practice system, like all orderly processes involving an increasing number of technical requirements, tends to petrifaction, and some danger may be discerned lest the originally excellent Connecticut system becomes overtechnical just at a time when a ferment of reform activity is remolding the procedure of several states and of the federal trial courts. The publication of a new Practice Book compiled by a Committee of Superior Court Judges, containing over 300 forms of complaints and a total of 680 official forms, affords perhaps a fitting occasion to express some concern lest Connecticut lose its procedural preeminence...|$|E

This {{circular}} {{was originally}} labeled 2 ̆ 2 The <b>Union</b> <b>Law</b> School <b>of</b> Chicago, 2 ̆ 2 reflecting the original name <b>of</b> the Kent <b>Law</b> School, which it held {{for less than}} a year. The Kent <b>Law</b> School <b>of</b> Chicago was formed in 1892 by Marshall D.

40|$|The {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States to unite the. law and equity procedures in the federal district courts, pursuant to authority granted by a recent congressional act, is anevent of historic significance for its effect both on law administration in our national judicial system and as an example for other systems. When the new procedure is made effective by rules now being formulated, it will bring about more extensive changes in the federal practice than any that have occurred since the First Judiciary Act of 1789. Obviously not all the consequences can now be foreseen, but with care and study the difficulties of the transition can be minimized and a flexible practice developed which will reflect {{the best of the}} English and state codes and rules. The chief problems involved in a complete <b>union</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and equity concern the preservation of the jury trial right as required by the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution. It is believed, however, as discussed elsewhere, that a simple and effective system is possible by requiring the claim of the right to be made at an early stage of the proceedings in each case or otherwise to be considered waived. A similar problem, although perhaps not of quite the same permeating importance, is that of the manner of appeal and the extent of review to be accorded by the court of review. Traditionally, and for historical reasons, the equity review is a re-examination of the entire record, on both the facts and the law, while that at law is limited to a consideration of the legal errors which may have been committed by the trial court. If this difference on appeal is to be continued even after a formally united procedure is adopted, it means that the ancient and troublesome distinctions between law and equity, though supposedly abolished in the trial court, are yet to be preserved for purposes of appeal. It has seemed clear, therefore, that some change in those rules is necessary, and the conclusion to that effect by the Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure, appointed by the Court to assist it in the preparation of rules of practice, seems to have met with general approval...|$|E
40|$|In {{our first}} {{article on the}} {{historical}} background of the proposed new {{rules of civil procedure}} for the United States courts authorized by the Act of Congress of June 19, 1934, we traced the developments of federal practice at law under the Conformity Act and in equity under the uniform equity system and pointed out the real steps toward an amalgamation of the federal law and equity systems which had taken place after the adoption of the Uniform Equity Rules of 1912 and the Law and Equity Act of 1915. As a conclusion we urged the adoption of rules providing for the complete <b>union</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and equity, a conclusion which we had expected to support by further reasons in this article. The action of the United States Supreme Court in the meantime has, however, made elaboration of the point no longer necessary. On May 9, 1935, the Chief Justice in his annual address to the American Law Insti- tute announced that the Court had decided to act under the second section of the Act, and, in accordance with its authorization, to draft rules for a united system in the federal district courts. So definite was the decision, so forcefully and persuasively was it stated, so completely were the arguments to the contrary answered and demolished, that it is now believed the considerable discussion which had developed on this point will be set at rest. Our earlier article had characterized the opportunity of procedural reform afforded by the new Act as a challenge to the profession and a test of its ability to keep its methods of work abreast of the needs of an increasingly complex social organization. The response of distinguished practitioners and jurists to the call to serve on the committees already appointed in the various districts to consider and make suggestions as to the new rules shows not only the greatest interest but an intense desire on the part of lawyers to see that the plan is carried to a successful conclusion. Now that the Court has so promptly chosen the one workable way of making the plan effective, we can feel confident that this reform, so long supported by the American Bar Association and pressed to such dramatic legislative success a year ago by the Attorney General, will be real, complete, and lasting...|$|E
