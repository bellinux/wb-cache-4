The same day, he decertified all government employee unions by executive order, removing the requirement that state employees pay <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> by rescinding a mandate created by Governor Evan Bayh in a 1989 executive order. Dues-paying union membership subsequently dropped 90% among state employees.|$|E

She is saved by a homeless man with exceptional martial-arts skills named Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a former Marine Force Recon. Chance is initially hesitant to involve himself with her mission, but as his merchant seaman <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> are in arrears he reluctantly allows Natasha to hire him as her guide and bodyguard during her search. Meanwhile, Chance's homeless friend Elijah Roper (Willie C. Carpenter) is the next to participate in Fouchon's hunt, and is also killed.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Congress also banned union {{political}} contributions to federal campaigns. The Smith-Connally Act, enacted in 1943, banned {{the use of}} union members' dues to make direct contributions to candidates for federal office but did not ban indirect expenditures which educated union members or the public about a candidate's voting record. The Taft-Hartley Act made the ban permanent. In 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Taft-Hartley Act's ban on use of <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> for political purposes did not extend to internal communications directed at a union's own members. Eleven years later, the Court refused to consider a federal district court's ruling that Taft-Hartley Act did not ban expenditure of <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> on communications with the public.|$|E

25|$|Harry Beck was a {{maintenance}} worker with the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. (C) in Maryland and a CWA organizer. Beck protested {{the use of}} his <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> for a political cause in which he did not believe and asked for a refund. The CWA refused, arguing that using <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> for political expenditures was appropriate and legal. In the early 1970s, after disagreeing with national CWA officials over a union organizing drive in suburban Baltimore, Maryland, Beck resigned from the union and began to pay the $10-a-month agency fee. Beck continued to protest {{the use of his}} agency fee for political purposes, and asked the CWA to provide a more accurate accounting of how much money it spent on politics. The union refused. In June 1976, Beck and 19 other non-union members of the CWA's bargaining unit at C sued the union for a refund. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation provided legal counsel and support to Beck and the other 18 workers. Beck quit C in 1979 and moved to Oregon, where he worked at CWA-organized job at American Telephone & Telegraph and continued to pay his agency fee.|$|E

25|$|The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) {{struggled}} {{to implement the}} Court's holding in Beck. In 1989, the National Right to Work Committee polled NLRB offices nationwide, posing as workers and asking about the requirement to pay <b>union</b> <b>dues.</b> The group found that Board agents and other staff at 22 of 29 offices gave the wrong information. Although the NLRB initially dismissed the report, {{within a few weeks}} the agency admitted its errors and ordered all its regional offices to review recent developments in labor law and provide accurate information on agency fee rights.|$|E

25|$|One of PerÃ³n's salient {{legacies}} was {{the rise}} of the CGT labor federation, which remained among the nation's most powerful institutions even after his overthrow. The CGT diversified their growing resources through investment banking via the Banco Sindical, captive insurance, and real estate, such that by 1965 <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> accounted for only a third of the CGT's income. While these profits financed an array of generous benefits for the rank-and-file, a thriving balance sheet also increasingly engendered corruption among union leaders. Many solicited bribes from employers using the threat of strike action and one â€“ Commercial Union leader Armando March â€“ was convicted in 1969 of embezzling up to US$30 million from his union's accounts {{over the course of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|Prospects for {{addition}} {{initiatives and}} legislation {{at the federal}} and state level appear mixed as of 2009. Former Federal Election Commission Chair Bradley A. Smith (who opposes compulsory unionism) has argued that even the most stringent laws are unlikely to have any impact, as the number of agency fee payers is small compared to the number of union members. At least one legal scholar has questioned the constitutionality of paycheck protection laws, while another, detailed analysis of the Washington state effort has concluded that instead of decreasing the amount of <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> available for political expenditures paycheck protection actually increased it (from approximately $630,000 to approximately $780,000) as unions shifted member dues internally to account for the agency fees going toward collective bargaining.|$|E
25|$|Seventh, some {{scholars}} {{point out that}} the Beck ruling may lead to unanticipated outcomes. At least one commentary on Beck concludes that Beck rights, if successfully implemented, may lead large numbers of workers to resign from a union during a strike. These workers will be able to continue to work during a strike (incurring none of the disadvantages a strike brings), and yet will still be able to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining (assuming the strike is successful and an agreement is negotiated). The strike is the most powerful weapon unions have, and undermining the union's ability to strike would put labor unions at a distinct disadvantage in collective bargaining. The NLRB and Supreme Court have acknowledged the role that agency fee payers can play in undermining strikes. In NLRB v. Textile Workers Union, 409 U.S. 213 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that once a union member had resigned, the union could not punish that worker for crossing picket lines. And in Pattern Makers' League v. NLRB, (as noted above) the Court said unions must permit members to resign at any time. Decisions like these have informed the NLRB's rulings on the issue as well. The Board found that an employer did not commit an unfair labor practice when it distributed notices to employees prior to a strike that outlined an employee's rights during a strike (including the right to become an agency fee payer and cross picket lines). The Board also held that, once a single employee has inquired about their right to become an agency fee payer, it is legal for an employer to notify all workers about this right. But {{in the absence of an}} employee-initiated iniquiry, it is not, the Board says, legal for employers to approach striking workers and ask them to become agency fee payers. The negative implications of widespread worker resignation from unions prior to or during a strike is clear, some argue. This may be changing, however, as more unions turn away from strikes and toward comprehensive campaigns. It is also unclear how Beck may impact dues checkoff (an agreement between the employer, union, and employee under which the employer agrees to deduct <b>union</b> <b>dues</b> directly from the employee's paycheck and turn it over to the union). In 1991, the NLRB held that dues checkoff agreements create an obligation to pay dues in the same way that becoming a union member does. It is possible that Beck and subsequent rulings could also undermine dues checkoff agreements.|$|E
