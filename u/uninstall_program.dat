25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an <b>uninstall</b> <b>program</b> from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E

50|$|The Registry {{contains}} important configuration {{information for}} the operating system, for installed applications {{as well as individual}} settings for each user and application. A careless change to the operating system configuration in the Registry could cause irreversible damage, so it is usually only installer programs which perform changes to the Registry database during installation/configuration and removal. If a user wants to edit the Registry manually, Microsoft recommends that a backup of the Registry is performed before the change. When a program is removed from control panel, it is not completely removed and the user must manually check inside directories such as program files. After this, the user needs to manually remove any reference to the <b>uninstalled</b> <b>program</b> in the registry. This is usually done by using regedit.exe. Editing the Registry is sometimes necessary when working around Windows-specific issues e.g. problems when logging onto a domain can be resolved by editing the Registry.|$|R

40|$|How can {{you take}} a {{computer}} program that runs on one computer and make it run correctly on another computer? This {{is the problem of}} software deployment and the topic of this thesis. It is a problem that we run into frequently in daily computer use. Installing, updating and <b>uninstalling</b> <b>programs</b> are all examples of deployment tasks. Deployment is an issue for both users and developers of computer software. After installing a program on a computer a user expects the program to work as intended and that the other programs installed on the computer works the same as before. The problem for the software developer is to ensure that the program he or she has written will run correctly in the complex environment that a computer system can be. Software deployment has been a topic of research since the late 1990 s. The deployment tools in use today are mostly a product of the computer industry or communities formed around open source operating systems. These tools have been built because of the need to reduce complexity of software deployment. Most available deployment tools do however nothing more than automating the deployment process. This thesis describes two deployment systems that address some of the problems in software deployment. As software deployment is a large topic to cover completely this thesis is focused on the following topics: Software as components. A piece of software is not a stand-alone entity, but a part of a system. It can use or be used by other pieces of software as a software component. Many of the challenges in deployments is the result of software components being dependent on other software components. Component storage. When packages are distributed, they are usually represented as a single entity, but during the installation the package is pulverized, i. e. its content will often be placed in different location in the filesystem and the package will no longer consist of a single unit. We want to explore different ways of storing components to preserve the component structure and investigate how this affect the management of software components...|$|R
5000|$|The {{version of}} this {{software}} used in Sony CDs is the one marketed as [...] "XCP-Aurora". The first time a user attempts to play such a CD on a Windows system, the user is presented with an EULA, if they refuse to accept it the CD is ejected, if they accept it the software is installed. The EULA did not mention that it installed hidden software. The software will then remain resident in the user's system, intercepting all accesses of the CD drive to prevent any media player or ripper software {{other than the one}} included with XCP-Aurora from accessing the music tracks of the Sony CD. No obvious way to <b>uninstall</b> the <b>program</b> is provided. Attempting to remove the software by deleting the associated files manually will render the CD drive inoperable due to registry settings that the program has altered. However, it was soon discovered that the software could be easily defeated by merely using a permanent marker to draw a dark border {{along the edge of the}} disk.|$|R
40|$|Virtualization is a {{technology}} that combines or divides computing resources to present one or many operating environments using methodologies like hardware and software partitioning or aggregation, partial or complete machine simulation, emulation, time-sharing, and others. Virtualization technologies find important applications {{over a wide range}} of areas such as server consolidation, secure computing platforms, supporting multiple operating systems, kernel debugging and development, system migration, etc, resulting in widespread usage. Most of them present similar operating environments to the end user; however, they tend to vary widely in their levels of abstraction they operate at and the underlying architecture. This paper surveys a wide range of virtualization technologies, analyzes their architecture and implementation, and proposes a taxonomy to categorize them {{on the basis of their}} abstraction levels. The paper identifies the following abstraction levels: instruction set level, hardware abstraction layer (HAL) level, operating system level, library level and application level virtual machines. It studies examples from each of the categories and provides relative comparisons. It also gives a broader perpective of the virtualization technologies and gives an insight that can be extended to accommodate future virtualization technologies under this taxonomy. The paper proposes the concept of an extremely lightweight technology, which we call as Featherweight Virtual Machine (FVM), that can be used to ”try out ” untrusted programs in a realistic environment without causing any permanent damage to the system. Finally, it demonstrates FVM’s effectiveness by applying it to two applications: secure mobile code execution and automatic clean <b>uninstall</b> of Windows <b>programs.</b> ...|$|R
