5|$|Throughout the investigation, {{according}} to Thompson, Admiral Leon A. Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, {{interfered with the}} investigation by sending suggestions to Milligan on avenues of inquiry and pushing for a finding that Hartwig or Truitt was responsible. Edney interfered with the investigation {{in order to prevent}} any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an <b>unsafe</b> ship in an <b>unsafe</b> manner. Also, Edney feared that if the Iowa class battleships were found to be <b>unsafe,</b> the battleships would be decommissioned and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.|$|E
5|$|An {{inspection}} on December 11, 2015 {{revealed that}} the bridge's suspension wires were twisted and out of line, making the bridge <b>unsafe</b> to carry vehicles and the 114-year-old bridge will be closed indefinitely, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|Commander Paul B. Cronk, {{head of a}} Coast Guard explosives-loading detail {{tasked with}} {{supervision}} of the working dock, warned the Navy that conditions were <b>unsafe</b> and ripe for disaster. The Navy refused to change its procedures and Cronk withdrew the detail.|$|E
5|$|Lone Scouting is {{a program}} {{designed}} to allow those who would otherwise not be able to become Boy Scouts or Cub Scouts—usually due to residence in an overseas, isolated, or <b>unsafe</b> community—to participate in the Scouting experience.|$|E
5|$|This {{differences}} {{might be}} linked to a difference of approach in driving safety culture, for instance in the balance between liberty and mandatory or forbidden dangerous or <b>unsafe</b> behavior.|$|E
5|$|Unlike , {{a fellow}} American-Hawaiian ship that was plagued with labor difficulties, Kentuckian {{seems to have}} escaped much of the {{maritime}} labor turmoil of the mid-1930s. One incident was reported by the Los Angeles Times in August 1936. The news item reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew went on strike in protest against <b>unsafe</b> working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, <b>unsafe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Air {{travel is}} {{discouraged}} {{for up to}} seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur. Underwater diving is considered <b>unsafe</b> after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed. Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} view {{holds that}} <b>unsafe</b> medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector {{that allowed the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These benefits are achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in <b>unsafe</b> abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.|$|E
5|$|Detractors further {{blamed the}} school for the accident, saying that, {{in the name of}} tradition, administrators {{turned a blind eye to}} an <b>unsafe</b> {{structure}} being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of the Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or <b>unsafe</b> horseplay at the Bonfire site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with <b>unsafe</b> sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months, dog shows, {{vaudeville}} performances, the horticultural show and various trade exhibitions continued at the Rink. By the 1920s, {{the building had}} deteriorated and the gallery became <b>unsafe</b> to use. Shaw sold the site in 1925 for $250,000 to the Stanley Realty Corporation to build a parking garage. The Victoria closed and a parking garage was built in its place.|$|E
5|$|Global warming {{represents}} a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more <b>unsafe</b> than birds {{because they have}} less ability to move large distances. Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodillians having their populations become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 {{the family}} of Kun Liu (the {{stuntman}} killed during filming) filed a wrongful death suit against the producers of the film, Nu Image and Millennium Films, and stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski. The suit alleged that conditions for the stunt were <b>unsafe.</b> The Expendables 2 credits contain a dedication to Liu's memory.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{fears about}} the spread of STDs have {{prompted}} the closing of bathhouseswith their private roomsin favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity {{takes place in the}} open, and can be observed by monitors {{whose job it is to}} enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in <b>unsafe</b> sex.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{chapters}} he describes the atrocious conditions he witnessed in China. Shanghai is depicted as a squalid, noisy, and polluted den of crime, poverty, and disease, and yet still comparatively wealthy compared {{to the rest of}} the country. The interior of the country is difficult to access due to lack of infrastructure, is mostly <b>unsafe</b> for travel, and is wracked constantly by famine and starvation.|$|E
5|$|Klein Elementary School: Located next to {{original}} Klein High School on Spring Cypress Road, Klein Elementary School {{opened in}} 1940 and was renamed Klein Middle School in 1971. The building was removed in 2007 {{as it had}} been deemed <b>unsafe</b> for habitation and {{to make way for the}} construction of the Network Operation Center.|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle (born 1973) is a Canadian {{professor}} at Humber College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada who was forcibly prostituted from {{the ages of}} 15 to 27 and now opposes prostitution in Canada. Falle {{grew up in a}} middle-class home and, when her parents divorced, her new single-parent home became <b>unsafe,</b> and Falle ran away from home. At the age of 15, Falle became involved in the sex industry in Calgary, Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the chapel}} were {{demolished}} {{at the start of}} 2006 on safety grounds, with scaffolding holding up some other sections. As of March 2008 the building has very little roof, with the walls, floors and ceilings in poor condition. The annex was also declared <b>unsafe,</b> but has since been reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} <b>unsafe</b> {{time for}} bulk carriers. Many bulkers sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, making it {{impossible}} for the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due partly to the sinking of , a series of international safety resolutions regarding bulkers were adopted during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{to remove the}} train from the site began {{on the evening of}} 1 March 2007 with the first carriages moved from the embankment. This allowed passengers' property to be retrieved and gave investigators access to the train interior, which previously had not been possible because it would have been <b>unsafe.</b> The last of the carriages were removed on 4 March 2007 and the A685 road was reopened.|$|E
5|$|The pulley {{system was}} {{eventually}} deemed <b>unsafe</b> due to instances of sagging and delayed reaction. As a result, it was replaced on 36engines by a safer {{compressed air system}} between 1930 and 1937. This system had seen previous successful use on the LBSCR. Because the air compressor required extra space for installation, these conversions were confined to the long-framed members of the class.|$|E
5|$|The show on June 14, 2002 at the United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas was {{cancelled}} due to {{a transformer}} blowing out during the 2nd song which put the whole show on auxiliary power making it <b>unsafe</b> for Spears and the entire production team to continue. The show initially {{was going to be}} rescheduled according to the band member and DJ, Skip, but it later fell through.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis, stenting {{and surgery}} {{are not used}} as widely as anticoagulation or {{antiplatelet}} drugs. These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be <b>unsafe</b> (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency).|$|E
5|$|<b>Unsafe</b> medical {{injections}} play {{a significant}} role in HIV spread in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, between 12 and 17% of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use. The World Health Organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in Africa at 1.2%. Significant risks are also associated with invasive procedures, assisted delivery, and dental care in this area of the world.|$|E
5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for <b>unsafe</b> conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E
5|$|After the tornado, {{there was}} an {{investigation}} into whether the students should have been dismissed before the tornado stuck the school. However, the National Weather Service survey from the office in Tallahassee suggested that the death toll could have been much higher due to the extreme damage {{in the parking lot}} and the area nearby. In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in the area with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise late that morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41am CST) made evacuating the area <b>unsafe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about {{the conditions of the}} work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having <b>unsafe</b> working conditions, and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of these women.|$|E
5|$|Around 42 {{per cent}} of {{pregnant}} women, more than 1.5 million, deliver babies at home. About two-thirds (61 per cent) of childbirths {{at home in}} Uttar Pradesh are <b>unsafe.</b> State has the highest child mortality indicators, from the neonatal mortality rate (NNMR) to the under-five mortality rate of 64 children who die per 1,000 live births before five years of age, 35 die within a month of birth, and 50 do not complete a year of life. A third of the rural population in the state has been deprived of primary healthcare infrastructure, according to the norms of the Indian Public Health Standards.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining <b>unsafe</b> abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|By September 1, the facility, {{like the}} Superdome, was {{completely}} overwhelmed and declared <b>unsafe</b> and unsanitary. However, {{even though there}} were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to have no knowledge of the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.|$|E
5|$|Cuban {{government}} officials issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} southern coastline on August 11, {{two days before the}} hurricane struck the island. This was upgraded to a hurricane warning on the 12th, 13 ½ hours before Charley made landfall. Because of the threat, the government issued a mandatory evacuation for 235,000citizens and 159,000animals {{in the area of the}} expected impact. An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, <b>unsafe</b> buildings to safer areas. The people were transported to shelters provisioned with supplies. In addition, the power grid in southern Cuba was turned off to avoid accidents.|$|E
5|$|Design of the FR-1 {{began in}} 1943 to a {{proposal}} instigated by Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. for a mixed-powered fighter because early jet engines had sluggish acceleration {{that was considered}} <b>unsafe</b> and unsuitable for carrier operations. Ryan received a contract for three XFR-1 prototypes and one static test airframe on 11 February 1943 with the first two prototypes delivered in 14 months. Another contract was placed for 100 aircraft on 2 December 1943 and a later contract on 31 January 1945 increased the total of FR-1s on order to 700.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels <b>unsafe</b> for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lanley {{succeeds in}} winning over {{almost the entire}} town, his salesmanship fails to {{convince}} Marge, who is frustrated with the town's purchase because she (correctly) believes the monorail is <b>unsafe</b> and that Lanley is a conman. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort to make even more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E
5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} soft drugs and {{then moved on to}} using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with a sense of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house <b>unsafe,</b> so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E
