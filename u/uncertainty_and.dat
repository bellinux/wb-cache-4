Under some conditions, an interval observer with discrete-time Luenberger structure is developed to cope with <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> faults ensuring guaranteed bounds on the estimated states and their stability. The interval observer design is based on assumption that the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> the faults magnitudes are considered as unknown but bounded.

5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic <b>uncertainty</b> <b>and</b> poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E

She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

5|$|The {{practical}} {{source of}} an emperor's {{power and authority}} was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor (sacramentum). The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>and</b> crisis. Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the donativum, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>and</b> futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E

5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential <b>uncertainty,</b> <b>and</b> giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and <b>uncertainty,</b> <b>and</b> applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the US.

40|$|Key Words-Adaptive control; sliding-mode control; {{deterministic}} robust control; nonlinear systems. Abstract-This paper {{considers the}} adaptive robust {{control of a}} class SISO nonlinear systems in a semi-strict feedback form. The systems may possess both parametric <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> unknown nonlinear functions that may represent modeling errors and external disturbances. With prior knowledge of the bounds of the parametric <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> the bounding functions of the unknown nonlinear functions, a systematic way to combine the backstepping adaptive control with deterministic robust control is developed. The method preserves {{the advantages of the}} two methods, namely asymptotic stability of adaptive control in the presence of parametric <b>uncertainties,</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed transient performance with prescribed precision of deter-ministic robust control for both parametric <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> unknown nonlinear functions. The resulting controller is more flexible and versatile than either adaptive control or robust control alone. Simulation results verify the advantages of the suggested method. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{chattering}} free neuro-sliding mode controller for the trajectory tracking control of two {{degrees of freedom}} (DOF) parallel manipulators which have a complicated dynamic model, including modelling <b>uncertainties,</b> frictional <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> external disturbances. A feedforward neural network (NN) is combined with an error estimator to completely compensate the large nonlinear <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> external disturbances of the parallel manipulators. The online weight tuning algorithms of the NN and the structure of the error estimator are derived with the strict theoretical stability proof of the Lyapunov theorem. The upper bound of <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> the upper bound of the approximation errors are not required to be known in advance in order to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. The example simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for the tracking control of a 2 -DOF parallel manipulator. It results in its being chattering-free, very small tracking errors and its robustness against <b>uncertainties</b> <b>and</b> external disturbances...|$|R

This decision had been made before the slapping incidents were made public, but Patton blamed them for his being denied the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any <b>uncertainty,</b> <b>and</b> that the slapping incidents had been an example of Patton's inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive or prone to making mistakes. On January 26, 1944 Patton was formally given command of the Third United States Army in England, a newly arrived unit, and assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy in early 1944 preparing for the pending invasion.|$|E
