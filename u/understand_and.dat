In Orgoreyn, Ai is seemingly accepted more easily by the political leaders, yet Ai is arrested, stripped of his clothes, drugged, and sent to a work camp. Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically shifgrethor, gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had kept him from understanding their relationship previously. During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> love Estraven.|$|E

Stauskas previously attended Lithuanian Saturday School in Toronto and is able to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> speak some Lithuanian. Geographically, Michigan is closer to Stauskas's parents home in Ontario than any other major Division I school, according to Stauskas.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed lemurs <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E

5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting {{that it was}} difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> had fairly poor graphics, awarding it low scores. In contrast, popular opinion was more positive: in a poll taken by Family Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were flat for the first two months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread. According to Kaga, a notable journalistic writer devoted a Famitsu column to the game, and this prompted sales to pick up around half a year after release. As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to <b>understand,</b> <b>and</b> makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E

5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> appreciate his position.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages, {{the patient is}} {{completely}} dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately {{not be able to}} perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates {{to the point where they}} are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.|$|E

5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E
5|$|In his discourses {{recorded}} in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans {{would not be able}} to withstand meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people can approach, <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> love him in the form of an Avatar. While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> use tools.|$|E

5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E
5|$|Research and {{academic}} institutions, professional associations, and think-tanks aim to observe, model, <b>understand,</b> <b>and</b> publish recommendations {{to improve the}} transparency and effectiveness of the global financial system. For example, the independent non-partisan World Economic Forum facilitates the Global Agenda Council on the Global Financial System and Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System, which report on systemic risks and assemble policy recommendations. The Global Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of global financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world. The Group of Thirty (G30) formed in 1978 as a private, international group of consultants, researchers, and representatives committed to advancing understanding of international economics and global finance.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team decided {{early on}} in the {{development}} process {{to reduce the number of}} characters present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters. While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story. Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would <b>understand</b> <b>and</b> empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E
