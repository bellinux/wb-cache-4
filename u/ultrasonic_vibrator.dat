40|$|Abstract – Power {{quality has}} always been a concern of power engineers. Certainly an {{argument}} can be successfully made that most parts of power engineering have the ultimate objective to improve power quality. AC motors were widely used in industrial and domestic applications. Generally, AC motors were of two types: Induction and Synchronous motors. In motor many parameters like different load cycling, switching, working in hot weather and unbalances creates harmonics which creates major reasons for temperature rise of the motors. Due to high peak value of voltage, harmonics can weaken insulation in cables, windings and capacitors and different electronic components. Higher value of harmonics increase the motor current and decrease the power factor which will reduce the life time of the motor and increase the overall rating of all electrical equipments. Harmonics reduction of all the motors in India will save more power. Coating of windings of the motor with nano fillers will reduce the amount of harmonics in the motor. Based on the previous project works, actions were taken to use the enamel filled with various nano fillers for the coating of the windings of the different AC motors.

Oxidation films form {{on the surface of the}} cast iron in pure water and cannot form on the surface of cast iron in mixed solution. The XRD results show that the oxidation film mainly consists of Fe 2 O 3 phase at 50 °C, Fe 3 O 4 phase at 80 °C. The mass loss at 50 °C is less than that at 80 °C. Oxidation film of Fe 2 O 3 phase has some advantages to decelerate the cavitation erosion. Mass loss of the sample of cast iron in mixed solution is less than that in pure water at 80 °C.

Experiments {{to determine the extent of}} grinding or reduction of particle size of HMX agitated in an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>vibrator</b> for increasing times have been done. The data have indicated a time of three [...] five minutes is adequate to disperse agglomerates without undue breaking or grinding of solid crystals. It is possible to do some grinding under severe conditions in the ultrasonic bath...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{plays an}} important role on the thermal withstand capability of the insulating materials. It has been observed that the use of nano composites in the matrix of polymeric materials can greatly improve the thermal, mechanical and electrical properties of polymeric nano composites. A nano composite (TiO 2 +SiO 2) has been tested as nano filler. The micro particles of TiO 2 and SiO 2 are converted into nano particles with the help of ball mill. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used to augment the particle size of nano composite. These nano composites were mixed with standard (Elmo Luft 1 A-FD) enamel with help of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>vibrator.</b> The thermal conductivity of enamel, micro composite (3 : 1, 1 : 3, 1 : 1 of SiO 2 and TiO 2) filled enamel and nano composite (3 : 1, 1 : 3, 1 : 1 of SiO 2 and TiO 2) filled enamel were detailed and analysed. Thermal conductivity was measured by using Lee’s Disc method. The mixing of nano composites of SiO 2 and TiO 2 with enamel in various proportions has no improvement when compared to the thermal conductivity of the enamel and the enamel filled with micro composites of SiO 2 and TiO 2 but reduced thermal conductivity when compared to that of SiO 2 and TiO 2. The enamel and micro composite of SiO 2 and TiO 2 taken in the proportion of 3 : 1 filled enamel has same value of thermal conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Laser surface {{modification}} of brass (Cu- 38 Zn- 1. 5 Pb [C 36500]) using AlSiFe and NiCrSiB alloy {{was achieved by}} using a 2 kW continuous wave Nd-YAG laser {{with the aim of}} improving the cavitation erosion resistance and corrosion resistance. The alloying powder was preplaced on the brass substrate by thermal spraying to a thickness of 350 mu m, followed by laser beam scanning to effect melting, mixing and alloying. A modified surface was achieved by overlapping of adjacent tracks. The cavitation erosion resistance and the anodic polarization characteristics of the laser surface modified specimens in 3. 5 % NaCl solution at 23 deg C were studied by means of a 20 kHz <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>vibrator</b> at a peak to peak amplitude of 60 mu m and a potentiostat respectively. The cavitation erosion resistance of the specimens modified with AlSiFe and NiCrSiB was improved by a factor of 3 and 7 respectively, compared with that of the brass substrate. Potentiodynamic test, however, indicated that the corrosion resistance of specimens modified with AlSiFe deteriorated, as reflected by a shift of the polarization curve towards higher current densities. On the other hand, the corrosion resistance of specimens modified with NiCrSiB was significantly improved, as evidenced by the presence of a passive region (from - 175 mV to - 112 mV) and a reduction in the anodic current density by at least an order of magnitude compared with the substrate at the same anodic potential. The hardness profile and the compositional profile were measured using a Vickers hardness tester and EDX respectively. The microstructure and the surface morphology of the specimens were investigated with the aid of SEM and optical microscopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{modification}} of eutectic silicon is {{of general interest}} since fine eutectic silicon along with fine primary aluminum grains improves mechanical properties and ductilities. In this study, high intensity ultrasonic vibration was used to modify the complex microstructure of aluminum hypoeutectic alloys. The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>vibrator</b> was placed {{at the bottom of}} a copper mold with molten aluminum. Hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy specimens with a unique in-depth profile of microstructure distribution were obtained. Polyhedral silicon particles, which should form in a hypereutectic alloy, were obtained in a hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy near the ultrasonic radiator where the silicon concentration was higher than the eutectic composition. The formation of hypereutectic silicon near the radiator surface indicates that high-intensity ultrasonic vibration can be used to influence the phase transformation process of metals and alloys. The size and morphology of both the silicon phase and the aluminum phase varies with increasing distance from the ultrasonic probe/radiator. Silicon morphology develops into three zones. Polyhedral primary silicon particles present in zone I, within 15 mm from the ultrasonic probe/radiator. Transition from hypereutectic silicon to eutectic silicon occurs in zone II about 15 to 20 祄 from the ultrasonic probe/radiator. The bulk of the ingot is in zone III and is hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy containing fine lamellar and fibrous eutectic silicon. The grain size is about 15 to 25 祄 in zone I, 25 to 35 祄 in zone II, and 25 to 55 祄 in zone III. The morphology of the primary ?Al phase is also changed from dendritic (in untreated samples) to globular. Phase evolution during the solidification process of the alloy subjected to ultrasonic vibration is described...|$|E
40|$|Nanofluids {{is a kind}} of new {{engineering}} material which consisting of solid nanoparticles with size typically of 1 - 100 nm by dispersing it into based fluids. This research presents the preparation of Aluminium Oxide(Al 2 O) nanofluids by using two-step methods. This nanofluids was prepared by dispersing Al 32 O nanoparticles(< 50 nm) in distilled water based fluids with the addition of calculated amount of Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulphonate(SDBS) as a surfactant and absence of SDBS surfactant. The nanofluids were sonicated with <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>vibrator</b> at power of 700 Watt and frequency of 40 k Hz for 15 minutes. It was tested that with the presence of surfactant in the nanofluids,the nanofluids was stable for 2 weeks. Absence of surfactant cause the small amount of particle aggregates had settled out of suspension after 1 day. Stabilization of the Al 2 O 33 nanofluids with and without surfactant can be obtained with Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM). Distilled water based fluids display Newtonian behavior but it transform to non-Newtonian fluid with the addition of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles. Viscosity of the Al 2 O nanofluids was measured both as a function of Al 2 O 3 3 nanoparticles volume fraction and temperature between 30 oC and 60 oC using Brookfield DV- II Pro Viscometer and results showed that no anomolous effects of viscosity with increasing of temperatures. The range of the viscosity from 30 oC and 60 oC is between 4. 05 cP to 2. 55 cP and viscosity of nanofluids increase with the Al 2 O nanoparticles volume concentration. The result then was compared with the previous researcher’s experimental data. Thermal conductivity of the Al 2 O 3 3 nanofluids water based was predicted using regression equation then compared it with previous experimental data...|$|E
