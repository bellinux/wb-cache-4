5|$|Born in Illinois, Dean {{attended}} the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> before graduating with a commission in the US Army through the Reserve Officer's Training Corps (ROTC) in 1921. Slowly rising up the {{ranks in the}} inter-war years, Dean worked a desk job in Washington D.C. for much of World War II before being transferred to the 44th Infantry Division which he later commanded during {{the final days of}} the war, and was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{antibodies}} {{have been developed}} that induce lethal iron deprivation (LID) by targeting the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR 1 /CD 71) and either neutralizing transferrin (Tf) binding, blocking internalization of the receptor and/or inducing its degradation. We have developed recombinant antibodies targeting human TfR 1 (ch 128. 1 and ch 128. 1 Av), which induce receptor degradation and are cytotoxic to certain malignant B-cells. We now show that internalization of TfR 1 bound to these antibodies can lead to its sequestration and degradation, as well as reduced Tf uptake, and the induction of a transcriptional response consistent with iron deprivation, which is mediated in part by downstream targets of p 53. Cells resistant to these antibodies do not sequester and degrade TfR 1 after internalization of the antibody/receptor complex, and accordingly maintain their ability to internalize Tf. These findings are expected to facilitate the rational design and clinical use of therapeutic agents targeting iron import via TfR 1 in hematopoietic malignancies.

5|$|The Spinks {{variety of}} avocado, Persea {{americana}} 'Spinks', {{was developed by}} William A. Spinks at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> and California Avocado Association comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be more resistant to freezing than other avocados. They also {{proved to be the}} second-longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at {{the site}} in the 1970s were {{sponsored}} by the University of California, Berkeley. They began in 1976 and were undertaken by John A. Graham, Robert F. Heizer and Edwin M. Shook. This first season uncovered 40 new monuments, including Stela5, {{to add to the}} dozen or so already known. Excavations by the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> continued until 1981 and uncovered even more monuments in that time. From 1987 excavations have been continued by the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH) under the direction of Miguel Orrego and Christa Schieber, and new monuments continue to be uncovered. The site has been declared a national park.|$|E
5|$|The Ghadar Party, {{initially}} the 'Pacific Coast Hindustan Association', {{was formed in}} 1913 in the United States {{under the leadership of}} Har Dayal, with Sohan Singh Bhakna as its president. It drew members from Indian immigrants, largely from Punjab. Many of its members were also from the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> including Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Kartar Singh Sarabha and V.G. Pingle. The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates, especially in the United States, Canada and Asia. Ghadar meetings were held in Los Angeles, Oxford, Vienna, Washington, D.C., and Shanghai.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Dean applied to the US Military Academy, but was rejected. He then tried to enlist in the United States Army during World War I, {{but he was too}} young to do so without his parents' permission, and his mother refused. Dean instead {{attended}} <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> studying pre-law. During this time, he also took a variety of side jobs, including a stevedore at the San Francisco docks, a motorman, and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department, where he worked under police chief August Vollmer. Dean originally sought to attain a Doctor of Law degree but only completed a Bachelor of Arts degree from Berkeley in 1922 before joining the Army.|$|E
5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley</b> successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Caldwell {{served on}} the faculties of the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Oklahoma, Syracuse University, and the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> and had shorter {{appointments}} at some 80 other collegiate institutions both within the U.S. and overseas. At various times, Caldwell served as advisor or consultant to the U.S. Senate, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, and Interior, and the National Institutes of Health. Although not a natural scientist, {{as part of his}} work towards establishing interdisciplinary study in universities and achieving a greater merging of the two worlds of science and public policy, he became deeply involved in national and international environmental affairs and worked closely with several important scientific bodies serving, among many appointments, on the Sea Grant Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first Environmental Advisory Board of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Pacific Science Congress, the President’s National Commission on Materials Policy, the Science Advisory Board for the Great Lakes of the International Joint Commission, as chair of the first Commission on Environmental Policy, Law and Administration for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and as advisor to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the UNESCO working program for the environmental education and training of engineers.|$|E
