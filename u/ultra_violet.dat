40|$|Identification and {{tracking}} of solar coronal loops {{is key to}} understanding solar magnetic field. Slow and fast Magnetohydrodynamic oscillation of tracked loops from sequence 171 Å extreme <b>ultra</b> – <b>violet</b> images was detected. The method was demonstrated using 171 Å images taken by SDO/AIA on 14 August 2010 and 20 January 2012. Two dimensional continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to clarify images of loops and to eliminate additional noises. Applying OCCULT method, the loops were labeled and their widths were determined. The Zernike moments of loops as an invariant property (transformation, scale and rotation) of loops were calculated. Then, the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) was used for identification of the same loops from sequence images. Slow longitudinal Magnetohydrodynamic oscillations were extracted by averaging pixels intensities perpendicular to tube axis.

40|$|The {{advent of}} “flexible” {{electronics}} on plastic substrates with low melting points requires {{the development of}} thin film deposition techniques that operate at low temperatures. This is easily achieved with vacuum or solution - processed molecular or polymeric semiconductors, but oxide materials remain a significant challenge. Here we show that zinc oxide (ZnO) can be prep ared using only room - temperature processes, using the molecular thin film precursor zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), follow ed by vacuum <b>ultra</b> - <b>violet</b> light treatment to elicit degradation of the organic components and transformation of the deposited film to oxide mate rial. The degradation mechanism was assessed by studying {{the influence of the}} atmosphere during the reaction: i t was particularly sensitive to oxygen pressure in the chamber and optimal degradation conditions were established as 3 mbar with 40 % oxygen in nitrogen. The morphology of the film was relatively unchanged during the reaction, but detailed analysis of its composition using both scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) revealed that a 40 nm thick layer containing ZnO results from the 100 nm thick precursor after complete reaction. Our methodology represent s a simple route for the fabrication of oxides and multilayer structures that can be easily integrated into current molecular thin film growth setups, without the n eed for a high temperature step...|$|R

40|$|Sulfur {{trioxide}} in {{the exhaust}} gas {{of an internal}} combustion engine is removed and concentrated by absorption in a solution of 80 % isopropyl alcohol, which quantitatively absorbs it and inhibits the oxidation of any sulfur dioxide which may be absorbed. The absorbed sulfur trioxide (sulfuric acid) is determined by an absorption titration by-using barium chloride as the titrant and thorin as the indicator. The sulfur dioxide content of the exhaust is measured continuously {{by means of a}} DuPont Model 411 <b>ultra</b> [...] <b>violet</b> photoanalyzer. As the automobile manufacturers are using oxidation catalysts on a portion of their 1975 car production, it became necessary to consider the effect of these catalysts on emissions other than just carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. One such emission is sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is produced in the combustion cycle of the engine by the oxidation of the sulfur which is present in the gasoline. Since one of the important uses of noble metal oxidation catalysts in the chemical industry is the production of sulfuric acid by oxidizing sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide, a serious emission product from catalyst-equipped vehicles may be sulfuric acid. A large number of methods for analyzing sulfur trioxide emissions in stack gases is available in the literature. However, most of these methods suffer interferences from materials which are commonly found in internal combustion engine exhausts, such as ammonia and nitrogen oxides. One method...|$|R
40|$|Titanium dioxide (Ti 02) f;im {{is one of}} the {{promising}} candidate materials that often used in various applications such as photo - sensor, <b>ultra</b> - <b>violet</b> (UV) protection and solar cell applications. In this study, Ti 02 thin film was prepared by a RF reactive magnetron sputtering system using Titanium (Ti) target as the starting material. Results using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) and Langmuir Probe equipment show that density plasma distribution of Ti, Ar, ~ ran+d 0 atom changes with respect to discharge power, working pressure (WP) and environment gas ratio. Observation on the atomic lines of Ti I and Ar I in pure Argon environment was found increased as the discharge power and working pressure increased. Emission line intensity of Arf ions with wavelength of 443. 02 nm shows significant increase as the discharge power increases. Increase in ~ rio+n population has contributed in increase of atomic Ti released inside the system. Influence of 0 2 gas flow in reactive magnetron sputtering is very critical during the formation of Ti 02. Significant change in emission response of Ti and 0 lines suggests Ti 02 film starts to form over critical ratio of 7 % ratio of 021 (Ar + 02). Further investigation using X - ray diffraction (XRD) shows that TiOz film has been formed with anatase crystallite behavior. In addition, Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) result shows that the Ti 02 particles size increases as the working pressure increase inside the deposition chamber. Smooth film with roughness less than 1. 6 nm was also observed. High transmittance (> 70 %) in the visible region can be generally observed using Ultraviolet - Visible spectroscopy (UV -Vis). Direct optical band gap for Ti 02 thin deposited at working pressure of 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 30 m and 40 mTorr was found 3. 99, 3. 38, 3. 39, 3. 43, 3. 24 and 2. 96 eV respectively. Therefore, by controlling those plasma properties in magnetron sputtering system, a good high quality Ti 02 film layer can be formed. This is important in order to optimize Ti 02 thin film for solar cell application...|$|R
