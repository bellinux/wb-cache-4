5|$|A road up Stjørdalen {{was built}} during the 1850s, {{connecting}} at Stjørdalshalsen to a steam ship service to Trondheim. A concern in Sweden was that Bottenviken could freeze <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the Trondheimsfjord offered an ice-free alternative for export of timber.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek's death.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2007, President Bush {{signed the}} U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 into {{law for the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that {{included}} an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former U.S. military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, {{pointing out that the}} U.S. airbase in Da Nang, alone, will cost $14 million to clean <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup. The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010. An additional $12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the Supplemental Appropriations Act and a total of $18.5 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011.|$|E

5|$|Mark {{shows an}} {{interest}} in Paige, but discovers she is dating Tyler. He later learns {{that this is a}} ruse to cover up their involvement with Dimato, who has bought the garage. They eventually regain Mark's trust after helping to bring Dimato to justice, and Mark and Paige reunite. Mark and Tyler's brother Aaron (Matt Wilson) comes to stay with them, and they are later joined by their father Russell (Russell Kiefel), who has a strained relationship with his sons. The Brennans consider buying the garage together, but Tyler later reveals that Russell abused him when he was younger. Mark and Aaron support Tyler and force Russell to leave. Mark and Paige discuss their future together when he admits that he is ready to have children, while she is not. Mark asks Tyler to buy Number 24 with him. They brothers fall out when Tyler learns that Mark tried to protect Aaron from arrest during his investigation into the Erinsborough High fire. While discussing their future, Mark and Paige get engaged. Mark is deeply critical of Paige when she befriends Dimato's lover Michelle Kim (Ra Chapman), who claims to be on the run from Dimato. The issue divides Mark, who does not trust Michelle, and Paige, who believes Mark thinks she is naïve. On their wedding day the police find stolen items with Paige's fingerprints on them, and Mark arrests her. She explains that Dimato and Michelle were trying to set her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Paul helped her deal with the situation, and that she did not tell Mark to protect him. Furious at Paige for further lies after promising there would be no secrets between them, Mark calls off the wedding. He later apologises and tries to convince Paige to take him back, but she refuses, wanting to find direction in her life and believing they are too different.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{were largely}} {{inactive}} following their 1997–1998 tour; after its end, their only public performance in 1998 {{was at an}} Amnesty International concert in Paris. Yorke later said that during that period the band came close to splitting <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he had developed severe depression. In early 1999, Radiohead began work on a follow-up to OK Computer. Although the album's success meant {{there was no longer}} any pressure or a deadline from their record label, tension during this period was high. Band members all had different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke experienced writer's block, influencing him toward a more abstract, fragmented form of songwriting. Radiohead secluded themselves with producer Nigel Godrich in studios in Paris, Copenhagen, and Gloucester, and in their newly completed studio in Oxford. Eventually, all the members agreed on a new musical direction, redefining their instrumental roles. After nearly 18 months, Radiohead's recording sessions were completed in April 2000.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E

25|$|The White Horse Sessions {{proved to}} be the last Nightnoise album. Cunningham left the band {{following}} its release, and was replaced by Irish fiddler John Fitzpatrick. The group recorded new material—both original compositions and covers of classic songs—but they were all made for albums other than their own. Nightnoise officially disbanded towards the end of 1997. In a 1999 interview, Ó Domhnaill stated that Nightnoise had not broken <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the band would be getting together again shortly, but a reunion never occurred.|$|E

25|$|Popular {{demands for}} a Constituent Assembly soon emerged. In December 1899, the U.S. War Secretary assured the Cuban populace that the {{occupation}} was temporary, that municipal and general elections would be held, that a Constituent Assembly would be set <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> sovereignty would be handed to Cubans. Brooke was replaced by General Leonard Wood to oversee the transition. Parties were created, including the Cuban National Party, the Federal Republican Party of Las Villas, the Republican Party of Havana and the Democratic Union Party.|$|E
25|$|In Angel season four, Angel is {{reverted to}} the evil Angelus after having his soul removed. Faith is {{approached}} by her former Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof), who informs her of Angelus's presence, sparking her {{to break out}} of prison and help them. Wanting to help Angel the way he helped her, Faith injects herself with a mystical drug and feeds herself to Angelus in order to incapacitate him so that their allies can work to restore his soul. She nearly dies from the drug, but during a psychic mind walk, Angel persuades her subconscious not to give <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> life is worth living.|$|E
25|$|The textile industry, {{which had}} always been an {{important}} pillar of Haarlem's economy, was in a bad shape {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century. Strong international competition, and revolutionary new production methods based on steam engines already in use in England, dealt a striking blow to Haarlem's industry. In 1815 the city's population was about 17,000 people, a large percentage of whom were poor. The foundation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in that year gave hope to many, who believed that under a new government the economy would pick <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> export-oriented economic activities such as the textile industry would recover.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems likely}} that it was around Lichfield, rather than Enville, that Margaret Lowe and her sisters grew <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> they came to {{maturity}} while living {{at least some of}} the time at Tymore. Their mother died while they were still children. Perhaps sensing that his profitable lessee was approaching death, Peter Roos sold the Tymore estate to William Skeffington in November 1593: The Skeffington family had held Fisherwick itself since the 1520s and Sir John had handed it over to his son William in 1587, so this was a natural extension to his estates in Staffordshire. In 1594 Skeffington leased the house at Tymore to Batholomew Farmer for ten years, so it cannot have bee occupied by Michael Lowe’s heirs at that date.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{restoration}} of his heart, the Doctor found himself locked in a desperate struggle with Sabbath as, along with his mysterious business associates, Sabbath hatched a plan to destroy all alternate realities. Sabbath believed that time travellers like the Doctor, every time they landed somewhere, created an alternate reality where they didn't show <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the universe was unable to support so many alternates without suffering damage; therefore, he attempted to trigger an explosion at Event One – the Big Bang – that would erase all alternate universes and leaving only one possible timeline. However, Sabbath's allies had been lying to him; in reality, Time would only split if absolutely necessary, and even then, it was nearly impossible to travel between alternate realities. In reality, Sabbath had been manipulated into creating {{a plan that would}} effectively wipe out free will itself.|$|E
25|$|Hitler, however, had no {{intention}} of staying on the defensive in the west over the winter. As early as mid-September he was planning a counter-offensive. By October, with the front stabilising, he had decided on an attack in the Ardennes, designed to split the British and American fronts at a weakly held point, cross the Meuse and recapture Antwerp. On 27 October Rundstedt and Model met with General Alfred Jodl, chief of operations at OKW, and told him flatly that they considered this impossible with the available forces. Instead they suggested a more modest operation to destroy the Allied concentrations around Liège and Aachen. Jodl took their views back to Hitler, but on 3 November he told them that the Führer's mind was made <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he wanted the attack to begin before the end of November. The spearhead was to be the 6th Panzer Army, commanded by Sepp Dietrich and largely made up of Waffen-SS units such as the Leibstandarte, Das Reich and Hitlerjugend, and the 5th Panzer Army, commanded by General Hasso von Manteuffel.|$|E

25|$|Quinn informs {{her that}} he found {{evidence}} that Sekou was set <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Porteous Belli (C. J. Wilson), an assassin working for Adal, has been spying on her. They go to the conspirators' safe house, where Belli attacks them. Quinn kills Belli, and finds evidence that the conspirators are planning to assassinate Keane. Moments later, however, the house is destroyed by a hidden bomb, taking the evidence with it. Carrie and Quinn rush to Keane's headquarters, which has just received a bomb threat. During the evacuation, Adal calls Carrie and tells her that the bomb threat is a ruse to get Keane {{out of the building}}, where she can be assassinated, while Quinn is to be framed as the killer. Carrie stops Keane's vehicle from leaving, seconds before the decoy vehicle is destroyed. Quinn smuggles Carrie and Keane out of the building in his car and sacrifices his life to save them when a special ops team, answering to Adal, opens fire on them. Adal is arrested and Keane is inaugurated as President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Other writers blamed either Pompey or Caesar. Plutarch did not {{indicate}} when the incident happened either. In his version it was a ploy by the supporters of Pompey, who claimed that Vettius was plotting to kill Pompey. When questioned in the senate he accused several people, but when he spoke {{in front of the}} people he said that Licinius Lucullus was the one who arranged the plot. No one believed him and {{it was clear that the}} supporters of Pompey got him to make false accusations. The deceit became even more obvious when he was battered to death a few days later. The opinion was that he was killed by those who had hired him. Suetonius wrote that Caesar had bribed Vettius to tell a story about a conspiracy to murder Pompey according to a prearranged plot, but he was suspected of ‘double-dealing.’ He also wrote that Caesar was supposed to have poisoned him. Cicero gave an account in some letters to his fiend Atticus. Vettius, an informer, claimed that he had told Curio Junior that he had decided to use his slaves to assassinate Pompey. Curio told his father Gaius Scribonius Curio, who in turn told Pompey. When questioned in the senate he said that there was a group of conspiratorial young men led by Curio. The secretary of Calpurnius Bibulus gave him a dagger from Bibulus. He was to attack Pompey at the forum at some gladiatorial games and the ringleader for this was Aemilius Paullus. However, Aemilius Paullus was in Greece at the time. He also said that he had warned Pompey about the danger of plots. Vettius was arrested for confessing to possession of a dagger. The next day Caesar brought him to the rosta (a platform for public speeches). Vettius did not mention Curio. He implicated other men instead. Cicero thought that Vettius had been briefed on what to say during the night. The men he mentioned had not cast any suspicion. Cicero noted that it was thought that this was a set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the plan had been to catch Vettius in the forum with a dagger and his slaves with weapons, and that he was then to give information. He also thought that this had been masterminded by Caesar, who got Vettius to get close to Curio.|$|E
