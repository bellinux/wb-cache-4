40|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>unstable</b> burst <b>fractures</b> of the atlas (Jefferson <b>fractures)</b> is controversial. <b>Unstable</b> Jefferson <b>fractures</b> have been managed successfully with either immobilization, typically halo traction or halo vest, or surgery.

The outcome challenges the clinical relevance of treatment algorithms that rely on the “rules of Spence” to guide {{treatment of}} <b>unstable</b> Jefferson <b>fractures</b> and illustrates instability {{may not necessarily be}} present in patients with considerable lateral mass widening.

30|$|Femoral trochanteric {{fractures}} {{are very}} common, {{and it was}} apparent that there were fractures whose fracture lines extended to the basal neck or to the subtrochanteric part, without remaining only in the trochanter part. However, there have been no reports that investigated the frequency of such <b>unstable</b> <b>fractures.</b> In this study, it became clear that, among the 284 fractures around the trochanteric part, namely area- 3, in 142 cases the fracture line remained only in the trochanteric part, and the remaining half were such <b>unstable</b> <b>fractures</b> whose fracture lines extended to the basal neck or the subtrochanteric part. These are the data provided by classifying femoral trochanteric fractures using area classification. The high reliability of area classification has already been reported (Kijima et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} tip-apex {{distance}} (TAD), cervicodiaphyseal angle and Garden angle in stable and <b>unstable</b> extracapsular <b>fractures</b> of the femur {{treated with a}} plate and sliding screw. METHOD: Hip radiographs in anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view on 117 patients were evaluated. The fractures were classified as stable or unstable, using the AO classification, and the reduction achieved was assessed {{in accordance with the}} following criteria: TAD > 3 cm; Garden alignment index (AP) < 160 °; and AP cervicodiaphyseal varus angle < 125 °. When two or more criteria were present, the quality of the osteosynthesis was classified as "not ideal". RESULTS: The patients with <b>unstable</b> <b>fractures</b> presented AP cervicodiaphyseal angles that were significantly greater (p = 0. 05) than in those with stable fractures. The patients with <b>unstable</b> <b>fractures</b> presented lateral cervicodiaphyseal angles that were significantly smaller (p = 0. 05) than in those with stable fractures.

Methods We estimated {{the costs of}} hospital care and outpatient visits for patients with traumatic thoracolumbar spine fractures. Results Stable fractures without neurological deficits were treated nonoperatively and the costs were EUR 5, 100. <b>Unstable</b> <b>fractures</b> without neurological deficits were treated either nonoperatively, {{with an average of}} 29 hospitalization days and average cost of EUR 12, 500 (86 % of which represented hospitalization costs), or operatively with 24 hospitalization days and average cost of EUR 19, 700 (48 % of which represented hospitalization costs and 42 % surgery costs). <b>Unstable</b> <b>fractures</b> with neurological deficits were usually operated (average costs EUR 31, 900). Interpretation For all patients, the costs of hospitalization days were the main cost driver. Although the length of stay for patients with <b>unstable</b> <b>fractures</b> and without neurological deficit who were treated operatively was shorter than for patients treated nonoperatively, the total costs were higher due to the additional costs of surgery.

40|$|Affected by {{physical}} properties of various components, characteristics and stress states of junction surface and other multiple factors, concrete, {{as a kind}} of multi-phase composite material, has complicated failure mechanism, thus making its fracture mechanism research difficult. But concrete has been widely used in engineering construction, so research on concrete fracture theory is of important realistic significance and construction value. This study discusses influence rule of specimen size and crack-depth ratio (α 0 /h) on double- K fracture parameters (initial fracture toughness ini IC K and <b>unstable</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness un IC K) and its size effects by using fracture test. Different sizes of concretes and roller compacted concrete (RCC) specimens are adopted to explore influence of specimen size on concrete double-K fracture parameters. Results reveal that initial fracture toughness ini IC K and <b>unstable</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness un IC K increase as specimen size enlarges, showing a size effect; besides, subcritical crack extends with the increase of specimen size. With regard to specimens with different crack-depth ratios, its <b>unstable</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness un IC K is unrelated to initial crack-depth ratio when crack-depth ratio is more than or equal to 0. 4, while initial fracture toughness ini IC K is correlated with initial crack-depth ratio, which indicate that double-K fracture parameters can be considered as material constants describing concrete initial fracture, stable expansion and whole process of stability failure...|$|E

Methods A systematic search of literature was performed to identify any type of study with the term <b>unstable</b> distal radius <b>fracture.</b> We assessed whether a definition was provided and determined the level of evidence for the most common definitions. Results The search yielded 2, 489 citations, of which 479 were included. In 149 studies, it was explicitly stated that patients with <b>unstable</b> distal radius <b>fractures</b> were enrolled. In 54 % (81 / 149) of these studies, the authors defined an <b>unstable</b> distal radius <b>fracture.</b> Overall, we found 143 different definitions. The seven most common definitions were: displacement following adequate reduction; Lafontaine's definition; irreducibility; an AO type C 2 fracture; a volarly displaced fracture; Poigenfürst's criteria; and Cooney's criteria. Only Lafontaine's definition originated from a clinical study (level IIIb).
