40|$|Objectives: Self-closing nitinol U-clips (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) have {{primarily}} {{been used}} by vascular surgeons to facilitate vessel anastomosis. The advantage of this device is that it obviates the need for suturing when manipulation of the tissue or needle is prohibitive. The current report describes a novel use of the <b>U-clip</b> as an aid in endoscopic reconstruction of the skull base. Methods/Participants: Two patients underwent <b>U-clip</b> assisted skull base repair. The first patient underwent transnasal endoscopic repair of an ethmoidal meningoencephalocele requiring primary dural closure and the second underwent odontoidectomy for basilar invagination via an endoscopic transnasal approach requiring primary closure of the soft tissues. Study Design – Case Series Results: The defects were successfully closed using the <b>U-Clip</b> anastomotic device. No cerebrospinal fluid leaks were experienced postoperatively. Intraoperative evaluation combined with postoperative imaging confirmed a satisfactory reconstruction. Conclusions: The <b>U-clip</b> device {{may be used as}} an adjunct in select cases to facilitate endoscopic skull base reconstruction. The use of this tool may prevent tissue migration and enhance dural closure. It may be particularly useful in cases where narrow operative corridors make conventional suturing technically difficult...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to create an ovine {{arteriovenous}} fistula (AVF) model which would closely replicate a human forearm fistula and use this to quantify the degree of intimal hyperplasia in those created with the <b>U-Clip</b> compared to a conventional sutured anastomosis. Materials and methodsTwenty AVFs were created in 10 Border Leicester–Merino sheep between the superficial femoral artery and vein of each hind limb. On one side the <b>U-Clip</b> and on the other a continuous polypropylene suture was used to perform the anastomosis. The animals were sacrificed at 2 (n =  3), 4 (n =  4), 6 (n =  3) weeks and histological slices were taken of each AVF in cross section to determine the intimal media area per unit length (IMA/L). ResultsIntimal hyperplasia (IH) was observed at all time points with one AVF found occluded with thrombus at the time of harvest. The IMA/L was significantly lower in the <b>U-Clip</b> groups by 24 % at 2 weeks, 32 % at 4 weeks and 23 % at 6 weeks (Two-way ANOVA, p =  0. 019, observed power =  0. 825, time or side p ≥  0. 766, type p =  0. 001; Paired t-test, p <  0. 001 between matched anastomotic types). Time taken to perform the anastomosis was similar between the two anastomotic techniques (Polypropylene 14 (8 – 18) vs. <b>U-Clip</b> 15. 3 (11 – 23) min; p =  0. 47). ConclusionThis ovine AVF model results in IH similar to that seen in a human AVF. The IH that occurs with the <b>U-Clip</b> is less than that of continuous polypropylene suture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{literature}} established that, {{in patients}} without Boey's risk factors, laparoscopic repair of perforated peptic ulcers, compared to open repair, is associated to lower wound infection rate, less analgesic use, reduction in post operative pain, shorter hospital stay. Some {{of the main}} drawbacks are length of operative time and laparoscopic surgeon's experience in intracorporeal knotting. We, for first, report our preliminary experience of perforated peptic ulcers' laparoscopic repair using Medtronic <b>U-Clip</b> ®. Methods From January 2008 to June 2008 we performed laparoscopic repair of perforated peptic ulcers using Medtronic <b>U-Clip</b> ® in 10 consecutive patients (6 men and 4 women, from 20 to 65 years-old of age). All the patients presented with iuxtapyloric perforated peptic ulcer, not greater than 10 mm, without signs of sepsis, free from major illnesses. The mini-invasive procedure was performed both by skilled and non-skilled laparoscopic surgeons under experts' surveillance. After it was recognized, perforation was sutured using <b>U-Clip</b> ® in a full-thickness manner. Results and Discussion We reported no surgical complications in the peri-operative period. The clinical outcome and time needed to perform the intervention didn't change between skilled and non-skilled surgeons. The follow-up at 30 days was good. Conclusion In our experience, the anastomotic device <b>U-Clip</b> ® simplifies laparoscopic repair of perforated peptic ulcer, avoiding the need to perform knots and making the procedure safe and easier. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare flow {{characteristics}} of LIMA-LAD anastomoses constructed using two different techniques. Thirty patients underwent MIDCAB using either simple continuous suture (20) or separate nitinol <b>U-clips</b> (10). Intraoperative transit time flow measurements were recorded. Preoperative variables were similar in the two groups. Anastomosis time was significantly higher in the <b>U-clipped</b> group (9. 9 ^ 1. 5 min. vs. 11. 4 ^ 1. 5 min; P 0 : 016). Average flow value in the 20 continuous suture LIMA-LAD anastomoses was 26. 7 ^ 8. 8 ml/min versus 36. 3 ^ 10. 6 ml/min in the 10 <b>U-clipped</b> grafts (P 0 : 014). Pulsatility Index value was significantly lower in the <b>U-clipped</b> group (3. 1 ^ 0. 9 vs. 1. 8 ^ 0. 3, P 0 : 0001) and diastolic flow index was significantly higher (0. 7 ^ 0. 04 vs. 0. 8 ^ 0. 03, P 0 : 046). Perioperative results were similar in the two groups (P ns). No mortality was reported. Postoperative trans-thoracic Doppler confirmed patency of the LIMA in all 30 patients. At short-term clinical follow-up (60 ^ 4 days), all patients were in CCSI. Nitinol <b>U-clips</b> can be used to construct LIMA-LAD anastomoses on the beating heart. Flow dynamics of these anastomoses are superior to those of grafts constructed using continuous suture technique. Particularly, total flow is higher and diastolic flow may reach values of 80 % of the total measured flow...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the in vivo {{corrosion}} resistance of the implanted titanium, nitinol annular occlusion device to a control device, i. e. an implantable device containing nitinol, approved by the FDA and currently on the market. Methods: The annular occlusion device is a self-closing, implantable clip. Three canines un-derwent placement of devices on the left and right atrial appendages. Two Vnus <b>U-clips</b> were secured to either atrium. On post-operative day 95, animals underwent en-bloc cardiac resection via the previous left thoracotomy incision. The annular occlusion device and <b>U-clips</b> were dissected free from the atria. The polyester fabric and tissue ingrowth were removed from the devices and were sent for corrosion analysis. Results: Gross examination of resected hearts of two canines revealed no abnormalities. The compressed endocardial surfaces were completely fused and the appendages fully necrosed. All devices were located and harvested. The annular occlusion device clips and Medtronic Vnus <b>U-clips</b> were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Both low and high magnification examination of the nitinol springs and the site of insertion of the nitinol springs into the titanium tubes in the annular occlusion device showed no evi-dence of localized corrosion. In no case was any evidence of general or localized corrosion found in the form of metal-lic oxidation.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} compare the local tissue {{response}} and subsequent volume of intimal hyperplasia (IH) that develops throughout the maturation of an arteriovenous fistula created using continuous/interrupted polypropylene {{with that of a}} novel, metal-alloy, penetrating anastomotic clip device. Materials and methodsForty-six fistulae were created in 23 sheep under a paired design using the nitinol <b>U-Clip</b> (n =  23) in one hind limb and continuous (n =  20) or interrupted (n =  3) polypropylene suture for the other. Animals were killed at 4 (n =  3), 14 (n =  3), 28 (n =  10), 42 (n =  3), and 180 (n =  4) days. Histological sections were evaluated for quantitative histology and immunohistochemistry. ResultsCompared with continuous polypropylene, <b>U-Clip</b> specimens demonstrated less intima–media area per unit length (IMA/L), proliferating cells, and tissue necrosis at all time points (MANOVA, F =  9. 8 – 24. 1, all p ≤ . 005; observed power > 82 %). Specifically, values of IMA/L were reduced by 5 % (p = . 97), 37 % (p = . 02), 33 % (p < . 01), 9 % (p = . 42), and 14 % (p = . 22) at the time points of 4, 14, 28, 42, and 180 days respectively. Proliferating cells were reduced by 75 % (p < . 01), 72 % (p = . 03), 76 % (p = . 03), 27 % (p = . 31), and 60 % (p = . 01) and tissue necrosis by 67 % (p < . 01), 58 % (p = . 02), 40 % (p = . 33), 21 % (p = . 43), 77 % (p = . 11). In a 28 -day comparison between <b>U-Clip</b> and interrupted polypropylene the <b>U-Clip</b> group demonstrated a 4 % (p = . 65) reduction in IMA/L, 74 % (p < . 01) in proliferating cells and 49 % (p < . 05) in tissue necrosis. ConclusionsThese results provide evidence of reduced local tissue necrosis, proliferating cells, and IH, favouring arteriovenous fistulae created using the <b>U-Clip</b> anastomotic device over conventional polypropylene suture techniques most evident over the first 4 weeks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{coronary}} anastomosis is {{the most}} difficult part of the coronary bypass procedure, particularly when using a minimally invasive technique. Methods to facilitate coronary anastomosis will make the minimally invasive approach to coronary bypass feasible. We sought preclinical validation and testing of the design and efficacy of a self-closing penetrating clip that can be used to facilitate the creation of graft-to-coronary end-to-side anastomosis. Methods: The nitinol <b>U-Clip</b> device (Coalescent Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) was used in 13 consecutive calves (63 - 118 kg). In each animal, the device was (1) used to create an anastomosis of the right internal thoracic artery to a coronary artery with the heart beating and (2) compared to polypropylene suture when used to repair two carotid arteriotomies. Intraoperative, 1 -week, 8 -week, and 26 -week postoperative angiograms and detailed histopathologic examinations were used to evaluate anastomotic patency and healing characteristics. Results: The nitinol <b>U-Clip</b> device successfully created right internal thoracic artery–coronary artery anastomoses and repaired carotid arteriotomy sites in 13 consecutive calves. The clip was precisely placed by means of the integrated suture and needle in a fashion similar to that used for conventional suture. The clip met design specifications by reliable release and automatic closure, thereby eliminating knot tying and assisted suture management. At the time of harvest, angiography showed widely patent coronary anastomoses (FitzGibbon grade A criteria, n = 13) and carotid arteriotomy repair sites (n = 13). Histopathologic evaluation confirmed normal healing with smooth circumferential neointimal resurfacing at the anastomotic and repair sites. Conclusions: The nitinol <b>U-Clip</b> design and function was validated in the formation of bovine coronary anastomoses on the beating bovine heart with excellent graft patency and healing characteristics. The nitinol <b>U-Clip</b> device tests favorably when compared with conventional sutures in carotid artery repair. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 121 : 859 - 70...|$|E
40|$|The most {{dramatic}} complication in endonasal surgery is inadvertent {{injury to the}} internal carotid artery (ICA) with massive bleeding. Nasal packing is the favored technique for control; however, this often causes complete carotid occlusion or carotid stenosis, contributing to the morbidity and mortality of the patient. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the efficacy of endoscopically applied hemostatic techniques that maintain vascular flow in an animal model of carotid artery injury. A total of 20 sheep underwent ICA dissection/isolation followed by the placement of the artery within a modified "sinus model otorhino neuro trainer" (SIMONT) model. A standardized 4 -mm carotid artery injury was created endoscopically. Randomization of sheep to receive 1 of 5 hemostatic techniques was performed (Floseal, oxidized regenerated cellulose, Chitosan gel, muscle patch, or the <b>U-Clip</b> anastomotic device). Specific outcome measures were time to hemostasis, duration of time mean arterial pressure (MAP) was > 55 mmHg, blood loss, and survival time. Muscle patch hemostasis and the <b>U-Clip</b> anastomotic device were significantly more effective at achieving primary hemostasis rapidly, reducing total blood loss, and increasing survival time and time MAP was > 55 mmHg more than Floseal, oxidized regenerated cellulose, and Chitosan gel (p < 0. 05). Additionally, all muscle patch-treated and <b>U-Clip</b> device-treated sheep achieved primary hemostasis and reached the endpoint of observation, while maintaining vascular patency. Floseal and oxidized regenerated cellulose failed to achieve hemostasis in any animal, with all animals exsanguinating prematurely. In the sheep model of endoscopic ICA injury, the muscle patch and <b>U-Clip</b> anastomotic device significantly improved survival, reduced blood loss, and achieved primary hemostasis while maintaining vascular patency.

40|$|Gastrojejunostomy {{stricture}} after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass {{occurs in}} 3 to 27 % of morbidly obese {{patients in the}} USA. We questioned whether preoperative patient characteristics, including demographic attributes and comorbid disease, might be significant factors in the etiology of stricture. In this study from November 2001 to February 2006 (51  months), at a high-volume bariatric center, of the 1, 351 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass, 92 developed stricture (6. 8 %). All but two were treated successfully by endoscopic dilation. All patients stopped nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications 2  weeks prior to surgery and did not restart them. The operative procedure included {{the use of a}} 21 -mm transoral circular stapler to create the gastrojejunostomy; the Roux limb was brought retrogastric, retrocolic. In an effort to reduce our center’s stricture rate, late in the study, <b>U-clips</b> used at the gastrojejunostomy were replaced by absorbable sutures, and postoperative H 2 antagonists were added to the treatment protocol. The change to absorbable polyglactin suture proved to be significant, resulting in a lower stricture rate. The addition of H 2 antagonists showed no significant effect. Following the retrospective review of the prospective database, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with the development of stricture.

This study was designed to examine one of these devices (a new self-closing clip) for left internal thoracic artery-left anterior descending coronary artery anastomosis. Its feasibility and the quality of anastomosis were evaluated. Methods: Fourteen patients who underwent first-time elective coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled between July and December 2000. The left internal thoracic artery was anastomosed to the left anterior descending coronary artery in an interrupted manner with Coalescent <b>U-clips</b> (Coalescent Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif). Immediate patency was checked with a transit-time flowmeter. Selective angiography was performed 6 months after surgical intervention. Results: Five patients underwent on-pump coronary bypass grafting, 9 on the beating heart. One patient was excluded from the study intraoperatively because of a poor target site necessitating a 2 -cm-long anastomosis. Left internal thoracic artery-left anterior descending artery anastomoses were created with an average of 11. 8 clips in 15. 9 minutes. Mean graft flow was 45. 6 mL/min. Neither conversion to standard suture technique nor revision of anastomosis was necessary. There tended to be a learning curve in the anastomosis on the beating heart. Postoperative lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital were 20. 7 hours and 3. 9 days, respectively. Neither death nor major complication was seen, except for temporary atrial fibrillation in 2 patients. Graft patency at 6 months was 100 % (FitzGibbon grade A). Conclusion: Left internal thoracic artery—left anterior descending artery anastomoses can be created safely and effectively with new self-closing clips on the beating, as well as the arrested, heart.

40|$|Introduction Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is {{the gold}} {{standard}} treatment for medically refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and endoscopic skull base surgery is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice for many skull base tumours. Intraoperative and postoperative bleeding can range from minor and troublesome, to catastrophic, increasing the risk of complications to the patient. Whilst {{there are a number}} of effective haemostats, they are associated with scar tissue formation, patient discomfort and risk disease transmission. Carotid artery haemorrhage during sinus and skull base surgery remains the most feared complication, with considerable challenges in controlling the surgical field and managing such an event. There is no prospective scientific investigation to guide the surgeon in how best to manage this scenario. The aim of this thesis is to explore different haemostatic techniques and agents that can be implemented during sinus and skull base surgery. Methods A novel haemostatic agent that has shown promise during in vitro investigation was identified and investigated in the sheep model of ESS. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) used the Boezaart surgical field grade scale to investigate the haemostatic efficacy. Macroscopic inspection of wound healing was performed for the first 2 post-operative weeks. Further evaluation of this agent was conducted in patients undergoing ESS. Patient’s symptoms were also investigated along with adhesion formation up to 3 months following surgery. To investigate the catastrophic bleeding scenario, the sheep model of carotid artery injury was developed. Consecutive experience with this model allowed a retrospective review of surgical videos to be performed so that a number of important principles could be identified to control the surgical field. Following this the efficacy of various techniques at achieving haemostasis were compared in a prospective randomised fashion. Particular end points included time to haemostasis, total blood loss, and overall survival of the animal. Results Chitosan gel, in the sheep model of ESS, achieved rapid haemostasis at 2, 4 and 6 minutes after injury, with no adverse effects noted in the early post-operative period. These findings were replicated in patients following ESS, with the additional benefits of no adverse patient symptoms and prevention of adhesion formation. The sheep model of carotid artery injury is a reproducible model of the high flow/high pressure vascular catastrophe that accurately recreates the anatomical constraints of the human nasal vestibule and is capable of training advanced endoscopic skull base surgeons in the techniques required to manage the surgical field. With specific instrumentation, the <b>U-clip</b> treatment and the muscle patch achieved complete haemostasis whilst maintaining vascular flow through the parent vessel. Conclusions Chitosan gel is the first effective haemostatic agent that improves macroscopic and microscopic features of wound healing, is well tolerated, and is rapidly dissolvable in the early post-operative period. The sheep model of carotid artery injury is an important innovation that allows advanced skull base surgeons to be trained in the techniques required to control the surgical field during carotid injury. Additionally, in the sheep model, the <b>U-clip</b> treatment and muscle patch repair achieve rapid haemostasis and maintain vascular patency. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ObjectiveA {{substantial}} {{barrier to}} widespread adoption of robotically assisted mitral valve repair surgery is increased operative time {{compared with that}} of median sternotomy. Nitinol U-clips (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) made of a shape-memory alloy eliminate intrathoracic suturing and may reduce operative times. MethodsA retrospective review of robotically assisted mitral valve repair surgery was done at East Carolina University, where preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected prospectively. The total time for <b>U-clip</b> or suture placement, as well as those for cardiopulmonary bypass, crossclamp, and annuloplasty band placement, were studied. Patients in whom only U-clips were used (“U-clips” cohort) were compared with those in whom only sutures were used (“sutures” cohort). Comparisons between groups were by two-tailed Student t test. ResultsBetween May 2000 and June 2004, U-clips were used exclusively in 50 patients (mean age 58. 4 ± 13. 2 years), and sutures were used exclusively in 72 patients (mean age 56. 2 ± 12. 9 years). The mean total time for placement and deployment of U-clips was shorter than for placement and tying of sutures (101 ± 45 seconds vs 186 ± 79 seconds, respectively, P <. 001). Cardiopulmonary bypass, crossclamp, and annuloplasty band placement times were shorter in the U-clips cohort (144 ± 50 minutes vs 169 ± 35 minutes, 105 ± 30 minutes vs 132 ± 29 minutes, and 26 ± 5 minutes vs 40 ± 10 minutes, U-clips vs sutures, respectively, all P <. 01). ConclusionsSignificantly shorter times were observed for placement and deployment of U-clips versus placement and tying of sutures, resulting in a reduction in mean band placement time of 14 minutes and significantly shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and crossclamp times in the U-clips cohort. Therefore, use of Nitinol U-clips instead of sutures may allow for significantly faster robotically assisted mitral valve repair surgery...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveDespite {{the early}} {{introduction}} of totally endoscopic {{coronary artery bypass}} on the beating heart, {{only a limited number}} of cases have been performed. The limiting factor has been the concern about safety and graft patency of the anastomosis. This study describes our experience with totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass on the beating heart with robotic assistance and its early and midterm results. MethodsIn 365 cases of robotic cardiac operations, 162 patients underwent robotic coronary artery bypass grafting on the beating heart, of whom 60 patients (46 male, 14 female) underwent totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass on the beating heart. The patients’ mean age was 56. 97 ± 9. 7 years (33 – 77 years). Left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending anastomosis was performed using the <b>U-Clip</b> device. ResultsWe completed 58 totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass procedures, in which 16 patients received hybrid procedures. Two patients had conversions to a minithoracotomy. The average left internal thoracic artery harvesting and anastomosis times were 31. 3 ± 10. 5 (18 ∼ 55) minutes and 11. 3 ± 4. 7 (5 ∼ 21) minutes, respectively. The mean operating room and operation times were 336. 1 ± 58. 5 (210 ∼ 580) minutes and 264. 8 ± 65. 6 (150 ∼ 420) minutes, respectively. The drainage was 164. 9 ± 83. 2 (70 ∼ 450) mL. Before discharge, 50 patients underwent angiography and 8 patients underwent computed tomography angiography, and the study showed that graft patency was 100 %. Unexpectedly, the left internal thoracic artery graft developed a collateral branch in 2 patients. After discharge, all patients were followed up by computed tomography angiography. The average follow-up time was 12. 67 ± 9. 43 (1 – 40) months. One patient had gastric bleeding after surgery.

40|$|Cardio{{vascular}} disease {{takes more}} human life {{than any other}} disease process. The vascular specialist fights a daily battle to limit the progression of atherosclerosis and replenish the circulation when it is compromised. Increasingly reliant on technological advances, the specialty {{is responsible for the}} evaluation of new devices and techniques through scientific method. This thesis represents a body of work which addresses several advances within the realm of vascular disease. In the first experimental portion a large animal model was established to evaluate a novel, nitinol, anastomotic device, the <b>U-clip.</b> Arteriovenous fistulae were created to compare the local cellular response around it and the conventional suture material. A distinct advantage was observed for the new technology with less intimal hyperplasia, necrosis and proliferating cells at earlier time points. The second experimental portion saw a focus on carotid artery stenting (CAS), a percutaneous method of revascularisation which utilises nitinol for both the carotid stent and the cerebral protection device (CPD). In a comprehensive histological and biomarker analysis the debris collected in the distal-filter CPD was found to contain more calcified tissue and fewer foam cells in symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic ones. It also demonstrated a greater proportion of inflammatory cytokines, macrophage specific proteins and matrix metelloproteinase (MMP) - 9, a gelatinase known to incite histological features of plaque vulnerability. In a second study a new technique to perform CAS guided by extra-vascular ultrasound was compared with standard CAS (fluoroscopy/angiography). This demonstrated significantly less contrast use and fewer direct cerebral injections whilst maintaining equivalent safety and efficacy. A corrosion-resistance analysis of nitinol stents used throughout the human body was performed to compare five stents used in clinical practice. It found a degree of difference in the corrosion-resistance properties of those five devices and demonstrated that corrosion in isolation may lead to stent fracture. Finally, the evolution of clinical practice in the treatment of critical lower limb ischaemia was evaluated in a single-centre experience. A shifting paradigm toward an endovascular-first strategy resulted in fewer major amputations and considerably less reliance on hospital inpatient resources compared to the open-surgery-first approach of a bygone era...|$|E
