The Antarctic endemic Schistidium antarctici possessed half the combined pool of UV screens of the other species but, as in C. purpureus, these were predominantly cell wall bound. Confocal microscopy confirmed the localization of UV screens in each species. • Greater investment in cell wall-bound UV screens offers C. purpureus a more spatially uniform, and potentially more effective, UV screen. Schistidium antarctici has the lowest <b>UV-screening</b> potential, indicating that this species may be disadvantaged under continuing springtime ozone depletion.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this 4 -year experiment conducted in a mountain grassland ecosystem {{was to investigate the}} interactive effects of ultraviolet (UV) treatment and drought on changes in accumulation of <b>UV-screening</b> compounds (flavonols) in selected herbs (Hypericum maculatum Crantz, Rumex obtusifolius L.) and grass (Agrostis tenuis Sibth.). Inasmuch as drought and UV radiation induce similar protective mechanisms, we tested the hypothesis that UV radiation and drought elicit synergistic effects on flavonol accumulation. The experimental plots were manipulated using rainout shelters enabling the exclusion and transmission of incident precipitation and UV radiation. Generally, UV and drought treatments had similar effects on flavonol accumulation. For R. obtusifolius, UV exclusion resulted in a substantial reduction of <b>UV-screening</b> compounds, particularly under ambient precipitation conditions, while for H. maculatum and A. tenuis UV exclusion caused only a slight reduction of flavonol content.

A new microcapsule-based system is developed consisting of a <b>UV-screening</b> polyurea shell containing a fluorescent liquid core. The <b>UV-screening</b> functionality allows to prevent unwanted fluorescence emission from intact microcapsules upon UV-light exposure and yields excellent visibility contrast of the locally damaged region where fluorescent liquid core released from ruptured microcapsules is present. In addition, by carefully tuning the chemical composition of the shell material, microcapsules with enhanced chemical stability can be formed, as demonstrated by their superior solvent resistance over dwell time originating from the highly crosslinked shell structure that prevents core extraction from the microcapsules.

Microcapsules filled with a photochromic spiropyran, dissolved in sunflower oil as core material, were synthesized by reacting a TDI-based polyisocyanate prepolymer with a benzophenone-based amine to obtain robust UV-absorbing polyurea shells. The newly synthesized <b>UV-screening</b> microcapsules were embedded into a photoresist to realize a new mechanoresponsive polymer. After scratching the coating, the <b>UV-screening</b> microcapsules break and the UV-sensitive core material is released and diffuses into the polymer matrix. Upon exposure to UV-A light, a rapid color change in the region where the damage was made is observed, because of the photoinduced transition of spiropyran to the plane merocyanine form.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} electron acceptors are tested for efficacy in the oxidation of water to oxygen, photocatalysed by titanium dioxide. The highly UV-absorbing metal ion electron acceptors, Ce 4 + and Fe 3 +, appear ineffective at high concentration (10 (- 2) M), due to <b>UV-screening,</b> but more effective at lower concentrations (10 (- 3) M). The metal-depositing electron acceptor, Ag+, is initially effective, but loses activity upon prolonged irradiation due to metal deposition which promotes electron-hole recombination as well as <b>UV-screening</b> the titania particles. Most striking of the electron acceptors tested is persulfate, particularly in alkaline solution (0. 1 M NaOH).

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) -absorbing {{phenolic}} compounds {{that have been}} shown to be protective against the damaging: effects of UV-B radiation (Tevini et al., 1991, Photochem. Photobiol. 53, 329 - 333) were found in the leaf epidermis of tropical mangrove tree species. These UV-absorbing {{phenolic compounds}} and leaf succulence function as selective filters, removing short and energetic wavelengths. A field survey showed that the concentration of UV-absorbing compounds varied between species, between sites that would be experiencing similar levels of UV radiation, and between sun and shade leaves. Sun leaves have greater contents of phenolic compounds than shade leaves, and more saline sites have plants with greater levels in their leaves than less saline sites. In addition, increases in leaf nitrogen contents and quantum yields did not correlate with increasing levels of UV-absorbing compounds. It was concluded from these results that although UV-absorbing compounds form a <b>UV-screen</b> in the epidermis of mangrove leaves, UV radiation may not be the only factor influencing the accumulation of phenolic compounds, thus an experiment which altered the level of UV radiation incident on mangrove species was done. Near ambient levels of UVA and UV-B radiation resulted in a greater content of UV-absorbing compounds in Bruguiera parviflora (Roxb.) Wight and Arn. ex Griff., but did not result in increases in B. gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk or Rhizophora apiculata Blume. Total chlorophyll contents were lower in R. apiculata when it was grown under near-ambient levels of UV radiation than when it was grown under conditions of UV-A and UV-B depletion, but no differences were observed between the UV radiation treatments in the other two species. There was no difference in leaf morphology, carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios, or chlorophyll a/b ratios between UV treatments, although these varied among species; B. parviflora had the highest carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio and R. apiculata had the lowest. Thus it is proposed that differences in species response tu UV radiation may be influenced by their ability to dissipate excess visible solar radiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{compounds}} {{responsible for}} the pink and blue colors of two families of hermatypic corals (Pocilloporidae, Acroporidae) from the southern Great Barrier Reef were isolated and biochemically characterized. Isolation of the pink pigment from Pocillopora damicornis (named pocilloporin, {lambda}max = 560 nm, 390 nm) revealed {{that it was a}} hydrophilic protein dimer with a native molecular weight of approximately 54 kD and subunits of 28 kD. The subunits are not linked by disulfide bonds. Attempts to dissociate the chromophore from the protein proved unsuccessful. Denaturing the protein with heat (60 {deg}C) or 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) removed the 560 -nm absorbance peak without introducing a detectable bathochromic shift. In acetone, ethanol, ether, and chloroform, the pigment precipitates out of solution, leaving a colorless supernatant. These properties suggest that the protein and chromophore are covalently linked. Ion analysis revealed that the pigment does not have metal ions chelated to it. Coral pigments were also isolated from pink morphs of other pocilloporids, Seriatopora hystrix ({lambda}max = 560 nm) and Stylophora pistillata ({lambda}max = 560 nm); and from bluish regions of the acroporids, Acropora formosa (blue; {lambda}max = 590 nm) and Acropora digitifera (purple; {lambda}max = 580 nm). With the exception of A. formosa, all the corals examined had pigments with the same native (54 kD) and subunit (28 kD) molecular weights as those of P. damicornis. A. formosa pigment has a native molecular weight of about 82. 6 kD and three subunits of 28 kD. The pigments isolated from each of these coral species have properties similar to those described for P. damicornis. Isolation and biochemical purification of the pigment enabled the exploration of the function of the pink pigment. Three possibilities were eliminated. The compound does not act as (i) a photoprotectant for shielding the photosynthetic pigments of symbiotic zooxanthellae against excessive irradiances, (ii) a fluorescent coupling agent for amplifying the levels of photosynthetically active radiation available for resident zooxanthellae, or (iii) a <b>UV-screen</b> against the high UV levels of shallow tropical marine environments...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidermal {{phenolic}} compounds (mainly flavonoids) constitute a vital screen {{that protects the}} leaf from damage by natural ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The effectiveness of epidermal <b>UV-screening</b> depends on leaf anatomy, the content of <b>UV-screening</b> compounds and their spatial uniformity over the leaf area. To investigate in vivo the spatial pattern of the epidermal UV-screen during leaf development, a fluorescence imaging method was developed to map the epidermal UV-absorbance at a microscopic scale. This study was done on oak (Quercus petraea) leaves that were used {{as a model of}} woody dicotyledonous leaves. METHODS: The leaf development of 2 -year-old trees, grown outdoors, was monitored, at a macroscopic scale, by in vivo measurements of chlorophyll content per unit area and epidermal UV-absorbance using two optical leaf-clip meters. The distribution of pigments within leaves was assessed in vivo spectroscopically. The microscopic images of UV-induced fluorescence and UV-absorbance acquired in vivo during leaf development were interpreted from spectral characteristics of leaves. KEY RESULTS: At a macroscopic scale, epidermal UV-absorbance was high on the upper leaf side during leaf development, while it increased on the lower leaf side during leaf expansion and reached the adaxial value at maturity. At a microscopic scale, in immature leaves, for both leaf sides, the spatial distribution of epidermal UV-absorbance was heterogeneous, with a pattern depending on the flavonoid content of vacuoles in developing epidermal cells. At maturity, epidermal UV-absorbance was uniform. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial pattern of epidermal UV-screen over the area of oak leaves is related to leaf anatomy during development. In vivo spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging of the leaf surface showed the distribution of pigments within the leaf and hence can provide a tool to monitor optically the leaf development in nature...|$|E

Benthic chlorophyll a concentrations (8 – 261 mg m- 2) greatly exceeded those of the phytoplankton (0. 008 – 1. 4 mg m- 2) in all sites.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{efforts in}} the field of innovative photovoltaic devices are strongly focused on the goal of obtaining high efficiencies. Synthesis of highly absorbing materials, engineering of interfaces, identification of electrons and holes transporters with high conductivity, replacement of expensive and toxic components with better ones are some of the current hot research topics. However, the resistance to meteorological phenomena, pollution and undesired UV radiation (present in the solar spectrum) cannot be easily tuned by working only on cell electrodes and electrolytes. To this purpose, great attention and expectations should be given to polymeric coatings that can be deposited on the external side of the cells. However, rather surprisingly, coatings have been developed almost exclusively for antireflective purposes. Indeed, despite the great academic and industrial efforts spent on cells components, the development of functional coatings for improving the outdoor stability and performance of third generation devices has been surprisingly practically neglected.

In addition, a long-term weathering study under real outdoor conditions showed that DSSCs incorporating the novel coating fully preserved their initial PCE, due to the combined action of the luminescent material (that acted as UV-screen) and the hydrophobic fluoropolymeric matrix (that acted as self-cleaning and water-repellent unit). In the second part of the work a series of novel stable and low cost organic molecules have been developed and used in a customized PU resins in order to obtain both tailored <b>UV-screening</b> and current improvement effect (down shifting without self absorption) in silicon solar cells. The general approach presented in this contribution to simultaneously improve performance and weatherability of photovoltaic devices may be readily extended to a large variety of sensitizer/luminophore combinations with appropriate spectral match as well as to the nascent world of perovskite solar cells, the instability to humidity and near-UV radiation of which represents one of the major problems currently under intense investigatio...|$|E
40|$|Life {{on earth}} can be dated {{back to some}} 3. 8 billion years, and several lines of {{evidence}} suggest {{that the level of}} atmospheric oxygen was very low even 2. 45 billion years ago, but then started to accumulate rapidly. However only for the past 500 million years has the atmosphere been “fully oxygenated”, i. e. with an O 2 -concentration close to the present 20 %, which coincides with the development of large and complex life forms. The sun emits short-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that is potentially harmful to life. While the present atmosphere absorbs all UV-C (< 280 nm), also the present biota face harmful levels of UV-B (280 – 320 nm) and UV-A (320 – 400 nm). It has been assumed that the evolution of higher life forms was linked with the establishment of a stratospheric ozone layer and thus a screening of UVR. This may not necessarily have been the case since also methane-derived organic hazes, sulfur vapour or aldehydes could have <b>UV-screening</b> properties. It is nevertheless reasonable to assume that early life for periods may have been at the edge of “mutatio...|$|E
40|$|UV-B {{radiation}} damage in leaves is prevented by epidermal <b>UV-screening</b> compounds {{that can be}} modulated throughout ontogeny. In epiphytic orchids, roots need to be protected against UV-B because they photosynthesize, sometimes even replacing the leaves. How orchid roots, which are covered by a dead tissue called velamen, avoid UV-B radiation is currently unknown. We tested for a UV-B protective function of the velamen using gene expression analyses, mass spectrometry, histochemistry, and chlorophyll fluorescence in Phalaenopsisxhybrida roots. We also investigated its evolution using comparative phylogenetic methods. Our data show that two paralogues of the chalcone synthase (CHS) gene family are UV-B-induced in orchid root tips, triggering the accumulation of two UV-B-absorbing flavonoids and resulting in effective protection of the photosynthetic root cortex. Phylogenetic and dating analyses imply that the two CHS lineages duplicated c. 100 million yr before the rise of epiphytic orchids. These findings indicate an additional role for the epiphytic orchid velamen previously thought to function solely in absorbing water and nutrients. This new function, which fundamentally differs from the mechanism of UV-B avoidance in leaves, arose following an ancient duplication of CHS, and has probably contributed to the family's expansion into the canopy during the Cenozoic...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{predicted}} to affect the biota of high latitudes first and most severely, and significant changes in temperature and wind speed have already been observed {{in parts of the}} Antarctic. Similarly, springtime ozone depletion since the late 1970 s has led to an increase in potentially mutagenic UV-B radiation over the Antarctic, and elevated mutation rates have been reported for several Antarctic moss species. This thesis explores the resilience of Antarctic mosses to the effects of elevated UV-B radiation and climate change, with special reference to populations of the cosmopolitan moss Ceratodon purpureus from the Windmill Islands region, East Antarctica. Radiocarbon analyses were used to determine the growth rates of seven moss shoot ‘cores’ representing four species, including C. purpureus, from the Windmill Islands and Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. My results show that the oldest core sections predate the 1960 s peak in atmospheric 14 C due to nuclear testing, indicating average growth rates between 0. 6 and 1. 3 mm yr- 1. This is the first study to describe the profile of the 1960 s 14 C bomb-pulse in Antarctic plants and importantly radiocarbon results indicate that individual colonies are more than 50 years old and that growth rates have varied significantly over this time. These data allow the influence of environmental variables on growth rates and water relations of Antarctic mosses to be explored over time periods not possible using other techniques. Correlation analysis was used to determine whether growth rate and  13 C of three C. purpureus and one Bryoerythrophyllum recurvirostre core from East Antarctica were associated with year-to-year variations in summer temperature, wind speed and stratospheric ozone depth over a 40 year period. Temperature was positively correlated with growth rate in all cores (r= 0. 22 to 0. 61), whereas the  13 C data indicated temperature and wind speed were consistently positively (r= 0. 20 to 0. 74) and negatively (r=- 0. 14 to - 0. 67) correlated with water availability, respectively. Correlations of ozone depth with growth rate and  13 C varied between cores and may be driven by covariance of ozone depth with wind speed and temperature. The significant positive correlation between  13 C and growth rate indicates that growth of C. purpureus is water-limited. Warming and increased precipitation predicted for the Antarctic over the 21 st century are likely to increase moss growth rates, whereas the already observed increase in wind speeds may reduce water availability and negatively impact the growth of these mosses. The timing and balance between the positive influence of warming and the negative influence of high wind speeds may determine the fate of East Antarctic moss communities. Previous studies of Antarctic clonal moss populations using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA markers have described extraordinarily high levels of variation in banding profiles within single colonies. This has been claimed to reflect somatic mutation, possibly resulting from elevated UV-B radiation due to the Antarctic ozone hole. I used microsatellite markers to compare the genetic variation present within continental Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and temperate C. purpureus populations and in contrast to previous studies found no evidence of elevated mutation rates in the Antarctic samples. Indeed continental Antarctic C. purpureus displays significantly less intra-population genetic diversity than populations from sub-Antarctic and temperate sites. Moreover, continental Antarctic sites displayed greater levels of allelic differentiation (PT= 0. 205, P= 0. 001) than temperate sites (e. g. PT= 0. 006, P= 0. 34), suggesting that they are less interconnected by gene flow than lower latitude sites and are effectively closed to immigration. However, a more in-depth analysis of the distribution of genotypes within the Windmill Islands suggests that individual genotypes have dispersed over more than ten kilometres, and indeed that some propagules originate outside the region. Taken together these results imply that climate change will present ongoing challenges for continental Antarctic moss populations with less potential than temperate populations to adapt to environmental change. Previous studies of UV-induced DNA damage in the three moss species that occur in the Windmill Islands have shown C. purpureus to be the most UV-tolerant although it possesses lower concentrations of methanol soluble <b>UV-screening</b> compounds than the co-occurring Bryum pseudotriquetrum. I used alkali extraction of cell wall-bound phenolics combined with methanol extraction of soluble phenolics to determine whether higher levels of cell wall-bound UV-screens could explain the greater UV tolerance of C. purpureus. The combined pool of UV-screens was similar in C. purpureus and B. pseudotriquetrum but whilst B. pseudotriquetrum had equal concentrations of MeOH-soluble and alkali-extractable cell wall-bound <b>UV-screening</b> compounds, C. purpureus had almost six times the concentration of cell wall-bound compared to MeOH-soluble UV-screens, offering this species a more uniform and potentially more effective UV screen. The Antarctic endemic Schistidium antarctici possessed half the combined pool of UV-screens of the other species, indicating this species may be disadvantaged under continuing springtime ozone depletion. These data suggest that while cell wall compounds have not previously been quantified in bryophytes they may be {{an important component of the}} UV defences of lower plants. The wide distribution of C. purpureus provided the opportunity to test whether moss colonies growing in different UV environments differ in their UV tolerance. I tested the hypothesis that sun forms from different UV environments (Wollongong, Australia and Lake Waiau, Hawaii) and sun and shade forms (Wollongong) differ in their UV tolerance by using chlorophyll fluorescence to compare the photosynthetic health of C. purpureus from each site over a four hour UV irradiation. Photosynthetic and <b>UV-screening</b> compound concentrations were compared between Australian and Hawaiian C. purpureus in an attempt to explain variations in UV tolerance. The effective yield of PSII photochemistry declined by 50 % in the UV-treated Wollongong shade samples, significantly more than the 25 % decline in the Wollongong sun samples, but no difference was found in the response of the two sun forms, despite an almost two-fold greater annual UV flux at the Hawaiian site. Ceratodon purpureus colonies from Australia, Hawaii and Antarctica have similar concentrations of <b>UV-screening</b> compounds, indicating production of <b>UV-screening</b> compounds may be constitutive in this species. Observed differences in UV tolerance appear to reflect acclimation rather than adaptation, which may benefit Antarctic C. purpureus as its life history reduces its capacity for adaptive change in response to recent changes in the UV environment. In conclusion, Antarctic C. purpureus is slow growing, long-lived and well protected from current levels of UV-B but potentially vulnerable to other disturbances, such as changes in water availability. Furthermore, Antarctic C. purpureus populations are weakly interconnected by gene flow and display low genetic diversity compared to populations from temperate and sub-Antarctic sites, reducing their capacity for adaptive change in the face of predicted regional climate change...|$|E
40|$|Mycosporine-like {{amino acids}} (MAAs) and scytonemin are <b>UV-screening</b> {{compounds}} that have presumably appeared {{early in the}} history of life and are widespread in cyanobacteria. Natural colonies of the UV-insensitive Nostoc flagelliforme were found to be especially rich in MAAs (32. 1 mg g DW- 1), concentrated in the glycan sheath together with scytonemin. MAAs are present in the form of oligosaccharide-linked molecules. Photosystem II activity, measured using PAM fluorescence and oxygen evolution, was used as a most sensitive physiological parameter to analyse the effectiveness of UV-protection. Laboratory experiments were performed under controlled conditions with a simulated solar radiation specifically deprived of UV-wavebands with cut-off filters (295, 305, 320, 345 and 395 nm). The UV-insensitivity of N. flagelliforme was found to cover the whole UV-A (315 – 400 nm) and UV-B (280 – 320 nm) range and is almost certainly due to the complementary UV-absorption of MAAs and scytonemin. The experimental approach used is proposed to be suitable for the comparison of the UV-protection ability in organisms that differ in their complement of UV-sunscreen compounds. Furthermore, this study performed with a genuinely terrestrial organism points to the relevance of marine photoprotective compounds for life on Earth, especially for the colonization of terrestrial environments...|$|E
40|$|Ceratodon purpureus is a {{cosmopolitan}} moss that survives {{some of the}} harshest places on Earth: from frozen Antarctica to hot South Australian deserts. In {{a study on the}} survival mechanisms of the species, nine compounds were isolated from Australian and Antarctic C. purpureus. This included five biflavonoids, with complete structural elucidation of 1 and 2 reported here for the first time, as well as an additional four known phenolic compounds. Dispersion-corrected DFT calculations suggested a rotational barrier, leading to atropisomerism, resulting in the presence of diastereomers for compound 2. All isolates absorbed strongly in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, e. g., biflavone 1 (UV-A, 315 - 400 nm), which displayed the strongest radical-scavenging activity, 13 % more efficient than the standard rutin; p-coumaric acid and trans-ferulic acid showed the highest UV-B (280 - 315 nm) absorption. The more complex and abundant 1 and 2 presumably have dual roles as both <b>UV-screening</b> and antioxidant compounds. They are strongly bound to Antarctic moss cell walls as well as located inside the cells of moss from both locations. The combined high stability and photoprotective abilities of these isolates may account for the known resilience of this species to UV-B radiation and its survival in some of the toughest locations in the world...|$|E
40|$|Devaleraea ramentacea {{represents}} one of the few red macroalgal species endemic to the Arctic. Previous unifactorial experiments revealed a generally high tolerance of D. ramentacea to variation in abiotic conditions. Although in the field the effects of photosynthetically active (PAR) and UV-radiation, temperature and salinity are usually interconnected, studies on interactive effects on its physiology are scarce. Mesocosm-experiments under natural solar radiation as well as laboratory set-ups under defined, artificial radiation conditions were conducted at Spitsbergen in order to reveal physiological responses of D. ramentacea under multiple abiotic stress. The algae were exposed to experimental treatments with/without UV-radiation, at three different water temperatures and at different salinities. In each treatment, photosynthetic performance was monitored by PAM chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and algal fragments were conserved for later biochemical analysis. Photosynthetic measurements confirm the high tolerance of adult sporophytes of D. ramentacea towards single and combined stress factors. Experimentally induced changes in the content of <b>UV-screening</b> mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA) and the enzymatic activity of superoxid-dimutase were studied. A specific characteristic of D. ramentacea under changing abiotic conditions is the greening of the tips. The factors inducing the loss of phycobiliproteins and the changes in physiological performance in the affected thallus fragments are addressed.

The biological samples were integrated in the EXPOSE-E facility and exposed for 1. 5 years outside the ISS to the combined impact of insolation, ultraviolet (UV) -irradiation, cosmic radiation, temperatures and vacuum conditions of LEO space. Additionally, a subset of X. elegans samples was exposed to simulated Martian environmental conditions by applying Mars-analogue atmosphere and suitable solar radiation filters. After their return to Earth the viability of the lichen samples was ascertained by viability analysis of LIVE/DEAD staining and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, but also by analyses of chlorophyll a fluorescence. According to the LIVE/DEAD staining results, the lichen photobiont showed an average viability rate of 71 %, whereas the even more resistant lichen mycobiont showed a rate of 84 %. Post-exposure viability rates did not significantly vary among the applied exposure conditions.

Spectrotometric (UV-VIS, NIR, FTIR, MS, NMR) and chromatographic (HPTLC) standardized techniques were utilized to identify the lichen compounds. UVB radiation in the glacier zone (5000 m) revealed a value of ~ 3 W m- 2 which is sufficient to produce important biochemical and cell alterations. Of a total of 25 lichen species distributed in the glacier and snow zones, 68 % showed the presence of phenolic compounds having strong absorption for UVC radiation, 96 % had strong absorption for UVB radiation and 100 % had strong absorption for UVA radiation. The substance groups that had the highest resistance to UVA and UVB radiation were characterized by ester bonds among both phenolic units (depsides). They were the most abundant products to be found among the lichens, whereas substances having ester and ether bonds in both phenolic units (depsidones) had a higher capacity to absorb UVC radiation.

Greenhouse-grown pumpkin leaves were pretreated with lincomycin to block the repair of photoinhibited PSII, and exposed to sunlight behind a UV-permeable or UV-blocking fi lter. Oxygen evolution and Chl fl uorescence measurements showed that photoinhibition proceeds 35 % more slowly under the UV-blocking than under the UV-permeable fi lter. Experiments with a fi lter that blocks UV-B but transmits UV-A and visible light revealed that UV-A light is almost fully responsible for the UV effect. The difference between leaves illuminated through a UV-blocking and UV-transparent fi lter disappeared when leaves of fi eld-grown pumpkin plants were used. Thylakoids isolated from fi eld-grown and greenhouse-grown plants were equally sensitive to UV light, and measurements of UV-induced fl uorescence from leaves indicated that the protection of the fi eld-grown plants was caused by substances that block the passage of UV light to the chloroplasts. Thus, the UV part of sunlight, especially the UV-A part, is potentially highly important in photoinhibition of PSII but the <b>UV-screening</b> compounds of plant leaves may offer almost complete protection against UV-induced photoinhibition...|$|E
