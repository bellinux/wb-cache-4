40|$|<b>Boreal</b> <b>owls</b> Aegolius funereus (referred to as Tengmalm’s owls in Europe) {{breed in}} boreal forests {{throughout}} the Holarctic region and in high-elevation subalpine forests further south. They are currently classified as seven subspecies; six found throughout Eurasia, {{and one in}} North America. The geographic distribution of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in North America and Eurasia is similar, as are their patterns of dispersal and irruption. Because a recent genetic study of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in North America found very little genetic differentiation among widely disparate locations, we expected that <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in Eurasia similarly would have very little genetic differentiation. Using seven microsatellite markers, we analyzed genetic samples from 275 <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in North America, 36 in Norway, and five in eastern Russia. We found no detectable genetic differentiation between Norwegian and Russian owls, but notable differentiation between North American and Eurasian owls. Low intra-continental genetic differentiation likely results from high rates of long-distance dispersal among subpopulations of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls.</b> In light of these results, we recommend further genetic sampling of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> throughout Eurasia {{in order to determine}} whether six separate subspecies here are warranted...|$|R

40|$|A habitat {{suitability}} index (HSI) model {{based on}} scientific literature and expert opinion {{was developed for}} the <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> (Aegolius funereus) in western Newfoundland, Canada. Preliminary analyses conducted on the model suggested outputs were most sensitive to variation in home range size, foraging radius, and density of living and dead stems in nesting areas. Over a 2 -yr period data were collected on 307 winter point count locations and nine <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> home ranges using radio telemetry to examine habitat use and test the HSI model. Owls were detected at 24 % of point count locations during two breeding seasons. Home range sizes during breeding varied with a median range of 429 ha. Log-ratio compositional analyses of roost locations and home ranges indicated that <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> do not occupy these sites at random. For roost locations, owls selected old and young softwood stands and avoided bogs, disturbed stands and scrub. Owl home ranges favored old softwood and disturbed stands and avoided old mixedwood and hardwood stands. HSI values produced by the original model {{did not differ significantly}} from those updated with local data on home range size. While owls were not occupying sites at random based on HSI values, the model was not able to predict <b>boreal</b> <b>owl</b> presence at levels better than chance alone. The HSI model failed to produce values greater than 0. 60 (out of 1. 00) suggesting that input values from the literature for other parts of the <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> range may not be reflective of habitat suitability for <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> in Newfoundland. Further research is needed to address knowledge gaps about parameters identified as sensitive (nesting habitat and nest tree availability). The island of Newfoundland may also contain far less suitable habitat than other comparable areas of North America, or <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> in Newfoundland may be less habitat-specific than previously thought...|$|R

During nocturnal surveys, 42 individual <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> singing territories were located. Vegetation was sampled at 0. 04 ha plots surrounding <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> song perches. Identical measurements were taken at one random plot, which was paired with a song plot. The majority (93 %) of song perches were located in coniferous species. <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> song sites had high basal area of both live and dead trees, higher percent coniferous canopy and a taller overstory canopy than those of random locations. Using Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery, I compared the proportion of 13 land cover classes within 100 m (3. 13 ha), 500 m (78. 14 ha), 1000 m (312. 57 ha), 2000 m (1, 256. 27 ha), and 5000 m (7, 814. 17 ha) radii concentric circular plots surrounding cavity trees (N = 31) with random locations (N = 41) distributed throughout the SNF.

30|$|Results of {{this study}} {{indicate}} that <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> females tried to compensate for the failure of their mates to perform parental tasks but were unable to successfully compensate for insufficient mate provisioning when brooding was obligatory. Similarly, Eldegard and Sonerud (2009) reported a brood where the male deserted and the female deserted shortly thereafter. One of our females, however, although widowed when the oldest chick was 21 days old, managed to fledge one chick. In other raptors, some examples of a parent successfully raising the young alone without his/her mate were also reported (Bowman and Bird 1987; Kunstmüller 1994, 1995, 2010; Peške, unpublished data on Sparrowhawks). Our findings indicate that the stage of the nesting phase can influence whether or not a <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> female provides single-parent care. Because successful offspring desertion by female <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> (in the late nesting phase) and male-only care are positively related to food abundance (Eldegard and Sonerud 2009; Zárybnická 2009 a; Korpimäki et al. 2011), the responses of female owls to low male food provisioning may vary in different environments and particularly under fluctuating food conditions. Similarly, female Eurasian Kestrels Falco tinnunculus and Northern Goshawks Accipiter gentilis adjust hunting efforts and nest attendance to the abundance of their main prey (Tolonen and Korpimäki 1994; Dewey and Kennedy 2001; Riegert et al. 2007). Unfortunately, we have no data to compare female-only parental care in <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> under different food availability levels.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} late summer abundance of small rodents and fall migrant abundance of two nocturnal avian predators, the <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> (Aegolius funereus) and the Northern Saw-whet Owl (A. acadicus), during their fall movement/migration. In the eastern Canadian <b>boreal</b> forest, <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> are considered resident (with irruptive movements to the south thought to occur during periods of low prey availability), and Northern Saw-whet Owls migratory. Data on late summer abundance of small rodents collected between 1995 and 2004 were used to develop an index of prey availability. Data on the number and age of irrupting/migrating owls were collected between 1996 - 2004 (mid-September to late October) using audiolures and mist nets. Our study revealed strong evidence of (1) a negative relationship between the abundance of small rodents and movement of <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> and (2) {{a positive relationship between}} the abundance of small rodents and the number of migrating juveniles and second year Northern Saw-whet Owls. In the latter case, it suggests that prey availability can strongly influence breeding success of this species, which is at the northern limit of its breeding range...|$|R

30|$|We found a {{total of}} 12 (16 %) <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owl</b> nests that failed due to food scarcity; four of these nests were {{monitored}} by the camera. At these camera nests, males were absent or provided food at a low rate. In good vole years, the reproductive period of <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> begins approximately 1 month earlier; clutch sizes are larger than in poor vole years, and 10 % to 20 % of males are polygynous (Korpimäki 1991; Korpimäki and Hakkarainen 1991, 2012). Although polygynous males usually provide sufficiently for their first nests, the breeding success of their secondary nests is poor (Korpimäki 1991). In our study, one polygynous male sufficiently fed its first family (the nest monitored by a camera), but its second nest failed because of food scarcity. We suggest that nests that failed due to food scarcity {{might have been the}} second nests of polygynous males.|$|R
