5|$|Clark, {{a former}} {{solicitor}} with <b>UNISON,</b> joined the Labour Party {{at the age}} of 17. She was elected to the House of Commons as the MP for North Ayrshire and Arran in the 2005 general election. The Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald reported that as a parliamentarian, she developed a reputation as a party rebel who, {{at the time of the}} leadership contest, had most recently voted against British participation in the 2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. She won the support of <b>UNISON</b> after announcing her intention to enter the deputy leadership contest, and was also backed by the Communication Workers' Union, Unite, the GMB, and the Musicians' Union.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{movement}} {{is the second}} aria of the cantata, scored for soprano with an obbligato accompaniment provided by the two recorders playing in <b>unison.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hansell {{commanded}} the 1st Wing during six critical months when the B-17 force, with only four inexperienced groups, struggled to prove itself. Among the combat doctrines that Hansell developed himself or approved were {{use of the}} defensive combat box formation, detailed mission Standard Operating Procedures, and all aircraft bombing in <b>unison</b> with the lead bomber, each designed to improve bombing accuracy.|$|E

5|$|In addition, larger organs may use <b>unison</b> off couplers, {{which prevent}} the stops pulled in a {{particular}} division from sounding at their normal pitch. These {{can be used in}} combination with octave couplers to create innovative aural effects, and {{can also be used to}} rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.|$|E
5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in <b>unison</b> on them.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in Ancient Greece, {{homophony}} indicated {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in <b>unison</b> or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices. Homophony as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} and characteristic playing techniques for the Welsh triple harp is that of <b>unisons</b> or [...] "Split doubling". The effect of <b>unisons</b> is obtained by playing the same note on both the outside rows using the right and left hands in rapid succession. Thus a progression of e.g., C-D-F-E, is achieved by playing CC-DD-FF-EE.|$|R
5000|$|Mandolin - 4 {{pairs of}} identically tuned strings, {{as opposed to}} octaves and <b>unisons</b> on the 12-string guitar.|$|R
5000|$|... 12 string guitar - Six {{pairs of}} strings tuned in octaves and <b>unisons</b> create a {{distinctive}} complex shimmer.|$|R
5|$|On April 18, 1865, the {{garrison}} at Fort Corcoran {{participated in a}} national salute to President Lincoln, who had been assassinated four days prior. At sunset, all ten guns at Fort Corcoran fired in <b>unison</b> with the guns of Fort Lincoln, Alexandria, and Camp Barry.|$|E
5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in <b>unison,</b> and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E
5|$|The second aria is {{accompanied}} by the strings and the two oboes da caccia in <b>unison</b> as obbligato instruments, thus both arias are dominated by instruments with a relatively low range (oboes de caccia having a pitch below that of a normal oboe).|$|E
5000|$|Avoid {{parallel}} perfect intervals such as parallel <b>unisons,</b> parallel 5ths {{and parallel}} octaves between any two voices to promote voice independence.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to this kind of}} usage, harmonic augmented <b>unisons</b> are frequently written in modern works involving tone clusters, such as Iannis Xenakis' Evryali for piano solo.|$|R
50|$|The Puerto Rican cuatro spans five courses, {{tuned in}} fourths from low to high B-e-a-d'-g',54321, with B and E in octaves and A, D and G in <b>unisons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the music}} video, Aguilera portrays her alter ego Baby Jane, a {{nickname}} that Nelly once gave her. The narrative scenes are punctuated by shots of two trombonists playing the Dave Cortez brass sample in <b>unison.</b> The video depicts {{a mix of}} styles from the 1920s, as well as modern.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects artist Aaron Juntunen {{copied the}} visuals from the Beat-Beat Revelation dance tracks from Dance Dance Revolution by using {{computer}} graphics. The tracks were played live, allowing the actors to dance in <b>unison.</b> Visual effects {{were also used}} to cover the name of Dawn's Liquor Mart, as the actual location did not give the production permission to use its name and logo.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in <b>unison.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Augmented <b>unisons</b> {{often appear}} as a {{consequence}} of secondary dominants, such as those in the soprano voice of this sequence from Felix Mendelssohn's Song Without Words Op. 102 No. 3, mm. 47-49.|$|R
50|$|In short, similar {{differences}} in width are observed for all interval types, except for <b>unisons</b> and octaves, {{and they are}} all multiples of ε, the difference between the Pythagorean fifth and the average fifth.|$|R
50|$|<b>UNISON's</b> current general {{secretary}} is Dave Prentis. He was elected on 28 February 2000 {{and took up}} the post on 1 January 2001, succeeding Rodney Bickerstaffe who had held the post for five years.|$|R
5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in <b>unison.</b> This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the planets}} in the Solar System have {{secondary}} systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury), and, {{in the case of}} the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in <b>unison.</b> Most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in <b>unison,</b> and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
50|$|In short, similar {{differences}} in width are observed for all interval types, except for <b>unisons</b> and octaves, {{and they are}} all multiples of ε, the difference between the quarter-comma meantone fifth and the average fifth.|$|R
50|$|He joined NALGO in 1975. In 1990, {{he became}} the deputy general {{secretary}}. He was the <b>UNISON's</b> deputy general secretary (DGS) since its formation in July 1993, when it was formed from NALGO, NUPE and CoHSE.|$|R
50|$|Within a {{diatonic}} scale, <b>unisons</b> and octaves {{are always}} qualified as perfect, fourths as either perfect or augmented, fifths as perfect or diminished, {{and all the}} other intervals (seconds, thirds, sixths, sevenths) as major or minor.|$|R
5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds {{was so great that}} The Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, {{so much so that the}} band members were unable to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments. As a result, they were unable to count songs in or perform in <b>unison.</b>|$|E
5|$|Possibly due to {{the speed}} at which she was constructed, Tsukuba {{reportedly}} suffered from numerous defects. Shortly after she was completed in 1907, the ship sailed for America where she participated in the Jamestown Exposition Naval Review in May. The ship then sailed to Europe where she made numerous port visits over the next several months. While in Britain, Tsukuba was fitted with a Vickers fire-control system that calculated the firing data for each gun and with which the gunnery officer fired the guns in <b>unison.</b> Ikoma visited England in July 1910 as part of the Japan–British Exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The Passing Zone {{made its}} first {{appearance}} during season 1 of America's Got Talent, {{as part of the}} Chicago auditions aired on July 5, 2006. Wee bounced a rubber (prop) bowling ball off of Morse's face ("to make sure you're paying attention"), then climbed onto Morse's shoulders while Morse balanced on a Rola Bola long enough for the duo to juggle a total of six flaming torches in <b>unison.</b> The judges' assessments were not unanimous; David Hasselhoff rejected them ("That's the act?!") while Brandy and Piers Morgan wanted to see more.|$|E
50|$|The Beauty of Scale (made {{possible}} through a research {{grant from the}} Royal Academy of Music) explores the standard scales and contains chapters on alternative scales such as pizzicato, <b>unisons,</b> 4ths and 7ths, and also on how to practise scales.|$|R
5000|$|The All About Jazz {{review by}} John Sharpe notes that [...] "Interlocking riffs, tricky <b>unisons</b> and ostinatos {{organically}} develop into ambient improv type structures in a largely continuous {{program in which}} atmospheric episodes alternate with more driving solo laden passages." ...|$|R
5000|$|To correct {{out of tune}} chords, first {{verify the}} <b>unisons,</b> octaves, perfect forth and perfect fifth {{intervals}} are keenly locked and in tune before correcting {{the other parts of}} chords; verify the vowels are also perfectly matched with good vocal production.|$|R
