50|$|The {{most basic}} {{technique}} is the ladder. To capture stones in <b>a</b> <b>ladder,</b> <b>a</b> player uses <b>a</b> constant series <b>of</b> capture threats—called atari—to force the opponent into a zigzag pattern {{as shown in}} the adjacent diagram. Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way, the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture. Experienced players recognize the futility of continuing the pattern and play elsewhere. The presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>ladder</b> on the board does give a player the option to play a stone {{in the path of the}} ladder, thereby threatening to rescue their stones, forcing a response. Such a move is called <b>a</b> <b>ladder</b> breaker and may be a powerful strategic move. In the diagram, Black has the option <b>of</b> playing <b>a</b> <b>ladder</b> breaker.|$|R
