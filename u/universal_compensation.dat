40|$|A {{number of}} {{methods have been}} studied and {{compared}} for their robustness for speaker verification using noisy speech samples. The methods include Wiener filtering, noise compensation, missing-feature technique, <b>universal</b> <b>compensation,</b> and their combinations. Strategies for combining different techniques are investigated, {{as a means of}} further improving noise robustness. A handheld-device database, collected in realistic conditions with noise corruption and transducer mismatch between training and testing, is used in the study. The various techniques and proposed combinations are compared within the same feature and model framework for characterizing the speakers. The experimental results indicate that: 1) usual noise filtering and noise compensation provided very limited robustness to noise corruption, and 2) the proposed technique combinations offered significantly improved noise robustness. 1...|$|E
40|$|Myosin {{in adult}} murine {{skeletal}} muscle is composed primarily of three adult fast myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. These isoforms, MyHC-IIa, -IId, and -IIb, are > 93 % identical at the amino acid level and are broadly expressed in numerous muscles, and their genes are tightly linked. Mice with a null mutation in the MyHC-IId gene have phenotypes that include growth inhibition, muscle weakness, histological abnormalities, kyphosis (spinal curvature), and aberrant kinetics of muscle contraction and relaxation. Despite {{the lack of}} MyHC-IId, IId null mice have normal amounts of myosin in their muscles because of compensation by the MyHC-IIa gene. In each muscle examined from IId null mice, {{there was an increase}} in MyHC-IIa– containing fibers. MyHC-IIb content was unaffected in all muscles except the masseter, where its expression was extinguished in the IId null mice. Cross-sectional fiber areas, total muscle cross-sectional area, and total fiber number were affected in ways particular to each muscle. Developmental expression of adult MyHC genes remained unchanged in IId null mice. Despite this <b>universal</b> <b>compensation</b> of MyHC-IIa expression, IId null mice have severe phenotypes. We conclude that despite the similarity in sequence, MyHC-IIa and -IId have unique roles in the development and function of skeletal muscle...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of speaker {{identification}} and verification in noisy conditions, assuming that speech signals are corrupted by environmental noise but knowledge about the noise characteristics is not available. This research is motivated {{in part by the}} potential application of speaker recognition technologies on handheld devices or the Internet. While the technologies promise an additional biometric layer of security to protect the user, the practical implementation of such systems faces many challenges. One of these is environmental noise. Due to the mobile nature of such systems, the noise sources can be highly time-varying and potentially unknown. This raises the requirement for noise robustness in the absence of information of the noise. This paper describes a method, named <b>universal</b> <b>compensation</b> (UC), that combines multi-condition training and the missing-feature method to model noises with unknown temporal-spectral characteristics. Multi-condition training is conducted using simulated noisy data with limited noise varieties, providing a “coarse ” compensation for the noise, and the missing-feature method refines the compensation by ignoring noise variations outside the given training conditions, thereby reducing the training and testing mismatch. This paper is focused on several issues relating to the implementation of the UC model for real-world applications. These include the generatio...|$|E

The dominant historical discourses in both countriees are analyzed on the basis of restitution legislation and procedures and public debates. The latter saw the emergence of various historical narratives of victimhood, constructed around memories of different historical injustices, and justifying or opposing claims for restitution or compensation for lost property. The thesis compares restitution claims made by various groups of former owners expropriated during several waves of property revolutions in the twentieth century: property issues related to the post-war forced population transfers, property issues related to the Holocaust, the claims of the former aristocracy and the landed gentry, and, finally, those of the Catholic Church. The analysis shows that the dynamics of restitution and memory were for the most part determined by the general processes of {{coming to terms with the}} communist past, and demonstrates that memories of communism have influenced the processes of dealing with World War II. In both national cases it is possible to identify dominant memory discourses that shaped the dynamics of restitution debates. In the Czech Republic, there was a condemnation of communist crimes presupposing the principle of compensation for past wrongdoing, while in Poland the idea of property restitution was rejected on the basis of arguments relating to universal victimhood and the impossibility of <b>universal</b> <b>compensation.</b> In both countries the different narratives were legitimized by law. In the Czech case this came in the form of the adoption of restitution laws at the beginning of the 1990 s, while in Poland the situation was marked by legislative silence and far-reaching legal continuity with the communist legal order...|$|E

The accuracy of the ADC {{as a function of}} its parameters is analyzed and impact of various imperfections of ADC components on its operation is evaluated. A <b>universal</b> error <b>compensation</b> algorithm for improving the conversion accuracy is proposed. On the way to implementation of the integrated optical ADC, two of its critical components - ring resonator filter bank and fiber-to-chip coupler -are designed.

40|$|Please note: This {{article is}} in Greek. Dionysios Solomos and Pierre Hyacinthe Azais: Pierre Hyacinthe Azais, a French philosopher and {{musician}} {{who lived in}} 1766 – 1845, {{was one of the}} philosophers the work of whom had been studied by the Greek poet Dionysios Solomos. His fundamental principles regarding the <b>universal</b> equilibrium, the <b>compensation</b> theory which balances human happiness, the unity of the universe and its relation to the human soul, are developed in his two main works Des compensations dans les destinées humaines (1808) and Explication Universelle (1809 – 1812), whereas his acoustic theory is imprinted in his articles titled “Acoustique fondamentale”, which were published in Revue Musicale (1831 – 1832). In our paper we will discuss some of the references of the name and the philosophical theory of Azais in Solomos’ Αυτόγραφα. The theoretical discussion will be based on specific examples from Solomos’ poetical practice, where the fruitful way in which the Greek poet assimilated the theoretical work of the French philosopher, can be detected...|$|R
40|$|Parasites with {{exclusive}} {{vertical transmission}} from host parent to offspring are an evolutionary puzzle. Any fitness costs for infected hosts risk the selective elimination of these parasites because their fitness {{is linked to}} host reproduction. One of the main evolutionary transitions from parasitism towards beneficial or mutualistic associations may therefore encompass a change from horizontal transmission to vertical transmission. In this thesis, the experimental evolution study on Paramecium and Holospora supports this hypothesis. The parasite nearly entirely lost horizontal transmission capacity in a treatment favouring vertical transmission and low virulence. However, many vertically transmitted parasites e. g. Caedibacter taeniospiralis impose detectable costs to their hosts. This endosymbiont imposes context-dependent costs to its host Paramecium tetraurelia. Fitness of infected paramecia was reduced in resource-limited conditions at all experimentally tested temperatures (16 - 32 °C). These universal fitness costs along the temperature gradient necessitate <b>universal</b> cost <b>compensation</b> that can be the ‘killer trait’ that eliminates uninfected competitors. At acute heat stress the loss of infection indicates that cost compensation is impossible, thereby restricting conditions for parasite persistence. Surprisingly, the parasite persists in permanent stress and optimal temperature conditions. Caedibacter was able to adapt to high temperature conditions by increasing its number in the populations but without reducing virulence in high temperature conditions. Acute and intense stress harms the parasite and causes its extinction but the parasite was able to evolve and adapt to stress conditions. Moreover, the parasite reacts exactly {{in the opposite direction}} as it was expected. They do not suffer from stressful conditions, they benefit...|$|R
40|$|A <b>universal</b> phase {{mismatch}} <b>compensation</b> method, {{which can}} be applied to temperature-insensitive frequency conversion, is experimentally demonstrated. In this method, two nonlinear crystals and an electro-optic crystal are cascaded. The generated phase mismatch in the nonlinear crystal can be well compensated for in the electro-optic crystal, thereby improving the stability of frequency conversion. In the proof-of-principle experiment, temperature-insensitive second and third harmonic generation (SHG and THG) are investigated by cascading KH 2 PO 4 (KDP) and KD 2 PO 4 (DKDP) crystals. The experimental results show that the temperature acceptance bandwidths of SHG and THG are 2. 1 and 2. 3 times larger, respectively, than that of the traditional method employing a single crystal. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of this method is also analyzed at a high power density, and a solution for the case of a nonuniform temperature is also discussed. Furthermore, angle-insensitive SHG is demonstrated to prove that this method can significantly reduce the influence of various unfavorable factors on frequency conversion. The demonstrated method may have potentially important applications in the nonlinear optical frequency conversion system. ? 2016 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the main theoretical elements and empirical underpinnings of executive compensation system designs. It is argued that the components affecting CEO pay studied up to today including e. g. company size, performance, industry, and ownership structure are not enough to explain the differences observed in international executive pay. Thus, the analysis is expanded to take into consideration also geographical and cultural influences. In this study geographical distance is measured at the continent level whereas Hofstede's cultural country scores are used to proxy cultural aspects. The study is realized as archival research with a sample of 120 observations from 10 countries and 6 industries. The countries included are Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, The United Kingdom and The United States. The industries included are energy, telecom & information technology, machinery, commercial, transport, and chemicals & pharmaceuticals. The compensation data was gathered from the webpages of the companies and the company specific control data from the Orbis database. The data was analysed with statistical methods using SPSS. The results are surprising by nature and challenge the sole reliance on agency theory and agency costs of debt theory in the field of executive compensation: the study indicates that the rational explanations such as company size, profitability, industry, and capital structure often offered to explain the determination of executive pay actually explain only {{a very small percentage of}} the international differences observed in executive compensation practices and in the use of share-based pay systems. On the contrary, the results suggest executive compensation relies very much on geographical and cultural considerations and as a consequence it seems there is no <b>universal</b> fit-for-all <b>compensation</b> practice that can be developed. Thus, this study gives indication against the recent suggestions towards a convergence of executive compensation...|$|R

In {{a variety of}} vertebrates capable of color vision, longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) of the optical system is corrected for by the exactly tuned longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA) of the crystalline lens. The LSA leads to multiple focal lengths, such that several wavelengths can {{be focused on the}} retina.

It was found that the lens of W. scintillans is virtually free of LSA and uncorrected for LCA. However, the eye does not suffer from LCA because of a banked retina. Photoreceptors sensitive to short and long wavelengths are located at appropriate distances from the lens, such that they receive well-focused images. Such a design is an excellent solution for the firefly squid because a large area of the retina is monochromatically organized and it allows for double use of the surface area in the dichromatically organized part of the retina. However, it is not a <b>universal</b> solution since <b>compensation</b> for LCA by a banked retina requires that eye size and/or spectral separation between photopigments is small...|$|R
