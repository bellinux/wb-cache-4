5|$|Jean-Michel Jarre {{was born}} in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to France Pejot, a French Resistance member and {{concentration}} camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. When Jarre was five, his parents split <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father moved to America, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first record player. From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young French boy was able to watch street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males {{mate with}} the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female {{fertility}} by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step {{process known as}} the flehmen response. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> front legs resting on the female's sides.|$|E

However within months it had dried <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> camp was in despair for want of water. The site at Risdon Cove was badly affect by inconsistent water supply, and stagnation of the inlet during the late summer.|$|E

25|$|After {{reorganization}} at Team Penske in 1990, Unser {{was finally}} crowded {{out of his}} part-time ride. With competitive rides filling <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> career dwindling down, he joined the sub-par Patrick Racing Alfa Romeo team for 1990. After dropping out at Indy, Unser crashed in practice at Michigan and broke his leg. He quit the team after the crash.|$|E
25|$|In 1670, France regained {{control of}} Acadia and {{appointed}} Mathieu de Goutin as the Civil and Criminal Lieutenant (lieutenant civil et criminel) of Acadia. Simultaneously, the Governor of Acadia was set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> job was primarily {{the defense of}} Acadia from English invasion. The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant was essentially supervised by the Governor, who held superior judicial authority over the Lieutenant, {{but for most of}} the time would let the Lieutenant mediate and decide legal affairs.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Alejo and {{his family}} moved from Cuba to Paris. He also spoke French and as an adolescent, he read Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola. In 1921, Carpentier {{attended}} the School of Architecture of the University of Havana. When he was 18, his parents' marriage broke <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father left. The following year, Carpentier left his studies and tried to find work to support his mother. He turned to journalism, working for the Cuban newspapers Carteles and Social. He also studied music.|$|E

25|$|Perry {{remained}} {{outside the}} secure room lying in wait, knife in hand, {{for a visit}} from the pirates who were trying to locate the missing crew members in order to gain control of the ship and presumably sail it to Somalia. Perry tackled the ringleader of the pirates and took him prisoner after a cat-and-mouse chase in a darkened engine room. Pirate ringleader Abduwali Muse cut his hand trying to keep Perry's knife away from his neck. The pirate was then tied <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wounds were treated by Second Mate Ken Quinn.|$|E
25|$|Port {{was born}} in Southend-on-Sea. When he was a year old, he moved to Dagenham, where he grew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> parents still live. He was {{described}} as being a 'loner' at school. His neighbour, Ryan, described him as having a peculiar, childlike personality, exhibiting odd behaviour as a grown man, such as playing with children's toys. He came out as gay in the mid-2000s. He lived alone in a flat in Barking, London, {{and worked as a}} chef at a Stagecoach bus depot in West Ham.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation into}} the disaster discovered {{that a large number}} of potassium superoxide chemical cartridges, used to absorb carbon dioxide and chemically release oxygen to enable survival, were found in the ninth compartment. But the level of carbon monoxide in the compartment exceeded what people can produce in a closed space. Divers found ash and dust inside the compartment when they first opened that hatch, evidence of a fire. But this fire was separate from that caused by the exploding torpedo. This and other evidence found in the salvaged wreck suggested that the crew were killed when they accidentally dropped one of the chemical superoxide cartridges into the seawater slowly filling the compartment. When the cartridge came in contact with the oily sea water, it triggered a chemical reaction and flash fire. The investigation showed that some men temporarily survived this fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. Captain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov's body was badly burned from below the waist <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> head and neck were severely disfigured by burns. The fire consumed all remaining oxygen, so that the remaining survivors all died, of burns, asphyxiation, or carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E

500|$|Another secco recitative, [...] "" [...] (Ah, {{powerful}} God, let me [...] ), is {{a prayer}} for the ability to always reflect on the miracle of creation.

500|$|Lyrically, Nimrod touches upon more {{reflective}} themes not present on earlier Green Day albums. [...] Much {{of the album}} illustrates Armstrong's sentiments on growing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> role as a husband and father. [...] "The Grouch" [...] centers on Armstrong's fears of [...] "wasting away, getting fat, becoming impotent, and losing his ideals." [...] On [...] "Walking Alone", he reflects on old friends from his childhood, and notes that he is [...] "too drunk to figure out they're fading away." [...] Armstrong discusses the struggle to stay sober on [...] "Hitchin' a Ride". [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] was inspired by Armstrong's failed relationship with a woman that ended when she joined the Peace Corps in 1990. [...] The same woman is also the subject of [...] "She" [...] from Dookie, [...] "Whatsername" [...] from American Idiot (2004) and [...] "Amanda" [...] from ¡Tré!.|$|E
500|$|German army {{reconnaissance}} aircraft spotted the first Soviet formations {{in the vicinity}} of the 16th Panzer Division on the morning of 26 June. By this date the division had already progressed [...] beyond the German-Soviet demarcation line and had suffered numerous losses due to mechanical failures caused by the dusty roads. Panzer-Regiment 2 was ordered to engage the Soviet T-26 tanks which were supported by strong infantry units. In the resulting battle Strachwitz was wounded in his left arm, but he remained with his unit. The heavy counter-attack was repulsed and the bridgehead over the Bug River, held by the division's motorcycle battalion (Kradschützen-Bataillon 16), was secured. The logistics system could not keep <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> regiment was not resupplied until 28 June. His unit first encountered the T-34 and a few KV-1 and KV-2 tanks the following day. These tanks had stronger armour and outgunned his Panzer III tanks. Only with the support of the 8.8 cm Flak artillery, deployed in an anti tank role, were they able to repulse the Soviet forces.|$|E

500|$|Macaulay's bowling {{action was}} relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries. Kilburn wrote: [...] "His run-up was half-shambling, his steps short and his {{shoulders}} swaying, but {{his feet were}} faultlessly placed and his aim was high at the instant of delivery". However, critics and team-mates more widely knew him as passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's [...] "mortal enemies". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball straight at their head without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair. Kilburn observed that [...] "should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later". The Yorkshire Post, after his death, observed: [...] "Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm {{when there was a}} fighting chance of victory".|$|E
500|$|When Tom Norman {{first saw}} Merrick, he was {{dismayed by the}} extent of his deformities, fearing his {{appearance}} might be too horrific to be a successful novelty. Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learned that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk [...] "waking with a broken neck". Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant. A pamphlet titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick" [...] was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.|$|E
500|$|The Little Fire Chief is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on a young boy, Willie Stone, who follows a parade of firemen and attempts to join them as their leader. The firemen find it humorous and allow him to play with them. The fire alarm sounds and Willie attempts to join them, but is too slow. On their way back, Willie holds them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister appears. A fireman named Jack, who has affections for the woman, convinces Willie to be relieved of his [...] "command" [...] by promising to call him later. Marie Eline {{played the role of}} Willie Stone, but the other two credits are claimed to have been William Garwood and Mignon Anderson. The rest of the cast and credits are unknown. The film was released on November 8, 1910 and {{does not appear to have}} had any reviews in the usual trade publications. The film was advertised nationally and was claimed to have been popular in Vancouver, Canada. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

500|$|Depp {{created his}} own image of Todd. Heavy purple and brown make-up was applied around his eyes to suggest fatigue and rage, as if [...] "he's never slept". Burton said of the {{character}} Sweeney Todd, [...] "We always saw him as a sad character, not a tragic villain or anything. He's basically a dead person when you meet him; the only thing that's keeping him going is the one single minded thing which is tragic. You don't see anything else around him." [...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak of white hair became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. My brother had a white spot growing <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E
500|$|Killen {{has said}} that he has seen {{interesting}} theories about the finale's meaning. He says no theory is [...] "wrong" [...] except those which compared Awake finale to Dallas (an American television soap opera) or Newhart (an American television sitcom). He supposed that there was the [...] "überpossibility" [...] that Michael was in a coma, or had a new third reality created, but it was not interpreted as [...] "He woke <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family was fine. He'd just been having two nightmares." [...] Killen said [...] "we actively fought against" [...] the idea that the series was Michael's dream; what seeing his wife and son together [...] "really represents is a further fracturing of his psyche". A second season, Killen said, would have explored the idea of Michael's wife and son both living but not (necessarily) a third reality. Another season also raised the possibility of Tara and Michael beginning a romantic relationship. Since the finale was written before the show's cancellation, it was written so either reality could have been the [...] "real" [...] one: [...] " [...] didn't intend to have that mystery sewn up in [...] ".|$|E
500|$|No.79 Squadron {{was formed}} on 26April 1943 at Laverton, Victoria. It {{received}} its first Spitfire VCs on 3May, and a fortnight later began moving to Goodenough Island, off New Guinea's east coast. Along with two Kittyhawk units, Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons, No.79 Squadron came under control of No.73 Wing, which {{was part of}} No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the South West Pacific. The Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Kittyhawks in the New Guinea campaign against Japanese forces. Rawlinson picked the squadron code letters <b>UP,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> own aircraft's identifier U, to spell UP-U ("up you") on his Spitfire's fuselage. After a quiet spell at Goodenough, in August the squadron moved to Kiriwina, the closest Allied airfield to the major Japanese base at Rabaul. This promised enemy raids but none occurred during the first weeks of the squadron's deployment, and the pilots saw no combat while patrolling in support of USAAF attacks on Rabaul; Rawlinson commented that it was [...] "a disappointment to us. What a letdown." [...] The Japanese began attacking Kiriwina in early October, and No.79 Squadron claimed its first victory on 31October, when one of the Spitfires shot down a Kawasaki Ki-61 [...] "Tony" [...] fighter north of the airfield.|$|E
