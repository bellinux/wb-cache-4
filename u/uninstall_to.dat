5000|$|In 2004, Benjamin Edelman, {{assistant}} professor at Harvard Business School and spyware researcher, analyzed the network behavior of 180solutions applications and claimed they redirected commissions to themselves that were properly due to affiliates, and additionally caused merchants to pay commissions when affected users clicked on merchant sites directly. During this time, 180solutions' applications were designed to be difficult <b>to</b> <b>uninstall,</b> requiring the user to download an additional uninstall application made by 180solutions or to use an adware removal tool. In 2005 the software <b>uninstall</b> was standardized <b>to</b> use Windows' [...] "Add or Remove Programs" [...] function, making it easy <b>to</b> <b>uninstall.</b>|$|R
50|$|EMCO Remote Installer allows {{auditing}} {{software and}} OS updates installed on remote PCs. The application extracts {{information about the}} installed software from remote PCs and stores it in a database enabling the user to generate software inventory reports. The collected software inventory information is used <b>to</b> <b>uninstall</b> applications and updates. A user can select software installed on remote PCs <b>to</b> <b>uninstall</b> it remotely. Remote uninstallation is performed silently. <b>To</b> <b>uninstall</b> software that was installed using EXE setups, a user should specify the command-line parameters activating the silent uninstallation mode or provide an uninstallation scenario file. Software installed using MSI and MSP packages is uninstalled silently using the standard options.|$|R

30|$|Finding the Appropriate Application: Suppose that Adam {{walks into}} a store with his {{smartphone}} and is looking for an application by which he can browse through different offers, product catalogues, or find information relative to a specific product of interest. Imagine how convenient this would be to Adam and how beneficial {{it would be to}} the store. AppaaS makes this scenario possible. As soon as Adam enters the store’s physical space, the store-specific application gets downloaded onto Adam’s smartphone, with his consent. As soon as Adam leaves the space, the application preserves its current state (browsed items, shopping cart, etc.) for future reference and gets <b>uninstalled</b> <b>to</b> free up the mobile resources it is holding. If Adam comes back to the same store (or another related store that shares the same application), the application launches back with the last preserved state that is relevant to Adam.|$|R
5000|$|This {{software}} was initially criticized by users for its similarity to various malware [...] "virus removers", but a software fix {{was published by}} Symantec to resolve this problem.This {{software was}} also installed on Toshiba Windows 7 laptops {{under the name of}} Toshiba Security Dashboard. The problem with this was, a user was unable <b>to</b> <b>uninstall</b> the software because there was no uninstaller in the program folder, and it wasn't even listed in Programs and Features. The solution was <b>to</b> <b>uninstall</b> the Toshiba Security Dashboard, thus uninstalling the Norton Product.|$|R

Neither the Sea Harrier FA2's Blue Vixen radar, the radar warning receiver or AMRAAM capability was proposed to be included; certain US software would be also be <b>uninstalled</b> prior <b>to</b> shipment. By October 2006, reports emerged that the deal had not materialised due to the cost of airframe refurbishment.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, [...]ZAP Files do not {{automatically}} uninstall when a User no longer requires the software.

5000|$|If app1 {{depends on}} libfoo 1.2, and app2 depends on libfoo 1.3, and {{different}} versions of libfoo cannot be simultaneously installed, then app1 and app2 cannot simultaneously be used (or installed, if the installer checks dependencies). When possible, this is solved by allowing simultaneous installations of the different dependencies. Alternatively, the existing dependency, along with all software that depends on it, must be <b>uninstalled</b> in order <b>to</b> install the new dependency. A problem on Linux systems with installing packages from a different distributor (which is not recommended or even supposed to work) is that the resulting long chain of dependencies {{may lead to a}} conflicting version of the C standard library (e.g. the GNU C Library), on which thousands of packages depend. If this happens, the user will be prompted <b>to</b> <b>uninstall</b> all those packages.|$|R
50|$|The {{main feature}} of ZSoft <b>Uninstaller</b> is <b>to</b> remove {{unnecessary}} files and registry entries left behind after uninstalling a program. It begins {{by analyzing the}} hard drive and registry before the program is installed. The user is then asked to install the program {{that they want to}} analyze. After the program is installed, ZSoft Uninstaller will reanalyze the same hard drive and registry, and compare the differences of the pre-installation with the post-installation. Each difference will be logged and the user can return at any time to delete the program and all of the files that were installed.|$|R
50|$|Once installed, cPanel {{cannot be}} easily removed. cPanel's FAQ {{states that the}} best way <b>to</b> <b>uninstall</b> cPanel is by {{reformatting}} the server. However, uninstall guides are available online for expert server administrators who do not wish to reformat their server.Similarly, it should only be installed on a freshly installed operating system with minimal prior configuration.|$|R

Other components include a defragmentation tool, a registry cleaner, and a startup manager to replace MSConfig.|$|R
50|$|CoolWebSearch uses various {{techniques}} to evade detection and removal, {{and as such}} many common spyware removal programs fail to properly remove the software. Since it is bundled with many other potentially unwanted software or add-ons, users need <b>to</b> <b>uninstall</b> those unwanted programs first, or else CoolWebSearch can come back even after they have changed their home page and search engine provider.|$|R
