40|$|A novel {{trigger circuit}} of signal {{sampling}} {{was designed for}} developing modularized high-resolution compact gamma camera. The design idea is to transfer the peak position detection of the signal of gamma camera into high-precision measurement of pole-zero timing. The <b>unipolar</b> <b>input</b> signal is shaped by a full-pass filter into a bipolar signal. The peak position of signal is determined by measuring the polar-zero position while a trigger pulse is generated corresponding to the peak position. The width and delay of the trigger pulse are adjustable by mono-stable trigger circuits. The pulse is used to trigger the data acquisition system. The experimental {{results show that the}} performance of the trigger circuit is stable and reliable. It can provide a high-precision determination of the peak position and well meet the requirements of the high-resolution compact gamma camera...|$|E
40|$|The LTC® 2351 - 12 is a 12 -bit, 1. 5 Msps ADC {{with six}} {{simultaneously}} sampled differential inputs. The device draws only 5. 5 mA {{from a single}} 3 V supply, and comes in a tiny 32 -pin (5 mm × 5 mm) QFN package. A SLEEP shutdown mode further reduces power consumption to 12 µW. The combination of low power and tiny package makes the LTC 2351 - 12 suitable for portable applications. The LTC 2351 - 12 contains six separate differential inputs that are sampled simultaneously on the rising edge of the CONV signal. These six sampled inputs are then converted {{at a rate of}} 250 ksps per channel. The 83 dB common mode rejection allows users to eliminate ground loops and common mode noise by measuring signals differentially from the source.

40|$|The LTC® 2355 - 12 /LTC 2355 - 14 are 12 -bit/ 14 -bit, 3. 5 Msps serial ADCs with {{differential}} inputs. The devices draw only 5. 5 mA from {{a single}} 3. 3 V supply and come in a tiny 10 -lead MSOP package. A Sleep shutdown feature further reduces power consumption to 13 µW. The combination of speed, low power and tiny package makes the LTC 2355 - 12 / LTC 2355 - 14 suitable for high speed, portable applications. The 80 dB common mode rejection allows users to elimi-nate ground loops and common mode noise by measuring signals differentially from the source. The devices convert 0 V to 2. 5 V <b>unipolar</b> <b>inputs</b> differentially. The absolute voltage swing for AIN+ and AIN – extends from ground to the supply voltage. The serial interface sends out the conversion results during the 16 clock cycles following a CONV rising edge for compatibility with standard serial interfaces. If two addi-tional clock cycles for acquisition time are allowed after the data stream in between conversions, the full sampling rate of 3. 5 Msps can be achieved with a 63 MHz clock. +...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the usual}} thin film {{magnetic}} memory, that which utilizes the two stable easy direction magnetization states for storage, inverted films (H,> Hr) {{are often used}} to reduce disturb sensitivity. In general, inverted films exhibit a high angular dispersion and an open hard direction hysteresis loop with considerable remanence. Middelhoek has attributed this high remanence to {{the large number of}} NBel walls formed after the application of a hard direction field exceeding the anisotropy field. The stable state resulting from this “dispersion locking ” finds utility as a storage state and is the subject treated here. This paper describes an orthogonal storage mode which could form the basis for a word-organized high-speed memory using unipolar drivers. Test programs and the results obtained therefrom are illustrated to show the useful operating range in a typical film. The total absence of “creep ” and the <b>unipolar</b> digit current <b>input</b> to the device are seen to be features of this dispersion locked mode...|$|R
40|$|An analog {{multiplier}} is a device having two input ports and an output port. The signal at the output {{is the product}} of the two input signals. If both input and output signals are voltages, the transfer characteristic {{is the product of}} the two voltages divided by a scaling factor, K, which has the dimension of voltage as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 : Basic Analog Multiplier and Definition of Multiplier Quadrants From a mathematical point of view, multiplication is a "four quadrant " operation—that is to say that both inputs may be either positive or negative, as may be the output. Some of the circuits used to produce electronic multipliers, however, are limited to signals of one polarity. If both signals must be unipolar, we have a "single quadrant " multiplier, and the output will also be unipolar. If one of the signals is unipolar, but the other may have either polarity, the multiplier is a "two quadrant " multiplier, and the output may have either polarity (and is "bipolar"). The circuitry used to produce one- and two-quadrant multipliers may be simpler than that required for four quadrant multipliers, and since there are many applications where full four quadrant multiplication is not required, it is common to find accurate devices which work only in one or two quadrants. An example is the AD 539, a wideband dual two-quadrant multiplier which has a single <b>unipolar</b> Vy <b>input</b> with a relatively limited bandwidth of 5 MHz, and two bipolar Vx inputs, one per multiplier, with bandwidths of 60 MHz. A block diagram of the AD 539 is show...|$|R
