25|$|The next night, Blagojevich lost to Patrick Porter by 3rd-round {{technical}} knockout. Porter's aggressive punching attack had Blagojevich covering <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> {{with his}} boxing gloves. Because Blagojevich {{did not return}} punches, the referee stopped the match (with Blagojevich still on his feet), and awarded it to Porter.|$|E
2500|$|Sinologist Herbert Giles, {{drawing on}} {{contemporary}} sources, described the Kangxi Emperor as [...] "fairly tall and well proportioned, he loved all manly exercises, and devoted three months annually to hunting.

2500|$|The {{pay-per-view}} {{opened up}} with a match type created by AAA, a Relevos Atómicos de locura match (Spanish for [...] "Eight-man madness match"). Relevos Atómicos de locura matches always feature teams composed of a male wrestler, a female wrestler, an Exotico wrestler and a Mini-Estrella facing off against each other. During the introductions the Exotico Polvo de Estrellas wore a robe and wig inspired by the Poison Ivy character from the Batman & Robin movie that featured a headdress that shot fireworks. The main story of the match focused on Billy Boy and Sexy Star's ongoing feud with Faby Apache. The match was not isolated to males wrestling against males or Mini-Estrellas wrestling against Mini-Estrellas as all eight combattants mixed it up during the match. Octagoncito almost pinned his rival Mini Abismo Negro on one occasion, narrowly avoiding defeat. Sexy Star tried to seduce El Elegido, hoping {{to keep him from}} hitting her. When Billy Boy entered the ring Sexy Star quickly pulled El Elegido's mask off and left the ring with it, this left him vulnerable for Billy Boy to pin him while he was trying to cover <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Following their victory Sexy Star and Billy Boy attacked Faby Apache, but were stopped by the return of Faby's sister Mari Apache who ran to the ring and saved her sister from a beating.|$|E
