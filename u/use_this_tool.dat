This method of cutting thin wood requires a degree of manual dexterity and patience to avoid spoiling the work. An alternative solution to this labour-intensive method of cutting intricate shapes in wood was required using modern technology solutions. The advent of the commercial medium-power Laser device has enabled many industries to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>tool</b> to cut {{many different types of}} material speedily. The puzzle-manufacturing process uses a laser-cutting method invented and perfected by the founder, Kevin Wentworth Presto, in 1994.|$|E
