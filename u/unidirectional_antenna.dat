40|$|In this research, {{the novel}} {{concept of a}} resonance-based {{reflector}} (RBR) was proposed, and a ring-shaped RBR was utilized to design a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> with low-profile and broadband characteristics. Research found the ring operates as two half-wavelength (λ/ 2) resonators. Then, the resonance effect transforms the reflection phase of the ring RBR, and achieves a reflection phase of 0 ° < ϕ < 180 ° in a wide frequency range above the resonance. Then, the in-phase reflection characteristic (− 90 ° < ϕ < 90 °) can be obtained in the wide frequency band by placing an antenna above the RBR with a distance smaller than λ/ 4. Two unidirectional antennas, named Case 1 and Case 2, were designed with the ring-shaped RBRs and bowtie antennas (RBR-BAs). The impedance bandwidths of Case 1 and the Case 2 are 2. 04 – 5. 12 GHz (86. 3 %) and 1. 97 – 5. 01 GHz (87. 1 %), respectively. The front-to-back ratio (FBR, an important parameter to measure the unidirectional radiation) of Case 1 ranges from 5 – 9. 9 dB for frequencies 2. 04 – 2. 42 GHz, and the FBR of Case 2 ranges from 5 – 16 dB for frequencies 2. 16 – 3. 15 GHz.

40|$|Abstract. A {{wireless}} ad-hoc {{network is}} a collection of transceivers positioned in the plane. Each transceiver is equipped with a limited, nonreplenishable battery charge. The battery charge is then reduced after each transmission, depending on the transmission distance. One of the major problems in wireless network design is to route network traffic efficiently so as to maximize the network lifetime, i. e., the number of successful transmissions. This problem is known to be NP-Hard for a variety of network operations. In this paper we are interested in two fundamental types of transmissions, broadcast and data gathering. We provide polynomial time approximation algorithms, with guaranteed performance bounds, for the maximum lifetime problem under two communication models, omnidirectional and <b>unidirectional</b> <b>antennas.</b> We also consider an extended variant of the maximum lifetime problem, which simultaneously satisfies additional constraints, such as bounded hop-diameter and degree of the routing tree, and minimizing the total energy used in a single transmission. ...|$|R

However, a low-profile <b>unidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> requires a back reflector {{close to the}} slot and the resulting stripline feed causes strong excitation of parallel-plate modes. In this contribution, we consider unidirectional reflector-backed slot configurations with parallel-plate mode suppression by shorting pins. Starting from a parametric study with respect to shorting pin location and back reflector distance, we present a stripline-fed rectangular slot element with radiation efficiency of more than 80 % and a bandwidth of about 5 % at centre frequency 10 GHz. A careful optimisation of shorting pin locations guarantees reliable parallel-plate mode suppression without deteriorating the slot radiation behaviour. Coupling coefficients between parallel and aligned rectangular slot elements are presented. For increased bandwidth applications, a bow-tie slot element with about 8 % bandwidth and radiation efficiency of close to 80 % is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Emerging mesh {{networks}} {{build on}} IEEE 802. 11 wireless local area networking technology to deliver Internet access to mobile users or to areas where traditional wired access technologies are unprofitable. Such deployments are highly bandwidth constrained; in dense urban environments many users {{are competing for}} the wireless medium and long-haul wireless backbone connections have significant contention. In addition, IEEE 802. 11 networks suffer from a high packet overhead—much higher than Ethernet, for example. This overhead consumes a significant share of the theoretical capacity. As networks advance to higher bitrates the proportion of this overhead increases, because packet preambles are transmitted at the lowest bitrate. We address this challenge through an adaptive, connection-agnostic aggregation mechanism that can reduce this overhead by combining multiple smaller packets into larger ones. One method uses a small delay on packets to enable the distributed aggregators to collect smaller packets from different network connections for assembling a larger packet. The second method automatically increases aggregation activity with network congestion; thus, it does not impose delays on network traffic in situations of low media utilization and also reduces delays under periods of high load. A prototype on a wireless testbed and simulation results for larger community network deployments show significant improvements in actual network capacity, ranging from a 60 - 270 % improvement for traditional “adhoc” scenarios and to a 100 - 500 % improvement for wireless networks using <b>unidirectional</b> <b>antennas...</b>|$|R

In the proposed technique, microwave hyperthermia of patient-specific breast models is implemented using a three-dimensional antenna array based on differential beam-steering sub-arrays to locally raise {{the temperature of the}} tumor to therapeutic values while keeping healthy tissue at normal body temperature. This approach is realized by optimizing the excitations (phases and amplitudes) of the antenna elements using the global optimization method particle swarm optimization. The antennae excitation phases are optimized to maximize the power at the tumor, whereas the amplitudes are optimized to accomplish the required temperature at the tumor. During the optimization, the technique ensures that no hot spots exist in healthy tissue.

40|$|International audienceMaximizing the {{throughput}} of point-to-point communication {{has been}} the crux of wireless networks. In IEEE 802. 11 networks, the first and prominent wireless technology, the model of point-to-point communication is still applicable today: the transmissions are between the wireless nodes and the access point, which usually serves as a gateway to the Internet. But this model is not well suited to more recent wireless systems such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc NETworks (VANETs). In such networks, a very significant part of communication is between one node and its neighbors and simultaneous transmissions or, in other words spatial reuse, is required to insure good performance. When we consider communication from one node to its neighbor,an important metric is the density of successful simultaneous transmissions. Several studies such as [1], [2] have shown how this density of transmissions can be improved in Aloha or in CSMA networks. The aim {{of this paper is}} to show that the use of directional antennas can greatly improve the performance of the network in our neighbor-to-neighbor communication model because interference is greatly reduced. The model we build here allows a quantitative study of the performance and the improvement obtained with directional antennas to be be achieved. The study of Aloha (slotted and non-slotted) is very easy to accomplish and leads to closed formulas for the density of successful transmissions. The study of CSMA is more complex. We use a Matern selection process to mimic the behavior of CSMA in a random pattern of nodes distributed as a Poisson Point Process (PPP) : each node receives a random mark and the nodes that have the smallest mark in their neighborhood are elected for transmission. Previous studies, such as [2], show that in CSMA networks, the density of successful transmissions is greatly influenced by the carrier sense detection threshold, which is one of the main parameters of CSMA. In this study we will assume that the carrier sense detection threshold is optimized to obtain the best performance of the CSMA network and our evaluations are performed under this condition. Our analytical models and our computation show that using directional antennas can lead to an improvement of up to more than 100 % in the density of throughput compared to the normal use of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>antennas...</b>|$|R

To enable the antenna to resonate at a low frequency within a compact substrate area, a pair of slots is created on the loop 2 ̆ 7 s vertical arms, whereas the dipole 2 ̆ 7 s structure is tapered to compensate for the negative effect of the capacitively loaded slots. With the proposed configuration, the antenna acts as an array of two dipoles and a quasi-Yagi antenna at lower and higher frequencies, respectively, and thus radiates mainly in one direction. The antenna has a compact size (with respect to the wavelength at the lowest operating frequency) of 0. 23 × 0. 23, making it 50...|$|R
40|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVDs) {{are the leading}} causes of death worldwide, with one third of deaths attributed to CVDs in 2012. Pulmonary oedema and pleural effusion are the most apparent symptoms of many diseases categorized under CVDs such as heart failure and lung cancer, at which fluid (mainly with high water content) is accumulated in or around the lungs. Therefore, constant monitoring of fluid levels inside the lungs {{is one of the}} most efficient ways of early detection of CVDs. Chest X-Rays and computational tomography (CT) -scans are the most widely used devices for fluid detection; however, they suffer from lack of sensitivity and ionizing radiation, respectively, that makes them unsuitable for long term monitoring purposes. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most reliable device that can be utilized for fluid accumulation detection. However, considering the fact that more than 75 % of the CVDs occur in countries with low or middle income, it is not widely available. Moreover, due to their bulky structures, the abovementioned devices lack the capability of being used in mobile emergency units such as ambulances or clinics at rural areas. To that end, this thesis is dedicated to design and fabrication of a low cost, portable and non-invasive device that can be used as an initial decision making tool for medical staff to pursue further investigations to define the exact cause of the oedema. First chapter of the thesis is allocated to introduction of the {{cardiovascular diseases}} and their effects on the dielectric properties of the tissues inside the lungs. A complete literature review on various alternative methods for replacing the conventional devices is performed. The obtained results by these systems and their advantages as well as their limitations are discussed. Microwave imaging technique is then presented in chapter two as a robust method which can both provide information about the presence and location of the accumulated fluid. This is specifically of great importance for cases where biopsy is required to remove or take sample of the accumulated fluid for saving the life of the patient. Chapter two is also allocated to the introduction of microwave-based medical diagnostic and monitoring systems for different applications such as breast cancer detection and brain imaging. A prospect of the possible realizable systems is investigated and existing scanning approaches are discussed. The main contributions of the thesis that are the design of several complete platforms, design of novel and <b>unidirectional</b> microwave sensors (<b>antennas),</b> promotion of novel scanning and detection methods are clarified in these chapters. In chapter three, firstly the optimum operating frequency for torso imaging is defined. By applying a circuit model that models different layers of torso as circuit elements, it is shown that a wide operating bandwidth at lower ultra-high frequency (UHF) band provides a reasonable compensation between the resolution of the obtained images and signal penetration inside the body. It is explained that due to the limited allowed microwave power for safety considerations <b>unidirectional</b> <b>antennas</b> are required. Then, it is explained that due to the large wavelengths at lower UHF band the sizes of the prospective antennas are expected to be large. To that end, novel miniaturization techniques are proposed to reduce the sizes of the conventional antennas in chapters three and four. These antennas are categorized under three dimensional (3 -D) and planar structure. A folding technique is introduced and used in the proposed 3 -D structures and it is shown that by using this technique both size and directivity/back radiation suppression is improved. 3 -D slot-antenna and cubic monopole-fed antennas are also proposed that wide operating bandwidth is achieved using slot impedance transformer, and multiple resonance-merging techniques, respectively. Regarding the planar structures that are presented in chapter four, it is shown that by combining the loop-dipole modes, both wide-operating bandwidth and directivity enhancement is achievable. Capacitive-loading of a loop antenna is the other proposed technique in which a loop antenna is partially and/or non-uniformly loaded with capacitors in the forms of simple slots and mu-negative (MNG) metamaterial-unitcells that help miniaturizing the size of the antenna by lowering its first resonance frequency. In chapters five and six, several platforms using single and multiple antennas with linear and circular configurations are presented and the utilized imaging technique for data processing is explained. The platforms are presented in a systematic progressive manner in which each system is covering the limitations of its previous prototype. Two final clinical platforms in the shape of clinical bed and doughnut-shaped chamber are proposed and the obtained test results on artificial phantom, animal lungs and human tests are presented. Based on the obtained results on healthy human beings it is shown that the scattered-field from torso of people with different body sizes vary in a reasonably limited range that is a welcoming result for building a global-database to define a threshold for healthy range. Chapter seven concludes the discussions made throughout the thesis and explains future works that can be carried out to further improve the reported systems...|$|R
