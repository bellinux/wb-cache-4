40|$|Research {{shows an}} uneven {{partition}} of value added along commodity chains between transnational firms and producers in developing countries. This paper briefly discusses {{how such a}} distribution occurs and how it leads to unequal exchange in trade. A North-South trade model reveals the uneven development consequences of this exchange. The terms of trade between North and South help maintain a gap in capital accumulation between the two regions. The model reveals that capital flows covering the trade deficit of the South with the North may help stimulate the <b>unrequited</b> <b>transfer</b> of real resources from South to North.

40|$|Among {{the major}} {{categories}} of international transactions, perhaps none is usually {{farther from the}} limelight than unilateral, or <b>unrequited,</b> <b>transfers.</b> This obscurity is puzzling, because countries' net receipts or payments of <b>unrequited</b> <b>transfers</b> often exceed their international balances on both trade and current account and sometimes amount to sizable fractions of their national incomes, and maintaining equilibrium in international payments {{in the face of}} sizable transfers is a challenging issue. > This article discusses the singular nature of <b>unrequited</b> <b>transfers,</b> recalls an historic, and still relevant, controversy over their economic impact, and recounts an effort by the United States to neutralize their balance-of-payments consequences. The size of these transfers in recent years, and some plausible explanations for them, are then evaluated, with most attention given to those of the United States. Balance of payments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{economic and}} financial developments in Sao Tomé and PrÃ­ncipe during the 1990 s. The {{economic and financial}} performance deteriorated sharply during 1994, owing to excessively expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Although real GDP grew virtually {{at the same rate}} as in 1993, inflation almost doubled. The fiscal deficit increased markedly compared with 1993, and was financed to a much greater extent than in the past by net credit from the banking system. Nonetheless, the balance of payments improved, primarily owing to higher inflows of private and official <b>unrequited</b> <b>transfers.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{conditions under}} which, starting from any tax distorting equilibrium, destination- and origin-based indirect tax-harmonizing reforms are potentially Pareto improving {{in the presence}} of global public goods. The first condition (<b>unrequited</b> <b>transfers</b> between governments) requires that transfers are designed {{in such a way that}} the marginal valuations of the global public goods are equalized, whereas the second (conditional revenue changes) requires that the change in global tax revenues, as a consequence of tax harmonization, is consistent with the direction of inefficiency in global public good provision relative to the (modified) Samuelson rule. Under these conditions, tax harmonization results in redistributing the gains from a reduction in global deadweight loss and any changes in global tax revenues according to the Pareto principle. And this is the case independently of the tax principle in place (destination or origin) ...|$|R

The first condition (<b>unrequited</b> <b>transfers</b> between governments) requires that transfers are designed {{in such a way that}} the marginal valuations of the global public goods are equalized, whereas the second (conditional revenue changes) requires that the change in global tax revenues, as a consequence of tax harmonization, is consistent with the under/over-provision of global public goods relative to the (modified) Samuelson rule.

40|$|The {{debate on}} {{appropriate}} measurement of workers’ remittances {{and the greater}} need for conceptual clarity about such statistics both for the compilers and the users raises certain important issues. First, lack of uniformity in properly identifying and measuring remittances of migrant workers constrains the scope of international comparability. For instance, in many countries translated {{in the form of}} transfers to residents as <b>unrequited</b> <b>transfers.</b> These country specific formats of remittance transfers and their inclusion in the remittance statistics need to be clearly recognized. Thus, the definitional issues need clarity to provide direction to the compiling counties to produce comparable statistics. Second, the experience of developing countries suggests that the survey method has its own limitations due to poor response of participants, particularly in a more liberalized environment. Even under the ITRS, the introduction of formats seeking disaggregated information does not ensure quality of data when respondents are either not cautious in classifying the detailed transactions or lack adequate skill to handle such information. Missing incentive systems for the reporting entities may also result in inadequate data quality. Third, is there a need for synthesizing statistics on remittances and the migration statistics? To what extent the migration statistics can keep pace with the requirements of compilation of remittances in terms of updated information, and attributes such as changing structure of migrant stocks, skill classification, average income levels, duration of stay etc. Possibility to develop an appropriate information system through coordinated efforts of migration authorities, immigration offices, the population census and the BoP compilers? The scope for sharing the host country statistics on immigration, which is presumably credible due to firm record of immigrants. Fourth, as many countries rely on the ITRS, it becomes extremely difficult to segregate between workers’ remittances and the compensation of employees by the reporting entities. The thin dividing line is conceptual rather than functional and more often the reporting entities do not have details on the period of stay. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the internationally funded Investment Compact of the Balkan Stability Pact is to reduce {{investment}} risk in the region and lay the foundations for the inflow of private capital. This paper discusses the situation of foreign direct investment (FDI) in South-East European countries (SEECs). It also draws lessons from the experience of Central European transition countries (CEECs) to make conclusions and policy recommendations for SEECs. It provides an insight into some crucial areas - foreign penetration in the manufacturing sector, FDI-related policies and privatization as a vehicle of FDI. The paper comes {{to the conclusion that the}} countries can transform and grow faster if they rely on foreign direct investment. The pace of restructuring has been fastest in countries where FDI was attracted also by privatization. Technologies relevant for growth are principally developed by multinationals and can only be accessed within their networks. A comparison of the performance of domestic-owned and foreign-owned enterprises in CEECs proves the overall positive effects of FDI in terms of structural upgrading and increasing competitiveness. But foreign direct investment inflows cannot be treated as <b>unrequited</b> <b>transfers</b> they finance profit-oriented ventures whose foreign owners expect to realize and, to a smaller or larger extent, also to repatriate the generated profit. Current account deficits are in part produced by FDI inflows. The experience with public policies in SEECs has been disappointing for reasons connected with weak states and corrupt practices. Strengthening public institutions and building credibility can be development targets of their own. In the given situation, policy recommendations must keep in mind that these countries can only cope with simple policies; they are unable to run very sophisticated programmes or apply complicated tools. In the future, supporting regional re-integration and easing border controls can reduce transaction costs and increase the size of attainable markets. Investment promotion policies must become more stable and transparent. Restructuring and privatization of ailing industries, restructuring and capitalization of the banking system as well as policies directed at the promotion of small and medium-size businesses are necessary to strengthen market-economy rule. The legal system must become more transparent and less corruptible. Simple legislation and institutions (smaller governments) are usually less corruptible than more complex, fuzzy ones. foreign direct investment, CEECs, SEECs, Balkans, economic policy...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{survey of the}} 2 ̆ 018 shopping list 2 ̆ 019 of sources of external finance that are directly channelled to the business sector of developing countries. Generally, our analytical survey covers the 1970 - 2000 period, and includes the distribution of foreign resources classified according to the different income-based and geographical breakdown of developing countries. We examine aggregate net resource flows {{in the form of}} the saving-investment gap and current account surplus in the balance-of-payments of developed countries. Also examined is the institutionalized component of this aggregate, which encompasses both official and private flows. In addition, we discuss the different components of private flows, including <b>unrequited</b> private <b>transfers</b> (grants by NGOs and workers 2 ̆ 019 remittances) and commercial capital flows (private flows to multilateral institutions and bilateral private capital flows in the form of foreign direct investments and portfolio capital flows) to developing countries. Official foreign flows for business sector development are also discussed. The recent pre-occupation with assistance to microfinance and microenterprises in developing countries as a way of enhancing poverty reduction and gender balance in recipient countries is also highlighted. These official sources are bilateral and multilateral flows, including those from the International Finance Corporation. Items that are, by their nature, inherently net outflows from developing countries are also examined. These include the cross-border international banking transactions by residents of developing countries that often give rise to capital flight. Also included are the foreign currency and other liquid liabilities of developed countries, whose holding by the residents of developing countries seems be increasing...|$|R
