5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the <b>upwind</b> side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving <b>upwind,</b> this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the <b>upwind</b> side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun <b>upwind</b> of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the <b>upwind</b> side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a two-dimensional diffusive transport model with convection. This model is studied numerically using an alternating direction implicit (ADI) method with exponential <b>upwinding.</b> It {{is known that}} the exponential <b>upwinding</b> technique can perform really well on one-dimensional steady transport problems. So, we are interested {{to find out how}} good exponential <b>upwinding</b> will be on a two-dimensional problem when coupled to locally one-dimensional methods, i. e., ADI methods. Our numerical simulations show that an ADI method with exponential <b>upwinding</b> can be a very useful method even in two dimensions. Especially, when there are no systematic ways of choosing the <b>upwinding</b> parameters in the conventional <b>upwinding</b> methods, one can confidently employ an ADI method with exponential <b>upwinding</b> on a convection dominated diffusion problem and expect good answers...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that moving mesh and <b>upwinding</b> schemes {{are two kinds}} of techniques for tracking the shock or steep wave front in the solution of PDEs. It is expected that their combination should produce more robust methods. Several <b>upwinding</b> schemes are considered for non-uniform meshes. A self-adaptive moving mesh method is also described. Numerical examples are given to illustrate that in some cases, especially for hyperbolic conservative laws with nonconvex flux, the <b>upwinding</b> schemes improve the results of the moving mesh methods. Comparing the results of several <b>upwinding</b> schemes, we find the local piecewise hyperbolic method (PHM) is very efficient and accurate when combined with a moving mesh strategy.

As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside <b>upwind</b> tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further <b>upwind.</b>|$|E

40|$|A uniform {{framework}} {{for the study of}} <b>upwinding</b> schemes is developed. The standard finite element Galerkin discretization is chosen as the reference discretization, and differences between other discretization schemes and the reference are written as artificial diffusion terms. These artificial diffusion terms are spanned by a four dimensional space of element diffusion matrices. Three basis matrices are symmetric, rank one diffusion operators associated with the edges of the triangle; the fourth basis matrix is skew symmetric and is associated with a rotation by = 2. While finite volume discretizations may be written as <b>upwinded</b> Galerkin methods, the converse {{does not appear to be}} true.

5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps.

These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands.

5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the <b>upwind</b> face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The <b>upwind</b> slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{shallow water}} {{equations}} {{are derived from}} the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids and are valid when the vertical velocity and acceleration of the fluid are small. The equations are adequate to model a big range of the hydrodynamic flows which appear in practical engineering situations. The shallow water equations can account {{for the effects of}} the bed slope, wind and bottom friction, turbulence, varying channel section and mass source due to superficial waters or infiltration. It has been proved by Bermúdez and Vázquez [3] the convenience of <b>upwinding</b> the bed slope source term in order to reduce discretization errors introduced in the <b>upwinded</b> convective flux terms. Vázquez-Cendón [10] showed also the need of <b>upwinding</b> the source terms which account for the varying geometry of the transversal section. This paper focus on the study of the mass and turbulent terms in the shallow water equations, analyzing the convenience of <b>upwinding</b> them from an accurate as well as a stability point of view. A steady solution to the equations which relate the bed slope with the mass and turbulent terms is proposed. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the <b>upwind</b> edges of sand seas.|$|E

However the heavy winds caused Constellation to heel so much that her leeward gunports had to remain closed. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing past L'Insurgentes to reach her leeward side. From there Constellation could bring more of her guns to bear. With Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried {{to communicate with the}} Americans. The American frigate ignored the French hail, closing to within fifty yards of L'Insurgente before opening up with a broadside. Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her, but Constellation held the weather gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E

5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it has been {{previously}} indicated that nest mates may alarm {{the rest of the}} nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest. Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating that it is still in its “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted <b>upwind</b> of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response {{from the rest of the}} nest. However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E

40|$|Introduction In doing {{numerical}} simulations with {{systems of}} hyperbolic conservation laws, <b>upwinding</b> is essential.

One of the first attempts at <b>upwinding</b> for the equations of gas dynamics was the method of Courant, Isaacson and Rees. Unfortunately, this method is not in conservation form and, thus, it is not appropriate for problems involving shocks since it does not guarantee that discontinuities are properly captured.
