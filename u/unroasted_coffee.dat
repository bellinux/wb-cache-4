40|$|Javamide-I/javamide-II are {{phenolic}} amides {{found in}} coffee. Recent reports {{suggested that they}} may contain several biological activities related to human health. Therefore, there is emergent interest about their quantities in coffee-related products. Green coffee extract is a powder extract made of <b>unroasted</b> green <b>coffee</b> beans, available as a dietary supplement. However, there is little information about the amounts of javamide-I/javamide-II in green coffee extract products in the market. Therefore, in this paper, javamide-I/javamide-II were extracted from green coffee extract products and their identifications were confirmed by NMR. After that, the amounts of javamide-I/javamide-II were individually quantified from seven different green coffee extract samples using the HPLC method coupled to an electrochemical detector. The HPLC method provided accurate and reliable measurement of javamide-I/javamide-II with excellent peak resolution and low detection limit. In all seven green coffee extract samples, javamide-II {{was found to be}} between 0. 28 and 2. 96 [*]mg/g, but javamide-I was detected in only five samples in the concentration levels of 0. 15 – 0. 52 [*]mg/g, suggesting that green coffee extract products contain different amounts of javamide-I/javamide-II. In summary, javamide-I/javamide-II can be found in green coffee extract products sold in the market, but their amounts are likely to be comparatively different in between green coffee extract brands...|$|R

5000|$|In 2013, {{manufacturing}} contributed 10% of GDP, {{compared to}} 21% for {{industry as a}} whole and 25% for agriculture. Half of GDP came (54%) from the services sector. In 2012, Uganda's main exports were all agricultural products: <b>unroasted</b> <b>coffee</b> (30.6%), cotton (5.6%) and tobacco (5.5%). In 2010, it spent less than 5% of GDP on agriculture, despite African countries having committed to the target of 10% when the African Union adopted the Maputo Declaration in 2003 [...] They reiterated this goal in the Malabo Declaration adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. However, African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aroma is {{the most}} {{important}} factor in assessing the quality of coffee. The volatile compounds profile could be very important to confirm the authenticity of Coffea arabica. The study was carried out on two species of <b>unroasted</b> <b>coffee</b> beans: Coffea arabica from Colombia and Nepal and Coffea robusta from Uganda and Vietnam. Both Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora were imported to the country of analysis approximately 5 months prior to the research. Before the analysis, the coffee beans were kept in a sealed, dark container, at 21 °C. The tests were performed using an electronic nose. Its functioning is based on gas chromatography with two columns of different polarities in parallel and with 2 ultra sensitive Flame Ionization Detectors (FID). With multivariate statistics – Principal Components Analysis – it was possible to reduce the number of links and present them in two dimensions, which allowed for the unambiguous identification and assignment of samples to a particular species of coffee. By using an electronic nose, one can distinguish and group <b>unroasted</b> <b>coffee</b> beans’ flavours depending on the country of origin and species...|$|E

It is essential to establish rapport with local partners to overcome this unfamiliarity and ensure the relevance of proposed solutions. For this workshop, we propose to share our experiences establishing such a relationship while designing a CAM-based mobile data capture system for Asobagri, a rural coffee cooperative in Barillas, Guatemala. Asobagri: The Coffee Cooperative Asobagri is a producer/exporter cooperative founded in Barillas- a remote city in the Guatemalan highlands {{with a population of}} about ten thousand people.

40|$|Organic {{solvents}} {{are used}} widely to extract biological agents. A project {{funded by the}} BMBF and coordinated by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety, and Energy Technology (UMSICHT) sets out to explore the possible use of supercritical fluids instead. The best-known practical example of the extraction of biological agents using supercritical liquids is probably the extraction of caffeine from <b>unroasted</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. While this process is well-established, supercritical carbon dioxide could be an environmentally friendly alternative for many other extraction processes. However, {{a better understanding of}} the physical and chemical processes involved needs to be developed before this is possible. The specific goal of this project is research on the extraction of biological agents from plant matrices, specifically from red clover, sage and rapeseed, and the treatment of heterogenic matrices like wood or paper, which is possible with hydrophobic substances by means of supercritical carbon dioxide. During the course of the extraction and treatment experiments, researchers will explore the impact of a wide variety of parameters on the matrix and the products. These include the impact of varying matrix properties, process/operation modes, pressure, temperature and mass/volume flow rates of the supercritical fluid. The results will find later industrial applications in cosmetics, food production and construction as well as in sectors like the chemical, pharmaceutical and textile industries...|$|E
40|$|Many {{epidemiological}} {{studies have indicated}} that coffee consumption may reduce the risks of developing obesity and diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms of these effects are poorly understood. Our previous study revealed the changes on gene expression profiles in the livers of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice fed a high-fat diet containing three types of coffee (caffeinated, decaffeinated and green <b>unroasted</b> <b>coffee),</b> using DNA microarrays. The results revealed remarkable alterations in lipid metabolism-related molecules which may be involved in the anti-obesity effects of coffee. We conducted the present study to further elucidate the metabolic alterations underlying the effects of coffee consumption through comprehensive proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Proteomics revealed an up-regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (a key enzyme in the TCA cycle) and its related proteins, suggesting increased energy generation. The metabolomics showed an up-regulation of metabolites involved in the urea cycle, with which the transcriptome data were highly consistent, indicating accelerated energy expenditure. The TCA cycle and the urea cycle are likely be accelerated in a concerted manner, since they are directly connected by mutually providing each other’s intermediates. The up-regulation of these pathways might result in a metabolic shift causing increased ATP turnover, which is related to the alterations of lipid metabolism. This mechanism may play an important part in the suppressive effects of coffee consumption on obesity, inflammation, and hepatosteatosis. This study newly revealed global metabolic alterations induced by coffee intake, providing significan...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe oil {{extracted}} by {{cold pressing}} <b>unroasted</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, known as green coffee oil, {{has been widely}} used for cosmetic purposes. The objective of this work was to prepare and characterize microcapsules containing green coffee oil and to verify its antioxidant activity under the effect of light, heat and oxygen. The encapsulating material was arabic gum and the microcapsules were obtained by spray drying an oil-in-water emulsion containing green coffee oil. The characterization of the microcapsules was performed by laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and the antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity was determined by a modified active oxygen method with light irradiation, heating and oxygen flux. The microparticles were effectively produced by the proposed spray drying method, which resulted in green coffee oil loads of 10 and 30 %. The morphological evaluation of microcapsules showed spherical shape with smooth and non-porous surfaces, demonstrating the adequacy of arabic gum as encapsulating material. Calorimetric analysis of individual components and microcapsules with 10 and 30 % green coffee oil showed diminished degradation temperatures and enthalpy, suggesting a possible interaction between arabic gum and green coffee oil. The antioxidant activities for pure green coffee oil and its microcapsules with loads of 10 and 30 % showed high activity {{when compared to the}} reference antioxidant alfa-tocopherol. Microcapsules containing 10 and 30 % of oil showed 7 -fold and 3 -fold increase in antioxidant activity when compared to pure green coffee oil. The new method for antioxidant activity determination proposed here, which applies heat, light and oxygen simultaneously, suggests a high improvement in encapsulated green coffee oil when compared to this active alone. The results showed herein indicate a promising industrial application of this microencapsulated green coffee oil...|$|E
40|$|A USDA {{analysis}} of the EBA initiative {{has found that the}} trade deficit of least developed countries with the EU has grown {{over the past five years}} and is larger than their trade deficit with the USA. The paper notes that the aim of the EBA initiative was to boost the trade of least developed countries in order to diversify their economies. In fact EU agricultural imports from LDCs have been decreasing over the past five years, with the LDC trade deficit with the EU reaching a new high in 2002. The paper points out that the EU is a net agricultural exporter to LDCs, with milk powder and wheat dominating. According to this report there is no evidence to suggest that imports to the EU have increased due to the EBA. The paper cites a World Bank study by Paul Bretton which suggest a number of reasons for the limited impact of the EBA initiative, notably: Rules of origin which are far stricter than those obtaining in the Cotonou Agreement; Restrictive requirements for meeting the 'sufficient processing' criteria; The costs and difficulties of providing the necessary paper work. Additional reasons put forward in the paper for the relative failure of the EBA include: Recognition of the possibility of the withdrawal of these preferences, since they are unilaterally established and are not bound at the WTO; Rapidly changing EU standards (an example was cited of Mozambican prawns which met all EU standards at the point of departure but which were in violation of revised EU standards upon arrival at the EU port). While it is recognised that the EU is not the only country where SPS standards can pose a problem to LDC exporters, it argues that EU standards are particularly burdensome, since they increasingly go beyond the CODEX system. LDCs are seen as facing particular problems with SPS measures, since they face difficulties not only in meeting EU standards cost effectively but also in verifying compliance with these standards where they are met. The report cites a World Bank study by John Wilson which noted that 'a 10 % increase in EU food standards decreased African exports to the EU by 11 %'. The USDA report notes that EBA exports are dominated by raw materials (<b>unroasted</b> <b>coffee,</b> undecaffeinated coffee beans, raw cotton, unmanufactured tobacco and raw cane sugar), with EU manufacturers gaining the marketing margins through processing for sale in domestic and international markets (including markets in the very LDCS which exported the raw materials). Comment: The deteriorating trade deficit of LDCs vis-à-vis the EU could be accounted for by the fluctuations in the US$/ € exchange rate. Since most LCD exports are denominated in US dollars the euro value of exports would have fallen by around 20 % over the past two years as a result of currency movements. A dramatic annual increase in LDC exports to the EU would have been needed for this phenomenon not to have manifested itself in a nominal increase in the trade deficit of LDCs with the EU. This being said, the issues raised with regard to the implementation of the EBA do need to be addressed. This could be attempted through the ACP-EU dialogue framework (since most LDCs are ACP members) with non-ACP LDC participants being invited to attend the sessions at which LDC issues are discussed. Some LDCs have undoubtedly benefited from the EBA. Ethiopia for example has been able to open up sugar exports to the EU making sugar its fifth largest export to the EU in 2002. A USDA {{analysis of}} the EBA initiative has found that the trade deficit of least [...] ...|$|E
