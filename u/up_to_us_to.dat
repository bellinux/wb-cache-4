Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, [...] "Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code.

500|$|Both clubs {{entered the}} match in differing league form. Manchester United lost 1–0 {{at home to}} Nottingham Forest on 29 September; the winning goal was scored by Stuart Pearce in the eighth minute. It was their third league defeat {{of the season and}} first at Old Trafford in seven months. By contrast, Arsenal beat Norwich City by two goals on 6 October. Five points {{separated}} the two clubs at the start of play, with Arsenal positioned second in the league table on 18 points, behind Liverpool, and Manchester United in sixth. Ferguson assessed United's title chances in his press conference before the game: [...] "At the moment, there is a group of six clubs behind Liverpool {{at the top of the}} table. It is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> keep up with that group and be ready to seize the opportunity if it presents itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Cissé's two goals, {{there had}} been {{speculation}} linking Liverpool with re-signing Michael Owen, who had left the club for Real Madrid a year earlier. Liverpool fans had even chanted Owen's name during the match, singing, [...] "There's only one Michael Owen." [...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is important for me, {{because there has been}} a lot of speculation about me of late and about my position within the club." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher stated the importance of the two goals for Cissé: [...] "Cissé wanted to prove a point – he wanted to show everyone what he can do and great credit to him. We're the players – it's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> play and the management decides which players we have." [...] Carragher confirmed that Liverpool missed their captain Gerrard, but was delighted to win the match despite this.|$|E

500|$|Owing to its {{popularity}} and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a modern version of Russell's teapot. Proponents argue that, since {{the existence of the}} invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be falsified, it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. Richard Dawkins explains, [...] "The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It is not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> disprove it." [...] Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of The Journal of Religion and Theater, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is [...] "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books The God Delusion and The Atheist Delusion.|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E

British prestige had been greatly impaired; before Norway, Americans had not doubted the Allies would win the war, but now they said, [...] "It will be <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> defend Democracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} {{figure of}} the French Enlightenment was Voltaire. Initially believing in the constructive role an enlightened monarch could play in improving {{the welfare of the}} people, he eventually came to a new conclusion: [...] "It is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> cultivate our garden". His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. Despite much persecution, Voltaire remained a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for civil rights—the right to a fair trial and freedom of religion—and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the Ancien Régime.|$|E

[...] The Chaff reviewer wrote of Jenny Green Teeth: [...] "Hayward's eclectic poetry reflects his enigmatic mind. ...

Hayward exerts a courageous strength, rebelling against his past creative constraints, and in perhaps a flush of originality and ambitious flair, has achieved a work of art." ...|$|E

Pittoni was elected to the Imperial Council with an absolute majority, representing the first constituency of Trieste (covering the old city and the suburb of San Giacomo). Although this was a major victory for his version of socialism, Pittoni noted that his League lacked cadres, and reached out to members of Italian Socialist Party (PSI), in the Kingdom of Italy, proposing that they should relocate their militancy to Trieste. He allowed a measure of nationalism to seep into his discourse, noting: [...] "It is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> also deal with the national issue."

2500|$|Second Avenue Subway {{plans for}} Phase 1 were only allowed to proceed because New York voters passed a {{transportation}} bond issue on November 8, 2005, allowing for dedicated funding allocated for that phase. Its passage {{had been seen}} as critical to its construction, but the bond was passed only by a narrow margin, with 55 percent of voters approving and 45 percent disapproving. After warning that failure to pass the act would doom the project, MTA chairman Peter S. Kalikow stated, [...] "Now it's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> complete the job." [...] On December 18, 2006, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that they would allow the MTA to commit up to $693 million in funds to begin construction of the Second Avenue Subway and that the federal share of such costs would be reimbursed with FTA transit funds, subject to appropriations and final labor certification.|$|E

At least three other crewmembers, as well as the Duff Gordons, Salomon and Stengel, denied hearing any suggestion to go back or opposing any proposition to do so. In the media later, the Duff Gordons in particular were widely criticised for what was interpreted as their callousness {{in the face of the}} disaster. For instance, as Titanic sank, Lucile reportedly commented to her secretary: [...] "There is your beautiful nightdress gone." [...] Fireman Pusey replied that she shouldn't worry about losing her belongings because she could buy more. Pusey mentioned that the crew had lost all their kit and that their pay stopped from the moment of the sinking.
