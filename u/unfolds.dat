40|$|SummaryIn {{response}} to mechanical stress, membrane proteins progress through sequences of major <b>unfolding</b> barriers, whereas soluble proteins usually must overcome only one major <b>unfolding</b> barrier. To {{gain insight into}} these markedly different <b>unfolding</b> behaviors, we applied force-probe molecular dynamics simulations and <b>unfolded</b> two β-barrel proteins, the transmembrane outer membrane protein G (OmpG) and the water-soluble green fluorescent protein (GFP). The simulations mimic with high precision the <b>unfolding</b> experiments and show that OmpG {{in the absence of}} a membrane and GFP circumvent high <b>unfolding</b> barriers by rotations and explore alternative <b>unfolding</b> pathways. Embedding OmpG in the lipid membrane restricts this search for pathways and forces the protein to cross high <b>unfolding</b> barriers. Likewise, restricting the rotation forces GFP to traverse high <b>unfolding</b> barriers in a similar manner to membrane-embedded OmpG. These results indicate that mechanically stressed proteins search alternative <b>unfolding</b> pathways by rotations and explain why membrane proteins generally show higher mechanical stability compared to water-soluble proteins...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of high-resolution {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) imaging and single-molecule force-spectroscopy was employed to <b>unfold</b> single bacterio-rhodopsins (BR) from native purple membrane patches at various physiologically relevant tempera-tures. The <b>unfolding</b> spectra reveal detailed insight into the stability of individual structural elements of BR against mechanical <b>unfolding.</b> Intermittent states in the <b>unfolding</b> process {{are associated with the}} step-wise <b>unfolding</b> of a-helices, whereas other states are associated with the <b>unfolding</b> of polypeptide loops con-necting the a-helices. It was found that the <b>unfolding</b> forces of the secondary structures considerably decreased upon increasing the temperature from 8 to 52 °C. Associated with this effect, the probability of individual <b>unfolding</b> pathways of BR was signi®cantly in¯uenced by the temperature. At lower temperatures, transmembrane a-helices and extracellular polypep-tide loops exhibited suf®cient stability to individually establish potential barriers against <b>unfolding,</b> whereas they predominantly <b>unfolded</b> collectively at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{describes an}} <b>unfolding</b> method whose principle {{is to determine}} the probability that a certain set of events has a certain range of energy. <b>Unfolding</b> methods are not related to the analyzed data and one is interested in {{the extent to which the}} <b>unfolding</b> solution encapsulates the <b>unfolding</b> variables in the data.

40|$|AbstractSingle-molecule force-clamp {{spectroscopy}} is {{a valuable}} tool to analyze <b>unfolding</b> kinetics of proteins. Previous force-clamp spectroscopy experiments have demonstrated that the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of ubiquitin deviates from the generally assumed Markovian behavior and involves the features of glassy dynamics. Here we use single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to study the <b>unfolding</b> kinetics of a computationally designed fast-folding mutant of the small protein GB 1, which shares a similar β-grasp fold as ubiquitin. By treating the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of polyproteins as the superposition of multiple identical Poisson processes, we developed a simple stochastic analysis approach to analyze the dwell time distribution of individual <b>unfolding</b> events in polyprotein <b>unfolding</b> trajectories. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of NuG 2 fulfills all criteria of a memoryless Markovian process. This result, {{in contrast with the}} complex mechanical <b>unfolding</b> behaviors observed for ubiquitin, serves as a direct experimental demonstration of the Markovian behavior for the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> of a protein and reveals the complexity of the <b>unfolding</b> dynamics among structurally similar proteins. Furthermore, we extended our method into a robust and efficient pseudo-dwell-time analysis method, which allows one to make full use of all the <b>unfolding</b> events obtained in force-clamp experiments without categorizing the <b>unfolding</b> events. This method enabled us to measure the key parameters characterizing the mechanical <b>unfolding</b> energy landscape of NuG 2 with improved precision.
