40|$|A {{total of}} 9 {{multiparous}} dromedary camels in late {{stage of lactation}} (287 ± 8 DIM; 3. 8 ± 0. 8 kg/d) were used to study the effect of manual <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation</b> on machine milking efficiency of dairy camels under intensive management condition. Experimental design consisted of 3 x 3 Latin square with 9 animals allocated randomly and equally to 3 treatment (T 1 = 60 s, T 2 = 90 s and T 3 = 120 s). All camels were machine milked twice daily. Milk yield and milk flow parameters were recorded by Lactocorder® milk meters. Udder health was evaluated by California mastitis test (CMT) and somatic cell counts (SCC). Cisternal milk was determined 14 h after milking using Atosiban®. Volumes of machine milk (MM), machine stripping milk (MSM) and residual milk (RM) were recorded in duplicate. No subclinical mastitis was detected during the experimental period {{as indicated by the}} CMT ( 25 %). The increase of <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation</b> from T 1 to T 3 decreased (p< 0. 05) the lag time (LT) (3. 83 to 2. 24 sec) in camels of G 1 and the MSM (26. 6 to 14. 8 %) as well as RM (46. 1 to 31. 4 %) in camels of G 2. Bimodal curves tended (P= 0. 08) to decrease from 43. 6 % to 28. 1 % when duration of <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation</b> increased from T 1 to T 3 in camels of G 2. In conclusion, increase duration of manual <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation</b> to 90 – 120 s ameliorate the machine milking efficiency in harder milked camels at late stage of lactation.

40|$|This {{literature}} review was prepared {{in response to}} questions from State Regulatory Agencies in the US regarding the efficacy of teat cleaning and sanitation in automatic milking systems (AMS). The {{literature review}} is presented in reverse chronological order and includes the author’s abstracts. The main focus of the review is the efficacy of teat and udder cleaning, although several notable studies on milk quality, residue avoidance and <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation</b> have also been included. A report on the pilot project authorized by the NCIMS on milk quality from AMS farms in the US is also attached. It is worthy to note that the bacterial quality of milk from AMS farms was better and the Somatic Cell Count was no different than a randomly selected cohort of diary farms in Wisconsin...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{somatic cell}} count (SCC) is used {{worldwide}} in dairy practice {{to describe the}} hygienic status of the milk and the udder health of cows. When SCC is tested on a quarter level to detect single quarters with high SCC levels of cows for practical reasons, mostly foremilk samples after prestimulation (i. e. cleaning of the udder) are used. However, SCC is usually different in different milk fractions. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was the investigation of the use of foremilk samples for the estimation of total quarter SCC. A total of 378 milkings in 19 dairy cows were performed with a special milking device to drain quarter milk separately. Foremilk samples were taken after <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation</b> and before cluster attachment. SCC was measured in foremilk samples and in total quarter milk. Total quarter milk SCC could not be predicted precisely from foremilk SCC measurements. At relatively high foremilk SCC levels (> 300 × 103 cells/ml) foremilk SCC were higher than total quarter milk. At around (50 - 300) × 103 cells/ml foremilk and total quarter SCC did not differ considerably. Most interestingly, if foremilk SCC was lower than 50 × 103 cells/ml the total quarter SCC was higher than foremilk SCC. In addition, individual cows showed dramatic variations in foremilk SCC that were not very well related to total quarter milk SCC. In conclusion, foremilk samples are useful to detect high quarter milk SCC to recognize possibly infected quarters, only if precise cell counts are not required. However, foremilk samples can be deceptive if very low cell numbers are to be detecte...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest in camel's milk for human nutrition due to its functional properties. As a result of market demands for milk production, intensive dairy camel's farms using modern machine milking have been recently estabilished around the world. Efficient milking {{are related to the}} good milking ability of animal (machine milked). Camels should be chosen with good udder and teat conformations because of its direct effects on ease of milking and milk hygiene. There are a huge variation in size of teats (length and diameter) between camels. These variations might cause some problems during machine milking and require special settings and practice during milking. Therefore, the necessity to design specific milking clusters for lactating camels, with longer and wider cups than dairy cows. Milking camels at 50 kPa and 60 pulsations/min improved milking efficiency without affecting teat condition and udder health; camels were able to let down more milk in a shorter time at higher milk flow rate. Compared to other dairy animals, camels have a very limited cisternal cavity. Therefore, insufficient <b>udder</b> and teat <b>stimulation</b> will lead to incomplete milking. It is recommended to extend the duration of <b>udder</b> and teat <b>stimulation</b> (90 to 120 sec) before milking. Further studies are needed to confirm these results during the entire lactation period. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mastitis {{is a high}} {{incidence}} disease in dairy cows. The acute stage is considered painful and inflammation can lead to hyperalgesia and thereby contribute to decreased welfare. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine changes in nociceptive responses toward cutaneous nociceptive laser stimulation (NLS) in dairy cows with experimentally induced Escherichia coli mastitis, and correlate behavioral changes in nociceptive responses to clinical and paraclinical variables. Methods Seven Danish Holstein-Friesian cows were kept in tie-stalls, where the E. coli associated mastitis was induced and laser stimulations were conducted. Measurements of rectal temperature, somatic cell counts, white blood cell counts and E. coli counts were conducted. Furthermore, scores were given for anorexia, local udder inflammation and milk appearance to quantify the local and systemic disease response. In order to quantify the nociceptive threshold, behavioral responses toward cutaneous NLS applied to six skin areas at the tarsus/metatarsus and udder hind quarters were registered at evening milking on day 0 (control) and days 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10 after experimental induction of mastitis. Results All clinical and paraclinical variables were affected by the induced mastitis. All cows were clinically ill on days 1 and 2. The cows responded behaviorally toward the NLS. For hind leg stimulation, the proportion of cows responding by stepping was higher on day 0 than days 3 and 6, and the frequency of leg movements after laser stimulation tended to decrease on day 1 compared to the other days. After <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation,</b> the proportion of cows responding by stepping was higher on day 1 than on all other days of testing. Significant correlations between the clinical and paraclinical variables of disease and the behavioral responses toward nociceptive stimulation were found. Conclusions Changes in behavioral responses coincide with peaks in local and systemic signs of E. coli mastitis. During the acute stage of E. coli mastitis nociceptive thermal stimulation on hind leg and mammary glands results in decreased behavioral responses toward nociceptive stimulation, which might be interpreted as hypoalgesia. </p...|$|E
40|$|Incontinentia lactis is a {{possible}} predisposing factor for an elevated level of intramammary infection. The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate possible causes of incontinentia lactis in dairy cows. Two farms that differed in breed composition, but that had similar average milk yields were studied: herd A, 28 kg/d, 31 Red Holstein cows; and herd B, 26 kg/d, 16 Brown Swiss cows. Herd A was classified into 2 groups: incontinentia lactis (ILA group) and control, whereas herd B was exclusively a control herd. Milk samples that represented foremilk and the main milk fraction were collected during 4 milking sessions. In addition, milk leakage samples from the ILA group were collected at different time intervals from 0 to 5 h before milking. Measurements of the teat, milk flow, fractions of cisternal and alveolar milk, intramammary pressure, and blood oxytocin pattern also were obtained. The ILA cows did not have differences in fat content between milk leakage and cisternal milk fraction. Milk fat content, however, increased during milking in response to continuous milk ejection (1. 95, 1. 99, and 4. 61 % for milk leakage, cisternal, and main milk samples, respectively). Teat canals were 9 % shorter in the ILA cows, which showed greater milk yield, peak, and average flow rates. Quarter cisternal milk yield of ILA cows tended to be greater (0. 50 vs. 0. 23 and 0. 28 kg for ILA and controls from herds A and B, respectively), whereas percentages of cistern milk and alveolar milk did not differ from controls. The greater pressure in the ILA group, both before and after manual <b>udder</b> <b>stimulation</b> (ILA: 4. 0 and 6. 4 kPa; control: 2. 0 and 5. 0 kPa, respectively), could be an important cause for the leakage. Nevertheless, the increase in IMP that occurred after udder preparation affirms that milk ejection occurred in response to the tactile teat stimulation, but not before the onset of leakage. Blood oxytocin concentration in ILA cows was low until the start of udder preparation and increased in response to the milking stimulus (reaffirming the hypothesis that milk leakage occurred in the absence of milk ejection). In conclusion, milk losses by leakage are likely due to the large amount of cisternal milk, which creates pressure and causes leakage, in the absence of milk ejection...|$|E
