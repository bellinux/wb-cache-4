5|$|Although {{he came to}} Hamburg to {{work with}} Pauli, Rabi found Otto Stern working there with two English-speaking {{postdoctoral}} fellows, Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor. Rabi soon made friends with them, and became interested in their molecular beam experiments, for which Stern would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943. Their research involved non-uniform magnetic fields, which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately. Rabi {{came up with the}} idea of using a <b>uniform</b> <b>field</b> instead, with the molecular beam at a glancing angle, so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism. This would be easier to use, and produce more accurate results. Encouraged by Stern, and greatly assisted by Taylor, Rabi managed to get his idea to work. On Stern's advice, Rabi wrote a letter about his results to Nature, which published it in February 1929, followed by a paper entitled Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen ("On the method of deflection of molecular beams") to Zeitschrift für Physik, where it was published in April.|$|E

25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of <b>uniform</b> <b>field,</b> at the expense of the volume of <b>uniform</b> <b>field</b> being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder.

We describe how stationary points can be moved over the manifold by applying external <b>uniform</b> <b>fields.</b> The manifold also {{plays an important role}} in the behavior of points of zero field. Field zeroes occur in two distinct types, in separate regions of space divided by the manifold. Pairs of zeroes of opposite type can be created or annihilated on the manifold. Finally, we give examples of the manifold for cases of practical interest. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "center of mass" [...] {{in the form}} of the center of gravity was first {{introduced}} by the ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer Archimedes of Syracuse. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a <b>uniform</b> <b>field,</b> thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the torque exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point—their center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.|$|E

We first derive an over-determined boundary value problem in the shell of the neutral inclusion, and then prove in the isotropic case that if the over- determined problem admits a solution, then the core and the shell must be concentric balls. As a consequence it is proved that the structure is neutral to all <b>uniform</b> <b>fields</b> {{if and only if}} it consists of concentric balls provided that the coefficient of the core is larger than that of the shell...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{completed}} fabrication and preliminary testing of a 12 -channel SQUID array using the superconducting image-surface gradiometer concept. Sensor response to point dipole magnetic sources, and <b>uniform</b> <b>fields</b> used to simulate ambient magnetic fields followed predicted values to high precision. Edge effects were not observed for sources, within 5 cm {{of the center}} of the imaging surface independent of whether the source is close or far from the surface. The superconducting imaging-surface also reduced <b>uniform</b> ambient <b>fields</b> at the SQUID sensors by approximately a factor of ten. Finally, a high degree of symmetry was observed between sides of the imaging surface for <b>uniform</b> <b>fields.</b> This symmetry, together with the very small sensitivity of sensors on {{the back side of the}} imaging surface to sources close to the front side provides an excellent circumstance for implementing either digital or analog background rejection. Their goal is to implement a higher density array with the superconducting imaging surface, together with background rejection, and utilize this system for MCG and other biomagnetic studies...|$|R
