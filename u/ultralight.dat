5000|$|Many of {{the early}} <b>ultralights</b> used a [...] "weight shift" [...] method of control, {{requiring}} the pilot to push a control bar to shift {{the center of gravity}} of the aircraft. The Weedhopper differed from most other <b>ultralights</b> of the period in that it has a control stick which moves the rudder and elevator, giving it two axis control in pitch and yaw. The pronounced dihedral of the wings, along with the swept leading edge causes it to bank into the turn, and results in a very stable, easy-to-fly aircraft. The Weedhopper differs from many of the other early <b>ultralights</b> in that it had a strut-braced wing, whereas most period <b>ultralights</b> have wire-braced wings.|$|R
