25|$|Juddering, shuddering and moaning: This {{is caused}} by an {{irregular}} and <b>unstable</b> <b>flow</b> from the second stage, It {{may be caused by}} a slight positive feedback between flow rate in the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, but enough to cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are tuned for maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the valve spring pressure often stops this problem. Juddering may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this study, the {{relation}} between the interior and the surface dynamics for nonlinear baroclinically <b>unstable</b> <b>flows</b> is examined using the concepts of potential vorticity. First, it is demonstrated that baroclinic <b>unstable</b> <b>flows</b> present the property that the potential vorticity mesoscale and submesoscale anomalies in the ocean interior are strongly correlated to the surface density anomalies. Then, using the invertibility of potential vorticity, the dynamics are decomposed in terms of a solution forced by the three-dimensional (3 D) potential vorticity and a solution forced by the surface boundary condition in density. It is found that, in the upper oceanic layers, the balanced flow induced only by potential vorticity is strongly anticorrelated with that induced only by the surface density with a dominance of the latter. The major consequence is that the 3 D balanced motions can be determined from only the surface density and the characteristics of the basin-scale stratification by solving an elliptic equation. These properties allow for the possibility to reconstruct the 3 D balanced velocity field of the upper layers from just the knowledge of the surface density by using a simpler model, that is, an “effective” surface quasigeostrophic model. All these results are validated through the examination of a primitive equation simulation reproducing the dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current...|$|R
