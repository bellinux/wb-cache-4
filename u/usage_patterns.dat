5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy <b>usage</b> <b>patterns</b> have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} {{orthologous}} or homologous genes can be analysed {{in terms of}} {{the presence or absence of}} group members in the reference genomes; such patterns are called phylogenetic profiles. To find HGT events, phylogenetic profiles are scanned for an unusual distribution of genes. Absence of a homolog in some members of a group of closely related species is an indication that the examined gene might have arrived via an HGT event. For example, the three facultatively symbiotic Frankia sp. strains are of strikingly different sizes: 5.43 Mbp, 7.50 Mbp and 9.04 Mbp, depending on their range of hosts. Marked portions of strain-specific genes were found to have no significant hit in the reference database, and were possibly acquired by HGT transfers from other bacteria. Similarly, the three phenotypically diverse Escherichia coli strains (uropathogenic, enterohemorrhagic and benign) share about 40% of the total combined gene pool, with the other 60% being strain-specific genes and consequently HGT candidates. Further evidence for these genes resulting from HGT was their strikingly different codon <b>usage</b> <b>patterns</b> from the core genes and a lack of gene order conservation (order conservation is typical of vertically evolved genes). The presence/absence of homologs (or their effective count) can thus be used by programs to reconstruct the most likely evolutionary scenario along the species tree. Just as with reconciliation methods, this can be achieved through parsimonious or probabilistic estimation of the number of gain and loss events. Models can be complexified by adding processes, like the truncation of genes, but also by modelling the heterogeneity of rates of gain and loss across lineages and/or gene families.|$|E
25|$|Construction of SkyTrain fare {{gates was}} {{completed}} in May 2014 but they remained unclosed until April 2016 owing to multiple system problems. While open for the nearly two-year period, holders of paper-based monthly passes, bus-issued transfers, and FareSaver tickets continued {{to pass through the}} gates into the stations' fare-paid zones unimpeded, although they were subject to having their fare inspected by transit security or transit police once inside the fare-paid zone. Starting in April 2016, they were initially fully closed only during peak hours, with one gate remaining open during off-peak times for people with accessibility issues who could not reach their Compass Cards to the fare gates to tap in or out. Full implementation of the fare gates was also delayed by problems with Compass Cards when riders were tapping out as they exited buses. The tapping-out process on buses was too slow and did not always record the tap which—because the system initially deducted a three-zone fare until a tap-out was recorded and a refund was issued to those having only travelled one or two zones—often resulted in customers being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they had only travelled through one or two. This was a serious setback for TransLink as the entire system was supposed to be operational by 2013. A solution was finally implemented where the requirement to tap out of buses was removed and all bus travel was considered as within a single zone, creating significant savings for those travelling multiple zones using buses only and in some cases changing transit <b>usage</b> <b>patterns.</b> The last fare gates left open for users with accessibility issues were closed on July 25, 2016, and the system has been in full operation since.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe swine-origin {{influenza}} A (H 1 N 1) virus (S-OIV) {{has come}} to the forefront since 2009 and was identified as a new reassortant strain. The hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates virus binding, contains antigenic regions recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and is associated with viral cross-species infection and adaption. The comparison study of codon usage preferences in influenza viral genomes was less extensive. In this study, we used codon <b>usage</b> <b>pattern</b> analyses to validate the adaption and origins of S-OIV. MethodsCodon <b>usage</b> <b>pattern</b> was used to estimate the host adaption of S-OIVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene was conducted to understand the phylogeny of H 1 N 1 viruses isolated from different hosts. Amino acid signature pattern on antigenic sites of HA was analyzed to understand the antigenic characteristics. ResultsResults of phylogenetic analyses of HA gene indicate that S-OIVs group in identical clusters. The synonymous codon <b>usage</b> <b>pattern</b> analyses indicate that the effective number of codons versus GC content at the third codon position in the HA 1 gene slightly differ from those in swine H 1 N 1 and gradually adapted to human. Our data indicate that S-OIV evolution occurred according to positive selection within these antigenic regions. A comparison of antigenic site amino acids reveals similar signature patterns between S-OIV and 1918 human influenza strains. ConclusionThis study proposes a new and effective way {{to gain a better understanding}} of the features of the S-OIV genome and evolutionary processes based on the codon <b>usage</b> <b>pattern.</b> It is useful to trace influenza viral origins and cross-species virus transmission...|$|R
