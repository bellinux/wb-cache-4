5|$|In 2006, a pet-quality Singapura in the UK cost £300-400 (US$500-600 USD) while a show {{specimen}} {{can cost}} <b>upwards</b> of £600. At present pet-quality Singapuras can cost £800-900 (US$1,300-1,500 USD) while show specimens go for <b>upwards</b> of £1,000.|$|E
5|$|Since cats lack lips {{to create}} suction, {{they use a}} lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid <b>upwards</b> into their mouths. Lapping {{at a rate of}} four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue {{to the surface of the}} water, and quickly retracts it, drawing water <b>upwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|The queue turns left {{again and}} follows an <b>upwards</b> {{path to the}} station.|$|E
5|$|A lesion in the {{posterior}} fossa {{can be detected}} by asking the patient to roll his or her eyes <b>upwards</b> (Parinaud's syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{also the}} home of Rising Phoenix Cheer, a {{successful}} competitive Allstar Cheerleading programme for athletes from age 5 <b>upwards,</b> training at Aldworth school.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and <b>upwards,</b> and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and <b>upwards.</b> The <b>upwards</b> components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{rumination}} {{syndrome is}} non-invasive {{and based on}} {{a history of the}} individual. Treatment is promising, with <b>upwards</b> of 85% of individuals responding positively to treatment, including infants and the mentally handicapped.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Columbia was in {{the path}} of totality for the Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. The city was expecting <b>upwards</b> of 400,000 {{tourists}} coming to the city to view the eclipse.|$|E
5|$|Male adults may patrol individually, {{but most}} congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a {{characteristic}} up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it <b>upwards</b> and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted <b>upwards.</b> Females fly into these swarms, and mating {{takes place in}} the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent <b>upwards,</b> and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before flying off.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} {{is given}} by an angle that can assume values between -90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates <b>upwards</b> as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate <b>upwards</b> until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Upwards</b> of 90 {{dead bodies}} were found and cremated, while the wounded were sent to British hospitals; {{the rest of the}} fort was then razed to the ground.|$|E
5|$|W. : When {{the newly}} formed FA Premier League split from the Football League, the {{remaining}} divisions of the Football League were renumbered <b>upwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|When disturbed, most leap <b>upwards</b> about 100 to 150mm, {{often from}} the cryptic rest pose, and often {{over a wide}} trajectory. Usually Portia then either freezes or runs about 100mm and then freezes.|$|E
5|$|When feeding, this flycatcher makes many short {{flights from}} perch to perch, preferring to hunt in shrubs with small leaves, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} genera Adesmia, Baccharis, and Porlieria. A tit-tyrant tends to land near {{the base of the}} shrub and make its way <b>upwards</b> while frequently flicking its tail <b>upwards</b> and shuddering its wings. It has also been observed pivoting on its perch throughout this process. While foraging, the tufted tit-tyrant averages three attacks on prey items per minute. Its feeding style has been compared to that of a kinglet.|$|E
5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and <b>upwards</b> along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|All races must {{be started}} by {{the report of the}} starter's gun or {{approved}} starting apparatus fired <b>upwards</b> after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position. An athlete may not touch either the start line or {{the ground in front of}} it with their hands or feet when on their marks.|$|E
5|$|Binary {{systems of}} sub-brown dwarfs are {{theoretically}} possible; Oph 162225-240515 was initially {{thought to be}} a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses <b>upwards</b> to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.|$|E
5|$|Chad {{is listed}} as a failed state by the Fund for Peace (FFP). In 2007 Chad had the seventh highest score on the failed state index. Since then the trend has been <b>upwards</b> each year. Chad had the fourth highest score (behind Sudan) on the Failed State Index of 2012 and , is ranked fifth.|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{gathered}} across Tyrone {{the following}} day to celebrate {{the arrival of the}} Sam Maguire Cup. The players' homecoming began at Aughnacloy before moving on to Ballygawley and Omagh, where <b>upwards</b> of 40,000 fans gathered. Despite their defeat, Armagh were greeted by hundreds of fans on the LouthArmagh border on their return.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the end of World War II, many MP 40s were {{captured}} or surrendered (<b>upwards</b> of 200,000) to the Allies and were then redistributed to the paramilitary and irregular forces of some developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Following its May 1943 {{debut in}} action, {{during the second}} half of 1943, Schnaufer and his crew began experimenting with {{upward-firing}} autocannons, dubbed Schräge Musik. This allowed the night fighter to approach and attack the bombers from below—outside the enemy crew's usual field of view. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped night fighter typically came as a complete surprise to the bomber crew, who realised a night fighter was close by only when they came under fire. It is not exactly known when Schnaufer's Bf 110 was equipped with Schräge Musik. Rumpelhardt stated that the weapons system was installed prior to his return from officer training. It is also not exactly known how many of his victories had been claimed using the <b>upwards</b> firing cannons. According to Fritz Engau, who had known Schnaufer since Flugzeugführerschule C 3, 20 to 30 of Schnaufer's aerial victories had been claimed using <b>upwards</b> firing guns.|$|E
5|$|If a country's {{authorities}} wish to devalue {{or prevent}} appreciation against market forces exerting <b>upwards</b> {{pressure on the}} currency, and retain control of interest rates, as is usually the case, they will need capital controls in place—due to conditions that arise from the impossible trinity trilemma.|$|E
5|$|If disturbed, most Portia species leap <b>upwards</b> about 100 to 150millimetres, {{often from}} the cryptic rest pose, and often {{over a wide}} trajectory. Usually Portia then either freezes or runs about 100millimetres and then freezes. However, P. fimbriata in Queensland rarely runs or leaps.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the people}} who live around Lake Toba are ethnically Bataks. Traditional Batak houses are noted for their {{distinctive}} roofs (which curve <b>upwards</b> at each end, as a boat's hull does) and their colorful decor.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds with the unusual ability to climb down trees head-first, unlike other birds {{which can only}} go <b>upwards.</b> There are about 24 species worldwide, one breeding in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds. They have the unusual ability to climb down trees head first, unlike most other birds {{which can only}} go <b>upwards.</b> Nuthatches have big heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds. They have the unusual ability to climb down trees head first, unlike other birds {{which can only}} go <b>upwards.</b> Nuthatches have big heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet. Three species have been recorded in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds. They have the unusual ability to climb down trees head first, unlike other birds, {{which can only}} go <b>upwards.</b> Nuthatches have large heads, short tails and powerful bills and feet.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs' hip sockets are {{oriented}} facing slightly <b>upwards,</b> and {{the head}} of the femur (thigh bone) is only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the thigh into a horizontal position during flight, as gliding lizards do.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to primary}} {{education}} in other countries, from years one to seven, the same teacher teaches the pupils {{all of their}} subjects. From year eight <b>upwards,</b> pupils receive teaching {{from a number of}} different teachers (this marks the boundary between primary education and lower secondary education). Groups may be mixed around year by year.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is divided into}} a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends <b>upwards</b> to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the winds are slow, but {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E
5|$|The {{circle is}} the only simple closed curve that {{maintains}} its shape under the curve-shortening flow, but some curves that cross themselves or have infinite length keep their shape, including the grim reaper curve, an infinite curve that translates <b>upwards,</b> and spirals that rotate while remaining {{the same size and}} shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{delays in}} the {{production}} process and the rush to deliver the film by the MGM/UA-imposed deadline of December 1997 drove the costs <b>upwards</b> to $110million, although the film recouped $338.9million at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows <b>upwards</b> and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate <b>upwards,</b> coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|The hubs of orb webs, {{where the}} spiders lurk, are usually above the center, as the spiders can move {{downwards}} faster than <b>upwards.</b> If {{there is an}} obvious direction in which the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators, the hub is usually offset towards that direction.|$|E
5|$|The merit {{component}} was {{a nominal}} sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from {{the foot of}} the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, 5 places counting <b>upwards,</b> and received 5 x £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).|$|E
