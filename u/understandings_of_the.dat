40|$|Abstract Our {{focus in}} {{this paper is to}} {{investigate}} Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault´s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socially constructed subject. We will focus on Bourdieu´s concept of habitus and Foucault´s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disciplinary power as two key concepts in the socially constructed subject. We have used the comparative method to build up the discussion where we will investigate similarities in <b>the</b> two thinkers <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon. The discussion helps clarifying where Bourdieu´s and Foucault´s view on the socially constructed subject, can be understood or misunderstood as deterministic. Furthermore we will discover whether or not <b>the</b> two theorists <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject includes <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> free will. <b>The</b> paper will end in a conclusion that clarifies Bourdieu and Foucault´s <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socially constructed subjects possibilities to reconstruct him- or herself...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive intent <b>of</b> advertising, {{which was}} defined as their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> advertisements to persuade people to buy the advertised products. Previous research has found age-related changes in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> this <b>understanding.</b> However, {{little is known about}} <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> developmental changes in this <b>understanding.</b> A series <b>of</b> 6 experimental studies explored children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive intent <b>of</b> advertising and their scepticism towards advertisements in relation to their theory of mind and their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marketplace. Children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive intent <b>of</b> advertising and their scepticism towards advertisements were assessed in interviews. Established false belief tasks were used to assess children's theory of mind, and novel measures were developed to measure children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marketplace. It was found that children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive intent <b>of</b> advertising was positively related to their second order theory of mind and to their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> how advertising is causally related to economic variables such as sales and demand. However, children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive intent <b>of</b> advertising was not related to their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> persuasion in social contexts. Moreover, children who recognised <b>the</b> persuasive intent <b>of</b> advertising did not necessarily evaluate advertisements on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advertisers' motives. Rather, children who believed <b>the</b> priority <b>of</b> businesses was to pursue financial gain, rather than to serve <b>the</b> welfare <b>of</b> customers, {{were more likely to be}} sceptical towards advertisements because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advertisers' self-serving interests. This thesis provides some evidence that <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> children's <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> advertising is related to their cognitive development and their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marketplace.

25|$|As time passed, {{theologians and}} {{philosophers}} developed more precise <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature of God {{and began to}} produce systematic lists of his attributes (i.e., qualities or characteristics). These varied in detail, but traditionally the attributes fell into two groups, those based on negation (God is impassible) and those positively based on eminence (God is infinitely good). Ian Ramsey suggested {{that there are three}} groups and that some attributes such as simplicity and perfection have a different logical dynamic which from such attributes as infinite goodness since there are relative forms of the latter but not of the former.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Luria reinterpreted and recast {{the whole}} scheme of Kabbalah in the 16th century, {{essentially}} making {{the second of}} two {{different versions of the}} Kabbalah: the Medieval (the initial, direct <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zohar, later synthesised by Moshe Cordovero) and the Lurianic. However, he understood his new doctrine as no more than a new revelation-teaching of the true meaning of the Zohar. Lurianic Kabbalah became the dominant Kabbalistic system, displacing Cordovero's, and afterwards the Zohar was read in its light. Lurianic Kabbalists sought to integrate this with the Cordoverian scheme, seeing both as true, but describing different aspects ("Worlds") of the Divine process.|$|E

25|$|The term magic {{comes from}} the Old Persian magu, a word that applied {{to a form of}} {{religious}} functionary about which little is known. During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, this term was adopted into Ancient Greek, where it was used with negative connotations, to apply to religious rites that were regarded as fraudulent, unconventional, and dangerous. This meaning of the term was then adopted by Latin in the first century BCE. The concept was then incorporated into Christian theology during the first century CE, where magic was associated with demons and thus defined against religion. This concept was pervasive throughout the Middle Ages, although in the early modern period Italian humanists reinterpreted the term in a positive sense to establish the idea of natural magic. Both negative and positive <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term were retained in Western culture over the following centuries, with the former largely influencing early academic usages of the word.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the {{development}} of opera in the 17th century that vocal pedagogy began to break away from some of the established thinking of the monastic writers and develop deeper <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical process of singing and its relation to key concepts like vocal registration and vocal resonation. It was also during this time, that noted voice teachers began to emerge. Giulio Caccini is an example of an important early Italian voice teacher. In the late 17th century, the bel canto method of singing began to develop in Italy. This style of singing had a huge impact on the development of opera and the development of vocal pedagogy during the Classical and Romantic periods. It was during this time, that teachers and composers first began to identify singers by and write roles for more specific voice types. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that more clearly defined voice classification systems like the German Fach system emerged. Within these systems, more descriptive terms were used in classifying voices such as coloratura soprano and lyric soprano.|$|E

25|$|On October 23 the {{day after}} the Spanish had ordered a dispersal, leading {{elements}} of the English fleet had started to return to Falmouth, Plymouth and Dartmouth but amazingly had completely missed the retreating Spanish fleet. At one point both fleets English and Spanish were on converging lines with one another. Essex on arrival soon learned from Mountjoy of the situation and both were surprised as each other as to how the English fleet had missed the Spanish. Essex immediately wrote letter to letter to parliament and the Queen in order to salvage the situation. Initially he was invested by the Queen with full powers sent down to him; the channel squadron was ordered to join his flag. The government soon after were impressed by his actions and <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intentions of the Spanish fleet; the capture of Falmouth or Milford Haven or the interception of the English fleet from the Azores. However soon after in one spirited letter by the Queen he was given a back hand by her for his failings in the Azores and the addition of England having been left unguarded. Essex immediately went to Court to explain his actions but was to be met by an icy disapproval from the Queen after which he went home to Wanstead to nurse his misery. Howard of Effingham in Essex's absence were given the command of the fleet to make sure the threat was alleviated.|$|E

This understanding of literature as a totality can be used to trace the development of the art, unlimited by differences between languages. Within this comparative literature other supernational literatures, which may be based on language families and schools, are also apparent. There are also national literatures which, although possibly of the same language, will still have thematic differentiations. These are also worthy of study.|$|E
500|$|Cochrane is {{critical}} {{of the use of}} claims about dignity in debates about the genetic engineering of nonhuman animals, in questions about the use of nonhuman animals in human entertainment, and in the bioethics literature. He holds that nonhuman animals do not possess an interest against being treated in undignified ways, and endorses [...] "undignified bioethics"—bioethics without the concept of dignity. Cochrane has sympathy for the standard criticisms of dignity in bioethics (that the concept is indeterminate, reactionary and redundant), and, in a 2010 paper, defends these criticisms against counter-claims from those who endorse various understandings of dignity. The bioethicist Inmaculada de Melo-Martín responded to Cochrane's article, claiming that the problems Cochrane identifies are problems with common <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts of dignity, not with the concepts themselves, and arguing that Cochrane's conclusion leads to a conception of bioethics almost devoid of ethics.|$|E
