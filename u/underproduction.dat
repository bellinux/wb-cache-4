5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant. Functional disorders can cause inflammation as can some other forms of thyroiditis. Functional disorders can result in the overproduction or <b>underproduction</b> of hormones. Any of the functional thyroid disorders can result in the gland's enlargement and cause a swollen neck termed a goitre.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, <b>underproduction</b> or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to <b>underproduction</b> of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E
40|$|Research {{shows that}} {{psychological}} time (i. e., the subjective experience {{and assessment of}} the passage of time) is malleable and that {{the central nervous system}} re-calibrates temporal information in accordance with situational factors so that psychological time flows slower or faster. Observed motion-speed (e. g., the visual perception of a rolling ball) is an important situational factor which influences the production of time estimates. The present study examines previous findings showing that observed slow and fast motion-speed during video playback respectively results in over- and <b>underproductions</b> of intervals of time. Here, we investigated through three separate experiments: a) the main effect of observed motion-speed during video playback on a time production task and b) the interactive effect of the frame rate (frames per second; fps) and motion-speed during video playback on a time production task. No main effect of video playback-speed or interactive effect between video playback-speed and frame rate was found on time production...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} compare {{technical}} efficiency of general practice (GP) {{delivered by the}} twenty Regions of Italy's decentralized healthcare system and to determine if it was affected by contextual factors. Methods: First, we calculated the Regional efficiency scores by means of Data Envelopment Analysis. Then we carried out a regression analysis to investigate the influence of contextual factors on the efficiency {{in the provision of}} GP services. Results: Six Northern Regions were identified as efficient using the best combinations of general practitioners to deliver a given level of GP outcomes. Compared with peer benchmarks, inefficient Regions used more (on-call and regular) general practitioners with important <b>underproductions</b> of outputs (e. g. avoidable hospitalizations). The regression analysis showed a negative relationship between efficiency and the Regional total health care expenditures as percentage of its Gross Domestic Product. Discussion: Improving efficiency of GP services delivery is likely to result in reduced health expenditures. Since there is a general tendency in Europe to decentralize governmental systems of countries and Italy can be seen as an extreme example of this trend, we consider our findings of high relevance for international comparative studies on performance of primary care systems.

25|$|Cortisol {{deficiency}} in CAH is usually partial, {{and not the}} most serious problem for an affected person. Synthesis of cortisol shares steps with synthesis of mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone, androgens such as testosterone, and estrogens such as estradiol. The resulting excessive or deficient production of these three classes of hormones produce the most important problems for people with CAH. Specific enzyme inefficiencies are associated with characteristic patterns of over- or <b>underproduction</b> of mineralocorticoids or sex steroids.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of privileged groups {{may not be}} a complete solution to the free rider problem, however, as <b>underproduction</b> of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his street light, making it possible that the street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.|$|E
25|$|HBB {{blockage}} {{over time}} leads to decreased beta-chain synthesis. The body's inability to construct new beta-chains {{leads to the}} <b>underproduction</b> of HbA. Reductions in HbA available overall to fill the red blood cells in turn leads to microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia ultimately develops in respect to inadequate HBB protein for sufficient red blood cell functioning. Due to this factor, the patient may require blood transfusions {{to make up for}} the blockage in the beta-chains. Repeated blood transfusions can lead to build-up of iron overload, ultimately resulting in iron toxicity. This iron toxicity can cause various problems, including myocardial siderosis and heart failure leading to the patient’s death.|$|E

2500|$|Academic {{dishonesty}} {{also creates}} problems for teachers. In economic terms, cheating causes an <b>underproduction</b> of knowledge, where the professor's {{job is to}} produce knowledge. [...] Moreover, a case of cheating often will cause emotional distress to faculty members, many considering {{it to be a}} personal slight against them or a violation of their trust. Dealing with academic misconduct is often one of the worst parts of a career in education, one survey claiming that 77% of academics agreed with the statement [...] "dealing with a cheating student {{is one of the most}} onerous aspects of the job".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the modern}} epoch of financialization, the main {{criticism}} of Mandel's {{idea is that}} overaccumulation can combine with <b>underproduction,</b> if it is safer (or more profitable) to invest in solidly insured non-productive assets. Martin Wolf states: [...] "the world economy has been generating more savings than businesses wish to use, even at very low interest rates." [...] Joseph Stiglitz similarly argues that from the 1990s onward, banks lent more and more money to investors who mainly did not use it to create new business, but to speculate in already existing assets for capital gain, thereby pushing up asset prices.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{within a}} species, {{different}} variants of hemoglobin always exist, although one sequence {{is usually a}} [...] "most common" [...] one in each species. Mutations in the genes for the hemoglobin protein in a species result in hemoglobin variants. Many of these mutant forms of hemoglobin cause no disease. Some of these mutant forms of hemoglobin, however, cause a group of hereditary diseases termed the hemoglobinopathies. The best known hemoglobinopathy is sickle-cell disease, {{which was the first}} human disease whose mechanism was understood at the molecular level. A (mostly) separate set of diseases called thalassemias involves <b>underproduction</b> of normal and sometimes abnormal hemoglobins, through problems and mutations in globin gene regulation. All these diseases produce anemia.|$|E
2500|$|Storage of {{agricultural}} products for price stabilization {{has also been}} used in modern times in many countries, including the United States. The term [...] "ever-normal granary" [...] itself was adopted from a Columbia University dissertation on Confucian economic practice by future US Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace around 1926 (some time before he came into office). Wallace brought the term {{into the mainstream of}} American agro-political thinking after the 1934 drought. One example of this idea is presented by Benjamin Graham in his book, Storage and Stability, which was written in 1937 during the Great Depression. Graham suggested that much like years of high agricultural yields, years of overproduction of commodities in general could be neutralized by storing commodities until periods of <b>underproduction.</b> This idea was in response to the overproduction of goods during the depression, and the desire to preserve jobs and keep prices stable during this time.|$|E

50|$|Normocytic anemia is {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen type of anemia. This type of anemia is usually caused by <b>underproduction</b> of blood cells as well as hemolysis. Anemia {{can be caused by}} either overproduction or <b>underproduction</b> of red blood cells as well as the production of defective blood cells. Because there are more red blood cells needed in the body at that moment, they are released prematurely, leading to polychromasia.|$|E

5000|$|James O'Connor {{argues for}} a [...] "second contradiction" [...] of <b>underproduction,</b> to {{complement}} Marx's [...] "first" [...] contradiction {{of capital and}} labor. While the second contradiction is often considered a theory of environmental degradation, O'Connor's theory in fact goes much further. Building {{on the work of}} Karl Polanyi, along with Marx, O'Connor argues that capitalism necessarily undermines the [...] "conditions of production" [...] necessary to sustain the endless accumulation of capital. These conditions of production include soil, water, energy, and so forth. But they also include an adequate public education system, transportation infrastructures, and other services that are not produced directly by capital, but which capital needs in order accumulate effectively. As the conditions of production are exhausted, the costs of production for capital increase. For this reason, the second contradiction generates an <b>underproduction</b> crisis tendency, with the rising cost of inputs and labor, to complement the overproduction tendency of too many commodities for too few customers. Like Marx's contradiction of capital and labor, the second contradiction therefore threatens the system's existence.|$|E
