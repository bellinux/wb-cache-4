50|$|Vesosome multicompartment {{structure}} encapsulates unilamellar liposomes {{within a}} second bilayer. For this purpose, it’s necessary to form bilayers {{that can be}} opened and closed at will, without disrupting the inner content. This is achieved by adding ethanol {{to a variety of}} saturated phospholipids in its gel phase, which drives interdigitation of phospholipids bilayers and subsequent fusion of small vesicles to form flat bilayer sheets. These are steady to removal of the residual ethanol <b>until</b> <b>heated</b> above the lipid chain melting temperature (Tm). The bilayers become flexible, and the sheets spontaneously close on themselves to form unilamellar vesicles. During the closure, the sheets can entrap whatever is around in suspension. By adding the vesicles aggregates including drug-loaded vesicles to the pelleted sheets before heating the mixture, encapsulation is carried out to form vesosomes.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common types of TLDs are calcium {{fluoride}} and lithium fluoride, {{with one or}} more impurities to produce trap states for energetic electrons.

Other types include beryllium oxide, calcium sulfate doped with Tm. As the radiation interacts with the crystal it causes electrons in the crystal's atoms to jump to higher energy states, where they stay trapped due to intentionally introduced impurities (usually manganese or magnesium) in the crystal, <b>until</b> <b>heated.</b> Heating the crystal causes the electrons to drop back to their ground state, releasing a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the trap state and the ground state.|$|E
50|$|The acid in {{a baking}} powder can be either {{fast-acting}} or slow-acting. A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a slow-acting acid will not react <b>until</b> <b>heated</b> in an oven. Baking powders that contain both fast- and slow-acting acids are double-acting; those that contain only one acid are single-acting.

Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot. Common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate (also called calcium acid phosphate). High-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate, sodium aluminum phosphate, and sodium acid pyrophosphate. Despite very low acute toxicity, exposure to aluminum salts has raised concerns regarding potential neurotoxicity.|$|E

40|$|Mg/Al-hydrotalcites {{containing}} NO 3 -, Cl-, SO 42 - or ClO 4 - were synthesised under N 2 {{to prevent}} incorporation of CO 32 -. The {{presence of the}} anions in the hydrotalcite structure was confirmed by infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The CO 3 - and the NO 3 -hydrotalcites contained both NO 3 - and CO 32 -, while the Cl-hydrotalcite also contained some CO 32 -. It is known that during thermal treatment of hydrotalcites dehydroxylation and decarbonisation strongly overlap. Mass spectrometry following TGA enables one to identify both reactions. For CO 3 -hydrotalcite CO 2 is released simultaneously with water (dehydroxylation) around 335 degrees Celsius followed by NO around 365 and 500 degrees Celsius. The stability of the NO 3 -hydrotalcite is different showing a major loss of CO 2 and H 2 O (dehydroxylation) around 410 degrees Celsius with losses of NO around 345 and 450 degrees Celsius. The Cl-hydrotalcite shows a similar behaviour for the H 2 O loss (dehydroxylation), but Cl is lost over a range from 400 to 900 degrees Celsius and CO 2 comes off in steps around 360 and 500 degrees Celsius. Completely different is the thermal behaviour of SO 4 - and ClO 4 -hydrotalcites. SO 4 -hydrotalcite shows a gradual weight-loss due to dehydroxylation with two minor water peaks around 260 and 375 degrees Celsius, while the sulphate remains in the structure. The sulphate is not lost <b>until</b> <b>heated</b> to 900 degrees Celsius. The ClO 4 -hydrotalcite shows a complex thermal behaviour with 2 steps of water loss around 375 and 440 degrees Celsius, where the second step is accompanied {{by the loss of}} O 2.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of developing a}} method for making monodisperse, unagglomerated spherical particles greater than 50 nm in diameter was demonstrated. Carbonaceous particles were made by pyrolyzing ethylene with a pulsed CO 2 laser, thereby creating a non-equilibrium mixture of carbon, hydrogen, hydrocarbon vapors, and unpyrolyzed ethylene. Via a complex series of reactions, the carbon and hydrocarbon vapors quickly condensed into the spherical particles. By cooling and dispersing them in a supersonic expansion immediately after their creation, the hot newly-formed spheres were prevented from colliding and coalescing, thus preventing the problem of agglomeration which as plagued other investigators studying laser-simulated particle formation. The cold particles could be left suspended in the residual gases indefinitely without agglomerating. Their uniform sizes and unagglomerated nature were visualized by collecting the particles on filters that were subsequently examined using electron microscopy. It was found the mean particle size can be coarsely controlled by varying the initial ethylene pressure, and can be finely controlled by varying the fluence (energy/unit area) with which the laser irradiates the gas. The motivating application for this research was to manufacture particles that could be used as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) seeds in high-temperature high-speed flows. Though the particles made in this program will not evaporate <b>until</b> <b>heated</b> to about 3000 K, and thus could serve as LDV seeds in some applications, they are not ideal when the hot atmosphere is also oxidizing. In that situation, ceramic materials would be preferable. Research performed elsewhere has demonstrated that selected ceramic materials can be manufactured by laser pyrolysis of appropriate supply gases. It is anticipated that, when the same gases are used in conjunction with the rapid cooling technique, unagglomerated spherical ceramic particles can be made with little difficulty. Such particles would also be valuable to manufacturers of ceramic or abrasive products, and this technique may find its greatest commercial potential in those areas...|$|E

40|$|Sealing {{materials}} {{that can be}} applied and left in place in vacuum over a wide range of temperatures (especially temperatures of a few thousand degrees Celsius) have been conceived and investigated for potential utility in repairing thermal-protection tiles on the space shuttles in orbit before returning to Earth. These materials are also adaptable to numerous terrestrial applications that involve vacuum processing and/or repair of structures that must withstand high temperatures. These materials can be formulated to have mechanical handling characteristics ranging from almost freely flowing liquid-like consistency through paste-like consistency to stiff puttylike consistency, and to retain these characteristics in vacuum <b>until</b> <b>heated</b> to high curing temperatures. A sealing material of this type can be formulated to be used in any of several different ways for example, to be impregnated into a high-temperature-fabric patch, impregnated into a high-temperature-fabric gasket for sealing a patch, applied under a patch, or applied alone in the manner of putty or wallboard compound. The sealing material must be formulated to be compatible with, and adhere to, the structural material(s) to be repaired. In general, the material consists of a vacuum-compatible liquid containing one or more dissolved compound(s) and/or mixed with suspended solid particles. Depending on the intended application, the liquid can be chosen to be of a compound that can remain in place in vacuum for a time long enough to be useful, and/or to evaporate or decompose in a controlled way to leave a useful solid residue behind. The evaporation rate is determined by proper choice of vapor pressure, application of heat, and/or application of ultraviolet light or other optical radiation.

40|$|Inadequate {{yields of}} PCR product and the {{generation}} of nonspecific PCR products can complicate genotyping studies, particu-larly when the DNA template is of inferior quality and/or has a low-copy number. In this study, the ability of AmpliTaq GoldÔ DNA Polymerase to enhance the specificity and yield of amplification was evaluated in a quadruplex short tandem repeat (STR) sys-tem in which a nonspecific PCR product and poor yield had been previously observed with AmpliTaqÒ DNA Polymerase usage. Because AmpliTaq Gold is inactive <b>until</b> <b>heated</b> during the PCR before thermal cy-cling, effects similar to those achieved with “hot-start ” PCR were attained in a fast, sim-ple and practical fashion. A significant en-hancement in yield at the four STR loci and improved balance of alleles resulted {{with the use of}} AmpliTaq Gold. Furthermore, a non-specific PCR product, the result of misprim-ing, was effectively eliminated. The consis-tency of quality results was improved, thereby promoting successful typing of sub-optimal DNA samples and enhancing the ac-curacy of genotyping. Since PCR product yield is elevated with AmpliTaq Gold usage, and consistent performance and low back-ground are achieved with higher amounts of AmpliTaq Gold compared with AmpliTaq, AmpliTaq Gold can be used to augment mea-sures taken to counteract the effects of some PCR/Taq DNA polymerase inhibitors, such as those found in blood and some forensic specimens. Studies showed that pH affects either the activity or the activation of the polymerase. AmpliTaq Gold was found to be compatible with pH 8. 3 buffers, such as GeneAmp ® PCR Buffer and AmpFlSTRÔ PCR Reaction Mix but not compatible with pH 9. 0 buffers, such as GenePrintÔ STR 10 ´ Buffer (however, conditions for the usage of AmpliTaq Gold with the GenePrint CTTv system are provided). AmpliTaq Gold is use-ful for the development and optimization of multiplex amplification systems, particularly those in which the primers are not well de-signed and/or the reaction conditions are not optimal. Finally, because AmpliTaq Gold is initially inactive, preparation of reactions at ambient temperature and automation of the PCR are facilitated. Therefore throughput can be expanded significantly with the use of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase...|$|E

The aim of the present research was to test the effect of the application of the SVCC technique on fresh mussel microbiological characteristics. Commercial Mediterranean mussels (M. galloprovincialis) were individually inoculated with 100 µl suspension of Pseudomonas spp. (107 UFC/mL), packaged in a Oriented Polyamide/Polypropylene (OPA/PP, Orved S. p. A., Musile di Piave, VE, Italy) pouch and heat-sealed before being submitted to heat treatment in a steam oven (Lanoix Ali S. p. A., Treviso, Italy). After treatment, mussel pouches were immediately chilled at 3 °C. Six different time temperature combinations (75 / 85 / 95 °C for 10 and 30 min), were tested in triplicate (3 specimens/group) and compared to raw and inoculated mussels. Total aerobic bacterial count (TBC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), anaerobic sulphite-reducing clostridia, Pseudomonas spp. and pH were determined. All time/temperature combinations resulted in a substantial reduction of the Pseudomonas spp. population (< 1 log CFU/g) both in raw (4. 9 log CFU/g) and experimentally inoculated (5. 7 log CFU/g) mussels.
