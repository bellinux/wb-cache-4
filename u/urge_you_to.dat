25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

500|$|In 1911 Cobden was {{responsible}} for the Indian women's delegation in the Women's Coronation Procession, a London demonstration organised by suffrage associations from Britain and the Empire. The procession marched on 17 June 1911, a few days before King George V's coronation. During 1910–12 several Conciliation Bills extending the parliamentary vote to a limited number of propertied women, were debated in the House of Commons. When the third of these was under discussion, Cobden sought the help of the Irish Parliamentary Party by reminding them of the support women had given to Ireland during the Land League agitation: [...] "In the name of those 40,000 Englishwomen we <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> support at every division this Bill by your presence and your vote". The bill was finally abandoned when the Liberal prime minister, H. H. Asquith, replaced it with a bill extending the male suffrage. In protest against the Liberal government's suffrage policies and its harsh treatment of militants, Cobden resigned her honorary presidency of the Women's Liberal Association in Rochdale, her father's last constituency.|$|E

[...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it.

2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Dobbs {{announced}} that he would broadcast two episodes of Lou Dobbs Tonight from the [...] "Hold Their Feet to the Fire" [...] conference in Washington, D.C., organized by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an anti-illegal immigration advocacy group. Media Matters also criticized this move, citing FAIR founder John Tanton's history of making racist remarks and supporting white supremacist organizations. Media Matters president, Eric Burns, issued an open letter to CNN vice president Jonathan Klein, asking that the network [...] [...] "Mr. Dobbs represents an ongoing threat to CNN's credibility as a serious news organization, in no small part because of his polemical coverage of immigration issues and his continued use of his CNN show to lend prominence to groups such as FAIR", wrote Burns. [...] "The attention and legitimacy he gave to the 'birther' movement—and CNN's condoning of his actions—did real damage to that credibility. His participation in the upcoming FAIR rally would do further, serious damage. We <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> finally acknowledge that Mr. Dobbs' actions in this and other contexts are inconsistent with the reputation that CNN strives to maintain." ...|$|E

[...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{established}} and successful songwriters Flanders and Swann {{were invited to}} lecture on their craft at Dartington International Summer School [...] in 1956. Flanders found that his spoken introductions were as well received by the audience as the songs themselves. He and Swann decided to give a show along similar lines in London. They took the New Lindsey Theatre for a limited three-week run; the New Lindsey, holding about 150 people, was situated outside the London West End theatre district. The show opened on 31 December 1956. The press notices were good, the box-office did excellent business, and the pair were offered a West End transfer. Swann recalled in 1977, [...] "We turned it down unanimously. It seemed to spell the end of Michael's radio career (he had by that time done at least a thousand broadcasts) {{and the end of}} Swann as composer." [...] After each had spent two or three sleepless nights worrying, they reconsidered; the show transferred to the Fortune Theatre in Covent Garden on 24 January 1957, where, according to The Times, [...] "it took the audience by storm". The critic J. C. Trewin wrote, [...] "I feel that even [...] Gilbert might have applauded the intricate neatness of their numbers. … I <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hear Mr Flanders as he explains the precise derivation of 'Greensleeves'." [...] The show ran for 808 performances at the Fortune, until 2 May 1959.|$|E
