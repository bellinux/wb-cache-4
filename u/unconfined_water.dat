Such an effect should be relevant and detectable for materials with large surface areas and low water contents. The relationship between the volumetric solid : water ratio and the isotopic fractionation between adsorbed water and <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> was investigated for the materials silage, hay, organic soil (litter), filter paper, cotton, casein and flour. Each of these materials was equilibrated via the gas phase with <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> of known isotopic composition to quantify the isotopic difference between adsorbed water and <b>unconfined</b> <b>water.</b> Across all materials, isotopic fractionation was significant (p < 0. 05) and negative (on average − 0. 91  ±  0. 22  ‰ for 18 ∕ 16 O and − 20. 6  ±  2. 4  ‰ for 2 ∕ 1 H at an average solid : water ratio of 0. 9). The observed isotopic fractionation was not caused by solutes, volatiles or old water because the fractionation did not disappear for washed or oven-dried silage, the isotopic fractionation was also found in filter paper and cotton, and the fractionation was independent of the isotopic composition of the <b>unconfined</b> <b>water.</b> Isotopic fractionation became linearly more negative with increasing volumetric solid : water ratio and even exceeded − 4  ‰ for 18 ∕ 16 O and − 44  ‰ for 2 ∕ 1 H. This fractionation behaviour could be modelled by assuming two water layers: a thin layer that is in direct contact and influenced by {{the surface of the}} solid and a second layer of varying thickness depending on the total moisture content that is in equilibrium with the surrounding vapour. When we applied the model to soil water under grassland, the soil water extracted from 7 and 20  cm depth was significantly closer to local meteoric water than without correction for the surface effect. This study has major implications for the interpretation of the isotopic composition of water extracted from organic matter, especially when the volumetric solid : water ratio is larger than 0. 5 or for processes occurring at the solid–water interface...|$|E

Underground nuclear tests at Yucca Flat, one of the USDOE test areas at NTS, have affected hydrologic conditions, including groundwater levels. The purpose of this map report, prepared in cooperation with USDOE, is to present selected water-level data collected from wells and test holes through December 1991, and to show potentiometric contours representing 1991 water-table conditions in the Yucca Flat area. The more generic term, potentiometric contours, is used herein rather than ``water-table contours`` because the hydrologic units contributing water to wells and test holes may not accurately represent the water table. The water table is that surface in an <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> body at which the pressure is atmospheric. It is defined by the altitude at which non- perched ground water is first found in wells and test holes.

40|$|Rocks of the {{mountains}} paralleling the San Pedro River Valley in the Tres Alamos Dam Site area {{range in age from}} Precambrian to Paleozoic. Granitic rocks which occur at the clam site are similar to those in {{the mountains}} to the west and east and are mapped as Precambrian in age. The oldest Tertiary unit exposed in the San Pedro Valley is the Granitic Conglomerate of Miocene (?) age which is overlain uncomfortably by the Black Conglomerate of Pliocene (?) age. A period of faulting and erosion followed the consolidation of the Black Conglomerate and parts of the units were removed. Erosion was followed by deposition of the Plio-Pleistocene Benson Beds. The flatbedded Benson Beds are generally fine grained and are reddish brown in color. The light brown Tres Alamos formation of Pleistocene age overlies the Benson Beds. The Tres Alamos unit is flat-bedded and consists of conglomeratic facies near the mountain fronts grading into fine-grained facies {{near the center of the}} valley. The youngest unit discussed is the floodplain deposits of the San Pedro River and its tributaries. The Tertiary conglomerates yield small to moderate amounts of <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> to wells penetrating those parts not overlain by Benson Beds. In the center of the valley where the conglomerates are overlain by Benson Beds, the unit contains artesian water at depths greater than 200 feet. The permeability of the Tertiary conglomerates probably ranges from 100 to 1, 000 gpd/ft^ 2. The Tres Alamos formation yields small amounts of non-artesian water to wells penetrating the conglomeratic facies. The permeability of the coarse fades of the Tres Alamos formation is estimated to range from 10 to 1, 000 gpd/ft^ 2. The Benson Beds do not yield water to any known well. The fine-grained beds of this unit form the confining layer for the underlying artesian system. The floodplain deposits yield moderate to large amounts of <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> to wells. The permeability of the floodplain deposits is believed to range from 1, 000 to 5, 000 gpd/ft^ 2. The granitic rocks exposed at the Tres Alamos Dam Site appear to form a ground water barrier to the artesian system. If this barrier existed in the past dividing the valley into two separate basins of deposition, it is possible that the sediments containing the artesian system are not continuous through the darn site area. It is possible that the artesian water may be moving through a buried channel to the west of the dam site, through buried remnants of the Tertiary conglomerates on the sides of the granitic rocks near the dam site, or through regional faults associated with the development of the Basin and Range province...|$|E

40|$|A {{ground-water}} flow and transport model simulating contaminant movement to public supply wells in the High Plains aquifer near York, Nebraska was developed {{as part of}} the U. S. Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Water-quality samples were collected from wells screened in unconfined and confined units. Samples collected from a public supply well and selected monitoring wells completed in the confined aquifer have chemistry and age-tracer concentrations consistent with a mix of young <b>water</b> from <b>unconfined</b> recharge areas combined with relatively older confined aquifer water. These results imply that there are preferential flow paths that permit shallow recharge water and contaminants to move through the confining layer.

MODFLOW-GWT (Ground-Water Transport) was used to simulate solute movement through the system, while also assigning ages to the particles. The simulations indicate that summer pumping conditions, which can cause vertical head differences of up to 15 meters between unconfined and confined layers, and wells screened through multiple layers introduce shallow recharge waters and contaminants to lower layers, increasing the vulnerability of public-supply wells completed in the confined system to contamination from <b>unconfined</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{water balance}} {{calculation}} {{and water quality}} are very important matters in the groundwater management. The water balance includes two parameters: input and output parameters. The input parameter is consisted from surface recharge (precipitation, irrigation return water, surfaces runoff recharge) and underground inflow (flow from adjacent aquifers). The underground inflow {{is an important factor}} in almost aquifers. It could form an important part of the water balance and could have major effects on the water quality. Although, when the underground inflow water quality is different whit the aquifer water quality, it can affect the aquifer water quality. Therefore, identifying this parameter is very important in the groundwater management. This research shows the aquifer interrelation's roles in the water management by considering a real case study. In this real case there are two aquifers, an unconfined aquifer overly on a confined aquifer. An impermeable layer isolates these two aquifers. This layer is deleted in some area and causes connection between two aquifers. This relationship affects the <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> quality and its sustainability. In the dry seasons, when the water table is low and hydraulic gradient is upward, high quality water moves from confined aquifer into upper unconfined aquifer. This improves the unconfined aquifer water quality in the dry seasons and deeps layer. Also, it makes the unconfined aquifer very sustainable...|$|E

Triazine and acetamide herbicides applied on the site and their transformation products had the highest frequencies of detection.

40|$|AbstractThe {{scale of}} CO 2 {{injection}} into the subsurface required to address CO 2 atmospheric concentrations is unprecedented. Multiple injection sites injecting into multiple formations {{will create a}} large excess pressure zone extending far beyond the limited volume where CO 2 is present. In a closed system, additional mass is accommodated by the compressibility of system components, an increase in fluid pressure, and possibly an uplift of the land surface. In an open system, as assumed in this analysis, another coping mechanism involves fluid flux out of {{the boundaries of the}} system, in which case the fresh-water-bearing outcrop areas, corresponding to the up-dip sections of the down-dip formations into which CO 2 is injected, could be impacted. A preliminary study using a MODFLOW groundwater model extending far down-dip shows that injecting a large amount of fluid does have an impact some distance away from the injection area but most likely only in localized areas. A major assumption of this preliminary work was that multiphase processes do not matter some distance away from the injection zones. In a second step, presented in this paper, to demonstrate that a simplified model can yield results as useful as those of a more sophisticated multiphase-flow compositional model, we model the same system using CMG-GEM software. Because the chosen software lacks the ability to deal easily with <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> flow, we compare fluxes through time, as given by MODFLOW and CMG-GEM models at the confined/unconfined interface...|$|E

The nature of thin water films on Pd, Pt, and Ru has been investigated by first-principles molecular dynamics to assess how the chemistry at the water–metal surface {{is responsible for the}} diversity in the behavior of the water layers closer to the metal. The characteristics of liquid water: the radial distribution functions, coordination, and fragment speciation appear only for <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> layers of a minimum of 1. 4 nm thick. In addition, the water layer is denser in the region closest to the metal for Pd and Pt, where seven- and five-membered ring motifs appear.

On Ru densification at the interface is not observed, water dissociates, and protons and hydroxyl groups are locked at the surface. Therefore, the acid–base properties in the area close to the metal are not perturbed, in agreement with experiments, and the bulk water resembles an electric double layer. Confinement affects water making it closer to ice for both structural and dynamic properties, thus being responsible for the higher viscosity experimentally found at the nanoscale.

However, unconfined waters sprays can be somewhat ineffective in actually removing airborne dust from the air. On the other hand, water powered scrubbers operating at higher water pressures of ? 1, 724 kPa (? 250 psig) in physical enclosures or ducts have previously been demonstrated to be very effective in removing airborne dust from the air. These higher operating water pressures are uncommon in many mines and mills, so their use is limited. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently investigated the performance of a lower-pressure, water powered inline series spray scrubber for removing localized airborne dust emitted at the source. Results showed noticeable improvements in airborne dust capture efficiency through the operation o f multiple inline series hollow cone spray nozzles within a round duct or pipe at the same water pressure as a single spray. Operating hollow cone spray(s) at higher water pressures noticeably improved airflow through the scrubber and yielded some additional scrubber efficiency improvements. Thus, in-line spray scrubber efficiency trade-offs were observed to be made by altering spray power components of water pressure and/or quantity (number of sprays). Results show that, on average, up to 0. 23 and 0. 32 m 3 /s (484 and 679 cu ft per min) of airflow at 0. 81 and 0. 69 dust capture efficiencies can be achieved with three 8120 and 3320 hollow cone inline series sprays, respectively, operating at 1, 655 kPa (240 psig) ...|$|E
40|$|Texas had unmet {{water supply}} needs in 2010. These unmet needs are {{expected}} to increase through 2040, making accurate water budgeting increasingly more important. Current water budgets use simple assumptions to estimate groundwater discharges (Qgw) to rivers based on established, but limited, hydrograph separation techniques. In this study we compare Qgw estimates obtained with more direct high-frequency techniques, including specific conductance mass balances, differential gaging, endmember-mixing analyses (EMMA), and the Dupuit equation using the observed slope of the <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> table, to Qgw estimates obtained using hydrograph separation. Together, these methods provide updated, seasonal estimates of the groundwater discharge component of the water budget for the second longest river in Texas. Two contiguous stretches of the river were investigated. The first, upstream river stretch primarily gained groundwater and saw strong agreement in Qgw estimated with specific conductance mass balance, differential gaging, EMMA, and hydrograph separation. Qgw ranged from - 18 to 50 m^ 3 /s, and correlated positively with river discharge. Negative and positive Qgw indicates net losing and gaining conditions, respectively. The second, downstream river stretch both gained groundwater and lost river water to the aquifer, again with strong agreement in estimated Qgw using the same four methods as above. Calculated Qgw ranged from - 155 to 112 m^ 3 /s, and, {{in contrast to the}} upstream stretch, correlated negatively to river discharge. The Dupuit equation-based estimates differed significantly from the other methods? estimates in both studied stretches of the river.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Water table recovery in four reclaimed mine blocks containing replaced overburden has been monitored at Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine in Grimes County, Texas since 1986. Recovery analysis was conducted based on data recorded at 27 wells installed in the reclaimed land and 23 wells installed in adjacent unmined land. It was found that water table recovery in reclaimed mine blocks is predictable: recovery is an exponential function of time and may be described by the following equation: Ew = RC log (t) + Eo where Ew equals any water table elevation above the mine floor to which recovery has occurred over the time, t, transpired between the time recovery began to the time Ew is attained. The constant Eo is the y-intercept which approximates the water table elevation at the beginning time of recovery, to referenced from the time of spoil replacement. The Recovery Coefficient (RC) is the average slope of the recovery curve. RC is proportional to inflow rate and the magnitude (potential saturated thickness) of water table recovery. As RC increases, recovery rate and/or magnitude increases. If recovery is uniform with respect to mine floor elevation, RC distributions for wells in a mine block can be standardized with respect to the mine block dimensions such that one RC value is attained for each mine block. RC is controlled by the complex interrelationships of several factors which may be described by the following factorial equation: RC= f (MD, HS, HP, MB, S 99 where MD = Mine block Dimensions, HS = Hydrostratigraphic Setting, HP = Hydraulic Properties of the spoil, MB = Moisture Balance for the mine area, and SW = Surface Water contribution to spoil resaturation. Based on the analyses the following conclusions were made pertaining to water table recovery at Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine: 1) rate of recovery {{does not appear to be}} controlled by the amount of sand in the pre-mine overburden, 2) surface water impoundments do not significantly recharge the mine blocks, 3) water table drawdown during mining can impact the local water table down-gradient of the mined land, 4) mining in several locations over an area composed of fluvial-deltaic sediments forces hydraulic connection of many of the stratigraphic units producing an <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> table aquifer from the pre-mine confined ground-water systems...|$|E
40|$|Aquifer {{heterogeneity}} {{within the}} large coastal sand island of Bribie Island, Queensland, Australia, has an affect on groundwater occurrence and migration. The stratigraphy of Bribie Island {{is complicated by}} the presence of low permeability humate-cemented indurated sand layers. Occurrences of indurated sand layers have previously been identified within many unconsolidated profiles along the east coast of Australia and around the world. Indurated sand layers are often discontinuous resulting in localised aquifer heterogeneity. However, their regional significance is commonly underestimated. The groundwater resource of Bribie Island is of commercial and environmental significance to the surrounding bay area. Recent development proposals for the groundwater resource necessitate an investigation into the nature of the water bearing properties of the island aquifer and in particular the presence of aquifer heterogeneity. Investigation of a "reference" transect across Bribie Island has involved the drilling and development of monitoring wells and the performance of hydraulic tests. This study demonstrates how detailed measurement of stratigraphy, groundwater levels, rainfall, barometric pressure and hydraulic testing can be used in conjunction to identify and assess aquifer heterogeneity within a sand island environment. Drill logs confirm the position of a palaeochannel within the sandstone bedrock that extends from the mainland continuing under Bribie Island. The overlying sediment profile is thickest within the palaeochannel. The Pleistocene and Holocene unconsolidated profile reflects a prograding barrier island/strandplain formation. The vertical sequence of sediments consists of units that range from offshore sandy silts to foreshore and beach medium-fine grained sands. An extensive indurated sand layer exists throughout the centre of the island. The greatest thickness of indurated sand is located centrally on the island beneath the main beach ridge system. The indurated layer at its thickest is approximately 5 - 8 m thick, but over much of the island the thickness is 1 - 3 m. The top of indurated sand layer is generally 1 - 3 m above mean sea level. Hydrographs from a network of groundwater monitoring wells illustrate that the groundwater resources across the reference transect can be divided into a shallow <b>unconfined</b> <b>water</b> table aquifer and basal confined aquifers. These upper and lower aquifers are characterised by different hydrological processes, physico-chemical properties, and water chemistry. The stratification of water levels across the reference transect and the relatively flat piezometric surface are in contrast with the classical "domed" water table aquifer expected of a barrier island. Stratified head gradients through the Bribie Island aquifers suggest groundwater migration to depth is impeded by the indurated sand layer. An elevated shallow water table results from the mounding of water above the indurated sand layer. The indurated sand layer is extensive across the reference transect. The elevated unconfined groundwater is usually stained with organic matter ("black water"), where as groundwater sourced from beneath the indurated sand layer is colourless ("white water"). The unconfined groundwater is also distinguished by low pH, low bicarbonate concentrations and high concentrations of organic carbon. Interaction between unconfined groundwater and surface water are also evident. Hydraulic tests indicate that each of the unconsolidated units across the reference transect has distinctive hydraulic characteristics. Estimates of vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer are two to three orders of magnitude greater than estimates for the indurated sand layer. Beneath the indurated sand layer hydraulic conductivities of the basal aquifers are also greater by two to three orders of magnitude than estimates for the indurated sand layer. The lower hydraulic conductivity within the indurated sand layer is responsible for the local semiconfinement of the basal aquifers...|$|E

The brackish water table is hydrologically connected to both the Gulf of Mexico {{on one side and}} swamp/estuary systems on the other, and there is an inland component of flow within the brackish lens. For the northwestern 200 km of coast, evaporation causes precipitation of calcite cements and subsequent lithification of a portion of the permeable dune ridge. A unit commonly referred to as the Upper Laja is presently forming within this beach-dune ridge, within the <b>unconfined</b> brackish <b>water</b> lens. Metastable skeletal fragments comprising this sedimentary unit are simultaneously being altered to low-magnesium calcite. An unconsolidated zone of carbonate sediments below the Upper Laja {{is a result of the}} zone of dispersion between seawater and meteoric water. The confining wackestone beneath the dune ridge and swamp/estuary systems is a caliche crust which developed on the underlying carbonate rocks and/or sediments less than 23, 000 years ago. Prior to calichification, subaerial exposure resulted in extensive meteoric diagenetic processes altering the precursor carbonate sediments and rocks of marine origin. While the unit was still sub- aerially exposed, evaporation and C 02 -degassing contributed to carbonate precipitation and stabilization of the caliche profile. Usually referred to as the Lower Laja, studies show it to be forming at present beneath and adjacent to the swamp/estuary systems, as calcite precipitates in remaining pore spaces. M. S.

25|$|Hydraulic head is a {{directly}} measurable {{property that}} can take on any value (because of the arbitrary datum involved in the z term); ψ can be measured with a pressure transducer (this value can be negative, e.g., suction, but is positive in saturated aquifers), and z can be measured relative to a surveyed datum (typically {{the top of the}} well casing). Commonly, in wells tapping <b>unconfined</b> aquifers the <b>water</b> level in a well is used as a proxy for hydraulic head, assuming there is no vertical gradient of pressure. Often only changes in hydraulic head through time are needed, so the constant elevation head term can be left out (Δh = Δψ).|$|R
40|$|By all accounts, the Seymour Aquifer is {{vulnerable}} to contamination. For example, sandy soils are widespread in the region, the aquifer is <b>unconfined,</b> and <b>water</b> tables are shallow throughout much of this system. It is also apparent that the Seymour Aquifer has consistently suffered from poor water quality—most often associated {{with high levels of}} nitrate-nitrogen. What cannot be affirmed {{is the extent to which}} water quality problems in the Seymour Aquifer can be attributed to natural sources or human activities. Over the past decade, researchers affiliated with several universities and agencies have investigated the sources of nitrate contamination in the Seymour Aquifer and the extent to which changes in land use practices may improve groundwater quality in the region. Finding the answer to this problem through research is important for several reasons. Most importantly, policy makers and the citizens of Texas need to know the capability of best land management practices to reduce groundwater contamination in the region. If, however, it is found that groundwater contamination is a naturally occurring phenomenon in the region, policymakers and the public may conclude it is not feasible to achieve high water quality in the Seymour Aquifer System...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{withdrawals}} {{of groundwater}} are adversely affecting the environment, economy {{and public health}} in large areas of Wisconsin. These drawdowns can cause the water level in wells, lakes, streams and wetlands to drop or cause them to dry up entirely. Drawdowns can also cause the levels of arsenic, radium, and salinity in drinking water to increase. State-supported research is using groundwater information and groundwater flow models developed at a regional scale and adapting it for use at the local level. In Washington County, researchers worked {{with the city of}} Richfield to develop a protocol for quantifying its groundwater budget (Cherkauer and LaCosse, 2001). That information will be coupled with projected changes in land use and pumping demand to define the effects of several development scenarios on the community's water supply. This protocol is currently being applied to the entire 7 -county SEWRPC region of Southeast Wisconsin. Regional studies have identified central Waukesha County as an area where continued deep groundwater pumping might be causing the deep aquifers to become <b>unconfined</b> as <b>water</b> levels fall (Eaton, 2004). A 2004 project installed one deep piezometer near Pewaukee for use as a monitoring point to document water-level declines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{explosion}} {{yielding a}} blast wave can cause catastrophic {{damage to a}} building and its personnel. This threat defines an immediate importance for understanding blast mitigation techniques via readily available materials. An <b>unconfined</b> mass of <b>water</b> {{in the form of}} a free flowing sheet has been experimentally tested and analyzed as a readily available mitigant. A single water sheet, with an approximate sheet thickness of 3 mm, was experimentally tested with an explosively driven shock tube at three different standoff distances. At the strongest shock strength considered, the water sheet decreased the peak overpressure of the blast wave by 80 % and the impulse by 60 %. Additionally, the peak overpressure transmitted through the water sheet was roughly constant regardless of standoff distance and explosive strength...|$|R
5000|$|The first piezometers in {{geotechnical}} engineering {{were open}} wells or standpipes (sometimes called Casagrande piezometers) [...] installed into an aquifer. A Casagrande piezometer will typically {{have a solid}} casing down to the depth of interest, and a slotted or screened casing within the zone where water pressure is being measured. The casing is sealed into the drillhole with clay, bentonite or concrete to prevent surface water from contaminating the groundwater supply. In an <b>unconfined</b> aquifer, the <b>water</b> level in the piezometer would not be exactly coincident with the water table, especially when the vertical component of flow velocity is significant. In a confined aquifer under artesian conditions, the water level in the piezometer indicates the pressure in the aquifer, but not necessarily the water table. Piezometer wells can be much smaller in diameter than production wells, and a 5 cm diameter standpipe is common.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{overview of}} the currently available theoretical methods and their capabilities in relation to simulations of the maneuvering behavior of displacement type of ships in a seaway. It has been considered that the ships are engaged in typical type of maneuvers such are for example Zig-Zag and Turning maneuvers according to IMO maneuvering standard and requirements (Faltinsen, 2005) while operating {{in the same time}} in deep and open, i. e. <b>unconfined</b> <b>waters</b> and encountering irregular wave field described by long- or short crested wave spectral formulation. Nowadays, most of the maneuvering simulation models, with an exception of limited number of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, are traditionally developed on the potential fluid flow theory with partial inclusion of the viscosity effects. Although their applicability and reliability is already well proven fact through the series of carried out validation and verification procedures related to maneuvering ships in calm water situations, their capabilities in recent years start to be questioned when it comes to maneuvering simulations of ships in a seaway. In this context, a unified maneuvering and seakeeping analysis appears to have a significant role. From the perspective of a maneuvering ship which advances through the wave field and may occasionally experience the wind loading effects it can be recognized that the maneuvering and seakeeping analysis are mutually interconnected. Furthermore, due to fact that their combination represents a complex problem the approach to its solution from the side of related research communities developed gradually. Commonly accepted formulation of a seaway through the linear superposition of regular waves on a certain way dictated approach to combined maneuvering and seakeeping problem having consequence that the problem should be studied mainly in two phases. Usually, in the first phase one will address the regular wave field scenarios while the second phase will account for the irregular wave field scenarios. Theoretical methods capable of combined maneuvering and seakeeping analysis in regular waves are mainly classified in two groups; one based on the (linear) convolution integral approach (Bailey et al., 1997; Fossen, 2005) and the second one based on two-time scale approach where the wave effects upon the maneuvering ship are estimated by the mean 2 nd order wave loads (Skejic and Faltinsen, 2008). Present work describes both mentioned methods with focus on their capabilities from the context of a ship executing maneuvers in regular waves. The problem of a maneuvering ship in irregular wave environment started to be analyzed recently in works by Seo and Kim (2011), Prpiæ-Or 9 ̆aiæ and Faltinsen (2012). The mentioned authors focused on a special case of a maneuvering ship in a seaway where it was assumed that the maneuvering ship is advancing on the straight line course, i. e. the ship has the constant heading and zero rudder angle. Mentioned special case is further generalized to arbitrary ship headings and rudder angles by Skejic and Faltinsen (2013). In conclusion, and based on the above described theoretical methods, the present paper discusses the analysis of the propulsive coefficients in the single hull-propeller-rudder arrangement from the wave environment point of view...|$|R
