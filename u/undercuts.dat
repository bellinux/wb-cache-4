40|$|Atomic oxygen <b>undercutting</b> is a {{potential}} threat to vulnerable spacecraft materials which have atomic oxygen protective coatings. Such <b>undercutting</b> is due to atomic oxygen attack of oxidizable materials at microscopic defects in the protective coatings. These defects occur during fabrication and handling, or from micrometeoroid and debris bombardment in space. An aluminized-polyimide Kapton multilayer insulation sample that was located {{on the leading edge}} of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) was used to study low Earth orbit directed ram atomic oxygen <b>undercutting.</b> Cracks in the aluminized coatings located around vent holes provided excellent defect sites for evaluation of atomic oxygen <b>undercutting.</b> The experimentally observed <b>undercutting</b> profiles were compared to predictions from Monte Carlo models for normal incident ram atomic oxygen attack. The shape of the <b>undercut</b> profile was found to vary with crack width, which is proportional to the number of oxygen atoms entering the crack. The resulting profiles of atomic oxygen which occurred on LDEF indicated wide <b>undercut</b> cavities in spite of the fixed ram orientation. Potential causes of the observed <b>undercutting</b> are presented. Implications of the <b>undercutting</b> profiles relevant to the Space Station Freedom are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D.

The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and <b>undercuts</b> the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undercuts</b> on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into {{internal and external}} <b>undercuts,</b> where external <b>undercuts</b> are on {{the exterior of the}} part and interior <b>undercuts</b> are {{on the inside of the}} part. <b>Undercuts</b> can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|E
40|$|In wet {{anisotropic}} etching, the etched {{profile of}} <b>undercut</b> convex corners {{depends on the}} type of etchant. A considerable amount of research has been carried out to explain this convex corner <b>undercutting</b> and to identify the orientation of <b>undercut</b> planes. However, it is not clearly understood why differently shaped <b>undercut</b> fronts appear with different etchants. Moreover, there has been no descriptive explanation regarding the distinct shape of the <b>undercut</b> convex corner in both KOH and TMAH. In this work, corner <b>undercutting</b> on the surface of a Si{ 100 } wafer is thoroughly investigated. The <b>undercutting</b> behavior is examined for two different kinds of etchants (KOH and TMAH). The study is performed by analyzing the etching characteristics of different kinds of convex corners on the mask patterns. One type of corner in the mask design is formed by directions, while other types are formed by the intersection of different directions, which shapes the <b>undercut</b> convex corner profile. Furthermore, the appearance of etchant-dependent beveled directions at convex corners is clearly explained using the contour plot of the etch-rate data of a silicon hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters in <b>undercut</b> slopes design is {{the determination of the}} maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span. The maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span is a function of slope geometry, the strength parameters of the slope material, condition of discontinuities, underground water condition, etc. However, the desired production capacity and therefore the size of excavating equipment will sometimes ask for a wider <b>undercut</b> span. The influence of arching phenomenon in geo-material on the stability of <b>undercut</b> slopes is investigated earlier. It is believed that due to arching effect, some load transfer from the <b>undercut</b> area into stationary remaining side toes leads to a more stable slope. However, the transferred load may result in ploughing failure of side toes. One technique for preventing the ploughing failure is the use of counterweight balance on side toes. In this study, the influence of counterweight size on the stability of the <b>undercut</b> slopes was investigated through a series of numerical model tests using FLAC 3 D software. It was concluded that there is a meaningful relationship between the counterweight balance size and the maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span where increasing a counterweight size results in a wider stable span. Finally, the numerical results were compared with pre-conducted physical modeling test and a nonlinear relationship was proposed between the counterweight size and the maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span...|$|R
25|$|<b>Undercuts</b> from etching are {{somewhat}} {{different than the}} <b>undercuts</b> explained above, {{because it is a}} side effect, not an intentional feature. <b>Undercuts</b> from etching can occur from two common causes. The first is over etching, which means the etchant was applied too long. The second is due to an isotropic etchant, which means the etchant etches in all directions equally. To overcome this problem an anisotropic etchant is used.|$|E

The limitation originates from the limited field measurements or laboratory experiments as well as the unavailability of discrete element models that can effectively simulate seepage particle mobilization, <b>undercutting,</b> and the corresponding mass wasting. The objective of this research was to demonstrate a procedure for incorporating seepage <b>undercutting</b> into bank stability models and to investigate the role of seepage <b>undercutting</b> on bank instability. The question to be addressed is whether seepage particle mobilization can lead to distances of <b>undercutting</b> that are a significant cause of bank instability...|$|R

Long-term electrically stimulated <b>undercut</b> tissue contained neurons which were not different from intact in these two measures. There was, therefore, a preservation of axonal morphology in stimulated <b>undercut,</b> adult cortex.

30|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and robust model is {{presented}} to explain the main reason behind <b>undercutting</b> at convex corners and no-undercutting at concave corners. The etch rate of the tangent plane at convex corner {{and the role of}} dangling bond in etching process are utilized to explain the <b>undercutting</b> at convex corner and the no-undercutting at concave corner, respectively. The present model shows that { 110 } is the tangent plane at convex corner which exhibits higher etch rate than the neighboring { 111 } plane in all types of anisotropic etchants; consequently the <b>undercutting</b> occurs at convex corners. The absence of dangling bonds at concave corner prevents the <b>undercutting</b> there. Moreover, the same model explains the reason of very less <b>undercutting</b> when the etching is carried out in surfactant-added tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).|$|R

When the existence of surface active element (e. g. the content of S is about 0. 02 - 0. 04 % in steel) change the sign of surface tension temperature coefficient to positive, <b>undercut</b> always occurs in TIG moveless welding, and not occurs when the content of S in iron is very low (e. g.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to model atomic oxygen erosion of protected polymers in low Earth orbit (LEO). <b>Undercutting</b> of protected polymers by atomic oxygen occurs in LEO due {{to the presence of}} scratch, crack or pin-window defects in the protective coatings.
