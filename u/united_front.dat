5|$|The <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> {{ministry}} {{ordered the}} creation of the Bangla Academy to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage. However, the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> rule was temporary, as Governor General Ghulam Muhammad cancelled the government and started Governor's rule on 30 May 1954. the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor's regime ended. The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the First <b>United</b> <b>Front,</b> Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng's Nanchang Uprising. Having helped orchestrate the uprising, Zhu and his army defected from the Kuomintang. The uprising failed to gather support, however, and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army. Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng. He was soon named head of a new First <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> military institute in Nanchang.|$|E
50|$|A cross-class {{alliance}} {{is a term}} for an organisation that bypasses social-economic classes in pursuit of its aim. It is often used by Trotskyists as a term of abuse towards popular fronts as they prefer working class <b>united</b> <b>fronts,</b> however some also accuse some supposed <b>united</b> <b>fronts</b> as being cross class alliances.|$|R
50|$|With {{the rise}} of Nazism in Europe, there was {{increased}} pressure on the LSI and Comintern to cooperate. On February 19, 1933, the LSI Bureau issued a call for joint action of the SPD and the Communist Party of Germany against Adolf Hitler's regime. The Comintern responded by stating {{that they were not}} convinced of the sincerity of the declaration. However, the Comintern did soon call its national sections to form <b>united</b> <b>fronts</b> together with social democratic parties locally. The LSI, on its side, did not accept the notion of local social democrats forming <b>united</b> <b>fronts</b> with the communist parties. However, as the Comintern adopted a more conciliatory tone, the resistance of the LSI against forming such <b>united</b> <b>fronts</b> on the national level softened.|$|R

5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{came to a}} head as {{elections to}} the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> coalition, which—led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> leaders and activists were arrested. A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister Muhammad Ali Bogra, resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as Maulvi Abdul Haq condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision. Consequently, the implementation failed and the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> won a vast majority of seats in the legislative assembly, while the representation of the Muslim League was reduced to a historic low.|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} end of Smith's front-line {{political}} career—Gerald Smith (no relation) replaced him as leader of the CAZ—but he remained active in opposition at a reduced level. In July 1992 he chaired a meeting where the CAZ, Muzorewa's UANC, Sithole's ZANU–Ndonga party and Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement formed a coalition to challenge Mugabe and ZANU–PF in the next parliamentary election. The result was the short-lived <b>United</b> <b>Front,</b> which Smith agreed to chair, saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead. The <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> quickly failed, largely {{due to the lack of}} common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election. Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.|$|E
5|$|<b>United</b> <b>Front</b> Games cut 120 {{staff with}} the company's {{solvency}} in doubt until August when Square Enix acquired the publishing {{rights to the}} game. Square Enix did not buy the True Crime intellectual property, and renamed the game Sleeping Dogs. Square Enix London Studios general manager Lee Singleton said he recognized the game's playability and potential. <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> Games' President Stefan Wessels stated he was excited to work with Square Enix London Studios. Sixty people {{were added to the}} development team and the game was released in late 2012.|$|E
50|$|Leon Trotsky and his far-left {{supporters}} roundly criticised the Popular Front strategy. Trotsky {{believed that}} only <b>united</b> <b>fronts</b> could ultimately be progressive, and that popular fronts were useless because they included non-working class bourgeois forces such as liberals. Trotsky {{also argued that}} in popular fronts, working class demands are reduced to their bare minimum, {{and the ability of}} the working class to put forward its own independent set of politics is compromised. This view is now common to most Trotskyist groups. Left communist groups also oppose popular fronts, but they came to oppose <b>united</b> <b>fronts</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|The New Democratic Front (NDF) is a {{political}} party in Sri Lanka. The party, founded in 2009, is {{an offshoot of the}} Democratic <b>United</b> National <b>Front.</b> It is currently a constituent partner of the <b>United</b> National <b>Front.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} went to war. When the Kuomintang and Communist Party {{declared a}} <b>united</b> <b>front</b> {{to fight the}} Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the <b>united</b> <b>front</b> should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the return}} of the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was {{observed}} {{for the first time in}} a peaceful atmosphere. The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar. The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>United</b> Left <b>Front</b> {{was formed}} in 1990 to protest against the Panchayat system and to restore multi-party democracy. They held a joint {{movement}} with the Nepali Congress and King Birendra in November 1990 finally yielded to their Jana Andolan. Two constituents of the <b>United</b> Left <b>Front,</b> Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist) and Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist), merged in January 6, 1991 to form the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) before the 1991 elections while the <b>United</b> Left <b>Front</b> became inactive.|$|R
50|$|In {{the talks}} in Bonn Fahim took a leading role, {{together}} {{with two other}} young and moderate Tajik leaders from the <b>United</b> Islamic <b>Front</b> (UIF), Yunus Qanuni and dr. Abdullah. After the death of Massoud, this trio had de facto been leading the <b>United</b> Islamic <b>Front.</b> Fahim was reportedly advocating a broad-based government headed by someone outside {{the leadership of the}} <b>United</b> Islamic <b>Front.</b> According to sources Fahim lobbied for Hamid Karzai as the next Afghan president instead for his formal leader Rabbani.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Saleh {{was a member}} of the Northern Alliance (also known as the <b>United</b> <b>Front)</b> and was {{fighting}} against the Taliban expansion. In 1997, Saleh was appointed by Massoud to lead the United Front's international liaison office at the Embassy of Afghanistan in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, where he served as a coordinator for non-governmental (humanitarian) organizations and as a liaison partner for foreign intelligence agencies.|$|E

5|$|When the CCP {{entered the}} First <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> to fight warlords and unite China from 1924–27 with the Guomindang (GMD), the each party {{established}} their own women’s department during this time. However, the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> {{ended with the}} White Terror (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror {{because they were not}} {{under the control of the}} GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the New Life Movement, which sought to counter the gender role espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927–1945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on 19 February 1971, {{the court}} heard reports from Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr of McCartney's {{attempts}} to control the band, and McCartney's equally unflattering assessment of Klein. Although the other three former Beatles had presented a <b>united</b> <b>front</b> against McCartney since his April 1970 departure from the band, the recent publication of Lennon's scathing comments to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, about McCartney, Harrison and Starr, added to the ill-feeling surrounding the group.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Diệm {{tried to}} {{integrate}} the remaining Hòa Hảo armies into the VNA. Ba Cụt {{was one of four}} Hòa Hảo military leaders who refused the government offer on 23 April, and continued to operate autonomously. At one stage, the Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo and Bình Xuyên formed an alliance called the <b>United</b> <b>Front,</b> in an attempt to pressure Diệm into handing over power; Ba Cụt was named senior military commander. However, this had little meaning as the various units were still autonomous of each other, and the <b>United</b> <b>Front</b> was more a showpiece than a means of facilitating coordinated action, and did not in any way strengthen any military threat to Diệm. The leaders were suspicious of one another and often sent subordinates to meetings. Initially, American and French representatives in Vietnam hoped that Diệm would take up a ceremonial role and allow the sect leaders—including Ba Cụt—to hold government positions. However, Diệm refused to share power and launched a sudden offensive against Ba Cụt in Thốt Nốt on 12 March, shelling the area heavily. The battle was inconclusive and both sides blamed the other for causing instability and disrupting the situation. Diệm then attacked the Bình Xuyên's Saigon headquarters in late April, quickly crushing them.|$|E

In addition, there have been various conflicts with Khartoum's Janjaweed rebels in Eastern Chad who killed civilians by use of helicopter gunships. Presently, the Union of Resistance Forces or UFR are a rebel group that continues to battle with the government of Chad. In 2010, the UFR reportedly had a force estimating 6,000 men and 300 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, as likely {{a thing of the}} past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a <b>united</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs {{difficult}} and prolonged development began in 2008.

Six months later, Square Enix bought the publishing rights and renamed the game Sleeping Dogs, without the True Crime license, but considered a spiritual successor.
