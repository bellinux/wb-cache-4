5|$|Influenced by the Völkisch movement, {{the regime}} was against {{cultural}} modernism {{and supported the}} development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism.

5|$|John Fine, on {{the other}} hand, {{suggests}} that the first peace between Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean. Kagan believes that Pericles used Callias, a brother-in-law of Cimon, {{as a symbol of}} <b>unity</b> <b>and</b> employed him several times to negotiate important agreements.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I analyze a {{previously}} unpublished Leibniz text {{from the early}} 1700 s. I give it the title “On <b>Unities</b> <b>and</b> Transmigration” since it contains an outline of his doctrine of <b>unities</b> <b>and</b> {{an examination of the}} doctrine of transmigration. The text is valuable because in it Leibniz considers three very specific versions of transmigration that he does not address elsewhere in his writings; these are where a soul is released by the destruction of its body and is then free to pass into another body, where souls are exchanged without any destruction of bodies, and where human souls are exchanged, again without any destruction of bodies. I show that when tackling these three versions of transmigration in “On <b>Unities</b> <b>and</b> Transmigration,” Leibniz develops a series of objections that are not found anywhere else in his published writings, despite his lifelong opposition to the doctrine of transmigration. This paper is completed by two appendices, the first of which presents the previously unpublished “On <b>Unities</b> <b>and</b> Transmigration” text in full, in the original French, while the second presents its English translation...|$|R

5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, <b>unity</b> <b>and</b> existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution {{to call for a}} referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E

5|$|Andriamasinavalona died in 1710 {{when one}} of his wives, Rasolomananambonitany, {{inadvertently}} pushed him from the elevated bed where they slept. He was buried in the royal tombs located at the Rova of Antananarivo. In opposition to Andriamasinavalona's intentions, after the king's death his sons forsook the concept of <b>unity</b> <b>and</b> instead fought one another in an effort to expand their realms. As a consequence of this decision, Imerina fragmented and was wracked with conflict for 77 years, until the kingdom was once again united during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina (17871810).|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} among the citizenry had never waned, and support {{continued to be}} evident, even {{on the eve of}} his overthrow and throughout his exile. He was seen as a hero, a model citizen, a caring monarch, and the source of national <b>unity</b> <b>and</b> well-being. Following his death, political wrangling prevented the return of his remains to Brazil. Continued efforts to repatriate the bodies of the Emperor and his wife dragged on for decades. The disputes were resolved and this was finally accomplished in 1920 with much fanfare. Over the decades, PedroII gradually grew within Brazil to represent the archetypical benevolent, self-effacing and effective ruler concerned only for the national welfare.|$|E

Some of the book series derived out of this publication were The Life Divine, The Synthesis of Yoga, Essays on The Gita, The Secret of The Veda, Hymns to the Mystic Fire, The Upanishads, The Renaissance in India, War and Self-determination, The Human Cycle, The Ideal of Human <b>Unity</b> <b>and</b> The Future Poetry were published in this magazine.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national <b>unity</b> <b>and</b> mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|Most generally, State Shinto {{refers to}} any use of Shinto {{practices}} {{incorporated into the}} national ideology during the Meiji period starting in 1868.

State Shinto is also understood to refer to the state rituals and ideology of Emperor-worship, which was not a traditional emphasis of Shinto — of the 124 Japanese emperors, only 20 have dedicated shrines.|$|E

The incumbent President, Mwai Kibaki, who represents the Party of National <b>Unity</b> <b>and</b> Raila Odinga from the Orange Democratic Movement were the leading candidates. Early indications showed that Odinga was likely to win the election, however the results announced by the Electoral Commission of Kenya showed that Kibaki had been re-elected and he {{was sworn in as}} President. Immediately after the Electoral Commission's announcement, Odinga rejected the result, claiming that widespread electoral fraud had taken place. European Union electoral observers also claimed that the electoral commission had failed to ensure the credibility of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Only a {{few months}} after the failed {{offensive}} against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges of <b>unity</b> <b>and</b> badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the Volcan Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations {{associated}} with the Restoration Movement had been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew between those who emphasized <b>unity</b> <b>and</b> those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church. In contrast, the Christian Church may consider any practice not expressly forbidden.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{proposed}} to mediate between Buenos Aires and the Federal League led by Artigas.

O'Higgins recommended caution, fearing that San Martín might be captured. Pueyrredón rejected the mediation, as he did not recognize Artigas as an equal to negotiate with him.|$|E
