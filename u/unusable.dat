5|$|In {{the case}} of where a pilot uses up his ammunition, or if his weapons are <b>unusable,</b> he should ram the enemy bomber.|$|E
5|$|Several {{earthquakes}} {{occurred in}} subsequent years, but they caused comparatively little damage. One, on 15 June 1803, affected Bucharest's water system and rendered many pumps <b>unusable.</b> Three other major earthquakes occurred in 1804 and 1812.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from the wreckage, but the Cockpit Voice Recorder had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was <b>unusable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The map the Workmans {{made during}} this trip was of low quality. According to Mason, the couple {{did not have}} a good sense of {{topographical}} direction, which meant that their measurements were inaccurate and <b>unusable</b> by the Survey of India.|$|E
5|$|The ore {{was easily}} located and worked from shallow pits and shafts, {{but once the}} usable upper {{deposits}} were removed, or if a mine shaft entered the bed too far below the surface, only <b>unusable</b> unconverted pyritic deposits were found.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, at {{the initial}} stage, card holders of first {{generation}} cardholder may voluntarily replace their cards at Octopus Service Point without charge. In 2017, the final call on card replacement is launched by Octopus company, or first generation card will be <b>unusable</b> by stages starting from 2018 January. Cardholder can replace these cards without charge at MTR or KMB Customer Service Centre, and Octopus Service Point.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo. Also in 1980, the new embassy under construction in Moscow was found to be so riddled with listening devices that it would be <b>unusable</b> for secure work.|$|E
5|$|Rendered <b>unusable</b> due to {{a bombing}} by the Italians on 5 July 1915, the ruins {{remained}} {{in a state of}} disrepair until the advent of the 21st century, when it was restored by the local administration of Ampezzo, {{with the assistance of the}} Lacedelli family. The fort houses a museum containing relics related to the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water <b>unusable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The San Esteban {{findings}} {{included three}} broken anchors and a wrought iron swivel gun {{that was also}} broken and <b>unusable.</b> The broken objects may have been kept so they could later be repaired, or may have just been used for ballast. There were four anchors in working condition.|$|E
5|$|The first Wii system {{software}} update (via WiiConnect24) caused {{a small number}} of launch units to become completely <b>unusable.</b> This forced users to either send their units to Nintendo for repairs (if they wished to retain their saved data) or exchange them for free replacements.|$|E
5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there were not enough guns on the island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were <b>unusable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} an increase in population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it <b>unusable.</b> The offices of the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
5|$|Brazil revoked its {{neutrality}} in the {{war between}} the United States and Germany on 1 June 1917, but did not declare war. At the same time, all German merchant ships interned in Brazilian harbors, 45 in all, were boarded and seized; most were <b>unusable</b> due to neglect or sabotage. On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again stopped short of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the International Society of Nephrology (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks could potentially injure or kill staff and make equipment <b>unusable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s about whether the Camber might silt up further and ultimately become <b>unusable</b> as an anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Despite the near-debacle, the {{commitment}} of the Sa'iqa, along with the paratroopers of the 85th Battalion, had actually reinforced Egyptian defenses and helped defeat the Israeli attack. The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see-saw fashion, raging back and forth, but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress, and the Egyptian paratroopers were firmly in control of Touscan. According to Trevor N. Dupuy, by this time Israeli artillery fire had made the main Cairo-Ismailia road <b>unusable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and <b>unusable.</b> Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they {{would also have to}} fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|During his patrol, Spider-Man stops a {{group of}} thieves who are {{breaking}} into a bakery. Simultaneously, Spider-Man takes pictures {{to give to the}} Daily Bugle. He happily leaves and returns home before his curfew. However, upon reviewing the photos, he discovers they are unfortunately <b>unusable.</b> Meanwhile, Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with an experimental serum, in an attempt to regrow his missing arm, before going to bed. Later, he awakens to discover his arm has indeed regrown. His wife, Martha, is furious that he experimented on himself without her knowledge, but softens upon seeing their son's reaction.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the scabbard and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were originally designed for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are <b>unusable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 11th century {{dispute over}} the cathedral {{graveyard}} had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be granted to the cathedral. A panel met to agree exactly how the land should be divided, concluding that the division should run straight across the bailey; the far side was returned to the cathedral, making {{the remainder of the}} castle <b>unusable</b> from a military perspective. Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 1941, during World War II {{the station}} was heavily damaged in an air raid. Much of the {{building}} was destroyed and the tracks to the station were rendered <b>unusable.</b> Although some funeral trains continued to run from nearby Waterloo station, the London terminus was never used again. Following {{the end of the}} war the London Necropolis Company decided that reopening the London Necropolis Railway was not financially worthwhile, and the surviving part of the station building was sold as office space. This remnant remains intact, and relatively unaltered since its opening.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 1970, First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon christened Pan Am's first 747, at Dulles International Airport (later Washington Dulles International Airport) in the {{presence}} of Pan Am chairman Najeeb Halaby. Instead of champagne, red, white, and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft. The 747 entered service on January22, 1970, on Pan Am's New York–London route; the flight had been planned for the evening of January21, but engine overheating made the original aircraft <b>unusable.</b> Finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day when Clipper Victor was used.|$|E
5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices <b>unusable</b> due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|The Syrians were {{equipped}} with rifles discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I and {{those used by}} the Sharifian Army's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt. The Syrians also possessed a number of machine guns and about 15 artillery batteries. According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120–250 bullets per rifle, 45 bullets per machine gun, and 50–80 shells per cannon. Part of this ammunition was also <b>unusable</b> because many bullet and rifle types did not correspond to each other.|$|E
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, a move that would later make them <b>unusable</b> for rail service.|$|E
5|$|The city faced {{attacks from}} Arab nomads from the Banu Hilal tribe. In 1057 the Zirids {{abandoned}} it for el-Mahdia, {{and it was}} never occupied again. Its building materials were later used by the inhabitants of Kairouan. As of 2009 {{the site of the}} city was a wasteland, crossed by many ditches, surrounded by the homes of poor people. Anything that could be reused for construction or other purposes has been scavenged during the centuries since it was abandoned. Stones, bricks, glass and metal were all removed. Little survived except fragments of <b>unusable</b> stucco.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{industry}} would ultimately {{prove to be}} a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it <b>unusable</b> for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 30-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two twin gun turrets, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Each gun was {{provided}} with 80 shells per gun. Hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major problem with the four of these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship and were <b>unusable</b> at high speed or in heavy weather. They were removed as useless in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E
5|$|Transportation {{was greatly}} {{affected}} by the hurricane, as well. The rainfall left 70% of the roads <b>unusable</b> or destroyed and greatly damaged 92bridges. Over 1,700miles (2700km) of highways or access roads needed replacement subsequent to the storm, especially {{in the northern part}} of the country and along portions of the Pan-American Highway. Total transportation damage amounted to $300million (1998USD). Agricultural losses were significant, including the deaths of 50,000 animals, mostly bovines. Crops and fisheries were affected greatly as well, and, combined with agricultural losses, damage totaled to $185million (1998USD).|$|E
5|$|Watchmen is an American comic-book limited series {{published}} by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, and collected in 1987. The series {{was created by}} a British collaboration consisting of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters {{that the company had}} acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters <b>unusable</b> for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.|$|E
5|$|Watt {{was waiting}} for the order, and in 1938 had {{arranged}} for production of the transmitters at Metrovick and receivers at A.C. Cossor. These {{turned out to be the}} wrong products: Metrovick had been told to directly copy ("Chinese") the 1937 design by Percy Hibberd, but Bawdsey had delivered the wrong prototype to Metrovick, who copied it. The Cossor receivers were found to be <b>unusable,</b> weighing as much as the entire transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically <b>unusable</b> for some considerable time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} GCCS operations, the General Post Office (GPO) {{established}} a training school, and a women's {{teacher training college}} was opened in 1948. The Ministry of Aviation also opened the Navaid training school on part of the site. The GPO had blocks built in the south-east area of the site, and other blocks were adapted from their original conditions for new uses. The CTS division of GCHQ remained on the site within Blocks C and D until 1987. Aerial masts which had been erected by the division became <b>unusable</b> after the nearby train line was electrified, and were removed the year CTS left.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them <b>unusable.</b> In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E
5|$|Barely Real is the 1992 {{extended}} play (EP) by the American indie {{rock band}} Codeine. After releasing their previous album Frigid Stars LP in 1990, the group accepted {{an invitation from}} the quartet Bastro to tour in Europe in 1991. Following the tour the group was invited to record a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted to record their follow-up album The White Birch in 1992. The recording sessions proved to be disastrous for the group since it found themselves often with <b>unusable</b> tracks over several different studios. As Codeine could not record enough material for a full-length album, they decided to release what tracks they had as an EP.|$|E
