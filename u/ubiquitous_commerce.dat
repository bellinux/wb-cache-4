40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} autonomous fair signature exchange in emerging <b>ubiquitous</b> (u-) <b>commerce</b> systems, which require that the exchange task be delegated to authorised devices for its autonomous and secure execution. Relevant existing work is either inefficient or ineffective in dealing with such delegated exchange. To rectify this situation, this paper aims to propose an effective, efficient and secure solution to the delegated exchange to support the important autonomy feature offered by u-commerce systems. The proposed work includes a novel approach to symmetric-key based verifiable proxy encryption to make the exchange delegation flexible, efficient and simple to implement on resource-limited devices commonly used in u-commerce systems. This approach is then applied to design a new exchange protocol. An analysis of the protocol is also provided to confirm its security and fairness. Moreover, a comparison with related work is presented to demonstrate its much better efficiency and simplicity...|$|R
40|$|Discrimination of benign {{sources from}} threat sources at Port of Entries (POE) is {{of a great}} {{importance}} in efficient screening of cargo and vehicles using Radiation Portal Monitors (RPM). Currently RPM's ability to distinguish these radiological sources is seriously hampered by the energy resolution of the deployed RPMs. As naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) are <b>ubiquitous</b> in <b>commerce,</b> false alarms are problematic as they require additional resources in secondary inspection in addition to impacts on commerce. To increase the sensitivity of such detection systems without increasing false alarm rates, alarm metrics need to incorporate the ability to distinguish benign and threat sources. Principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering technique were implemented in the present study. Such techniques were investigated for their potential to lower false alarm rates and/or increase sensitivity to weaker threat sources without loss of specificity. Results of the investigation demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity in discriminating benign sources from threat sources...|$|R

40|$|Taking {{measurements}} and using measuring devices are <b>ubiquitous</b> in <b>commerce</b> and scientific activities today. Inter-laboratory studies (especially so-called Key-Comparisons) are conducted to ensure measurement capability for commerce, evaluate {{national and international}} equivalence of measure, and validate measurement devices and measurement methods or standard materials. A common protocol employed in many inter-laboratory studies is for a pilot lab to prepare materials or objects to be measured and deliver them to participating labs. The labs proceed to take {{measurements and}} report the results to the pilot lab which performs a statistical analysis. An overarching goal of many inter-laboratory studies {{is to establish a}} reference value for some measurand (the underlying quantity subject to measurement). In these studies, {{it is not unusual for}} one or more labs to report measurements that are unlike the majority. There is no consensus on how to handle these unusual measurements in a statistical analysis. Most methods, in one way or another, attempt to determine if each laboratory should be classified as an "outlier 2 ̆ 2 and discard measurements from those labs that are so classified. The practice of excluding particular measurement results without substantive reasons is discouraged. In Key-Comparison studies, the concept of outlying laboratories must be treated even more delicately. For these, discarding outlying measurements is often politically untenable. There is a need to develop methodologies for the analysis of inter-laboratory studies that model the potential existence of laboratory outliers in a way that doesn 2 ̆ 7 t let them dominate the estimation of a measurand. The development of such methodologies is the general theme of this dissertation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} new {{trends in the}} field of “pervasive” or “ubiquitous” {{computing}} in logistics. Over the past two decades, research challenges in pervasive computing have evolved following the rapid progress of information and communication technology. Researchers are working to create an “Internet of Things” that globally interconnects smart devices and sensor networks. Technologies such as wireless communication, ubiquitous sensors, and passive or semi-passive RFID, are essential to monitor the transport chain. “Pervasive adaptation” is a new research challenge that has been recently introduced to describe system's ability to autonomously recognize the situation and adapt to situational changes. For example, it is expected that intelligent parcels that can observe and evaluate current environmental conditions including traffic information, velocity, new orders, temperature, or storage conditions, and decide adaptations such as changing transport route or destination and swapping vehicle. In order modern ubiquitous computing devices to become fully functional they need to overcome compatibility and security problems; these issues as well as potential solutions are explored in this paper. On the other hand, as new technology such as Ultra High Frequency RFID becomes more mature, it is launching into <b>ubiquitous</b> status in <b>commerce</b> and society...|$|R

40|$|There are {{increasingly}} many personalization services in ubiquitous computing environments that involve {{a group of}} users rather than individuals. <b>Ubiquitous</b> <b>commerce</b> {{is one example of}} these environments. <b>Ubiquitous</b> <b>commerce</b> research is highly related to recommender systems that have the ability to provide even the most tentative shoppers with compelling and timely item suggestions. When the recommendations are made for a group of users, new challenges and issues arise to provide compelling item suggestions. One of the challenges a group recommender system must cope with is the potentially conflicting preferences of multiple users when selecting items for recommendation. In this paper we focus on how individual user models can be aggregated to reach a consensus on recommendations. We describe and evaluate nine different consensus strategies and analyze them to highlight the benefits of group recommendation using live-user preference data.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the rapid {{proliferation}} of electronic commerce technologies has fundamentally transformed the way we conduct business. This trend is expected to accelerate {{in the coming years}} due to a number of different factors, including the introduction of new mobile and ubiquitous computing technologies; the wider recognition by business of the strategic advantages offered by the implementation of ubiquitous computing and communications infrastructures; the emergence of novel business models which become possible only through this technology; and last but not least the development of new economics {{that can be used to}} understand and value <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>commerce</b> activity. Nevertheless, there are different ways of conceptualising <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>commerce,</b> and hence different ways of understanding what is needed for its successful implementation. One perspective is the objective view in which technologies are seen as distinct entities with specific qualities and mostly predictable consequences.

40|$|Advances in {{wireless}} networking, {{mobile broadband}} Internet access technology {{as well as}} the rapid development of ubiquitous computing means Internet shopping is no longer limited to restricted environ-ments. <b>Ubiquitous</b> <b>commerce</b> (u-commerce) must not only provide the customers with commodity information at any time and any place, but also must provide customers with the appropriate shopping assistance for their context to help them complete their shopping activity. In the <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>commerce,</b> the preferences of customers change frequently over time. Therefore, u-commerce application should consider customers ’ preference contexts and incorporate them into the recommender process of the system. This paper proposes a context-aware personalized recommendation approach for implementing adaptive ubiquitous shopping. First, the customers ’ preference contexts are automatically acquired from click streams of customers. Considering the time-sensitive characteristics of preference contexts, the exponential smoothing method is used to predict the customers ’ preference contexts more accurately in the recommen-dation process. Second, the preference contexts are used as implicit ratings of commodities, and the collaborative filtering based on preference contexts can be utilized to generate recommended commodity lists for the customers. Finally, the experiments are conducted and the proposed recommen-dation approach is compared with traditional collaboration filtering approach (CF). The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed recommendation approach outperforms the traditional CF, and can improve the customers ’ shopping effectiveness in a preference context-aware manner...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As <b>{{ubiquitous}}</b> <b>commerce</b> is coming, {{the ubiquitous}} recommendation systems utilize collaborative filtering to help users with fast {{searches for the}} best suitable items by analyzing the similar preference. However, collaborative filtering may not provide high quality recommendation {{because it does not}} consider user’s preference on the attribute, the first rater problem, and the sparsity problem. This paper proposes the user preference through learning user profile for ubiquitous recommendation systems to solve the current problems. In addition, to determine the similarity between the users belonging to particular categories and new users, we assign different statistical values to the preference through learning user profile. We evaluated the proposed method on the EachMovie dataset and it was found to significantly outperform the previously proposed method. ...|$|E
