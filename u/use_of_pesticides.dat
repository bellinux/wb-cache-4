5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, without the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|Organic {{apples are}} {{commonly}} {{produced in the}} United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E
5|$|Today, poison is {{used for}} {{a wider variety of}} {{purposes}} than it used to be. For example, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds. Such chemicals, known as pesticides, have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 million tons of industrial pesticides are used each year. Other poisons {{can also be used to}} preserve foods and building material.|$|E
40|$|Demands {{towards the}} {{increase}} of high profits {{and the safety of}} the agricultural product have made the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> unavoidable. Regulation and government effort to prevent farmers from the dangerous <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> has long been implemented {{but the fact is that}} until nowadays the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> by farmers is far from safety standard. Both the effect of acute and chronic pesticide intoxication can create nervous system disorder and even death. Most users do not have enough knowledge about the danger <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> and safety work procedure. In order to increase the quality of the farmers’ health and to prevent them from the effect of acute intoxication and long term <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> effect, it is necessary to develop strategies to anticipate the effect <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> through Total Ergonomic Approach. This approach (TEA) includes SHIP approaches (Systemic, Holistic, Interdisciplinary and Participatory) and Appropriate Technology assessment in design. Based on the anticipating strategies towards the effect <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> intoxication on the farmers it is hoped that in the future the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> can fulfill safety standard and increase the life quality of farmers and community in general...|$|R
30|$|The {{surface and}} ground water bodies are easily being {{contaminated}} by runoff water or by rain for the indiscriminate <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide.</b> According to Rahman (2000), the widespread <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> may contaminate {{the environment and}} freshwater fish. It is obligatory of entering the fractions of applied insecticides into the aquatic ecosystems due to the application techniques for crop protection (Van Wijngaarden et al. 2005).|$|R

5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} has {{an extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern. In the western Palaearctic, populations are generally stable or increasing, {{but there have been}} local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> and this may still be the case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E

5|$|Various {{causes for}} the {{dramatic}} decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks; electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; and diseases. A shortage of nesting sites caused {{by changes in}} urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows. A primary cause of the decline {{seems to be an}} insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|Resistance can {{be managed}} by {{reducing}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pesticide.</b> This allows non-resistant organisms to out-compete resistant strains. They can later be killed by returning to <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide.</b>|$|R

25|$|Every dollar ($1) that {{is spent}} on {{pesticides}} for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved. This means based that, {{on the amount of}} money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds. In general, farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round. The general public also benefits from the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria.

40|$|Background: There are {{inconsistencies}} {{about the}} effects of farmworker housing and workplace conditions and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> self-protective behavior practices and personal protective equipment (PPE). Objective: To investigate the association between workplace and housing conditions and farmworker <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> safety practices and PPE. Methods: This study was conducted in 4 counties in North Carolina, USA, from July to October, 2010, during the agricultural growing season. Farmworkers working in agriculture aged 18 to 62 (n= 187) were administered a structured questionnaire to collect self-reported measures on housing and workplace conditions. <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> safety and PPE were examined by asking questions about wearing gloves, wearing socks, and wearing a hat. Chi-square and multiple logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analyses. Results: Farmworkers reporting availability of enough hot and cold water for bathing and doing laundry were 13. 6 times more likely to use pesticide safety practices (adjusted OR: 13. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 4 – 135. 4), whereas, those who reported that soap for handwashing was always or usually available while doing agricultural work were 7. 8 times more likely to use pesticide safety practices (adjusted OR: 7. 8, 95 % CI: 3. 3 – 18. 5). Farmworkers that reported access to water to wash their hands with while performing agricultural work were more likely to use PPE (adjusted OR: 3. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 3 – 9. 2). Conclusions: Some migrant farmworker labor camps are not supplying acceptable housing conditions such as 1 handwashing sink per 6 people (n= 10, 5. 4 %). <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> safety practices and PPE is greater when farmers provide decontamination supplies. Improvement of housing and workplace conditions are crucial to increase <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> safety practices and PPE...|$|R
