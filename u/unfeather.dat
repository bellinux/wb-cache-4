5|$|Engines and {{propellers}} numbers 1 to 3 suffered substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and propeller number 4 suffered much less damage. The investigators determined {{that at the time}} of impact, propellers 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing power but propeller number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action was taken by the crew to <b>unfeather</b> propeller number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained evidence of any internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the results indicated normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E

50|$|The {{plane was}} {{cruising}} {{at an altitude}} of 8,000 feet when it encountered icing. This caused two engines to fail. As the craft descended, the other two engines also failed, causing the propellers to autofeather. The crew tried and failed to restart the engines, and were unable to <b>unfeather</b> the propellers normally; they then put the plane into a dive in an attempt to force the propellers from their feathered position. Eventually they succeeded in restarting engine number four. They applied full power to this engine, which caused the craft to enter a circling descent until crashing into trees; at the time of impact it had almost no forward velocity. Five trees were driven through the fuselage, yet their trunks remained intact.|$|E

50|$|The vulturine {{guineafowl}} {{is a large}} (61-71 cm) {{bird with}} a round body and small head. It has a longer wings, neck, legs and tail than other guineafowl. The adult has a bare blue face and black neck, and although all other guineafowl have <b>unfeathered</b> heads, this species looks particularly like a vulture because of the long bare neck and head.|$|R
25|$|Immature birds differ {{little from}} adults; they have lighter margins {{to the back}} feathers, {{producing}} a scalloped effect. The light parts of the plumage are almost white, paler than in adults; the <b>unfeathered</b> parts are also paler. Nestlings are covered in peculiarly dense down, reminiscent of a duckling's; they are generally brownish buff, darker above, and already show the blackish facial marks of the adults.|$|R
50|$|In September 1993 the Pond racer {{was entered}} again and once more, piloted by Rick Brickert.

50|$|The picathartes, rockfowl or bald crows {{are a small}} genus of two {{passerine}} {{bird species}} forming the family Picathartidae found in the rain-forests of tropical west and central Africa. They have <b>unfeathered</b> heads, and feed on insects and invertebrates picked from damp rocky areas. Both species are totally non-migratory, being dependent on a specialised rocky jungle habitat.Both species are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
50|$|This large, glossy, blue-black ibis has an <b>unfeathered</b> red {{face and}} head, and a long, decurved red bill. It breeds colonially on and amongst rocks and on cliffs, laying {{two or three}} eggs which are {{incubated}} for 21 days before hatching. It is a large bird that feeds and roosts in substantial groups. It feeds on insects, small reptiles, rodents and small birds. They do little vocalizing other than occasional gobbling sounds.|$|R
50|$|The ibises are gregarious long-legged {{wading birds}} with long down-curved bills; they form one {{subfamily}} of the Threskiornithidae, the other subfamily being the spoonbills. The two Geronticus species differ from other ibises {{in that they}} have <b>unfeathered</b> faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives. The species is currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, however, it is in no immediate danger of extinction.|$|R
50|$|The Papuan eagle (Harpyopsis novaeguineae) {{also known}} as the Papuan harpy eagle, New Guinea eagle, or Kapul eagle, is a large (length 75-90 cm, {{wingspan}} 157 cm, weight 1600-2400 g) greyish brown raptor with a short full crest, broad three-banded wings, powerful beak, large iris, long rounded tail and white underparts. It has long and powerful <b>unfeathered</b> legs with sharp claws. The sexes are similar, and the female is slightly larger than the male. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Harpyopsis.|$|R
50|$|The wattled {{starling}} is 21 cm long, {{with a short}} tail and pointed wings. It has mainly grey plumage except for a white rump, and black flight feathers and tail. The breeding male has a white shoulder patch and a distinctive head pattern, with <b>unfeathered</b> yellow skin, and black forehead and throat wattles. The {{extent to which these}} seasonal features develop increases with the age of the bird, and some old females may show a weaker version of this plumage.|$|R
50|$|The ibises are gregarious, long-legged {{wading birds}} with long down-curved bills. Along with the spoonbills they form one {{subfamily}} within the Threskiornithidae family. The northern bald ibis' closest relative, {{and the only}} other member of the genus, is the southern bald ibis, G. calvus, of southern Africa. The two Geronticus species differ from other ibises in that they have <b>unfeathered</b> faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives.|$|R
40|$|Pathological and {{immunohistochemical}} {{findings in}} the skin of an Egyptian goose naturally infected with avian pox virus are described in this paper. Cutaneous papules and nodules were observed on the <b>unfeathered</b> parts of the skin. Histopathological examination revealed hyperplasia of the epithelial cells of the stratum spinosum, with presence of eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions. Avipoxvirus was detected in the formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues of goose skin by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence. To our knowledge, {{this could be the}} first record of avian pox in geese in Egypt...|$|R
50|$|The bearded bellbird (Procnias averano) {{also known}} as the campanero or anvil-bird, is a {{passerine}} bird which occurs in northern South America. The male is about 28 cm long with white plumage apart from a brown head and black wings. At his throat hang several black, <b>unfeathered</b> wattles. The female is a little smaller with olive-green head and upper parts, yellow underparts streaked with green and a yellow vent area. The male has a loud, repeated metallic hammering call, as well as various other vocalisations.|$|R
50|$|The Archangel is a {{breed of}} fancy pigeon, notable for the {{metallic}} sheen of its feathers. Archangels, {{along with other}} varieties of domesticated pigeons, are all descendants from the rock pigeon (Columba livia). It is kept as an ornamental or fancy breed, valued for its unusual appearance. Archangels are small, weighing about 12 oz. They have <b>unfeathered</b> legs and dark orange eyes. They {{may or may not}} be crested. The body of the bird is bronze or gold with wings that are either black, white, or blue.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} bald ibis, hermit ibis, or waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is a {{migratory bird}} found in barren, semi-desert or rocky habitats, often close to running water. This 70 - 80 cm glossy black ibis, which, unlike {{other members of}} the ibis family, is non-wading, has an <b>unfeathered</b> red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} often {{considered}} a subspecies of the Eurasian eagle-owl Bubo bubo {{and is very}} similar in appearance. The facial disk is unmarked and has a black border, a feature that is much weaker in the Eurasian form. The base of the primaries is unbanded and rufous. The tail bands have the tawn bands wider than the black ones. A large pale scapular patch is visible on the folded wing. The inner claws are the longest. The last joint of the toes are <b>unfeathered.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sexes {{are similar}} in plumage, {{although}} males are generally larger than females, and, as with other ibises that breed in colonies, have longer bills. The longer-billed males are more successful in attracting a mate. The downy chick has uniformly pale brown plumage, and the fledged juvenile resembles the adult except {{that it has a}} dark head, light grey legs, and a pale bill. The <b>unfeathered</b> areas of the young bird's head and neck gradually become red as it matures. Moroccan birds have a significantly longer bill than Turkish birds of the same sex.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{typically}} 73 to 75 cm long. Some specimens may exceed {{a length of}} 80 cm and a weight of 3.5 kg. It is marginally larger than the two other crowned pigeons on average, thus is considered the largest surviving species of pigeon of earth. The standard measurements among pigeons on mainland New Guinea are: the wing chord is 36 - 39 cm, the tail is 27 - 30.1 cm, the bill is 3.2 - 3.5 cm and the <b>unfeathered</b> tarsus is 8.5 - 9.8 cm.|$|R
50|$|The moorhen is a {{distinctive}} species, with dark plumage {{apart from the}} white undertail, yellow legs and a red frontal shield. The young are browner and lack the red shield. The frontal shield of the adult has a rounded top and fairly parallel sides; the tailward margin of the red <b>unfeathered</b> area is a smooth waving line. In the related common gallinule of the Americas, the frontal shield has a fairly straight top and is less wide towards the bill, giving a marked indentation to the back margin of the red area.|$|R
50|$|Swans are {{the largest}} extant members of the {{waterfowl}} family Anatidae, and are among the largest flying birds. The largest species, including the mute swan, trumpeter swan, and whooper swan, can reach a length of over 1.5 m and weigh over 15 kg. Their wingspans can be over 3.1 m. Compared to the closely related geese, they are much larger and have proportionally larger feet and necks. Adults also have a patch of <b>unfeathered</b> skin between the eyes and bill. The sexes are alike in plumage, but males are generally bigger and heavier than females.|$|R
50|$|The helmeted {{guineafowl}} {{is a large}} (53-58 cm) bird with a round body and small head. They weigh about 1.3 kg. The body plumage is gray-black spangled with white. Like other guineafowl, this species has an <b>unfeathered</b> head, in this case decorated with a dull yellow or reddish bony knob, and red and blue patches of skin. The wings are short and rounded, and the tail is also short. Various sub-species are proposed, differences in appearance being mostly a large variation in shape, size and colour of the casque and facial wattles.|$|R
5000|$|It {{reaches a}} length between 19 and 22 cm. The wings are about 17 cm. Its plumage is rufous brown and {{exhibits}} black shaft streaks. The underparts and the facial disc are rufous. The long grey legs are <b>unfeathered.</b> The eyes {{are large and}} golden yellow. The ear tufts are very small. Its call which sounds like a rasping [...] "whaugh" [...] with various [...] "tok tok" [...] notes can be heard from a far distance and in particular in the darkness. Its diet consists of geckos, tree frogs and insects (e.g. locusts).|$|R
5|$|The bill {{is black}} in the {{nominate}} subspecies but pale or yellowish in adults of the smaller Indian ginginianus. Rasmussen and Anderton (2005) suggest that this variation may need further study, particularly due to the intermediate black-tipped bill described in rubripersonatus. The facial skin is yellow and <b>unfeathered</b> down to the throat. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage but breeding males have a deeper orange facial skin colour than females. Females average slightly larger and are about 10â€“15% heavier than males. Young birds are blackish or chocolate brown with black and white patches. The adult plumage is attained only after about five years.|$|R
