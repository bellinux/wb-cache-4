5|$|Several other {{formations}} {{were also}} created but were mostly eroded away following two major periods of <b>uplift.</b> The Laramide orogeny affected the entire {{western part of}} what would become North America starting about 70million to 50million years ago. This event helped to build the Rocky Mountains {{and in the process}} closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this <b>uplift.</b> The Colorado Plateaus were uplifted 16million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus, each separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own <b>uplift</b> rate. The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this <b>uplift.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to <b>uplift</b> the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block {{and the resulting}} accelerated <b>uplift</b> of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional <b>uplift</b> occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. <b>Uplift</b> of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the San Joaquin Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their <b>uplift</b> along a blind thrust fault (the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' <b>uplift,</b> it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The <b>uplift</b> also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{ingredient in}} the construction of phenomenologically viable superstring models is the <b>uplifting</b> of Anti-de Sitter supersymmetric critical points in the moduli sector to metastable Minkowski or de Sitter vacua with broken supersymmetry. In all cases described so far, <b>uplifting</b> results in a displacement of the potential minimum away from the critical point and, if the <b>uplifting</b> is large, can lead to the disappearance of the minimum altogether. We propose a variant of F-term <b>uplifting</b> which exactly preserves supersymmetric critical points and shift symmetries at tree level. In spite of a direct coupling, the moduli do not contribute to supersymmetry breaking. We analyse the stability of the critical points in a toy one-modulus sector before and after <b>uplifting,</b> and find a simple stability condition depending solely on the amount of <b>uplifting</b> and not on the details of the <b>uplifting</b> sector. There is a region of parameter space, corresponding to the <b>uplifting</b> of local AdS maxima [...] or, more importantly, local minima of the Kahler function [...] where the critical points are stable for any amount of <b>uplifting.</b> On the other hand, <b>uplifting</b> to (non- supersymmetric) Minkowski space is special in that all SUSY critical points, that is, for all possible compactifications, become stable or neutrally stable.

50|$|The Paleozoic {{basement}} pierces the {{sedimentary cover}} in several almond-shaped, horst-like <b>uplifts,</b> their size ranging from 1 to 300 km2. Examples are the so-called massifs satellites nord-pyrénéens (north pyrenean basement <b>uplifts)</b> between Lourdes and Perpignan, amongst them the following uplifts: Agly, Arize, Barousse, Bessède-de-Sault, Castillon, Milhas, Plantach, Saint-Barthélémy, Salvezines, and Rabat-les-Trois-Seigneurs, plus several <b>uplifts</b> {{in the northern}} Basque country. These <b>uplifts</b> have a left-lateral shearing origin and are tilted to the north; simultaneously they also exhibit a vertical shearing component. They probably formed in the Variscan orogeny. In the basement <b>uplifts,</b> mainly Precambrian gneisses and granulitic gneisses (in the Agly massif), and Paleozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks are found.|$|R
5|$|Geologically, West Antarctica {{closely resembles}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula {{was formed by}} <b>uplift</b> and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment <b>uplift</b> was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to East Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|In the Miocene and Pliocene epochs further <b>uplift</b> {{and erosion}} {{occurred}} in the Highlands. Plant and animal types developed into their modern forms. Scotland lay in its present position on the globe. As the Miocene progressed, temperatures dropped and remained similar to today's.|$|E

30|$|However, {{in case of}} a {{permeable}} layer (sand) {{surrounded by}} impermeable barriers (shale or carbonate seal) on all sides and intact <b>uplifting</b> to a shallower depth, the pore pressure within this layer will be the same anywhere within its boundaries, and it is also the same before and after <b>uplifting,</b> while the pore pressure gradient in the <b>uplifted</b> part of this layer increases after <b>uplifting</b> because it is now at a shallower depth relative to the surface and will require heavier mud weight to drill.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBeginning teachers’ {{first years}} in school have been {{described}} as demanding and stressful. In explaining beginning teachers’ stress, previous research mainly focused on either trait-like personality characteristics or general work-related stressors. In contrast, the present study focused on the day-to-day experience. The aim of the current study was (a) to identify the task-related daily <b>uplifts</b> and hassles of beginning teachers, (b) to examine the association of daily <b>uplifts</b> and hassles with teachers’ socio-demographic and personality characteristics, and (c) to investigate the effect of daily <b>uplifts</b> and hassles on teachers’ emotional exhaustion. The sample consisted of 141 beginning teachers up to four years in the profession who completed an online diary for 14 consecutive days. Results showed that most daily <b>uplifts</b> and hassles were related to teaching in class and interacting with colleagues. Both hassles and <b>uplifts</b> showed only a few unsystematic correlations with teachers’ characteristics. However, daily <b>uplifts</b> and hassles significantly explained beginning teachers’ daily emotional exhaustion...|$|R

(A decade earlier Paul Oakenfold, Sasha & Digweed, and Paul van Dyk had sparked interest.) Today, <b>uplifting</b> has emerged as a widely popular electronic dance music subgenre with DJs and producers such as John O'Callaghan, Daniel Kandi, Bryan Kearney, Andy Blueman, Aly & Fila, Sean Tyas and Super8 & Tab focusing particularly on <b>uplifting</b> trance as their overriding genre, and others, such as Jason van Wyk, Above & Beyond, who include <b>uplifting</b> trance as part of their broader repertoire.

In September 2009, AfterHours hosted [...] "Uplift Day" [...] that was exclusively dedicated to <b>uplifting</b> trance.|$|R
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following <b>uplift</b> from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. <b>Uplift</b> of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The <b>uplift</b> caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent <b>uplift</b> of the Colorado Plateau and tilting of the Markagunt Plateau started 13million years ago. This steepened {{the stream}} {{gradient}} of the ancestral Virgin River (Zion Canyon {{section of the}} park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and downcut faster into the underlying Markagunt Plateau. Downcutting continues to be especially rapid after heavy rainstorms and winter runoff when the water contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. <b>Uplift</b> and downcutting are so fast that slot canyons (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the Zion Narrows, formed.|$|E
5|$|The Altiplano {{started to}} form during the Eocene, when {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate caused compression along the plate margin. Strong volcanism and tectonic <b>uplift</b> occurred between 15and 20million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The {{entire area}} {{underwent}} <b>uplift</b> during the Laramide orogeny between 70 and 40 {{million years ago}} which was {{also part of the}} Gunnison <b>Uplift.</b> This raised the Precambrian gneiss and schist that makes up the canyon walls. During the Tertiary from 26 to 35 million years ago large episodes of volcanism occurred in the area immediately surrounding the present day Black Canyon. The West Elk Mountains, La Sal Mountains, Henry Mountains, and Abajo Mountains all contributed to burying the area in several thousand feet of volcanic ash and debris.|$|E

5|$|Eruptions {{along the}} narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and {{explosion}} pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. <b>Uplift</b> of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large magma chamber {{like the one that}} produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and <b>uplift</b> within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAfter {{reviewing}} several mechanisms {{proposed to}} get a dS/Minkowski vacuum in moduli stabilization scenarios of type-IIB superstring orientifold compactifications we propose a criterium for characterizing those that may effectively lead to a positive small cosmological constant. We suggest that the variation in the expectation value of a good <b>uplifting</b> term, due to the shift in the minimum of the potential after <b>uplifting,</b> is {{much smaller than the}} original cosmological constant. This is studied with some detail in Large volume scenarios where the dependency on the volume direction is rather generic and easy to spot. Here we find that an <b>uplifting</b> term in the potential, with generic form Vup∼ 1 /Vγ, should be restricted to the one satisfying γ≪ 12. Such a bound might explain why in models previously studied no <b>uplifting</b> has been achieved, and gives motivations to study a novel proposal of dilaton dependent <b>uplifting</b> mechanism for which no numerical studies has been performed before. We find that in this case it is actually possible {{to get a}} dS vacuum, but still leave open the question of a more precise discrimination feature the good <b>uplifting</b> mechanisms should satisfy...|$|R
5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region.

Although discrepancies exist for several of the wells, a strong positive correlation can be found between erosions {{and relative}} <b>uplifts.</b> This good correlation verifies on the one hand that sonic well-logging data can give reasonably good estimates of relative <b>uplifts,</b> {{and on the other hand}} that erosions incurred during the basin inversion are strongly tectonically driven.
