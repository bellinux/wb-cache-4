5|$|The sound {{values of}} {{modified}} Latin letters {{can often be}} derived {{from those of the}} original letters. For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent retroflex consonants; and small capital letters usually represent <b>uvular</b> consonants. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, {{there is no way to}} deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example in Visible Speech) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in Hangul).|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} into {{the reconstruction of the}} consonants of Middle Mongol has engendered several controversies. Middle Mongol had two series of plosives, but there is disagreement as to which phonological dimension they lie on, whether aspiration or voicing. The early scripts have distinct letters for velar plosives and <b>uvular</b> plosives, but as these are in complementary distribution according to vowel harmony class, only two back plosive phonemes, */k/, * (~ *, *) are to be reconstructed. One prominent long running disagreement concerns certain correspondences of word medial consonants among the four major scripts (UM, SM, AM, and Ph, which were discussed in the preceding section). Word medial /k/ of Uyghur Mongolian (UM) has, not one, but two correspondences with the three other scripts: either /k/ or zero. Traditional scholarship has reconstructed */k/ for both correspondences, arguing that */k/ got lost in some instances, which raises the question of what the conditioning factors of those instances were. More recently, the other obvious possibility has been assumed, namely that the correspondence between UM /k/ and zero in the other scripts points to a distinct phoneme, /h/, which would correspond to the word-initial phoneme /h/ that is present in those other scripts. /h/ (sometimes also called /x/) is sometimes assumed to derive from *, which would also explain zero in SM, AM, Ph in some instances where UM indicates /p/, e.g. debel > Khalkha deel.|$|E

25|$|Several other {{attempts}} followed, {{with varying}} degrees of success. Some orthographic attempts even expand further: the Alfabeto Funcional Trilingüe, made up of 40 letters (including the voiced stops necessary for Spanish) and created by the Academia de las Lenguas Aymara y Quechua in Puno in 1944 is the one used by the lexicographer Juan Francisco Deza Galindo in his Diccionario Aymara – Castellano / Castellano – Aymara. This alphabet has five vowels ⟨a, e, i, o, u⟩, aspiration is conveyed with an ⟨h⟩ next to the consonant, and ejectives with ⟨’⟩. The most unusual characteristic is the expression of the <b>uvular</b> /χ/ with ⟨jh⟩. The other <b>uvular</b> segment, /q/, is expressed by ⟨q⟩, but transcription rules mandate that the following vowel must be ⟨a, e, o⟩ (not ⟨i, u⟩), presumably to account for <b>uvular</b> lowering and to facilitate multilingual orthography.|$|E
25|$|All consonants can in {{principle}} occur geminated or long, although phonemic xxʷ and ṛṛ {{do not seem}} to be attested. The <b>uvular</b> stops only occur geminated or long (qq, qqʷ).|$|E

5000|$|All five vowel phonemes vary {{considerably}} phonetically. The phoneme /i/ has three distinct allophones. It is realized as [...] following unrounded <b>uvulars.</b> It is realized as [...] {{with a central}} off-glide preceding both unrounded and rounded <b>uvulars.</b> Elsewhere, it is realized as low [...] or high [...] The /e/ is realized as a low to mid-front vowel, usually between [...] or high [...] The /a/ is low and central to back, often close to [...] The /u/ is high, back, and rounded, realized somewhere between low [...] or high [...]|$|R

25|$|In addition, many {{researchers}} use the x-caron (x̌) for the voiceless <b>uvular</b> fricative. The {{use of the}} standard IPA belted l (ɬ) for the voiceless lateral fricative is becoming increasingly common.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have harmony {{processes that}} involve {{an interaction between}} vowels and consonants. For example, Chilcotin has a phonological process known as vowel flattening (i.e. post-velar harmony) where vowels must harmonize with <b>uvular</b> and pharyngealized consonants.|$|E
25|$|Unlike active {{articulation}}, passive articulation is {{a continuum}} without many clear-cut boundaries. The places linguolabial and interdental, interdental and dental, dental and alveolar, alveolar and palatal, palatal and velar, velar and <b>uvular</b> merge into one another, and a consonant may be pronounced {{somewhere between the}} named places.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the above}} interpretation, {{the split between}} the centum and satem groups {{would not have been}} a {{straightforward}} loss of an articulatory feature (palatalization or labialization). Instead, the <b>uvulars</b> [...] (the [...] "plain velars" [...] of the traditional reconstruction) would have been fronted to velars across all branches. In the satem languages, it caused a chain shift, and the existing velars (traditionally [...] "palatovelars") were shifted further forward to avoid a merger, becoming palatal: [...] > [...] > [...] In the centum languages, no chain shift occurred, and the <b>uvulars</b> merged into the velars. The delabialisation in the satem languages would have occurred later, in a separate stage.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{letter in}} the Tsolyáni Engsvanyáli script now has a name—each {{consonant}} {{is surrounded by a}} coordinating vowel: labials in u-u, dentals in a-a, apicals in i-i, laminals in e-e, velars in o-o-, and the remaining (<b>uvulars,</b> glottals, ... etc.) in ü-ü: ...|$|R
50|$|As in the Vowels section, {{symbols in}} boldface reflect the {{conventional}} orthography, and IPA equivalents {{are given in}} brackets. In the practical orthography, <b>uvulars</b> are indicated by underlining the velar letters, , and {{the position of the}} apostrophe before or after the consonant letter distinguishes glottalization.|$|R
25|$|In the past, the Nuxálk (or Bella Coola) of British Columbia's Central Coast {{have also}} been {{considered}} Coast Salish. This language shares at least one phonological change with Coast Salish (the merger of the Proto-Salish pharyngeal approximants with the <b>uvular</b> fricatives), but it also displays certain similarities to the Interior Salish languages. If it is indeed {{a member of the}} Coast Salish branch, it was the first to split off from the rest.|$|E
25|$|Scanian dialects have various local native idioms {{and speech}} patterns, and realizes diphthongs and South Scandinavian <b>Uvular</b> trill, {{as opposed to}} the supradental /r/-sound {{characteristic}} of spoken Standard Swedish. They are very similar to the dialect of Danish spoken in Bornholm, Denmark. The prosody of the Scanian dialects has more in common with German, Danish and Dutch (and sometimes also with English, although to a lesser extent) than with the prosody of central Swedish dialects.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, {{there is a}} set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or <b>uvular</b> ejective fricative, these phonological elements make it easy to distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, it is harder to tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E
5000|$|The {{consonant}} inventory largely resembles Arabic: differentiated voicing; <b>uvulars,</b> pharyngeals (traditionally {{referred to}} as emphatics) requiring the pharynx muscles to contract and influencing the pronunciation of the following vowel (although [...] only occur in Arabic loans and [...] only {{in the name of}} Allah).|$|R
5000|$|... and [...] are unchanged. The {{environment}} around <b>uvulars</b> and velars {{produces a}} different set of variants, including occasional slight diphthongs. Additionally, some roots cause darkened vowels to appear in suffixes; one example is the prefix -ekst ("hand, arm"), which is darkened in x°əl’-akst. The darkened vowels are as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{variants}} can the established. Since palatalized consonants are -back, {{the appearance}} of palatalized <b>uvulars</b> in a few languages such as Ubykh is difficult to account for. According to Vaux (1999), they possibly hold the features +high, -back, -ATR, the last being the distinguishing feature from a palatalized velar consonant.|$|R
25|$|Phonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, <b>uvular,</b> pharyngeal, and glottal consonants in a {{distribution}} rather {{similar to that}} of Arabic. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of tenuis and emphatic consonants, as in many Semitic languages, or one of aspirated and ejective consonants, as in many Cushitic languages.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} reading traditions have been {{preserved}} in liturgical use. In Oriental (Sephardi and Mizrahi) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the Ashkenazi (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over <b>uvular</b> or glottal articulation when representing {{the community in}} religious service such as prayer and Torah reading), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. The Samaritan tradition has a complex vowel system which does not correspond closely to the Tiberian systems.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the lack}} of fricatives, the most {{striking}} feature of Australian speech sounds is {{the large number of}} places of articulation. Nearly every language has four places in the coronal region, either phonemically or allophonically. This is accomplished through two variables: the position of the tongue (front or back), and its shape (pointed or flat). There are also bilabial, velar and often palatal consonants, but a complete absence of <b>uvular</b> or glottal consonants. Both stops and nasals occur at all six places, and in some languages laterals occur at all four coronal places.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the term}} has {{historically}} been used by phoneticians, and is occasionally used by phonologists today, it is now more common in popular use as an imprecise term for sounds produced relatively far back in the vocal tract. The term continues {{to be used by}} some phonologists to denote laryngeal consonants (including <b>uvulars),</b> as well as murmured, pharyngealized, glottalized, and strident vowels.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all ejective consonants in the world's {{languages}} are stops or affricates, and all ejective consonants are obstruents. [...] {{is the most}} common ejective, and [...] is common among languages with <b>uvulars,</b> [...] less so, and [...] is uncommon. Among affricates, [...] are all quite common, and [...] and [...] are not unusual ( [...] is particularly common among the Khoisan languages, where it is the ejective equivalent of [...] ).|$|R
2500|$|Both [...] and [...] undergo apicalisation after alveodental continuants in {{unstressed}} syllables, e.g. siler [...] 'you (plural)', ziyan [...] 'harm'. They are medialised after [...] {{or before}} , e.g. til [...] 'tongue', xizmet [...] 'work; job; service'. After velars, <b>uvulars</b> and [...] they are realised as , e.g. giram [...] 'gramme', xelqi [...] 'his [...] nation', Finn [...] 'Finn'. Between two syllables that contain a rounded back vowel each, they are realised as back, e.g. qolimu [...] 'also his [...] arm'.|$|R
