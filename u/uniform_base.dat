40|$|A base B for a space X {{is said to}} be uniform (respectively, weakly uniform) if, {{for each}} p C X and each {{infinite}} subcollection _H of B_, each member of which contains p, H _ is a local base for p (respectively, Ch H [...] = { p}). The concept of a <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> is apparently due to Alexandroff and has been studied by Russian topologists for several years. However, it was noted independently by Alexandroff in [1] and Heath in [2] that a regular Tl-space has a <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> if and only if it is a metacompact Moore space. Hence, in one terminology or the other, spaces with a <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> have long {{played an important role in}} the study of generalized metric spaces. The concept of a weakly <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> has recently been defined and studied by. Heath and Lindgren in [3]. It is the purpose of this paper to resolve some basic questions about this property which arise from the work in [3]. In [3], an example is given of (1) a paracompact Tl-space that has a weakly <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> but fails to be first countable and (2) a paracompact, first countable T 1 -space that has a weakly <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> but fails to be a Moore space.

40|$|A base B for a space X is a weakly <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> if no {{two points}} of X belong to {{infinitely}} {{many members of}} B. More generally, any family of sets with this property is called a weakly uniform family. This concept {{may be useful in}} resolving certain unsolved problems regarding spaces that have a Gb-diagonal. (A Hausdorff space with a weakly <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> has a Gb-diagonal and is metrizable if it is countably compact and regular.) Also weakly uniform bases are closely related to point-countable bases [4, 9] and to orthocompactness [6]. Metacompact Moore spaces [1, 7], the Michael line [11, Example 71], and the pointed irrational extension of R [1 1, Example 69] all have weakly uniform bases. The following proposition shows that most of the results we obtain for spaces with weakly uniform bases hold for spaces that have point-separating weakly uniform open covers. PROPOSITION 1. For any space X, the following are equivalent. ' (i) X can be condensed onto a space with a weakly uniform point-separating open cover, (ii) X can be condensed onto a space with a weakly <b>uniform</b> <b>base,</b> (iiO X has a weakly uniform poin t-separating open co ver. A further generalization of weakly <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> obtains if in the definition, "infinitely " is replaced by "uncountably". We believe, however, that the interests of clarity will be best served by stating our results in terms of weakly uniform bases and leaving the verification of their generalizations to the reader. We assume that all spaces are Hausdorff. For any space X, let I(X) = (xlx • X and x is an isolated point} and I_(X) = ((x} ix • I(X) }. PROPOSITION 2.

40|$|The {{influence}} of base profile design on the Si/SiGe HBT characteristics is investigated. It is determined that for <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> HBT, {{with the increase}} of base doping concentration and the base Ge mole fraction, the cutoff frequency of the HBT decreases. But the current gain decreases {{with the increase of}} base doping concentration and increases with the increase of Ge mole fraction. For graded base HBT, when the base width is 700 A, the Ge mole fraction grading of (0. 2 - 0. 1) / 700 A from collector edge to the emitter edge in the base region is enough for raising the cutoff frequency. For the same Ge dose in the base region, <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> HBT provides higher current gain but lower cutoff frequency than graded base HBT. Finally, we have designed and fabricated <b>uniform</b> <b>base</b> Si/SiGe HBT for power application, the current gain is 50 - 320 and the cutoff frequency is 7. 5 GHz at collector-emitter voltage of 4 V and collector current of 300 mA...|$|E
