40|$|The use {{of contact}} lens (CL) for the {{correction}} of refractive errors, cosmetic use and their usage as a therapeutic modality for corneal pathologies has increased tremendously over the years. The {{present study was}} conducted with the aim to find a pattern of CL use amongst college students with a focus on the rationale for CL use and problems related to their use. This study includes 371 college students who were current <b>users</b> of <b>CL</b> {{at the time of the}} study. Results showed that 96. 8 % of the <b>CL</b> <b>users</b> use the ‘daily wear type’ of CL.

40|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that cochlear implantation (CI) benefits deaf children's speech perception, language development and speech production. Early fitting of an implant results in improved outcomes. This thesis explores the development and determinants of phonological awareness (PA) in paediatric <b>Cl</b> <b>users.</b> Phonological awareness is important for literacy acquisition in hearing children. In hearing children phonological awareness develops first at the syllable level then at the intra-syllabic level of onset-rime and finally at the phoneme level. It is expected that paediatric <b>Cl</b> <b>users</b> will follow the same developmental trajectory. The impact of the timing of cochlear implant fitting on phonological awareness and the relationship between phonological awareness and word reading are also investigated. Three new tests of phonological awareness were developed for the thesis. Nineteen children with implants were seen twice over a 12 month period. Nine of these children were fitted with their implant early (below 3. 6 years) and ten were fitted later (between 5 and 7 years). Several comparison groups were included; a group of profoundly deaf children with hearing aids, a group of severely deaf children, a group of hearing children with specific language impairment and two groups of typically developing hearing children. One hearing group was matched for reading level and the other group was matched for chronological age to the Cl group. Phonological awareness in <b>Cl</b> <b>users</b> developed along a similar trajectory to hearing children. Syllable awareness was equivalent in the Cl group to both groups of hearing children, awareness of rhyme and phonemes was significantly delayed, but was equivalent to the profoundly deaf children using hearing aids. The difference between the early and late Cl groups on PA performance was small. There was some evidence of a link between PA and word reading, but overall, receptive vocabulary emerged as the most robust longitudinal predictor of reading ability in deaf children...|$|R
40|$|Background: Amplitude {{modulation}} (AM) detection is {{a measure}} of temporal processing that has been correlated with cochlear implant (CI) users' speech understanding. For <b>Cl</b> <b>users,</b> AM stimuli {{have been shown to be}} louder than steady-state (non-AM) stimuli presented at the same reference current level, suggesting that unwanted loudness cues might contribute to CI users' AM sensitivity as measured in a modulation detection task. In this paper, a new method is introduced to dynamically control unwanted AM loudness cues when adaptively measuring modulation detection thresholds (MDTs) in <b>Cl</b> <b>users.</b> Methods: MDTs were adaptively measured in 9 CI subjects using a three-alternative, forced-choice procedure, with and without dynamic control of unwanted AM loudness cues. To control for AM loudness cues during the MDT task, the level of the steady-state (non-AM) stimuli was increased to match the loudness of the AM stimulus using a non-linear amplitude scaling function, which was obtained by first loudness-balancing non-AM stimuli to AM stimuli at various modulation depths. To further protect against unwanted loudness cues, +/- 0. 75 dB of level roving was also applied to all stimuli during the MDT task. Results: Absolute MDTs were generally poorer when unwanted AM loudness cues were controlled. However, the effects of modulation frequency and presentation level on modulation sensitivity were fundamentally unchanged by the availability of AM loudness cues. Conclusions: The data suggest that the present method controlling for unwanted AM loudness cues might better represent Cl users' MDTs, without changing fundamental effects of modulation frequency and presentation level on Cl users' modulation sensitivity.

Seventy students (55. 1 %) used CL. The make-to-female ratio was 1 : 2. The mean interval from the start of CL application was 5. 1 ± 2. 4 years. The types of CL consisted of hard CL in 12. 9 % of the 70 students, conventional soft CL (SCL) in 21. 4 %, frequent-replacement SCL (2 weeks) (FRSCL) in 50. 0 %, and daily disposable SCL in 15. 7 %.

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the objective vocal quality in 36 prelingually deaf children using cochlear implant (CI) with a mean age of 9 years. An additional purpose was to compare the objective vocal quality of these 36 <b>Cl</b> <b>users</b> with 25 age-matched children with prelingual severe hearing loss using conventional hearing aids (HAs) and 25 normal hearing (NH) children. Study Design. The design for this cross-sectional study was a multigroup posttest-only design. Methods. The objective vocal quality was measured by means of the dysphonia severity index (DSI). Moreover, perceptual voice assessment using the GRBASI scale was performed. Results. CI children have a vocal quality by means of the DSI of + 1. 8, corresponding with a DSI% of 68 %, indicating a borderline vocal quality situated 2 % above the limit of normality. The voice was perceptually characterized by the presence of a very slight grade of hoarseness, roughness, strained phonation, and higher pitch and intensity levels. No significant objective vocal quality differences were measured between the voices of the CI children, HA users, and NH children. Conclusions. According to the results, one aspect of the vocal approach in children with CI and using HAs must be focused on the improvement of the strained vocal characteristic and the use of a lower pitch and intensity level...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate changes in corneal epithelial cell morphology and physiology following short term (3  months) wear of highly oxygen permeable CLs and to compare this with disposable CLs.  METHODS—Subjects were wearers of highly oxygen permeable CLs (n= 11, wearing CLs on a 30  night schedule), disposable <b>CL</b> <b>users</b> (n= 6, wearing CLs on a 6  night schedule), and non-CL wearers (n= 20). Mean CL wear experience was 3  months. Epithelial cells were harvested using corneal cytology and were stained using acridine orange and ethidium bromide. Epithelial cell size and viability were determined.  RESULTS—The majority of epithelial cells recovered were non-viable (71 %), and the mean longest cell diameter was 38  (SD 8) µm. Disposable CLs caused an increase in cell size (42  (7) µm) compared with both non-wear (39  (7) µm, p= 0. 01) and wear of highly oxygen permeable CLs (37  (10) µm, p= 0. 0049). There was no difference in cell viability between groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Extended wear of disposable CLs caused an 8 % increase in cell diameter in harvested corneal epithelial cells following 3  months of CL wear. Cells harvested following 3  months' wear of highly oxygen permeable CLs were indistinguishable from those recovered from non-CL wearers. ...|$|R
40|$|Controlled Language (CL) for Ontology Editing tools {{offer an}} {{attractive}} alternative to naive users, wishing to create Ontologies. However despite {{the benefits of}} <b>CLs,</b> <b>users</b> are still required to learn the correct syntactic structures {{in order to use}} the Controlled Language properly. Referring to CL vocubulary/syntax rules can be time consuming, annoying and in certain cases may prevent uptake of the tool. This paper extends work based on a controlled language for ontology editing-CLOnE, which uses standard NLP tools, for processing the language and manipulating an ontology. The reversal of this process involves text generation of the CLOnE language from an existing ontology using Natural Language Generation (NLG), specifically template based/shallow NLG. The text generator and the CLOnE authoring process both combine to form a RoundTrip Ontology Authoring environment: one can start with an existing imported ontology or one originally produced using CLOnE, (re) produce the Controlled Language using the NL generator, modify or edit the text as required and subsequently parse the text back into the ontology using the CLOnE environment. Building on previous methodology we undertook an evaluation, comparing the Round Trip Ontology Authoring process with a well-known ontology editor; Where previous work required a CL reference manual with several examples in order to use the controlled language, the substitution of NLG reduces this learning curve for users, while simultaneously improving upon existing results for basic Ontology editing tasks...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor {{care and}} hygiene of contact lens (CL) results in eye {{problems}} and infections. Healthcare workers {{have an important}} role in advocating correct lens care. Objectives: To determine the practices of CL care and the adverse consequences of poor CL care among healthcare workers. Setting and Design: A cross-sectional study in one public and three private sector hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan, in 2009 - 2010. Materials and Methods: We questioned 500 healthcare workers of all ages and both sexes, who wore CL, about compliance with advice on care and any complications due to improper hygiene practices. Ethical approval was obtained. Chi-square tests were used to determine significance and p-value less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of the total <b>CL</b> <b>users,</b> 385 (77 %) were females. Most (75 %) respondents wore CL to correct myopia, whereas 54 % wore CL only occasionally. Surprisingly, only 24 % knew the CL cleaning protocol. Lens solution was changed daily by 33 % of users and after more than 2 weeks by 42 %. Although 412 (82 %) participants practised reasonable hand hygiene before inserting CL, 88 (18 %) did not. Infection and eye dryness were statistically significantly (P < 0. 01) associated with sex, hand-washing, and frequency of CL use.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of different indoor environments simulated in an environmental chamber on soft contact lens (CL) wearers. Methods: Fifty-four CL wearers were grouped based on their symptoms while wearing their CLs. Subjects were fitted with two different CL types, conventional hydrogel (Omafilcon A) and silicone hydrogel (comfilcon A), and exposed to two controlled indoor environmental conditions, standard [50 % relative humidity (RH), 23 degrees C, 930 mb of atmospheric pressure] and adverse (in-flight air cabin environment: 5 % RH, localised air flow, 23 degrees C, 750 mb atmospheric pressure), for 90 min in an environmental chamber, making {{a total of four}} visits. Symptoms, tear osmolarity, pre-lens tear breakup time (PLBUT), phenol red thread test, visual acuity, bulbar and limbal hyperaemia, corneal and limbal staining, and CL dehydration were assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance. A linear mixed model was used to analyse the effect of environment, CL type, discomfort-based grouping, and time on blink rate. Results: Environment was found to significantly (p <= 0. 018) affect limbal and bulbar hyperaemia, PLBUT, tear osmolarity, and CL dehydration. Likewise, CL type significantly (p <= 0. 04) affected nasal and total corneal staining, limbal conjunctival staining, CL dehydration, comfort, and blurred vision. The environment, CL type, and time had significant effects (p <= 0. 0001) on the blink rate. Conclusions: Ocular surface integrity and blink rate in CL wearers depend on the environment <b>CL</b> <b>users</b> are exposed to, {{as well as on the}} soft CL type that they are wearing.

40|$|PURPOSE: To apply {{a commercially}} {{available}} high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomographer (SOCT) {{to assess the}} change in tear volume after application of a new artificial tears formulation specifically developed for contact lens (<b>CL)</b> <b>users.</b> METHODS: Twenty OD from young healthy CL wearers (mean age, 24. 7 ± 3. 5 years) with refractive errors ranging from - 0. 75 to - 2. 50 D (mean, - 1. 56 ± 0. 69 D) were examined. All subjects were fitted with Focus Dailies CL (Ciba Vision), and two drops of Blink Contacts (AMO), lubricating formulation specifically developed for CL wearers, were instilled after baseline measures. Tear meniscus volume (TMV) was measured immediately after and 1 min, 10, 30, and 60 min after instillation using the Copernicus HR SOCT (Optopol Tech., SA, Poland). TMV was calculated from the local area from tomograms assuming a regular distribution of the tear meniscus across the eyelid. Three scans were taken {{at each of the}} time points. RESULTS: Mean meniscus volume without CL was 1. 35 ± 1. 18 μL, volume with CL was higher, 1. 71 ± 1. 56 μL but not significantly different (mean difference, 0. 36 ± 1. 31 μL). After instillation of Blink Contacts eye drops, meniscus volume increased to an average of 4. 10 ± 2. 91 μL. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that values after 10 min were significantly higher than before instillation of eye drops (p < 0. 01; mean difference, 0. 77 ± 0. 65 μL). After 30 and 60 minutes, values of TMV decreased to almost baseline (average mean difference from baseline 0. 19 ± 0. 18 μL at t 30, p < 0. 001, and 0. 06 ± 0. 08 μL at t 60, p = 0. 004). CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution imaging of the lower tear film meniscus with SOCT systems provides useful measures of tear volume. An artificial tear formulation provides a change in tear volume that is maintained beyond 10 min, although further study, using control groups, would be desirable to determine the consistency of those higher-than-baseline values observed over time. 1. 895 JCR (2012) Q 2, 21 / 59 Ophthalmolog...|$|R
