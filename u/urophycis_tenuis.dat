Sci., 41 : 183 – 196. doi: 10. 2960 /J. v 41. m 627 White hake (<b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis)</b> is a temperate demersal fish species distributed in the northwest Atlantic. On the Grand Bank, it is concentrated mainly to the southwest where water temperatures are warmest. Survey data indicate that mature adult females aggregate on the southwest (SW) Grand Bank slope in spring and first-year juveniles settle on the southern, shallow Grand Bank in autumn. Dispersion patterns and survival potential of eggs, larvae and juveniles were investigated with re-spect {{to the effects of}} location (horizontal and vertical) and timing (monthly) of spawning under monthly-mean circulation fields, M 2 tidal currents and associated turbulent mixing computed from a three-dimensional regional ocean circulation model. The results indicate that releases below the surface Ekman layer and in late spring have the highest chances for juveniles to settle in the southern Grand Bank nursery area in autumn. On an interannual scale, the strong recruitment of the 1999 year-class has been used as an example to examine the potential linkage between recruitment and the strength of the Labrador Current. A weak along-slope current and strong on-bank flow contributed to the strong recruitment of the 1999 year-class...|$|E

40|$|White hake (<b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis,</b> Mitchill 1815) is a bottom-dwelling fish {{distributed}} only in {{the northwest}} Atlantic from Cape Hatteras to southern Labrador; with dense concentrations in the Gulf of Maine, on the Scotian Shelf, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the southern Grand Banks. Over their entire range, white hakes are found at bottom depths from 4 oC). They occupy {{a wide range of}} bottom depths along the slope out to 800 m; at depths considerably greater than what is observed in other parts of their range. White hake may be classified as “ temperature keepers”: maintaining a constant temperature range by changing their depth distribution. The largest year-class since 1977 was observed in 1999; first detected by an IYGPT survey and also observed in a Spanish research survey. An estimated growth rate of about 2. 5 cm per month corresponds to the dominant 25 -cm mode of white hakes seen in the following year’s Canadian spring research survey. There appears to be some geographic separation of white hake life stages in NAFO Div. 3 NO and Subdiv. 3 Ps.

40|$|Juvenile {{white hake}} (<b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis)</b> {{abundance}} {{has been increasing}} on the northeast coast of Newfoundland {{over the past two}} decades. In these coastal areas juvenile white hake and Greenland cod (Gadus ogac) overlap spatially and temporally in eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat, an important nursery for young of the year gadids. Concern has arisen that the recent increase in white hake abundance may be negatively impacting other gadids, such as Greenland cod. The purpose of my study was, therefore, to investigate the habitat use and behavioural interactions of juvenile white hake and Greenland cod and how this may vary in response to predator threat (an age 3 + Atlantic cod; G. morhua) and interspecific competition. A series of laboratory experiments were undertaken to determine habitat use under these different scenarios by dividing the bottom of two replicate arenas (2 x 2 x 0. 5 m) into thirds and covering these with artificial eelgrass, cobble, or sand. My study documented overlapping habitat use by juvenile white hake and Greenland cod and supported the contention that eelgrass serves as an important refuge habitat for both species, with Greenland cod showing the highest affinity. Furthermore, interspecific competition experiments showed evidence of white hake excluding Greenland cod from preferred habitat as a result of competition for refuges. The size advantage that white hake gain over Greenland cod early during demersal life may be the main mechanism that influences the outcome of this habitat competition...|$|E

40|$|With {{the decline}} in “ {{traditional}} ” groundfish resources in the waters around Newfoundland, interest in the exploitation of alternate species including white hake (<b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis)</b> has increased. Presently there is a limited directed fishery for white hake on the southern Grand Banks. It is more commonly taken in mixed fisheries with cod, monkfish and skate. There is no quota for the hake fishery in NAFO Divisions 3 LNO and Subdivision 3 Ps and effort is regulated only by closures due to excessive by-catch of other species. This paper provides: a review of fishery catch, effort, and catch composition; an analysis of abundance, biomass and size composition from research vessel surveys; and an examination of spatial distribution, for white hake in NAFO Div. 3 LNO and Subdiv. 3 Ps, 1985 - 1998. By 1995, abundance had declined to lowest historic levels.

40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{sampling}} the diets of Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica chicks were compared and evaluated. Prey-carrying puffins were captured in mist-nets, or observed with a telescope or with unaided eyes. Prey samples collected in mist-nets yielded higher proportions of gravid capelin Mallotus villosus than did samples obtained visually. Telescopic samples produced higher {{estimates of the}} numbers of larval fish landed by puffins (larval fishes are often lost when food-laden birds are caught in mist-nets), and yielded underestimates of the lengths of male capelin. Slight correction factors made the 3 prey sampling methods comparable. Visual sampling procedures had the advantages of creating less disturbance and allowing puffins to deliver food to chicks. Use of telescopic sampling is, however, dependent on colony topography. Forage fishes, heavily dominated by 2 -yr-old capelin, made up 88 % and 98 % of the frequency and mass, respectively, of the prey delivered to puffin chicks. Small prey (larval capelin and sandlance Ammodytes spp., hake <b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis,</b> crustaceans) were most commonly fed to young chicks. Gravid and male capelin {{tended to be more}} commonly ted to chicks midway through the nestling period, a time of rapid growth. Spent female and immature capelin were fed more commonly to older chicks. The lengths of gravid capelin tended to increase through the nestling period. Gravid and spent female and male capelin and sandlance fed to puffin chicks were shorter in 1992 than in 1993 or 1994. Successful puffin chicks on Great Island, Newfoundland, Canada, were fed an average of 1105 (SD = 435) prey items weighing 2812 g (SD = 579) equivalent to 12506 kJ (SD = 2391). Extrapolation of these findings suggests that the population of Atlantic puffins in Newfoundland consumes about 8000 + t of forage fishes, mostly 2 -yr-old female capelin during a breeding season.

40|$|The {{influence}} of habitat configuration on faunal distribution and success is largely unknown, despite {{a large body}} of literature concerning implications of habitat fragmentation. In Newfoundland coastal waters, a number of juvenile fish species, including Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), are associated with eelgrass (Zostera marina), a habitat that naturally occurs in a variety of configurations and that is susceptible to anthropogenic fragmentation. Studies have shown that the strength of this association is variable at different eelgrass sites and across scales. Given this inconsistent association and the complex spatial configurations of eelgrass, I investigated the relationships between a number of spatial characteristics of eelgrass and density of three juvenile (age- 0) fish species, Atlantic cod, Greenland cod (G. ogac), and white hake (<b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis).</b> I used data from aerial photographs to determine perimeter and area measurements at multiple scales, fractal dimensions of perimeter (DP) and area (DA), and a measure that combines perimeter and area complexity at these scales βP/A. Age- 0 fish densities were estimated at each eelgrass site using a seine net. I found parabolic relationships between βP/A and density for all three species, indicating highest fish densities at sites of intermediate patchiness and edge regularity. Furthermore, I determined that βP/A provided a less ambiguous estimate of spatial configuration than other measures. This intermediate maximum may reflect a trade-off, whereby eelgrass sites of intermediate spatial complexity provide juvenile fish with both optimal protective cover and opportunity to feed. I assessed this hypothesis by measuring foraging success in age- 0 Greenland cod at sites of varying eelgrass fragmentation, as measured by βP/A I found that foraging success depends on cod density. I then combined this relationship and the parabolic relationship between density and fragmentation to develop a model that predicts the observed relationship between foraging success and eelgrass site configuration. My thesis demonstrates that eelgrass habitat configuration influences the density and success of resident fish fauna. Furthermore, this research demonstrates that predictive models are possible in ecology...|$|E

The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92. 6 % of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 300 m. Five assemblages were identified. Two shallow assemblages {{were found in the}} shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 150 and include yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), moustache sculpin (Triglops murrayi), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and web sculpin (Hemitripterus americanus). Assemblage II (Shallow) includes the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m and comprises Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American angler (Lophius americanus), wolfish (Anarichas lupus) and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). Assemblage III (Intermediate) contains the depth strata between 301 and 600 m. Redfish (Sebastes spp.), spotted wolfish (Anarhichas minor), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), Northern wolfish (Anarhichas denticulatus), white hake (<b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis),</b> witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and longfin hake (Phycis chesteri) were included in the intermediate assemblage. Finally, we found two deep clusters: Assemblage IV (Deep) contains the depths between 601 and 1000 m, and Assemblage V (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) formed Assemblage IV. Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemnitzii), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborean) and longnose chimera (Harriotta raleighana) made up the deepest assemblage. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Yellowtail flounder appears to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod and American plaice that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the fishing effort in the deep waters of the Grand Banks, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas...|$|E
30|$|Fish {{are known}} to have high protein content and the most {{abundant}} amino acids are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and lysine in aquatic organisms (Ozden and Erkan, 2008). In the previous studies, Kim and Lall (2000) investigated the amino acid contents of three kinds of marine flounder fish (Hippoglossus hippoglossus, Pleuronectes ferruginea, and Paralichthys olivaceus) in their study and found that the most abundant amino acids are aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, and lysine. Zuraini et al. (2006) studied the amino acid contents of Channa striats, Channa micropeltes, and Channa lucius. They determined that the most abundant amino acids are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and lysine, and they indicated that these species are rich about essential amino acids for human health and evolution. Ozden and Erkan (2008) examined the amino acid contents of three cultured species (Dicentrarchus labrax, Sparus aurata, and Dentex dentex) and determined that aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and lysine were the most abundant amino acids. They reported that aspartic acid and glutamic acid are important in enzyme solubility and protecting ionic character in enzyme activity. Adeyeye (2009), in his study, examined the amino acid contents of Clarias anguillaris, Oreochromis niloticus, and Cynoglossus senegalensis species, and he identified that glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and leucine were most common amino acids. He reported that these species are valuable amino acid sources. Erkan et al. (2010 a) examined the amino acid content of Trachurus trachurus and found that the most abundant amino acids were aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and lysine. Erkan et al. (2010 b) studied about the amino acid contents of Engraulis encrasicolus, Pomatomus saltatrix, Sarda sarda, M. surmelutus, and Merlangius merlangus and they found that lysine, leucine, arginine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid were the most abundant amino acids. Oluwaniyi et al. (2010) studied about the amino acid contents of Clupea harengus, Scomber scombrus, Trachurus trachurus, and <b>Urophycis</b> <b>tenuis</b> species. They reported that the most abundant amino acids are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, lysine, and leucine. Zhao et al. (2010) studied about the amino acid content of Pampus punctatissimus, an important fishery source in China, and found that glutamic acid, lysine, leucine, and aspartic acid were the most abundant amino acids. Ozden and Erkan (2011) studied the amino acid contents of some fishery products and found that the amino acid values changes according to species. Peng et al. (2013), identified that the most abundant amino acids of in tuna fish (Thunnus albacares and Thunnus obesus) were aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and lysine. They stated that the named fish are a good source of nutrients in terms of glutamic acid that required for cell proliferation. Kaya et al. (2014) investigated the amino acid content of, Salmo trutta forma fario that hunting and growing on the farms, and they found that glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and lysine values were higher than other amino acids. They found that the differences in total amino acid values were generally significant (P <  0.05) by species and by age, and they stated that the distinction in amino acid values was due to the spawning season, the feeding conditions, and the living area. Baki et al. (2015), compared the amino acid contents of natural and cultured sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in their study, and they found that the most abundant amino acids were aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine, and lysine. Suseno (2015) reported that the most abundant amino acids were glutamic acid, arginine, leucine, and lysine in tuna fish (Thunnus sp.). Salma et al. (2016) found that the most abundant amino acids found in mackerel (Scomber scombrus) were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and lysine.|$|E
