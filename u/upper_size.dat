5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum <b>upper</b> <b>size</b> limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– the genome is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes {{because of the high}} fidelity of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a mathematical model}} to quantify the loss of resilience in collapsing honey bee colonies due {{to the presence of}} a strong Allee effect. In the model, recruitment and mortality of adult bees have substantial social components, with recruitment enhanced and mortality reduced by additional adult bee numbers. The result is an Allee effect, a net per-individual rate of hive increase that increases as a function of adult bee numbers. The Allee effect creates a critical minimum size in adult bee numbers, below which mortality is greater than recruitment, with ensuing loss of viability of the hive. Under ordinary and favorable environmental circumstances, the critical size is low, and hives remain large, sending off viably-sized swarms (naturally or through beekeeping management) when hive numbers approach an <b>upper</b> stable equilibrium <b>size</b> (carrying capacity). However, both the lower critical <b>size</b> and the <b>upper</b> stable <b>size</b> depend on many parameters related to demographic rates and their enhancement by bee sociality. Any environmental factors that increase mortality, decrease recruitment, or interfere with the social moderation of these rates has the effect of exacerbating the Allee effect by increasing the lower critical size and substantially decreasing the <b>upper</b> stable <b>size.</b> As well, the basin of attraction to the <b>upper</b> stable <b>size,</b> defined by the model potential function, becomes narrower and shallower, indicating the loss of resilience as the hive becomes subjected to increased risk of falling below the critical size. Environmental effects of greater severity can cause the two equilibria to merge and the basin of attraction to the <b>upper</b> stable <b>size</b> to disappear, resulting in collapse of the hive from any initial size. The model suggests that multiple proximate causes, among them pesticides, mites, pathogens, and climate change, working singly or in combinations, could trigger hive collapse...|$|R

40|$|<b>Upper</b> premolar <b>size</b> and cusp heteromorphy {{have been}} used in several studies that argue for {{alternative}} phyletic placements of early and middle Miocene fossil hominoids relative to extant primate clades. The underlying interpretation is that upper premolar enlargement relative to the first and/or second molar and a reduction in upper premolar cusp heteromorphy are characteristic of extant apes. The aim of the present study is to test the strength of the phylogenetic signal contained within these characters to determine whether they diagnose the groups of living primate taxa for which they are proposed. The hypotheses are evaluated by means of character state analysis performed on seven metric characters derived from associated upper premolar and molar data collected from seventeen extant and fifteen extinct catarrhine species. The computer programme MacCIade is used to reconstruct hypothetical ancestral nodes using the phylogenetic method of character optimization. The results indicate that there is only a very weak phylogenetic signal contained within <b>upper</b> premolar <b>size</b> and cusp heteromorphy. Both characters fail to unambiguously diagnose groups of living apes as clades. Further analyses suggest that relative upper premolar enlargement is an adaptation to hard object feeding, but the functional significance of upper premolar cusp heteromorphy remains unclear. These findings imply that phylogenetic analyses that incorporate one or both dental traits to develop a phylogenetic framework within which to place fossil taxa relative to extant anthropoids are fundamentally flawed, because neither <b>upper</b> premolar <b>size</b> nor cusp heteromorphy provide convincing evidence of common ancestry relationships...|$|R
