60|$|Leaning {{upon the}} arm of the gallant Pompey, and {{attended}} at a respectable distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of the populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted Edina. On a sudden, there presented itself to view a church--a Gothic cathedral--vast, venerable, and with a tall steeple, which towered into the sky. What madness now possessed me? Why did I rush upon my fate? I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the giddy pinnacle, and then survey the immense extent of the city. The door of the cathedral stood invitingly open. My destiny prevailed. I entered the ominous archway. Where then was my guardian angel?--if indeed such angels there be. If! Distressing monosyllable! what world of mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters! I entered the ominous archway! I entered; and, without injury to my orange-colored auriculas, I passed beneath the portal, and emerged within the vestibule. Thus it is said the immense river Alfred passed, unscathed, and <b>unwetted,</b> beneath the sea.|$|E

[FN#1] The {{second is}} an {{imitative}} word, called in Arabic grammar Tabi'a, as [...] "Zayd Bayd," [...] "Zayd and others;" [...] so used, it denotes contempt for drachms and similar parts of drug-craft. [FN#2] This familiar abbreviation of Wali al-Din {{was the name}} assumed by the enterprising traveller, Dr. Wallin. [FN#3] By the Indians called Bhang, the Persians Bang, the Hottentots Dakha, and the natives of Barbary Fasukh. Even the Siberians, we are told, intoxicate themselves by the vapour of this seed thrown upon red-hot stones. Egypt surpasses all other nations in the variety of compounds into which this fascinating drug enters, and will one day probably supply the Western world with [...] "Indian hemp," [...] when its solid merits are duly appreciated. At present in Europe it is chiefly confined, as cognac and opium used to be, to the apothecary's shelves. Some adventurous individuals at Paris, after the perusal of Monte Christo, attempted an [...] "orgie" [...] {{in one of the}} cafes, but with poor success. [FN#4] The Indian name of an Afghan, supposed to be a corruption of the Arabic Fat'han (a conqueror), or a derivation from the Hindustani paithna, to penetrate (into the hostile ranks). It is an honourable term in Arabia, where [...] "Khurasani" [...] (a native of Khorasan), leads men to suspect a Persian, and the other generic appellation of the Afghan tribes [...] "Sulaymani," [...] a descendant from Solomon, reminds the people of their proverb, [...] "Sulaymani harami!"-"the Afghans are ruffians!" [...] [FN#5] For the simple reason that no Eastern power confers such an obligation except for value received. In old times, when official honour was not so rigorous as it is now, the creditors of Eastern powers and principalities would present high sums to British Residents and others for the privilege of being enrolled in the list of their subjects or servants. This they made profitable; for their claims, however exorbitant, when backed by a name of fear, were certain to be admitted, unless the Resident's conscience would allow of his being persuaded by weightier arguments of a similar nature to abandon his protege. It is almost needless to remark that nothing of the kind can occur in the present day, {{and at the same time}} that throughout the Eastern world it is firmly believed that such things are of daily occurrence. Ill fame descends to distant generations; whilst good deeds, if they blossom, as we are told, in the dust, are at least as short-lived as they are sweet. [FN#6] A doctor, a learned man; not to be confounded with Hakim, a ruler. [FN#7] It may be as well to remark that our slave laws require reform throughout the East, their severity, like Draco's Code, defeating their purpose. In Egypt, for instance, they require modification. Constitute the offence a misdemeanour, not a felony, inflict a fine (say L100), half of which should be given to the informer, and make the imprisonment either a short one, or, what would be better still, let it be done away with, except in cases of non-payment; and finally, let the Consul or some other magistrate residing at the place have power to inflict the penalty of the law, instead of being obliged, as at present, to transmit offenders to Malta for trial. As the law now stands, our officials are unwilling to carry its rigours into effect; they therefore easily lend an ear to the standard excuse-ignorance-in order to have an opportunity of decently dismissing a man, with a warning not to do it again. [FN#8] Yet at the time there was at Alexandria an acting Consul-General, to whom the case could with strict propriety have been referred. [FN#9] Johann Gottlieb Fichte expressly declares that the scope of his system has never been explained by words, and that it even admits not of being so explained. To make his opinions intelligible, he would express them by a system of figures, each of which must have a known and positive value. [FN#10] M. C. de Perceval (Arabic Grammar), and Lane (Mod. Egyptians, Chapter 8 et passim), give specimens. [FN#11] A monogram generally placed at the head of writings. It is the initial letter of [...] "Allah," [...] and the first of the alphabet, used from time immemorial to denote the origin of creation. [...] "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last." [...] [FN#12] [...] "Ala-rik," [...] that is to say, fasting-the first thing in the morning. [FN#13] The Almighty. [FN#14] W'as-salam, i.e. adieu. [FN#15] From M. Huc we learn that Jin-seng is the most considerable article of Manchurian commerce, and that throughout China there is no chemist's shop unprovided with more or less of it. He adds: [...] "The Chinese report marvels of the Jin-seng, and no doubt it is for Chinese organisation a tonic of very great effect for old and weak persons; but its nature is too heating, the Chinese physicians admit, for the European temperament, already in their opinion too hot. The price is enormous, and doubtless its dearness contributes with a people like the Chinese to raise its celebrity so high. The rich and the Mandarins probably use it only because it is above the reach of other people, and out of pure ostentation." [...] It is the principal tonic used throughout Central Asia, and was well known in Europe when Sarsaparilla arose to dispute with it the palm of popularity. In India, Persia, and Afghanistan, it is called chob-chini,-the [...] "Chinese wood." [...] The preparations are in two forms, 1. Sufuf, or powder; 2. Kahwah, or decoction. The former is compound of Radix China Qrient, with gum mastich and sugar-candy, equal parts; about a dram of this compound is taken once a day, early in the morning. For the decoction one ounce of fine parings is boiled for a quarter of an hour in a quart of water. When the liquid assumes a red colour it is taken off the fire and left to cool. Furthermore, there are two methods of adhibiting the choh-chini: 1. Band; 2. Khola. The first is when the patient confines himself to a garden, listening to music, enjoying the breeze, the song of birds, and the bubbling of a flowing stream. He avoids everything likely to trouble and annoy him; he will not even open a letter, and the doctor forbids anyone to contradict him. Some grandees in central Asia will go through a course of forty days in every second year; it reminds one of Epicurus' style of treatment,-the downy bed, the garlands of flowers, the good wine, and the beautiful singing girl, and is doubtless at least as efficacious in curing as the sweet relaxation of Gräfenberg or Malvern. So says Socrates, according to the Anatomist of Melancholy, [...] "Oculum non curabis sine toto capite, Nec caput sine toto corpore, Nec totum corpus sine animo." [...] The [...] "Khola" [...] signifies that you take the tonic without other precautions than the avoiding acids, salt, and pepper, and choosing summer time, as cold is supposed to induce rheumatism. [FN#16] Certain Lamas who, we learn from M. Huc, perform famous Sie-fa, or supernaturalisms, such as cutting open the abdomen, licking red-hot irons, making incisions in various parts of the body, which an instant afterwards leave no trace behind, &c., &c. The devil may [...] "have a great deal to do with the matter" [...] in Tartary, for all I know; but I can assure M. Huc, that the Rufa'i Darwayshes in India and the Sa'adiyah at Cairo perform exactly the same feats. Their jugglery, seen through the smoke of incense, and amidst the enthusiasm of a crowd, is tolerably dexterous, and no more. [FN#17] A holy man. The word has a singular signification in a plural form, [...] "honoris causa." [...] [FN#18] A title literally meaning the [...] "Master of Breath," [...] one who can cure ailments, physical as well as spiritual, by breathing upon them-a practice well known to mesmerists. The reader will allow me to observe, (in self-defence, otherwise he might look suspiciously upon so credulous a narrator), that when speaking of animal magnetism, as a thing established, I allude to the lower phenomena, rejecting the discussion of all disputed points, as the existence of a magnetic Aura, and of all its unintelligibilities-Prevision, Levitation, Introvision, and other divisions of Clairvoyance. [FN#19] In the generality, not in all. Nothing, for instance, can be more disgraceful to human nature than the state of praedial slavery, or serfs attached to the glebe, when Malabar was under the dominion of the [...] "mild Hindu." [...] And as a rule in the East it is only the domestic slaves who taste the sweets of slavery. Yet there is truth in Sonnini's terrible remark: [...] "The severe treatment under which the slaves languish in the West Indies is the shameful prerogative of civilisation, and is unknown to those nations among whom barbarism is reported to hold sway." [...] (Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt, vol. ii.) [FN#20] The author has forgotten to mention one of the principal advantages of slaves, namely, the prospect of arriving at the highest rank of the empire. The Pasha of the Syrian caravan with which I travelled to Damascus, had been the slave of a slave, and he is but a solitary instance of cases perpetually occuring in all Moslem lands. [...] "C'est un homme de bonne famille," [...] said a Turkish officer in Egypt, [...] "il a ete achete." [...] [FN#21] A [...] "Barbarian" [...] from Nubia and Upper Egypt. Some authorities, Mr. Lane for instance, attribute the good reputation of these people to their superior cunning. Sonnini says, [...] "they are intelligent and handy servants, but knaves." [...] Others believe in them. As far as I could find out, they were generally esteemed more honest than the Egyptians, and they certainly possess a certain sense of honour unknown to their northern brethren. [...] "Berberi" [...] is a term of respect; [...] "Masri" [...] (corrupted from Misri) in the mouth of a Badawi or an Arab of Arabia is a reproach. [...] "He shall be called an Egyptian," [...] means [...] "he shall belong to a degraded race." [...] [FN#22] Who becomes responsible, and must pay for any theft his protege may commit. Berberis, being generally [...] "les Suisses" [...] of respectable establishments, are expected to be honest. But I can assert from experience that, as a native, you will never recover the value of a stolen article without having recourse to the police. For his valuable security, the Shaykh demands a small fee (7 or 8 piastres), which, despite the urgent remonstrances of protector and protege, you deduct from the latter's wages. The question of pay is a momentous one; too much always spoils a good servant, too little leaves you without one. An Egyptian of the middle class would pay his Berberi about 40 piastres a month, besides board, lodging, some small perquisites, and presents on certain occasions. This, however, will not induce a man to travel, especially to cross the sea. [FN#23] A man from the Sa'id or Upper Egypt. [FN#24] A favourite way of annoying the Berberis is to repeat the saying, [...] "we have eaten the clean, we have eaten the unclean,"-meaning, that they are by no means cunning in the difference between right and wrong, pure and impure. I will relate the origin of the saying, as I heard it differently, from Mansfield Parkyns, (Life in Abyssinia, chap. 31.) A Berberi, said my informant, had been carefully fattening a fine sheep for a feast, when his cottage was burned by an accident. In the ashes he found roasted meat, which looked tempting to a hungry man: he called his neighbours, and all sat down to make merry over the mishap; presently they came to the head, which proved to be that of a dog, some enemy having doubtless stolen the sheep and put the impure animal in its place. Whereupon, sadly perplexed, all the Berberis went to their priest, and dolefully related the circumstance, expecting absolution, as the offence was involuntary. [...] "You have eaten filth," [...] said the man of Allah. [...] "Well," [...] replied the Berberis, falling upon him with their fists, [...] "filth or not, we have eaten it." [...] The Berberi, I must remark, is the [...] "Paddy" [...] of this part of the world, celebrated for bulls and blunders. [FN#25] The generic name given by Indians to English officials. [FN#26] There are four kinds of tobacco smoked in Egypt. The first and best is the well-known Latakia, generally called [...] "Jabali," [...] either from a small seaport town about three hours' journey south of Latakia, or more probably because grown on the hills near the ancient Laodicea. Pure, it is known by its blackish colour, fine shredding, absence of stalk, and an undescribable odour, to me resembling that of creosote; the leaf, too, is small, so that when made into cigars it must be covered over with a slip of the yellow Turkish tobacco called Bafra. Except at the highest houses unadulterated Latakia is not to be had in Cairo. Yet, mixed as it is, no other growth exceeds it in flavour and fragrance. Miss Martineau smoked it, we are told, without inconvenience, and it differs from our Shag, Bird's-eye, and Returns, in degree, as does Chateau Margeau from a bottle of cheap strong Spanish wine. To bring out its flavour, the connoisseur smokes it in long pipes of cherry, jasmine, maple, or rosewood, and these require a servant skilled in the arts of cleaning and filling them. The best Jabali at Cairo costs about seven piastres the pound; after which a small sum must be paid to the Farram or chopper, who prepares it for use. 2nd. Suri (Tyrian), or Shami, or Suryani, grown in Syria, an inferior growth, of a lighter colour than Latakia, and with a greenish tinge; when cut, its value is about three piastres per pound. Some smokers mix this leaf with Jabali, which, to my taste, spoils the flavour of the latter without improving the former. The strongest kind, called Korani or Jabayl, is generally used for cigarettes; it costs, when of first-rate quality, about five piastres per pound. 3rd. Tumbak, or Persian tobacco, called Hijazi, because imported from the Hijaz, where everybody smokes it, and supposed to come from Shiraz, Kazerun, and other celebrated places in Persia. It is all but impossible to buy this article unadulterated, except from the caravans returning after the pilgrimage. The Egyptians mix it with native growths, which ruins its flavour and gives it an acridity that [...] "catches the throat," [...] whereas good tumbak never yet made a man cough. Yet the taste of this tobacco, even when second-rate, is so fascinating to some smokers that they will use no other. To be used it should be wetted and squeezed, and it is invariably inhaled through water into the lungs: almost every town has its favourite description of pipe, and these are of all kinds, from the pauper's rough cocoa-nut mounted with two reeds, to the prince's golden bowl set with the finest stones. Tumbak is cheap, costing about four piastres a pound, but large quantities of it are used. 4th. Hummi, as the word signifies, a [...] "hot" [...] variety of the tumbak, grown in Al-Yaman and other countries. It is placed in the tile on the buri or cocoa-nut pipe, <b>unwetted,</b> and has a very acrid flavour. Being supposed to produce intoxication, or rather a swimming in the head, hummi gives its votaries a bad name: respectable men would answer [...] "no" [...] with rage if asked whether they are smoking it, and when a fellow tells you that he has seen better days, but that now he smokes Hummi in a buri, you understand him that his misfortunes have affected either his brain or his morality. Hence it is that this tobacco is never put into pipes intended for smoking the other kinds. The price of Hummi is about five piastres per pound. [FN#26] A study essential to the learned, as in some particular portions of the Koran a mispronunciation becomes a sin. [FN#27] The Shafe'i, to quote but one point of similarity, abuse Yazid, the Syrian tyrant, who caused the death of the Imam Husayn: this expression of indignation is forbidden by the Hanafi doctors, who rigidly order their disciples to [...] "judge not." [...] [FN#28] A systematic concealment of doctrine, and profession of popular tenets, technically called by the Shi'ahs [...] "Takiyah:" [...] the literal meaning of the word is [...] "fear," [...] or [...] "caution." [...] [FN#29] One of the most esteemed chapters of the Koran, frequently recited as a Wazifah or daily task by religious Moslems in Egypt. [FN#30] The Mastabah here is a long earthen bench plastered over with clay, and raised about two feet from the ground, so as to bring the purchaser's head to a level with the shop. Mohammed Ali ordered the people to remove them, as they narrowed the streets; their place is now supplied by [...] "Kafas," [...] cages or stools of wicker-work. [FN#31] A great age in Lower Egypt, where but few reach the 12th lustre. Even the ancients observed that the old Egyptians, despite their attention to diet and physic, were the most short-lived, and the Britons, despite their barbarism, the longest lived of men. [FN#32] This is the [...] "imposition" [...] of Oxford and Cambridge. [FN#33] The Hammam, or hot bath, being a kind of religious establishment, is one of the class of things-so uncomfortably numerous in Eastern countries-left 'ala jud'ak, [...] "to thy generosity." [...] Consequently, you are pretty sure to have something disagreeable there, which you would vainly attempt to avoid by liberality. The best way to deal with all such extortioners, with the Lawingi (undresser) of a Cairo Hammam, or the [...] "jarvey" [...] of a London Hansom, is to find out the fare, and never to go beyond it-never to be generous. The Hammam has been too often noticed to bear another description: one point, however, connected with it I must be allowed to notice. Mr. Lane (Modern Egyptians) asserts that a Moslem should not pray nor recite the Koran in it, as the bath is believed to be a favourite resort of Jinnis (or genii). On the contrary, it is the custom of some sects to recite a Ruk'atayn (two-bow) prayer immediately after religious ablution in the hot cistern. This, however, is makruh, or improper without being sinful, to the followers of Abu Hanifah. As a general rule, throughout Al-Islam, the Farz (obligatory) prayers may be recited everywhere, no matter how impure the place may be: but those belonging to the classes sunnat (traditionary) and nafilah (supererogatory) are makruh, though not actually unlawful, in certain localities. I venture this remark on account of the extreme accuracy of the work referred to. A wonderful contrast to the generality of Oriental books, it amply deserves a revision in the rare places requiring care. [FN#34] Europeans so seldom see the regular old Shaykh, whose place is now taken by polite young men educated in England or France, that this scene may be new even to those who have studied of late years on the banks of the Nile. [FN#35] This word is often used to signify simply [...] "yes." [...] It is corrupted from Ay wa'llahi, [...] "Yes, by Allah." [...] In pure Arabic [...] "ay" [...] or [...] "I" [...] is synonymous with our [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "ay"; and [...] "Allah" [...] in those countries enters somehow into every other phrase. [FN#36] This is, of course, ironical: [...] "Allah be praised for creating such a prodigy of learning as thou art!" [...] [FN#37] The larger the turband the greater are the individual's pretensions to religious knowledge and respectability of demeanour. This is the custom in Egypt, Turkey, Persia, and many other parts of the Moslem world. [FN#38] Ya gad'a, as the Egyptians pronounce it, is used exactly like the [...] "mon brave" [...] of France, and our [...] "my good man." [...] [FN#39] The [...] "mountain" [...] in Egypt and Arabia is what the [...] "jungle" [...] is in India. When informed that [...] "you come from the mountain," [...] you understand that you are considered a mere clodhopper: when asserting that you will [...] "sit upon the mountain," [...] you hint to your hearers an intention of turning anchorite or magician. [FN#40] Ya hu, a common interpellative, not, perhaps, of the politest description. [FN#41] A religious formula used when compelled to mention anything abominable or polluting to the lips of a pious man.|$|E

40|$|Tillage plays a {{major role}} in food production. In {{developed}} countries, farmers practice excessive tillage. Soil scientists are recommending reduced tillage practices known as conservation tillage. In developing countries such as India, farmers practice indigenous tillage which has characteristics of conservation tillage. A review of the theoretical developments in tillage mechanics showed that there exists inadequate knowledge to predict the soil failure mechanisms, to predict the tool forces, or to determine the soil modifications caused by tillage. It is shown that there is a need to develop new theoretical concepts relevant to soil failure observed in agricultural soils, and that observations in soil failure can form the bases for a better understanding of how tillage modifies soil tilth;Agricultural soils are subject to seasonal wetting and drying that create drying stress in soil. Experiments were done in a clay loam soil to investigate the effect of drying stress on soil physical properties and on soil mechanical behavior as influenced by a model tine. A dry soil was subject to three higher moisture treatments and then each of them was dried to the initial moisture content. Results showed that the dried soil physical properties significantly differed from those of the <b>unwetted</b> soil. Soil strength and aggregate size increased with drying stress. Soil aggregate size and tine forces were greater in dried soils as compared to the <b>unwetted</b> soil;Experiments in wet and dry soils showed that the tine performance and soil properties resulting from tillage depended not only on moisture content but also whether a given moisture content was obtained by wetting a drier soil or by drying a wetter soil. Results showed that, at a given moisture content, the wetted soils failed by Fracture mode and offered relatively more draft than the dried soil which failed by 2 ̆ 2 Preferential Fracture 2 ̆ 2 mode.

40|$|Abstract. – We {{present an}} {{evaporation}} experiment {{in a single}} fluid layer reproducing conditions of volatile fluids in nature. When latent heat associated to the evaporation is large enough, the heat flow through the free surface of the layer generates temperature gradients that can destabilize the conductive motionless state giving rise to convective cellular structures without any external heating. Convective cells can be then observed in the transient range of evaporation from an initial depth value to a minimum threshold depth, after which a conductive motionless state appears until the evaporation finishes with an <b>unwetting</b> sequence. The sequence of convective patterns obtained here without heating {{is similar to that}} obtained in B´enard-Marangoni convection. This work presents the sequence of spatial bifurcations {{as a function of the}} layer depth. The transition between square-to-hexagonal pattern, known from non-evaporative experiments, is obtained here with a similar change in wavelength...|$|R
40|$|A {{lattice model}} for active matter is studied numerically, showing that it {{displays}} wettings transitions between three distinctive phases when {{in contact with}} an impenetrable wall. The particles in the model move persistently, tumbling with a small rate α, and interact via exclusion volume only. When increasing the tumbling rates α, the system transits from total wetting to partial wetting and <b>unwetting</b> phases. In the first phase, a wetting film covers the wall, with increasing heights when α is reduced. The second phase is characterized by wetting droplets on the wall with a periodic spacing between them. Finally, the wall dries with few particles in contact with it. These phases present nonequilibrium transitions. The first transition, from partial to total wetting, is continuous and the fraction of dry sites vanishes continuously when decreasing the tumbling rate α. For the second transition, from partial wetting to dry, the mean droplet distance diverges logarithmically when approaching the critical tumbling rate, with saturation due to finite-size effects...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ultrastructure}} {{of the egg}} chorion of the dragonfly, Pantala flavescens (Fabricius) {{is described}} using the light and scanning electron microscope. The egg of Pantala flavescens is oval and the chorion is distinctly divided into an outer exochorion and an inner endochorion. The egg measures about 720 ± 20 × 530 ± 10 µm in <b>unwetted</b> condition. The endochorion is light yellow, but turns brown {{within a few hours}} in water. The exochorion which envelopes the endochorion as a thin covering which expands into a transparent thick, sticky, jelly-like structure when it comes in contact with water and therefore, the egg in wet condition bloats and measures 870 ± 20 × 550 ± 20 µm. The apically placed micropylar apparatus is nipple shaped, formed of a small sperm storage chamber (atrium) and a median projecting micropylar stalk. The stalk is of 'concave cone ' type and possesses a pair of subterminal orifices. A circular groove demarcates the exochorion and the micropylar apparatus...|$|E
40|$|The thermo-fluid-dynamic {{field that}} arises when an {{infinite}} thick plate is impulsively accelerated to a constant speed in a laminar regime is studied, {{taking into account}} the coupling of the convection and conduction in the fluid with the conduction in the solid. Two significant cases are discussed depending on the boundary condition imposed on the <b>unwetted</b> side of the plate: constant temperature or adiabatic wall. The work is particularly focused on analysing the singularities arising in the field at the initial time. For this purpose an exact analytical solution of the problem governed by the Navier– Stokes equations with constant properties and by the energy equations in the fluid and in the solid is proposed and discussed. The non-dimensional parameter governing the conjugated effects is shown to be the ratio between the thermal effusivities in the fluid and in the solid. The results have also been extended to the analysis of compressible flows by the Stewartson–Dorodnitsin transformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of diffuse energy on an <b>unwetted</b> flat plate with attached heterogeneities is examined using a statistical, multiple scattering approach. The statistically homogeneous heterogeneities lightly couple the membrane and flexural waves. The problem is formulated {{in terms of}} the Bethe–Salpeter equation, which governs the field covariance. It is reduced to a radiative transfer equation in the limit that the attenuations per wave number are small, i. e., when the heterogeneities are weak. This radiative transfer equation governs the diffuse energy propagation as a function of space, time, and propagation direction. Solutions of the radiative transfer equation are presented for the simple case of attached heterogeneities in the form of delta-correlated springs excited by an extensional point source. The results show the evolution of the extensional, shear, and flexural energy densities across the plate as a function of time. A similar approach is expected to apply to the more complicated case of submerged complex structures...|$|E

40|$|Recently, we {{have found}} that {{simulated}} rainfall causes a chronic inhibition of leaf photosynthesis in Phaseolus vulgaris (M. Ishibashi and I. Terashima [1995] Plant Cell Environ 18 : 431 - 438). Mechanisms of this inhibition were examined in the present study. After the plants were treated with continuous mist for 24 h and then dried to <b>unwet</b> conditions, light-saturated photosynthetic rates of the leaves measured at 35 Pa ambient CO 2 decreased to one-half of the control level. The extractable activity of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) also decreased to the same extent. Unexpectedly, this decline was due not to the lowered activation state but to the decrease in the amount of Rubisco. Before or after the "rain" treatment, the relationship between the net photosynthetic rate and the amount of Rubisco was expressed as a unique linear function with a small intercept (r 2 = 0. 84). From these it was inferred that the main cause of the rain-induced decline in photo-synthetic rate was the loss in amount of Rubisco...|$|R
40|$|Structurally ordered {{interfaces}} between ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene or graphite are {{of great}} interest for carbon spintronics, since they allow spin-filtering due to k-vector conservation. By solid phase epitaxy of amorphous/nanocrystalline CoFeB at elevated temperatures, the feasibility of fabricating crystalline interfaces between a 3 d ferromagnetic alloy and graphite is demonstrated, without suffering from the <b>unwetting</b> problem that was commonly seen in many previous studies with 3 d transition metals. The films fabricated on graphite in this way are {{found to have a}} strong body-centered-cubic (110) texture, albeit without a unique, well-defined in-plane epitaxial relationship with the substrate lattice. Using various X-ray spectroscopic techniques, it is shown that boron suppresses the formation of CoFe-O during CoFeB deposition, and then diffuses out of the CoFe lattice. Segregation of B occurred exclusively to the film surface upon in situ annealing, and not to the interface between CoFeB and graphite. This is favorable for obtaining a high spin polarization at the hybrid CoFe/graphite crystalline interface. The Co and Fe spin moments in the crystalline film, determined by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, are found to be bulk-like, while their orbital moments show an unusual giant enhancement which has yet to be understood...|$|R
40|$|Operation {{of thermal}} spray zinc (Zn) anodes for {{cathodic}} protection (CP) of reinforced concrete structures {{was investigated in}} laboratory and field studies conducted by the Albany Research Center (ARC) {{in collaboration with the}} Oregon Department of Transportation. The purposes of the research presented in this report were: evaluate the need for preheating concrete to improve the adhesion of the anode; estimate the service life of thermal spray Zn CP anodes; determine the optimum thickness for Zn CP anodes; characterize the anode-concrete interfacial chemistry; and correlate field and laboratory results. Laboratory studies involved accelerated electrochemical aging of thermal sprayed Zn anodes on concrete slabs, some of which were periodically wetted while others were <b>unwetted.</b> Concrete used in the slabs contained either 1. 2 or 3 kg NaCl /m 3 (2 or 5 lbs NaCl /yd 3) as part of the concrete mix design. The Zn anodes were applied to the slabs using the twin wire arc-spray technique. Half of the slabs were preheated to 120 - 160 C (250 - 320 F) to improve the initial Zn anode bond strength and the other half were not. Accelerated aging was done at a current density of 0. 032 A/m 2 (3 mA/ft 2), 15 times that used on Oregon DOT Coastal bridges, i. e,. 0. 0022 A/m 2 (0. 2 mA/ft 2) Cores from the Cape Creek Bridge (OR), the Richmond San Rafael Bridge (CA), and the East Camino Underpass (CA) were used to study the anode-concrete interfacial chemistry, to relate the chemistry to electrochemical age at the time of sampling, and to compare the chemistry of the field anodes to the chemistry of anodes from the laboratory studies. Cores from a CALTRANS study of a silane sealant used prior to the application of the Zn anodes and cores with galvanized rebar from the Longbird Bridge (Bermuda) were also studied. Aged laboratory and field anodes were characterized by measuring {{some or all of the}} following parameters: thickness, bond strength, anode-concrete interfacial chemistry, bulk chemistry, anode resistance, circuit resistance, electrochemical age, and air and water permeability. Models are presented for the operation of periodically-wetted and <b>unwetted</b> thermal spray Zn anodes from the initial energizing of the anode to the end of its service life. The models were developed in terms of bond strength, circuit resistance, anode-concrete interfacial chemistry, electrochemical age, and anode condition. The most significant results of the research are: (1) preheating concrete surfaces prior to coating with Zn is unnecessary; (2) anodes generally fail due to loss of bond strength rather than Zn consumption; (3) <b>Unwetted</b> anodes fail more quickly than periodically-wetted anodes; (4) 0. 47 - 0. 60 mm (12 - 15 mil) anode thickness is adequate for most Oregon DOT coastal impressed current CP (ICCP) installations; (5) based on bond strength, thermal spray Zn ICCP anode service life is approximately 27 years at 0. 0022 A/m 2 (0. 2 mA/ft 2); (6) anode reaction products alter the anode-concrete interface by rejecting Ca from the cement paste, by replacing it with Zn, and by the accumulation of a Zn mineral layer that includes chloride and sulfur compounds; (7) CP system circuit resistance provides an effective means for monitoring the condition of Zn ICCP anodes as they age...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} the energy {{exchange}} between the atmosphere and a vegetated surface has been developed and used to investigate the sources of energy available for evaporation of precipitation intercepted by a forest canopy. Simulations with this model have demonstrated that a forest canopy wetted by rainfall will partition more of the absorbed radiant energy into latent heat exchange than an <b>unwetted</b> canopy in the same environment. This energy diversion creates a decrease in sensible heat transfer from the canopy to the atmosphere and a smaller decrease in a long-wave radiation emitted by the canopy. Although both evapotranspiration and the evaporation of intercepted precipitation are evaporative losses, they have generally been expressed as separate terms in. the hydrologic cycle because they {{were believed to be}} independent of each other. However, this concept of mutual independence has been disputed. Because evaporation is an energy dependent process and the amount of,energy available for evaporation in a par-ticular environment is limited, some investigators suggested that energy used to evaporate intercepted water mus...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperiments were {{performed}} to highlight the influence of surface wettability on nucleate boiling heat transfer. Nanocoating techniques were used to vary the water contact angle from 20 ° to 110 ° by modifying nanoscale surface topography and chemistry. The bubble growth was recorded by a high speed video camera to enable {{a better understanding of}} the surface wettability effects on nucleation mechanism. For hydrophilic (wetted) surfaces, it was found that a greater surface wettability increases the vapour bubble departure radius and reduces the bubble emission frequency. Moreover, lower superheat is required for the initial growth of bubbles on hydrophobic (<b>unwetted)</b> surfaces. However, the bubble in contact with the hydrophobic surface cannot detach from the wall and have a curvature radius increasing with time. At higher heat flux, the bubble spreads over the surface and coalesces with bubbles formed at other sites, causing a large area of the surface to become vapour blanketed. The best heat transfer coefficient is obtained with the surface which had a water contact angle close to either 0 ° or 90 °. A new approach of nucleation mechanism is established to clarify the nexus between the surface wettability and the nucleate boiling heat transfer...|$|E
60|$|Evadne was {{eighteen}} years of age. Although they {{spent much time}} together at Windsor, the extreme youth of Adrian prevented any suspicion as {{to the nature of}} their intercourse. But he was ardent and tender of heart beyond the common nature of man, and had already learnt to love, while the beauteous Greek smiled benignantly on the boy. It was strange to me, who, though older than Adrian, had never loved, to witness the whole heart's sacrifice of my friend. There was neither jealousy, inquietude, or mistrust in his sentiment; it was devotion and faith. His life was swallowed up in the existence of his beloved; and his heart beat only in unison with the pulsations that vivified hers. This was the secret law of his life--he loved and was beloved. The universe was to him a dwelling, to inhabit with his chosen one; and not either a scheme of society or an enchainment of events, that could impart to him either happiness or misery. What, though life and the system of social intercourse were a wilderness, a tiger-haunted jungle! Through the midst of its errors, in the depths of its savage recesses, there was a disentangled and flowery pathway, through which they might journey in safety and delight. Their track would be like the passage of the Red Sea, which they might traverse with <b>unwet</b> feet, though a wall of destruction were impending on either side.|$|R
50|$|They {{can come}} in many {{different}} configurations {{from that of a}} pure race boat to that of a recreational craft. A padded v-hull is very similar in basic shape to the popular v-hull which simply forms a vee when looking {{at the back of the}} watercraft. The difference in design with the padded v-hull is that where the point of the vee would be on the bottom of a plain v-hull there is a flat area ranging from six to ten inches wide. When looking at a padded v-hull from underneath, the front of the hull shows a vee which slowly starts to taper and blend back to the flat pad area. This back portion of the hull is the pad and it will protrude from the vee surface one-half to one-full inch. The pad more efficiently provides hydrodynamic lift due to very low deadrise planing surface, compared to the vee hull lifting surfaces. This highly efficient lift helps to <b>unwet</b> the less efficient vee sections hull which reduces drag tremendously. It uses hydrodynamic pressure to ride higher in the water. As the boats speed increases, water pressure builds on the flat surface of the pad causing the boat to ride higher in the water and ultimately the boat will be riding on just the pad area. At low speeds these hulls ride and handle just the same as a regular v-hull of the same size and weight. Once speeds increase the padded hull will out accelerate and have a higher top speed than a plain v-hull since the padded hull has less drag once speeds increase.|$|R
