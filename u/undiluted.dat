5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally <b>undiluted.</b> The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When <b>undiluted,</b> {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of <b>undiluted</b> essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Devagiri, Shiva comes {{to know of}} the treacherous wars that the Chandravanshis are {{carrying}} on the Meluhans. He also meets Brahaspati, the Chief Inventor of the Meluhans. Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually <b>undiluted</b> Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years. Brahaspati and Shiva develop a close friendship and the royal family returns to Devagiri. One morning, the whole of Meluha wakes up to loud noises coming from Mount Mandar. Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in the treacherous wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
25|$|It also {{banned the}} {{drinking}} of <b>undiluted</b> wine except for medical purposes.|$|E
25|$|Wine {{was almost}} always diluted, usually with water (or snow when the wine was to be served cold). The Greeks {{believed}} that only barbarians drank unmixed or <b>undiluted</b> wine and that the Spartan king Cleomenes I was once driven insane after drinking wine this way. They also believed that <b>undiluted</b> wine could even kill the drinker: the Gallic chieftain Brennus was recorded as having committed suicide by drinking wine full-strength. Greeks asserted that the dilution of wine with water was a mark of civilized behavior, whose contrast was embodied in {{the myth of the}} battle of Lapiths with the Centaurs, inflamed to rape and mayhem because of wine drunk <b>undiluted</b> with water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undiluted</b> urine can {{chemically}} {{burn the}} leaves or roots of some plants, {{particularly if the}} soil moisture content is low. For this reason, urine fertilizer is usually applied diluted with water.|$|E
25|$|Cask {{strength}} (also {{known as}} barrel proof) whiskies are rare, and usually only {{the very best}} whiskies are bottled in this way. They are bottled from the cask <b>undiluted</b> or only lightly diluted.|$|E
25|$|The {{race of the}} Hellenes {{has been}} wiped out in Europe. Physical beauty, {{intellectual}} brilliance, innate harmony and simplicity, art, competition, city, village, the splendour of column and temple — indeed, even the name has disappeared {{from the surface of}} the Greek continent.... Not the slightest drop of <b>undiluted</b> Hellenic blood flows in the veins of the Christian population of present-day Greece.|$|E
25|$|The {{drain pipes}} from {{waterless}} urinals {{need to be}} installed correctly in terms of diameter, slope and pipe materials {{in order to prevent}} buildup of struvite ("urine stone") and calcium phosphate precipitates in the pipes, which would cause blockages and could require expensive repairs. Also, the <b>undiluted</b> urine is corrosive to metals (except for stainless steel), which is why plastic pipes are generally preferred for urine drain pipes.|$|E
25|$|Lazaraus Muoka {{claimed to}} have had many dreams from God in 1994 {{prompting}} him to pull out from the church he was serving as a pastor and set up his own church. Shortly after pulling out, he set up The Lord's Chosen Charismatic Revival Movement {{with the aim of}} “preaching the <b>undiluted</b> word of God”. The church which started with a few pioneer members has gone on {{to become one of the}} most popular churches in Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly <b>undiluted.</b> Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a flash fire hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, an {{arbitrary}} volume {{of hot water}} can be stored, {{as long as the}} stratification is kept intact. In this case there must not be vertical metal plates or tubes as they would conduct heat through the water layers, defeating the purpose of stratification. When effectively employed this technique can maintain water as high as 95°C (i.e. just below boiling) yielding a higher energy density, and this energy can be stored a long time provided the hot water remains <b>undiluted.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Abhidhamma is thus {{presented}} as a pure and <b>undiluted</b> form of the teaching that was too difficult for most practitioners of the Buddha's time to grasp. Instead, the Buddha taught by the method related in the various suttas, giving appropriate, immediately applicable teachings as each situation arose, rather than attempting to set forth the Abhidhamma in all its complexity and completeness. Thus, there is a similarity between {{the traditions of the}} Adhidhamma and that of the Mahayana, which also claimed to be too difficult for the people living in the Buddha's time.|$|E
25|$|Episodes {{revolve around}} the adventures of Sarah and her friends in Valley Village, California, a {{district}} in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles, which is portrayed as an autonomous city within the show. Silverman plays a fictionalized version of herself, an unemployed woman who leads an irresponsible life. Her most notable trait is her <b>undiluted,</b> childlike self-absorption, which commonly leads to awkward comedic situations in which she insults friends, family, and total strangers. The show tackled issues such as abortion, racism, and same-sex marriage; it was canceled after three seasons. The show was filmed at Hollywood Center Studios, Hollywood, California.|$|E
25|$|Since 5β-coprostanol {{is formed}} from {{cholesterol}} in the vertebrate gut, {{the ratio of}} the product over reactant can be used to indicate the degree of faecal matter in samples. Raw untreated sewage typically has a 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol ratio of ~10 which decreases through a sewage treatment plant (STP) such that in the discharged liquid wastewaters the ratio is ~2. <b>Undiluted</b> STP wastewaters may be identified by this high ratio. As the faecal matter is dispersed in the environment, the ratio will decrease as more (non-faecal) cholesterol from animals is encountered. Grimalt & Albaiges have suggested that samples with a 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol greater than 0.2 may be considered as contaminated by faecal material.|$|E
25|$|Magna, {{a special}} artist use acrylic paint was {{developed}} by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an acrylic resin with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is miscible with turpentine or mineral spirits and dries rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his Stripe Series, where the colors are used <b>undiluted</b> and are poured unmixed directly from the can.|$|E
25|$|As used by homeopaths, {{the term}} {{allopathy}} has always {{referred to the}} principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for fever may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an antibiotic) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted and succussed dosage of a substance, usually containing no actual particles of that substance, that in an <b>undiluted</b> and unsuccussed form would induce fever in a healthy person. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small (or nonexistent) doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. <b>Undiluted</b> animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E
25|$|Maximising funding {{permitted}} under pre-emption rules. For countries, {{such as the}} UK, where {{companies are}} subject to limits {{on the number of}} shares that can be offered to non-shareholders non-pre-emptively, convertibles can raise more money than via equity issues. Under the UK’s 1989 Guidelines issued by the Investor Protection Committees (IPCs) of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Fund Managers (NAPF), the IPCs will advise their members not to object to non pre-emptive issues which add no more than 5pct to historic non-diluted balance sheet equity in the period from AGM to AGM, and no more than 7.5pct in total over a period of 3 financial years. The pre-emption limits are calculated on the assumption of 100pct probability of conversion, using the figure of <b>undiluted</b> historic balance sheet share capital (where there is assumed a 0pct probability of conversion). There is no attempt to assign probabilities of conversion in both circumstances, which would result in bigger convertible issues being permitted. The reason for his inconsistency may lie {{in the fact that the}} Pre Emption Guidelines were drawn up in 1989, and binomial evaluations were not commonplace amongst professional investors until 1991-92.|$|E
500|$|The theatre's {{management}} was clearly {{concerned that the}} public might find the double opera too heavy in <b>undiluted</b> form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a [...] "mutilation", carried out [...] "for fear that the music may tire the hearers".|$|E
500|$|West Wycombe {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the most theatrical and Italianate mid-18th century buildings in England". Of all the 18th-century country houses, its façades replicate in <b>undiluted</b> form not only the classical villas of Italy on which Palladianism was founded, but also the temples of antiquity on which Neoclassicism was based. [...] The Greek Doric of the house's west portico is the earliest example of the Greek revival in Britain.|$|E
500|$|From the {{promulgation}} of {{the first}} constitution, in 1848, until the early twentieth century, Luxembourgish politics was dominated by independent politicians and statesmen. [...] The prerogative powers of the Grand Duke remained <b>undiluted,</b> and, as such, the monarch actively chose and personally appointed the Prime Minister. [...] As a result, the Prime Minister was often a moderate, without any strong affiliation to {{either of the two}} major ideological factions in the Chamber of Deputies: the secularist liberals and the Catholic conservatives.|$|E
500|$|He {{died during}} the 143rd Olympiad (208–204 BC) {{at the age of}} 73. Diogenes Laërtius gives two {{different}} accounts of his death. In the first account, Chrysippus was seized with dizziness having drunk <b>undiluted</b> wine at a feast, and died soon after. In the second account, he was watching a donkey eat some figs and cried out: [...] "Now give the donkey a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs", whereupon he died in a fit of laughter. His nephew Aristocreon erected a statue in his honour in the Kerameikos. Chrysippus was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by his pupil Zeno of Tarsus.|$|E
500|$|His {{follow-up}} album on Psychopathic A-1 Yola, saw Esham achieving his highest consecutive {{level of}} charting success, as it peaked at 176 on the Billboard 200, his highest selling album on that chart to date, {{as well as}} peaking at #6 on Top Heatseekers, #12 on the Independent Albums chart, #23 on the Top Rap Albums chart, and #48 on the Top R chart. Allrovi wrote, [...] "During the course of A-1 YOLA, Esham {{takes the form of}} street hustler, kingpin, vampire, and all sorts of underworld characters, injecting his <b>undiluted</b> personality into each three-to-four-minute sketch. His sonic backdrop remains raw but fresh, drawing an impressive amount of energy out of sparse beats." ...|$|E
500|$|Virtually {{all aspects}} of the game had their proponents and detractors. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the unity of [...] "great-looking camera work with simple controls" [...] and {{compared}} its [...] "thought-provoking" [...] storyline to Metal Gear Solid, while a GamePro reviewer criticized those features, calling the controls limited, the cel-shading dull, and the story incoherent. Kasavin complimented the game's eclectic soundtrack, excellent voice acting, and distinctive sound effects, while the GamePro reviewer panned them as minimalist and irritating. IGN's Matt Casamassina likened the control scheme to [...] "old-school adventure games like Myst and Snatcher" [...] and commended Suda51 for making a [...] "cult hit", [...] "erupting with style, mood and <b>undiluted</b> craziness". Casamassina was also impressed by the quality of the anime-style cutscenes featured {{in the latter half of}} the game.|$|E
500|$|The second {{concept is}} a huge energy vessel hidden in the world inside the Moon and {{protected}} by the Ōtsutsuki clan. It is a yellow sun-like object with a double-layered hexagonal pupil surrounded by orange flower-like iris. The center of the core also contains Hamura's Tenseigan. The object is stored within a spherical case attached to Hamura's shrine. It can only be touched by someone who possesses [...] "the <b>undiluted</b> chakra of Hamura". The vessel is a highly powerful object as it supports {{the life of the}} hollow world by providing the artificial sun. It was also used in warfare by the feuding main and branch families of the Ǒtsutsuki clan. However, to support the vessel, all Ōtsutsuki clan members have to give up and combine their Byakugan within the vessel. This includes Toneri, the last surviving member of the clan.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{received}} largely positive reviews. Although {{it did not}} chart, Nakamura {{said the}} album sold well, even during its initial underground release. [...] "We didn't have records in every store. We'd have 10 copies in Tower {{and the next day}} they'd be sold out, and then we wouldn't get another copy in for another month." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention, citing the album's introduction and the songs [...] "Earth People" [...] and [...] "Wild and Crazy" [...] as highlights, and writing simply [...] "the shock horror! the shock horror! the perhaps authentically crazy!" [...] NME magazine described the album as [...] "...nineteen strong doses of pure, <b>undiluted</b> hip-hop." [...] Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReviews wrote that [...] "If you aren't laughing, you should be bugging. Kool Keith obviously doesn't care. You should, though, because like every other record Keith has ever been on, it will be hailed ten years from now as a classic." [...] In his review, Chairman Mao of Rolling Stone wrote [...] "Kool Keith leads and oversees the chaos with a Zappa-esque commitment to decadence." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{important}} {{products of}} Kumbakonam include brass, bronze, copper and pewter vessels, silk and cotton cloths, sugar, indigo and pottery. Kumbakonam {{is considered to}} be the chief commercial centre for the Thanjavur region. In 1991, around 30% of the population was engaged in economic activity. Rice production is an important activity in Kumbakonam. [...] Of 194 industrial units in Kumbakonam, 57 are rice and flour mills. Kumbakonam is also a leading producer of betel leaves and nuts; the betel leaves produced in Kumbakonam are ranked amongst {{the best in the world}} in terms of quality. The A. R. R. Agencies, a leading manufacturer of arecanut slices has its factory in Kumbakonam. The main administrative offices of T. S. R. & Co., a cosmetic company, are also based in Kumbakonam. Kumbakonam is also famous for its metal works. The Tamil Nadu Handicraft Development Corporation had been established in the nearby town of Swamimalai in order to train bronze artisans. Kumbakonam is an important silk-weaving centre and more than 5,000 families were employed either directly or indirectly in silk weaving. Silk weaved in Kumbakonam is regarded as one of the finest in the subcontinent. They are largely used in the manufacture of Thirubuvanam silk sarees. Kumbakonam was also an important salt-manufacturing area during British rule. The town lends its name to the Kumbakonam Degree Coffee, a blend of coffee prepared using <b>undiluted</b> pure milk. In recent times, Kumbakonam has emerged as an important manufacturer of fertilizers.|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network's reviewers found much {{to enjoy}} {{about the first}} series, {{although}} Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be [...] "watched in small doses, as trying to tackle {{too much of it}} in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells". Carl Kimlinger comments that [...] "from the moment the words 'School Rumble' come spinning onto the screen, you know you're in for ... <b>undiluted</b> good times", and that the title is [...] "two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you're likely to see anytime soon". Carlo Santos praises volume six's bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that [...] "although this disc technically marks the end of [...] School Rumble, it's really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish". Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series' long-term entertainment value, but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, found his early indifference fading as the story develops. IGN's Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched, and the style—if not always the color—of Funimation's metallic locker artbox for School Rumbles English translation of the first season was welcomed.|$|E
500|$|Terry-Thomas {{enjoyed his}} time at Ardingly, and relished his {{association}} with upper middle class school friends. His academic abilities were modest, and he only came to the notice of staff through his frequent tomfoolery. Although he initially felt intimidated by his school surroundings, his confidence grew as he put on [...] "a bold, <b>undiluted</b> and sustained show of chutzpah", according to his biographer, Graham McCann. On his return home to Finchley to start a break in 1927, his more mature manner impressed the family's housekeeper Kate Dixon, who seduced the young student at the family home. He stayed at Ardingly for one more term and returned home to London, but made no plans to further his education or start long-term work. Instead, he accepted a temporary position at Smithfield Market, where he earned 15 shillings a week as a junior transport clerk for the Union Cold Storage Company. By his own admission, he never stopped [...] "farting around" [...] and often kept his colleagues entertained with impersonations of the Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Erich von Stroheim. He also invented various characters, including Colonel Featherstonehaugh-Bumleigh and Cora Chessington-Crabbe, and frequently recited comic stories involving them to his colleagues. His characterisations soon came to the notice of the company's management who prompted him to enrol in the company's amateur drama club. He made his début with the drama company {{in the role of}} Lord Trench in The Dover Road which was staged at the Fortune Theatre, London. The production was popular with audiences, and he subsequently became a regular performer in many amateur productions.|$|E
2500|$|While cask-strength, or <b>undiluted,</b> whisky (sometimes {{having an}} alcohol content upwards of 60%) has {{recently}} become popular, {{the vast majority}} of whisky is diluted to its [...] "bottling strength" [...] - between 40% and 46% ABV - and bottled for sale.|$|E
2500|$|Two months later, Coady {{nominated}} Curtain as his Book of the Year in {{a column}} of critic's choices. He said, [...] "No crime story of 1975 has given me more <b>undiluted</b> pleasure. As a critic, I welcome it, {{as a reminder that}} sheer ingenuity can still amaze." ...|$|E
2500|$|While some {{winemaking}} techniques {{once considered}} fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices {{have gone in}} the opposite direction. One {{of the most controversial}} is adding water to wine in a technique known today as humidification. Master of wine Jancis Robinson calls the act of adding water to [...] "stretch out" [...] or dilute wine [...] "possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book." [...] There is a long history of adding water to dilute wine {{in order to make it}} more palatable. The ancient Greeks thought it was [...] "barbaric" [...] to drink <b>undiluted</b> wine. They further believed that <b>undiluted</b> wine was unhealthy and that the Spartan king Cleomenes I was once driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{them were}} claims of {{insensitivity}} against {{the newspaper and}} of giving an unduly large audience to a position characterized as being extremist. University of Texas president Larry Faulkner issued a response denouncing Jenson's as [...] "a fountain of <b>undiluted</b> foolishness on issues of public policy", noting [...] "e is not speaking in the University's name and may not speak in its name." ...|$|E
2500|$|At first Hahnemann used <b>undiluted</b> doses for provings, but {{he later}} {{advocated}} provings with preparations at a 30C dilution, and most modern provings {{are carried out}} using ultra-dilute preparations {{in which it is}} highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain. During the proving process, Hahnemann administered preparations to healthy volunteers, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a [...] "drug picture".|$|E
