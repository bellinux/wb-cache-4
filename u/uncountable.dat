5|$|Andrew {{sold and}} mortgaged royal estates to finance his campaign, which {{became part of}} the wider Fifth Crusade. He renounced his claim to Zadar in favor of the Republic of Venice so that he could secure {{shipping}} for his army. He entrusted Hungary to Archbishop John of Esztergom, and gave Croatia and Dalmatia to Pontius de Cruce, the Templar Prior of Vrana. In July 1217, Andrew departed from Zagreb, accompanied by Leopold VI of Austria and Otto I, Duke of Merania. His army was so largeat least 10,000 mounted soldiers and <b>uncountable</b> infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later. The ships transported them to Acre, where they landed in October.|$|E
25|$|The set T is <b>uncountable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Morley's categoricity theorem, proved by Michael D. Morley (1965), {{states that}} if a first-order theory in a {{countable}} language is categorical in some <b>uncountable</b> cardinality, i.e. all models of this cardinality are isomorphic, then it is categorical in all <b>uncountable</b> cardinalities.|$|E
25|$|This {{contradicts the}} {{original}} assumption, so T must be <b>uncountable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In R {{carrying}} the lower limit topology, no <b>uncountable</b> set is compact.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>uncountable</b> ordinal , {{equipped}} with its natural order topology, is not separable.|$|E
25|$|In the {{infinite}} version, {{the collection of}} balls can be countable or <b>uncountable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{contemporary}} mathematical logic, {{the signature}} varies by application. Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, ×} or just {×} for groups, or {0, 1, +, ×, <} for ordered fields. There are no {{restrictions on the}} number of non-logical symbols. The signature can be empty, finite, or infinite, even <b>uncountable.</b> <b>Uncountable</b> signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem.|$|E
25|$|The Cantor set is {{an example}} of an <b>uncountable</b> set that has Lebesgue measure zero.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{example of}} a space which is not {{separable}} is a discrete space of <b>uncountable</b> cardinality.|$|E
25|$|Any {{theory with}} a {{countable}} {{language that is}} categorical for some <b>uncountable</b> cardinal is totally transcendental.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} only countably many notations, all ordinals with notations are {{exhausted}} well below the first <b>uncountable</b> ordinal ω1; their supremum is called Church–Kleene ω1 or ω1CK (not {{to be confused with}} the first <b>uncountable</b> ordinal, ω1), described below. Ordinal numbers below ω1CK are the recursive ordinals (see below). Countable ordinals larger than this may still be defined, but do not have notations.|$|E
25|$|This {{construction}} can {{be improved}} to create an <b>uncountable</b> family of U-numbers of degree n. Let Z be the set consisting of every other power of 10 in the series above for λ. The set of all subsets of Z is <b>uncountable.</b> Deleting any of the subsets of Z from the series for λ creates uncountably many distinct Liouville numbers, whose nth roots are U-numbers of degree n.|$|E
25|$|In Lebesgue measure theory, the Cantor set is {{an example}} of a set which is <b>uncountable</b> and has zero measure.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} models of an {{unstable}} theory T of any <b>uncountable</b> cardinality κ≥|T| is the maximum possible number 2κ.|$|E
25|$|The set of {{transcendental}} {{numbers is}} uncountably infinite. Since the polynomials with rational coefficients are countable, and since each such polynomial has {{a finite number}} of zeroes, the algebraic numbers must also be countable. However, Cantor's diagonal argument proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are <b>uncountable.</b> Since the real numbers are the union of algebraic and transcendental numbers, they cannot both be countable. This makes the transcendental numbers <b>uncountable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The perfect set theorem, {{which states}} that every <b>uncountable</b> closed subset of a {{complete}} separable metric space contains a perfect closed set.|$|E
25|$|Since it is symmetric, it can {{be defined}} even on an <b>uncountable</b> {{supporting}} set, giving an example of non-separable polynomially reflexive Banach space.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of Cantor's proof that the real numbers are <b>uncountable</b> and the rationals countable, it follows that almost all real numbers are irrational.|$|E
25|$|Such {{sets are}} {{now known as}} <b>uncountable</b> sets, {{and the size of}} {{infinite}} sets is now treated by the theory of cardinal numbers which Cantor began.|$|E
25|$|Example 1. The {{power set}} 2X of X, {{consisting}} of all subsets of X. Here X may be any set: empty, finite, infinite, or even <b>uncountable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Four is {{the only}} {{dimension}} n for which Rn can have an exotic smooth structure. R4 has an <b>uncountable</b> number of exotic smooth structures; see exotic R4.|$|E
25|$|In the {{cocountable}} topology on an <b>uncountable</b> set, no infinite set is compact. Like {{the previous}} example, the space {{as a whole}} is not locally compact but is still Lindelöf.|$|E
25|$|A {{product of}} at most countably many {{separable}} spaces is separable. A countable product of second-countable spaces is second countable, but an <b>uncountable</b> product of second-countable spaces need {{not even be}} first countable.|$|E
25|$|Let V be an infinite-dimensional {{vector space}} over an <b>uncountable</b> field F. Then Con A {{isomorphic}} to Sub V implies that A {{has at least}} card F operations, for any algebra A.|$|E
25|$|Many {{consequences}} of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem seemed counterintuitive to logicians in the early 20th century, as the distinction between first-order and non-first-order properties was not yet understood. One such consequence is the existence of <b>uncountable</b> models of true arithmetic, which satisfy every first-order induction axiom but have non-inductive subsets. Another consequence that was considered particularly troubling is {{the existence of a}} countable model of set theory, which nevertheless must satisfy the sentence saying the real numbers are <b>uncountable.</b> This counterintuitive situation {{came to be known as}} Skolem's paradox; it shows that the notion of countability is not absolute.|$|E
25|$|The Menger sponge is {{a closed}} set; {{since it is}} also bounded, the HeineBorel theorem implies that it is compact. It has Lebesgue measure0. Because it {{contains}} continuous paths, it is an <b>uncountable</b> set.|$|E
25|$|From {{the above}} property, one can deduce the following: If X is a {{separable}} space having an <b>uncountable</b> closed discrete subspace, then X cannot be normal. This {{shows that the}} Sorgenfrey plane is not normal.|$|E
25|$|For an {{infinite}} set the order type determines the cardinality, but not conversely: well-ordered sets {{of a particular}} cardinality can have many different order types. For a countably infinite set, the set of possible order types is even <b>uncountable.</b>|$|E
25|$|A well-ordered set as {{topological space}} is a first-{{countable}} space if {{and only if}} it has order type {{less than or equal to}} ω1 (omega-one), that is, {{if and only if}} the set is countable or has the smallest <b>uncountable</b> order type.|$|E
25|$|As a topological space, {{the real}} numbers are separable. This {{is because the}} set of rationals, which is countable, is dense in the real numbers. The irrational numbers are also dense in the real numbers, however they are <b>uncountable</b> and have the same {{cardinality}} as the reals.|$|E
25|$|Georg Cantor formalized {{many ideas}} related to {{infinity}} and infinite sets during the late19th and early 20thcenturies. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets {{of different sizes}} (called cardinalities). For example, the set of integers is countably infinite, while the infinite set of real numbers is <b>uncountable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1924, he {{finished}} primary school and {{never went back}} to school. He {{was hired as a}} sales clerk working extended hours. Although his catholic devotion and <b>uncountable</b> penances, apart from all restrictions imposed by the priest he confessed with; he never stopped having visions or communicate with the spirits.|$|E
25|$|On {{a compact}} Hausdorff space {{the support of}} a non-zero measure is always non-empty, but may have measure 0. An example of this is given by adding the first <b>uncountable</b> ordinal Ω to the {{previous}} example: the support of the measure is the single point Ω, which has measure 0.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{consider}} {{for instance}} the unit circle S, {{and the action}} on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples ofπ. Here G is countable while S is <b>uncountable.</b> Hence S breaks up into uncountably many orbits underG. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an <b>uncountable</b> subset X of S with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint fromX. The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since X is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on S, finding an algorithm to select a point in each orbit requires the axiom of choice. See non-measurable set for more details.|$|E
25|$|Every {{countable}} limit ordinal requires {{replacement for}} its construction analogously to ω·2. Larger ordinals rely on replacement less directly. For example, ω1, the first <b>uncountable</b> ordinal, {{can be constructed}} as follows– the set of countable well orders exists as a subset of P(N×N) by separation and powerset (a relation on A is a subset of A×A, and so {{an element of the}} power set P(A×A). A set of relations is thus a subset of P(A×A)). Replace each well-ordered set with its ordinal. This is the set of countable ordinals ω1, which can itself be shown to be <b>uncountable.</b> The construction uses replacement twice; once to ensure an ordinal assignment for each well ordered set and again to replace well ordered sets by their ordinals. This is a special case of the result of Hartogs number, and the general case can be proved similarly.|$|E
