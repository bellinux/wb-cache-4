40|$|Based on {{the high}} {{incidence}} of invasive species of the African snail, Achatina fulica, in Araguaína city, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the microbiological conditions of the snail and the occurrence of this in home gardens in the city. Laboratory methods were followed to determine the presence / absence of microorganisms at the snail´s surface, as well as filamentous fungi. In addition there were performed hundred and one (101) interviews to locals settled in nineteen sectors of Araguaína. The microbiological results from the snail surface analysis showed at least 1, 2 x 105 CFU/g of heterotrophic bacteria, also were isolated fungi as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichophytone and Cryptococcus. In the survey interview, 86 % of respondents reported a high incidence of snail in their homes during the rainy season and 50 % of them informed they had some kind of home garden, on the other hand 85 % are <b>unawared</b> <b>of</b> the diseases that could be transmitted by this snail. We conclude that there are high levels of microbial contamination on the snail surface, combined with the preference for domestic garden´s products, been <b>unawared</b> <b>of</b> risks that can be carried by the snail invasion, which indicate the need to improve the knowledge regarding the risks of A. fulica in the daily lives of the residents of Araguaína city, considering not only people´s health but also the productivity of small-scale agriculture...|$|R

5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians are <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the diagnosis {{or they may}} miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} an audience's knowledge of the group membership of a target on the communication of information about this target. Participants were asked to rank order five traits to describe a person labelled as an engineer to an imaginary audience. Overall {{they were more likely}} to choose traits stereotypical of the target's social category when the audience was presented as <b>unaware</b> than aware <b>of</b> this category membership. Within-participants analyses also indicated that the perceived stereotypicality of a trait predicted its communication more positively when the audience was <b>unaware</b> than aware <b>of</b> the target's social category. These results can be interpreted in line with the maxim of quantity (Grice, 1975) : stereotype-consistent information being more informative when the audience is <b>unaware</b> than aware <b>of</b> the target's social category, it is more likely to be communicated in the former than in the latter case.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{graffiti}} subculture from gender perspective. Graffiti is traditionally perceived as part of Hip Hop subculture. Position of graffiti is examined within the frame of Hip Hop subculture and outside of it, when graffiti becomes a subculture itself. Relationships in graffiti subculture are deeply rooted in hierarchy. That is characterized by untouchable position of those writers {{that are on the}} top of hierarchical system, whose side effect is exclusion of women graffiti writers. This process is also connected to motivations of male writers for participation in graffiti subculture, which is also examined as a place for constructing masculinity. Another explored area focuses on gender stereotypes in graffiti and on the ways of restraining women's authority as graffiti writers from various sides that are often <b>unawared</b> <b>of</b> discriminatory behavior. The final part examines the ways of how female writers make themselves visible in graffiti and how they perceive their position in graffiti subculture in 2012...|$|R
