And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for <b>us</b> <b>because</b> we have to learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 82 {{traverses}} it, in {{the process}} reaching the highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road. After Cottonwood Pass to the south, it is the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state, the fourth-highest paved road {{in the state and}} the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Because</b> of the heavy snowfall at its elevation, it is closed in wintertime, isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season.|$|E
5|$|The Proposal is a 2009 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli. The film stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds with Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson.

5|$|Anthrax was {{announced}} as the headliner {{for the third}} annual Metal Alliance US tour, which endured through March and April 2013. Supporting acts included Exodus, Municipal Waste, and Holy Grail, with the headliner Anthrax performing Among the Living in its entirety. Charlie Benante has been taking time off from gigs outside the <b>US</b> <b>because</b> of personal reasons. His place was filled in by drummer Jon Dette during these shows. The group filmed their performance at Santiago, Chile, with Benante on drums, for the DVD album Chile On Hell. The tour ended with a show at San Bernardino, California, at the two-year anniversary of the album's release. After finishing the tour, the band took a short break before reconvening to start work on a new album.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, a {{detailed}} {{article in the}} London Review of Books by journalist Seymour Hersh said that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that Pakistani Army chief Pervez Kayani and ISI director Ahmad Shuja Pasha aided the U.S. mission to kill, not capture bin Laden. According to Hersh, Pakistani officials were always aware of bin Laden's location and were guarding the compound with their own soldiers. Pakistan decided to give up bin Laden's location to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> American aid was declining. Pakistani officials {{were aware of the}} raid, and assisted the U.S. in carrying it out. According to Hersh, bin Laden was basically an invalid.|$|E
5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the <b>US.</b> <b>Because</b> of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E

25|$|Family BASIC is an {{implementation}} of BASIC for the Famicom, packaged with a keyboard.

25|$|Another basic {{drive is}} the sexual drive which like food motivates <b>us</b> <b>because</b> it is {{essential}} to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than woman to think about sex.|$|E

25|$|While the {{government}} had a sufficient objective for infringing the right, namely working with the US cooperatively to fight crime and to keep {{good relations with the}} US, it was not necessary to risk execution for these objectives to be met. Asking that the death penalty should not be sought should not hurt relations with the <b>US</b> <b>because</b> the extradition treaty allows for this. There was also a concern about keeping dangerous criminals out of Canada, but the Court replied that criminals might not find extradition with the risk of a life sentence more attractive than the risk of execution, and thus it was not proven criminals would flee to Canada.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the United States had 21.5 GW of {{pumped storage}} {{generating}} capacity (20.6% of world capacity). PHS generated (net) -5.501 GWh {{of energy in}} 2010 in the <b>US</b> <b>because</b> more energy is consumed in pumping than is generated. Nameplate pumped storage capacity had grown to 21.6 GW by 2014, with pumped storage comprising 97% of grid-scale energy storage in the US. As of late 2014, there were 51 active project proposals {{with a total of}} 39 GW of new nameplate capacity across all stages of the FERC licensing process for new pumped storage hydroelectric plants in the US, but no new plants were currently under construction in the US at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{practical}} {{effect of}} the Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that the US would not invade Cuba. It is possible that Khrushchev placed the missiles in Cuba only to get Kennedy to remove the missiles from Italy and Turkey and that the Soviets {{had no intention of}} resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Because</b> the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time, Khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened. The perception was that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been humiliated. However, both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.|$|E

25|$|Galen {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{scholars}} and physicians of classical antiquity. Today, the original texts of some of his works, and details of his biography, are lost, and are only known to <b>us</b> <b>because</b> they were translated into Arabic. Jabir ibn Hayyan frequently cites Galen's books, which were available in early Arabic translations. In 872 AD, Ya'qubi refers to some of Galens works. The titles of the books he mentions differ from those chosen by Hunayn ibn Ishāq for his own translations, thus suggesting earlier translations must have existed. Hunayn frequently mentions in his comments on works which he had translated that he considered earlier translations as insufficient, and had provided completely new translations. Early translations might have been available before the 8th century; most likely they were translated from Syrian or Persian.|$|E
25|$|On June 22 (18 {{days after}} {{publication}} of Snowden's NSA documents began), officials revoked his U.S. passport. On June 23, Snowden boarded the commercial Aeroflot flight SU213 to Moscow, accompanied by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks. Hong Kong authorities said that Snowden {{had not been}} detained for the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> the request had not fully complied with Hong Kong law, {{and there was no}} legal basis to prevent Snowden from leaving. On June 24, a U.S. State Department spokesman rejected the explanation of technical noncompliance, accusing the Hong Kong government of deliberately releasing a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant and after having sufficient time to prohibit his travel. That same day, Julian Assange said that WikiLeaks had paid for Snowden's lodging in Hong Kong and his flight out.|$|E
25|$|ClassesT and L {{could be}} more common {{than all the other}} classes {{combined}} if recent research is accurate. Study of the number of proplyds (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in nebulae from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the galaxy should be several orders of magnitude higher than what was previously speculated. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a protostar, which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible to <b>us.</b> <b>Because</b> brown dwarfs can live so long, these smaller bodies accumulate over time.|$|E
