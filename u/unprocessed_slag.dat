A mix having the density of 1300 kg/m 3 with a proportion of (1 cement: 2 sand), W/C ratio of 0. 45, a commercially available additive (SP- 1), class F fly ash and a unprocessed blast furnace slag was used. The results show that the mix containing the slag achieved a higher compressive strength (6. 31 MPa at 28 days) than that of the control mix at the same age (5. 81 MPa). In addition, combining both slag and fly ash as a cement replacement further enhanced the compressive strength achieving higher compressive strengths. Also, a more stable mix was achieved by the slag replacement when compared to the control mix. This result concludes that the <b>unprocessed</b> <b>slag</b> is a good pozzolanic material that can be used with foam concrete...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{production}} of mortars prepared using a commercial CEMIIB-S 42. 5 N cement, a natural aggregate, steelmaking slag, a superplasticizer and water. The as-received <b>unprocessed</b> steel <b>slag</b> was milled by a hammer mill and then sieved to obtain batches with different maximum particle size. Each batch was used, together with the other components, {{in the production of}} mortars which were tested, by compression and water absorption, after different aging times in order to evaluate their long term stability. Several slag-free samples were also prepared as reference materials. All mortars were prepared with fixed aggregate/cement ratio (6 / 1), superplasticizer/cement ratio (s/c) and water/cement ratio (w/c). It has been demonstrated that an adequate protocol for the preparation and the use of slag containing particles with 2500 µm maximum size lead to the production of materials with mechanical properties suitable for civil engineering applications after aging for 28, 90 and 180 days. However, samples containing slag particles with size equal or greater than 1000 µm display a decay of mechanical properties after longer aging in water or after accelerated aging...|$|R
40|$|Interactions in culture, science, and {{technology}} in early Islamic North Africa are studied through an examination of Maghribi metallurgy. My dissertation, based on the Social/Cultural Construction of Technology (SCOT) model (Bijker 1997), explores {{the impact of the}} Islamic religion and culture on scientific and technological change in the spheres of gold and silver minting, copper working, and iron smelting towards reconstructing the role and impact of metals in Islamic society. The purpose of my reconstruction is to define and contextualize early Islamic Maghribi metallurgy for a region and time period poorly defined in the history of metallurgical technology. The development of this history of technology involves the investigation of technical design within a religious framework, presenting explanations for the motivations of the use of certain metals from both their intrinsic and instrumental properties. This specialized history is important in that it provides information of significance on the larger scope of the history of technology and science and on the structure of Islamic society. This study uses multiple lines of evidence, including historical documents, numismatic evidence, and archaeological data in an effort to situate the role of early Islamic Maghribi metallurgy into the framework of the history of African metallurgy. The religious and cultural meanings of metals are outlined through the compilation of their mention in the qur’ān, the Hadīth, and the chronicles of travelers. Coinage survey positions the political and economic role of the Islamic state, and addresses the stability of western-periphery polities within the state and the concerns of a dogmatically motivated bimetal system. The site of al-Basra, Morocco, a state mint under the Idrisid rule (A. D. 788 - 959), is the source for the excavated metal materials; the metal artifacts, <b>unprocessed</b> minerals, <b>slag,</b> non-metal tools associated with the metal production, and metallurgical facilities are described in their historical context. This dissertation presents, for the first time ever, an English translation of al-dawHa al-mushtabika fī DawābiT dār al-sika (The Intricate Tree in the Realm of the House of Minting). This fourteenth century Arabic text details the meaning, production, and uses of metals in medieval Islamic society, and serves as a unit of study within Maghribi metallurgical technology. An ethnographic study of the metal artisans of Fes, Morocco provides a modern-day reflection to this reconstruction. This study supports the SCOT methodology by identifying the relationships between scientific and technological practices and systems of belief. The Islamic culture and its practices [...] which were part codified religion, part belief system [...] were subject to change based on the contextual situations of the society. This study demonstrates that the society’s metallurgical practices were subject to the same conditions. The metallurgical know-how within Islamic Maghribi society was, and is, a direct reflection of the unifying themes embedded in the culture...|$|R
