40|$|The gear noise {{problem that}} widely occurs in power {{transmission}} systems is typically characterised {{by one or}} more high amplitude acoustic signals. The noise originates from the vibration of the gear pair system caused by transmission error excitation that arises from tooth profile errors, misalignment and tooth deflections. This paper aims to further research the effect of tooth profile modifications on the transmission error of gear pairs. A spur gear pair was modelled using finite elements, and the gear mesh was simulated and analysed under static conditions. The results obtained were used to study the effect of intentional tooth profile modifications on the transmission error of the gear pair. A detailed parametric study, involving development of an optimisation algorithm to design the tooth modifications, was performed to quantify the changes in the transmission error as a function of tooth profile modification parameters as compared to an <b>unmodified</b> <b>gear</b> pair baseline. ...|$|E
40|$|Face {{gear drives}} have many {{advantages}} over other cross axis transmissions especially in high performance applications. The lack of published design experience and design standards make their design difficult. This is mainly {{due to the}} complex geometries and {{to the lack of}} practical experience. For these reasons face gears have not been used for long. This work is aimed at investigating the behavior of a face gear transmission considering contact path under load, load sharing and stresses, for an <b>unmodified</b> <b>gear</b> set including shaft misalignment and modification on pinion profile. The investigation is carried out by integrating a 3 D CAD system and a FEA code, and by simulating the meshing of pinion and gear sectors with three teeth, using contact elements and an automated contact algorithm. The procedures followed to create the 3 D models of teeth in mesh are described and finite element analysis results discussed showing the differences between unmodified, modified and misaligned teeth. Results show the influence of load on theoretically calculated contact paths, contact areas, arc of action and load sharing. The differences with respect to the ideal case are sometimes remarkable. Further developments are discussed...|$|E

The work also investigates the main differences between the static and dynamic transmission error generated during the meshing of a spur gear pair model. A combination of Finite-Element Analysis, hybrid numerical/analytical methodology and optimisation algorithms were used to scrutinise the dynamic behaviour of the gear pairs under various operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{original}} formulation for tooth friction {{power losses}} in internal gears including {{the influence of}} tooth profile modifications is presented. For <b>unmodified</b> <b>gears,</b> the results agree well with the classic formulae in the literature thus validating the proposed approach. The contributions of profile modifications on internal gear efficiency are compared to that on external gears and the formulation is extended to planetary gears. Finally, the role of profile relief on planetary gear efficiency is pointed out and commented upon...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{universal}} modification {{theory is}} developed {{for all kinds}} of hourglass worm drives, no matter what shape the generating surface of the worm is. Based on the theory established, toroidal worm drives can be classified into two main categories: with singular points and without singular points. That is to say, the <b>unmodified</b> hourglass worm <b>gearing</b> is merely a special case of the modified one in essence. Furthermore, the meshing characteristics of a double-enveloping toroidal worm drive are entirely up to the situation of the solution of the meshing equation of the second envelope...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{computer simulation}} program for dynamic modeling of low-contact-ratio spur gear systems is presented. The procedure computes the static transmission error of the gears operating under load {{and uses a}} fast Fourier transform to generate the frequency spectrum of the static transmission error at various tooth profile modifications. The dynamic loading response of an <b>unmodified</b> (perfect involute) <b>gear</b> pair was {{compared with that of}} gears with various profile modifications. Correlations were found between various profile modifications and the resulting dynamic loads. An effective error, obtained from frequency domain analysis of the static transmission error of the gears, gave a very good indication of the optimum profile modification to reduce gear dynamic loading. Design curves generated by dynamic simulation at various profile modifications are given for gear systems operated at various loads. Optimum profile modifications can be determined from these design curves for improved gear design...|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{commercial}} fishing extend far beyond direct effects on targeted species. As much as 40 % of global marine catch {{is attributable to}} bycatch, or the capture of non-target organisms which occurs during fishing. The amount of bycatch in a fishery is determined {{in part by the}} selectivity of the industry’s fishing gear, and bycatch mitigation often focuses on improving the selectivity of these gears. This thesis explores bycatch mitigation through the design and evaluation of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), or fishing gear modifications aimed specifically at reducing non-target catch while maintaining the catch of target species. I examine BRDs using a three-pronged assessment, which tests a modified gear’s effects on non-target catch, on target catch, and on practicality for use in commercial fisheries (all relative to <b>unmodified</b> <b>gear).</b> I first perform a global-scale meta-analysis on technologies designed to protect elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) from longline fisheries. I show that most technologies are broadly ineffective at reducing elasmobranch bycatch, and that many studies fail to adequately assess novel BRDs across all three dimensions of gear performance. The remainder of my thesis focuses on the research and development of BRDs for a British Columbia fishery which employs trapping gear to capture spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros). Using data from fishery-independent surveys, I show that these traps catch rockfish (Sebastes spp.) as bycatch, a multi-species genus which is depleted due to overfishing and which suffers high discard mortality due to barotrauma incurred during the fishing process. I demonstrate that a novel underwater camera system can be used to study prawn traps in situ, and use insights from this analysis to inform the design of BRDs for prawn traps. I conclude my thesis with an assessment of BRDs of my own design, using both catch data and in situ observations conducted using my underwater camera apparatus. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the challenges in designing effective BRDs, and provides a framework for assessment that {{can be used as a}} template in future studies of fishing gear design...|$|E
