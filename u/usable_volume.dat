This was a major reconstruction that involved {{the removal of the}} superstructure, masts and armament as well most of the internal equipment. To increase the <b>usable</b> <b>volume</b> of the hull and to improve crew comfort, the forecastle deck was extended almost {{all the way to the}} stern and a new superstructure was built above it, made of aluminium to reduce topweight. Two lattice masts were added to carry the Type 277Q surface-search, Type 274 navigation, and Type 293Q gunnery radars. The ship's main gun armament now consisted of a twin-gun turret fitted with 4-inch (102mm) Mk XVI guns mounted aft and a water-cooled, twin-gun Mk V mount for 40mm Bofors guns above the bridge. The pair of triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortars were shifted to the quarterdeck aft and were controlled by Type 170 and 174 ASDIC systems.|$|E

40|$|Overcrowding in the {{perimeter}} zone is an inevitable issue in residential rooms with limited space. Obstructions, such as furniture and household items, may block the existing windows, and therefore affect interior daylight conditions. A facade design approach is needed that simultaneously {{takes into account}} daylighting and the <b>volume</b> of <b>usable</b> space for obstructions in {{the perimeter}} zone of such rooms. This study simulates daylight distributions in a typical small residential room with obstructions in front of windows. The simulation consists of two parts. First, the effects on horizontal illuminances caused by different positions and shapes of obstructions are examined under an overcast sky. Second, the maximum <b>usable</b> space <b>volumes</b> for obstructions of 51 optimized facade configurations are calculated in terms of four window-to-wall ratios (WWRs).

Additionally, by using the optimized facade forms, a facade with a WWR value of 50 % provides the maximum usable space for obstructions.

This research emphasizes on {{the analysis of the}} geometrical effect of the conventional Golay-Maxwell pair gradient coils to these two parameters through computer simulation. The results show that the geometrical parameters of ? and d affect Golay coil’s magnetic field gradient. <b>Usable</b> <b>volume</b> is improved 50 % while gradient strength is increased 11 % when ? is 1600 compared to the original 1200. The increase of d results in increase of <b>usable</b> <b>volume,</b> which is a maximum of 3374 cm 3 at 0 : 8 r but a loss of gradient strength of 36 % compared to - 0. 34 mT/m at 0 : 2 r.

40|$|Abstract. Eroded {{soil from}} {{overland}} {{is one of}} the major nonpoint pollution sources in many watersheds. The subsequent sediment not only reduces conveyance capacity of streams and <b>usable</b> storage <b>volume</b> of reservoirs but it also adsorbs and transports pollutants into and impairs its receiving water bodies. These negative environmental impacts may be alleviated by reducing sediment loading, which is positively associated with soil erosion rate. Targeted to critical erosion areas, which have a soil erosion rate higher than the tolerable level (T value) of 4536 kg/ac-y (5 tons/ac-y), limited funds may be more efficiently used to control sediment. With this regard, it is necessary to identify these areas in a watershed using an efficient tool such as an ArcView GIS based AGNPS (AGriculture Non-Point Source) model. The objective of this study was to use the GIS-AGNPS model to identify erosion-source areas within the 7075 -ha Lake Icaria watershed, located in the Adams County, Iowa. The simulation results indicated that under current conventional cultivation practices, approximately 20 % of the watershed in size was incurring a soil erosion rate above the T value. However, iterative simulation results revealed that the erosion rates in more than 63 % of these identified critical areas could be reduced to a magnitude less than the T value, provided that the cropping (C) factors corresponding to the conventional cultivation practices would be adjusted down by 25 %...|$|R
