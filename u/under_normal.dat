5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his performances, Fingleton was {{recalled}} to the Test team for the tour of South Africa in 1935–36, where he partnered Brown {{at the top of the}} innings. <b>Under</b> <b>normal</b> circumstances, the Australians would have been captained by Fingleton's rival Bradman, who had been vice-captain to Woodfull. However, Bradman was unable to tour for medical reasons and Vic Richardson led the team instead. With Bradman out of the way, the tour was to be the most prolific and peaceful phase of Fingleton's international career and included several large opening stands with Brown. During the tour, Fingleton played with an attacking flair that contrasted with his established reputation for doggedness. For Fingleton, it was the happiest tour he had been on, in large part due to Bradman's absence.|$|E
5|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to be {{substantially}} automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> operation, the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after stations stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Specifications for {{laboratory}} {{shear strength}} testing of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) must replicate field conditions while still accounting for time and cost considerations. A database of 414 GCL in-ternal and 534 GCL-geomembrane (GM) interface shear strength results has been assembled. Specifically, {{the results of}} large-scale direct shear tests conducted by a single independent laboratory are evaluated to de-velop guidelines on specimen conditioning. It was found that both the GCL internal and interface peak shear strengths decreased with increasing time of hydration (th). However, the GCL internal shear strength did not change for th beyond 48 hs and the GCL-GM interface shear strength did not change for th beyond 24 hs. The normal stress used during hydration affected significantly the peak shear strength due to bentonite swelling. Hydration <b>under</b> low <b>normal</b> stress followed by consolidation led to similar GCL internal peak shear strength as hydration <b>under</b> high <b>normal</b> stress. However, due to bentonite extrusion, hydration <b>under</b> high <b>normal</b> stress led to consistently lower GCL-GM interface peak shear strength than hydration <b>under</b> low <b>normal</b> stress followed by consolidation. Overall, GCL internal and interface large-displacement shear strengths {{were found to be}} relatively insensitive to conditioning. ...|$|R
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E
5|$|Club {{competitions}} between {{teams from}} different European countries can trace their origins {{as far back}} as 1897, when the Challenge Cup was created for clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who did not meet <b>under</b> <b>normal</b> circumstances. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, named after entrepreneur and sportsman Thomas Lipton, was established in 1909 and was contested between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the competition lasted for two years. The earliest attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club FC Servette. Founded in 1930, the Coupe des Nations featured clubs of ten major European football leagues and was deemed a success. Due to financial reasons, the competition was abandoned.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the plane-on-plane {{torsional}} fretting tribological {{behavior of}} polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was studied. A {{model of a}} rigid, flat-ended punch acting on an elastic half-space was built according to the experimental conditions. The {{results indicate that the}} shape of T-θ curves was influenced by both the torsional angle and the normal load. The torsion friction torque and wear rate of PTFE exponentially decreased when the torsion angle rose. The torsional torque increased from 0. 025 N·m <b>under</b> a <b>normal</b> load of 43 N to 0. 082 N·m <b>under</b> a <b>normal</b> load of 123 N. With sequentially increasing normal load, the value of torque was maintained. With rising normal load, the wear mass loss of PTFE disks was increased and the wear rate was decreased. Good agreement was found with the calculated torque according to the model and the experimental torque except for that <b>under</b> a <b>normal</b> load of 163 N. The difference <b>under</b> a <b>normal</b> load of 163 N was caused by the coefficient of friction. Usually the coefficient of friction of a polymer decreases with increasing normal load, whereas a constant coefficient of friction was applied in the model...|$|R

Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
