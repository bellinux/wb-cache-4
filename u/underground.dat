5|$|The <b>Underground</b> State {{also became}} officially {{recognized}} by the Polish government, local authorities and the community, with most major cities in Poland erecting various memorials to the <b>Underground</b> State affiliated resistance. In Poznań, there is a dedicated Polish <b>Underground</b> State Monument, erected in 2007. On 11 September 1998 the Sejm (parliament) of Poland declared the day of 27 September (anniversary {{of the founding of}} the Service for Poland's Victory organization) to be the Day of the Polish <b>Underground</b> State.|$|E

5|$|The {{two largest}} <b>underground</b> {{publishers}} were the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of Armia Krajowa and the Government Delegation for Poland. Tajne Wojskowe Zakłady Wydawnicze (Secret Military Publishing House) of Jerzy Rutkowski (subordinated to the Armia Krajowa) {{was probably the}} largest <b>underground</b> publisher in the world. In addition to Polish titles, Armia Krajowa also printed false German newspapers designed to decrease morale of the occupying German forces (as part of Action N). The majority of Polish <b>underground</b> presses were located in occupied Warsaw; until the Warsaw Uprising {{in the summer of}} 1944 the Germans found over 16underground printing presses (whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps). The second largest center for Polish <b>underground</b> publishing was Kraków. There, writers and editors faced similar dangers: for example, almost the entire editorial staff of the <b>underground</b> satirical paper Na Ucho was arrested, and its chief editors were executed in Kraków on 27May 1944. (Na Ucho was the longest published Polish <b>underground</b> paper devoted to satire; 20issues were published starting in October 1943.) The <b>underground</b> press was supported by a large number of activists; in addition to the crews manning the printing presses, scores of <b>underground</b> couriers distributed the publications. According to some statistics, these couriers were among the <b>underground</b> members most frequently arrested by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Visual arts were practiced <b>underground</b> as well. Cafes, {{restaurants}} and private homes were turned into galleries or museums; some were closed, with their owners, staff and patrons harassed, arrested or even executed. Polish <b>underground</b> artists included Eryk Lipiński, Stanisław Miedza-Tomaszewski, Stanisław Ostoja-Chrostowski, and Konstanty Maria Sopoćko. Some artists worked directly for the <b>Underground</b> State, forging money and documents, and creating anti-Nazi art (satirical posters and caricatures) or Polish patriotic symbols (for example kotwica). These works were reprinted on <b>underground</b> presses, and those intended for public display were plastered to walls or painted {{on them as}} graffiti. Many of these activities were coordinated under the Action N Operation of Armia Krajowa's Bureau of Information and Propaganda. In 1944 three giant (6m, or 20ft) puppets, caricatures of Hitler and Benito Mussolini, were successfully displayed in public places in Warsaw. Some artists recorded life and death in occupied Poland; despite German bans on Poles using cameras, photographs and even films were taken. Although {{it was impossible to}} operate an <b>underground</b> radio station, <b>underground</b> auditions were recorded and introduced into German radios or loudspeaker systems. <b>Underground</b> postage stamps were designed and issued. Since the Germans also banned Polish sport activities, <b>underground</b> sport clubs were created; <b>underground</b> football matches and even tournaments were organized in Warsaw, Kraków and Poznań, although these were usually dispersed by the Germans. All of these activities were supported by the <b>Underground</b> State's Department of Culture.|$|E

In 1933, the C {{and the rest of the}} <b>Underground</b> Group was taken into public ownership. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.|$|E
