50|$|Fets y Cybydd, or the Miser’s Feast, was a {{very popular}} dish in Carmarthenshire 100 years ago. It was made in a saucepan, but can also be made in a casserole. The bottom of the dish is covered in peeled potatoes, and a sliced onion, with a little salt, covered with water and then brought to the boil. When the water is boiling, a few slices of bacon or apiece of ham are placed on top. The lid is {{replaced}} and the whole simmered <b>until</b> the <b>potatoes</b> <b>are</b> cooked, and the water absorbed. The miser was supposed to eat the potatoes one day, mashed up in the liquid, keeping the slices of bacon to be eaten {{the next day with}} plain boiled potatoes.|$|R
50|$|Crofting {{communities}} {{became more}} common {{in the early part of}} the 19th century. Particularly in the West Highlands and the Isles, the residents of these small agricultural plots <b>were</b> reliant on <b>potatoes</b> for at least 3 quarters of their diet. <b>Until</b> 1750, <b>potatoes</b> had <b>been</b> relatively uncommon in the Highlands. With a crop yield 4 times higher than oats, they became an integral part of crofting. After partial crop failures in 1836 and 1837, a severe outbreak of potato blight arrived in Scotland in 1846. By the end of the year, the north-west Highlands and the Hebrides had serious food shortages, with an estimated three quarters of the population with nothing to eat.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the eastern}} coast, which is characterised by the plain of Serra do Topo (800 m above sea level) and almost {{constantly}} covered in thick fog, {{made it difficult}} to cultivate cereal crops. This was usually confined to a narrow platform that circuited the village of Topo and the lower portion of Santo Antão. These were ideal conditions, with their ravines and rugged valleys, that allowed the cultivation of taro, which assumed a dominant part of the local agriculture and economy. The taro was usually cultivated along the margins of the fields that were seeded with cereal crops and provided a guaranteed source of proteins for local settlers, <b>until</b> the <b>potato</b> <b>was</b> introduced later in the century. The plant occupied areas with abundant sources of water and could tolerate areas of shade, and were therefore ideal in the fajãs, ravines and valleys, taking advantage of access to water and waterfalls. On São Jorge, in particular, the coastal debris fields (the fajãs) were ideal along the southern coast of the island. Today, there still exist some plants in these zones and especially in those areas that have since been abandoned by human settlement, but yet wild plants have survived.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} aims for using genetic {{modification}} when developing LBR <b>potato</b> varieties <b>is</b> to achieve resistance that is lasting over time [10]. Novel molecular technologies have advanced researchers' ability to identify and characterize genes that provide late blight resistance and transfer these genes from wild potato species to commercial ones [13]. Still, several questions remain about the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed resistance of potato plants [60 – 62]. Similarly, {{more research is needed}} to advance the understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of virulence and adaptability in the P. infestans population [63]. Further research of these knowledge gaps is crucial in the search for ways to achieve durable LBR potato varieties. Still, these uncertainties are seldom acknowledged and openly discussed in public, as for instance illustrated with the lack of attention that these issue are given in a recent report written by leading European researchers involved in the development of cisgenic LBR potato [64]. Rather, the message conveyed by researcher working in this field <b>is</b> that GM <b>potato</b> will significantly contribute to a more sustainable potato production by providing the potato plant with a defence system that lasts over time [10, 20, 64 – 67]. They argue that this approach makes it easier for researchers to introduce several R genes into the same <b>potato</b> variety, which <b>is</b> expected to tip the ‘evolutionary’ balance in favour of the potato plant and against P. infestans, as it will be more difficult and time consuming for P. infestans to overcome multiple defence mechanisms at once. When this approach is presented to public, it is however largely under communicated that the durability of the cisgenic LBR GM <b>potato</b> can only <b>be</b> assessed in retrospect, meaning that it is problematic to predict how long the resistance will last <b>until</b> the <b>potato</b> <b>is</b> put in large-scale production and cultivated over time.|$|R
