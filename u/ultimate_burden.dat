40|$|There {{has been}} a wealth of recent work {{deriving}} optimal monetary policy utilising New Neo-Classical Synthesis (NNCS) models based on nominal inertia. Such models typically abstract from the impact of monetary policy on the government’s finances, by assuming that consumers are infinitely-lived and taxes are lump-sum such that Ricardian Equivalence holds. In this paper, {{in the context of}} a sticky-price NNCS model, we assume that the government must adjust spending and/or distortionary taxation to satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint. We then consider optimal monetary and fiscal policies under discretion and commitment in the face of technology, preference and cost-push shocks. We find that the optimal precommitment policy implies a random walk in the steady-state level of debt, generalising earlier results that involved only a single fiscal instrument. In the case of negative fiscal shocks this implies permanently higher taxation and lower output and government spending to support the new steady-state debt stock, but the optimal combination of these variables will ensure a zero rate of inflation under commitment. We also find that the time-inconsistency in the optimal precommitment policy is such that governments are tempted, given inflationary expectations, to raise taxation to reduce the <b>ultimate</b> debt <b>burden</b> they need to service. Since taxation is a distortionary labour income tax, this aggressive raising of taxation raises firms’ marginal costs and fuels inflation. We show that this temptation is only eliminated if following shocks, the new steady-state debt is equal to the original, first-best, debt level. This implies that under discretionary policy the random walk result is overturned: debt will always be returned to this initial steady-state even although there is no explicit debt target in the government’s objective function.

Chronic HCV infection may {{in the long run}} cause cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma, with an <b>ultimate</b> disease <b>burden</b> of at least 350, 000 deaths per year worldwide. The new generation of highly effective direct acting antivirals (DAA) to treat HCV infection brings major promises to infected patients in terms of exceedingly high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) but also of tolerability, allowing even the sickest patients to be treated. Even {{in the face of the}} excellent safety and efficacy and wide theoretical applicability of these regimens, their introduction is currently facing cost and access issues denying their use to many patients in need. Health systems in all countries are facing a huge problem of distributive justice, since while they should guarantee individual rights, among which the right to health in its broader sense, therefore not limited to healing, but extended to quality of life, they must also grant equal access to the healthcare resources and keep the distribution system sustainable. In the face of a disease with a relatively unpredictable course, where many but not of all chronically infected will eventually die of liver disease, selective allocation of this costly resource is debatable. In most countries the favorite solution has been a stratification of patients for prioritization of treatment, which means allowing Interferon-free DAA treatment only in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, while keeping on hold persons with lesser stages of liver disease. In this report, we will perform an ethical assessment addressing the issues linked to access to new therapies, prioritization and eligibility criteria, analyzing the meaning of the term "distributive justice" and the different approaches that can guide us (individualistic libertarianism, social utilitarianism and egalitarianism) on this specific matter. Even if over time the price of new DAA will be reduced through competition and eventual patent expiration, the phenomenon of high drug costs will go on in the next decades and we need adequate tools to face the problems of distributive justice that come with it...|$|R
40|$|Introduction] The {{concept of}} 'residential premises' is {{important}} in relation to Goods and Services Tax ('GST') liability because it {{plays a key role}} in determining whether property usage and transfers — the latter being a particularly significant element of modern capitalist economies — will be GSTfree, input taxed or fully taxable. Recent cases have raised a number of interesting issues in relation to 'residential premises' under the GST legislation. Some of these issues have been resolved satisfactorily by court decisions, others have been 'resolved' in rather puzzling ways, while some remain unresolved. It is useful to begin the discussion of GST treatment of residential premises with an overview of the relevant provisions. Underpinning the GST treatment of residential premises is the principle that persons selling or leasing real property should be treated in a comparable way to owner-occupiers. To achieve this outcome, where other requirements are satisfied: * in general, supplies of residential premises by lease, hiring, licence or sale are input taxed under Subdivisions 40 -B and 40 -C 5 (which are generally in similar terms); that is, the supply of the items is not taxed, but the supplier cannot claim input tax credits incurred in the supply; * however, the supply of residential premises is only input taxed to the extent that the premises are to be used predominantly for residential accommodation — regardless of the length of occupation; * the supply of new residential premises or commercial residential premises is an exception to the above rules and is not input taxed, but is subject to full GST taxation. The interplay of these factors creates an interesting but complex picture — particularly as the Courts have consistently indicated that the GST is a practical, business tax; that it is to be interpreted in a way that gives it a real-world effect; and that Division 165 gives the Commissioner wide powers to attack over-zealous tax planning arrangements. The effect of these GST provisions can be represented diagrammatically by a flowchart, as shown in Figure 1. The impact of the provisions affecting residential property was outlined by Perram J in Sunchen Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation, who referred to the GST Act’s 'confusing terminology' before noting that it relieves certain supplies from the GST in two ways. Firstly, certain supplies are made 'GST-free', and no GST is collected by the revenue. While the suppliers are not obliged to collect GST from the consumer, they are still entitled to claim input tax credits on supplies leading to that supply. As Perram J noted: The practical consequence of the tax not being collected from the consumer and the supplier being entitled to claim an input tax credit is that none of the inputs into the ultimate supply are taxed — GST is not collected from the ultimate consumer and each intermediate supplier obtains input tax credits which neutralise their own liability to GST. Secondly, certain supplies are 'input taxed'. In these cases, the supply is not subject to GST, but the supplier cannot claim an input tax credit for supplies made to it which were inputs into the supply to the consumer: The practical effect of this is to cast the <b>ultimate</b> economic <b>burden</b> of the tax not on the end user but on the immediately preceding supplier. The practical effect of denying an input tax credit to the supplier [such as the owner of land who sells it, or a landlord who grants a residential lease to a tenant] on supplies which are inputs into the premises is to render those supplies subject to GST in the hands of the supplier. Put another way, the inputs into the supply of the premises are taxed which gives rise, no doubt, to the otherwise rather obscure expression 'input taxed'...|$|R
40|$|Two years ago, in University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, the Supreme Court {{decided that}} a {{plaintiff}} in a Title VII retaliation case must prove but-for causation between his protected conduct and a defendant’s decision to take an adverse employment action against him. Although the Court was focusing only on the plaintiff’s <b>ultimate</b> <b>burden</b> of proof, several courts have interpreted Nassar’s pro-employer outcome as raising the burden plaintiffs must meet when attempting to establish a prima facie case. These courts are no longer accepting close temporal proximity between a plaintiff’s protected activity and the employer’s adverse employment action as being sufficient to establish the causal connection element of the plaintiff’s prima facie case. As a result, plaintiffs in several jurisdictions are finding {{it more difficult to}} establish their prima facie cases and are therefore losing at summary judgment. In this Article, I argue that although Nassar raised the <b>ultimate</b> <b>burden</b> for a plaintiff bringing Title VII retaliation claims, courts that are applying Nassar to the prima facie case stage are applying Nassar incorrectly. There are four reasons these courts should not be raising the burden on a Title VII retaliation plaintiff as he is attempting to establish a prima facie case. First, the Supreme Court and all federal courts have consistently stated that establishing a prima facie case should not be a difficult task, and applying Nassar to conclude that close temporal proximity is not sufficient to establish the causal connection element of the prima facie case contradicts that directive. Second, despite what several courts believe, Nassar did not address a plaintiff’s burden at the prima facie case stage; it simply addressed a plaintiff’s <b>ultimate</b> <b>burden</b> of proving but-for causation. Third, raising the burden on a plaintiff at the prima facie case stage will allow employers to avoid scrutiny of their alleged reasons for the adverse employment actions, and it is when employers are forced to provide those reasons that employers’ true motives are often discovered. And finally, any concern that not raising the burden at the prima facie case stage will result in frivolous EEOC charges and/or complaints in federal court is unwarranted. It is for these reasons that courts should not be using Nassar to raise a plaintiff’s burden at the prima facie case stage, but rather they should be using Nassar only for evaluating whether a plaintiff has met his <b>ultimate</b> <b>burden</b> of proving but-for causation...|$|E

40|$|Lifestyle {{intervention}} programmes are efficacious in {{the management}} of obesity but often report poor attendance and adherence rates that hinder treatment effectiveness and health outcomes. The aim of this systematic review is to identify (i) barriers to behaviour change and (ii) predictors of adherence to lifestyle intervention programmes in adults with obesity. Studies were identified by systematically reviewing the literature within Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science from inception to August 2016. Barriers to behaviour change include poor motivation; environmental, societal and social pressures; lack of time; health and physical limitations; negative thoughts/moods; socioeconomic constraints; gaps in knowledge/awareness; and lack of enjoyment of exercise. The most prominent predictors of adherence include early weight loss success, lower baseline body mass index (BMI), better baseline mood, being male and older age. The findings within this review provide novel insight to clinicians working in obesity and have important implications for lifestyle intervention programme design. Barriers to behaviour change need to be addressed early in treatment, with lifestyle intervention individualized accordingly. Predictors of adherence should also be taken into careful consideration, with negative moods and unrealistic weight loss expectations discussed at the outset. If adherence is improved, treatment effectiveness, health outcomes and the <b>ultimate</b> <b>burden</b> of chronic diseases could also be improved...|$|E

An understanding of the distribution of the burden of the existing property tax and the effects of changing the level of taxation is vital in evaluating possible policy alternatives, such as the full or partial replacement of local property taxes which finance schools with an increase in the state income tax. Obviously such choices involve many other considerations in addition to the incidence of the various taxes, yet incidence questions are of crucial importance and the focus of much public debate. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potentials}} for and limitations {{to the use}} of impact fees to finance urban transport infrastructure in developing country cities, drawing from the specific case of Santiago de Chile. The paper first assesses the current state of urban transport infrastructure financing and some of the inherent complications. The paper then overviews the growth of impact fee use as an infrastructure-financing tool in the United States and presents principles for their “appropriate ” use, based on the U. S. experience. The paper then summarizes the nascent use of transport impact fees in Santiago, where they are currently being used to help finance transport infrastructure demands resulting from rapid suburbanization there. After providing a background to the current urban transportation infrastructure finance system in Chile, the paper assesses the use of impact fees in Santiago, based on the principles of use developed in the U. S. Based on this preliminary assessment, the paper recommends that, if transport impact fees are to be used effectively in Chile then proper over-arching legal guidance for their use must be established, a uniform approach to their application should be employed, the relationship of impact fees to other user fees and other forms of development exactions must be clarified, the question of who actually bears the <b>ultimate</b> <b>burden</b> of impact fee costs should be answered, and, finally, the effects of transport impact fees on other public policy goals should be more clearly understood.
