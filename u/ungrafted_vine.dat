In the first experiment, rootstock affected vegetative growth, chlorophyll content, yield, cluster weight and berry weight in both years, gas exchange measurements in 2000, and fruit composition in 2001. Of the V. riparia x V. rupestris rootstocks, 3309 C and Schwarzmann imparted low to moderate vigor, as reflected by pruning weight. 101 - 14 Mgt imparted higher vigor to Pinot noir than 3309 C. Based on ripening index values (soluble solids/titratable acidity, Brix/TA), ripening appeared to be earlier for vines grafted to 101 - 14 Mgt and Schwarzmann than for 3309 C. The V. berfandieri x V. riparia rootstocks, including 161 - 49 C and 420 A, imparted average to higher than average vigor. Ripening appeared to be later than average and berries larger than average for vines grafted to these rootstocks. With the exception of 110 R, the V. berlandieri x V. rupestris rootstocks had higher than average vigor. Ripening times seemed to be average and berry weights were higher than average for vines grafted to these rootstocks. Of the remaining-rootstocks 1616 C performed much like the V. berlandieri x V. rupestris rootstocks with an even higher ripening index. Borner, Riparia Gloire, 44 - 53 Malegue and Gravesac all imparted low to moderate vigor. Berry weights tended to be average to lower than average. Riparia Gloire and Gravesac seemed to impart earlier ripening, while Borner and 44 - 53 Malegue did not. In the second experiment, the V. berlandieri x V. riparia rootstocks imparted more vigor, a higher yield, a higher berry weight and delayed ripening as reflected by the ripening index. 101 - 14 Mgt imparted a higher pruning weight, lower berry weight and earlier ripening than 3309 C. 110 R, 44 - 53 Malegue and Gravesac conferred moderate vigor as reflected by pruning weight. Riparia Gloire conferred lower vigor. Ripening times imparted by these rootstocks ranged from early for Riparia Gloire and Gravesac, to average for 110 R and later for 44 - 53 Malegue. Berry weights were average for scion grafted to 110 R and Gravesac, and low for scion grafted to Riparia Gloire and 44 - 53 Malegue...|$|E

5000|$|Though not {{claiming}} to have invented it, Liem was in 2008 commended by Eric Asimov for discovering the word [...] "gob-less" [...] as a term for wines of grace, balance and finesse, {{in response to the}} trend among wine critics such as Robert Parker who frequently apply the word [...] "gobs" [...] to describe wines of overwhelming power and fruity sweetness. Similarly in 2009, Asimov expressed appreciation of a Liem column comparing wines made from <b>ungrafted</b> <b>vines</b> with cheese made from unpasteurized milk.|$|R
40|$|The grape {{production}} and grape and wine quality of Shiraz vines, grown either {{on their own}} roots or on 6 rootstocks that have varying resistance to nematodes, were compared. Vines on the rootstocks Ramsey and Dog Ridge out-yielded <b>ungrafted</b> <b>vines</b> by 46 and 4 S 0 /o, respectively, principally because of increased vegetative growth and hence retention of more nodes at pruning. Ramsey rootstock gave a greater grape yield per shoot. The ability of Dog Ridge stocks to produce yields as high as those of Ramsey {{highlights the importance of}} adequate pruning levels to enable the full potential of rootstocks to be determined. Vines on the rootstock Dog Ridge produced wines with higher pH values than wines from <b>ungrafted</b> control <b>vines.</b> Nematode counts suggested that the Vitus champini stocks have good tolerance to both rootknot and root lesion nematodes...|$|R

50|$|Many have {{suggested}} that this failure was predictable, as one parent of AxR1 {{is in fact a}} susceptible V. vinifera cultivar. But the transmission of phylloxera tolerance is more complex, as is demonstrated by the continued success of 41B, an F1 hybrid of Vitis berlandieri and Vitis vinifera. The full story of the planting of AxR1 in California, its recommendation, the warnings, financial consequences, and subsequent recriminations remains to be told. Modern phylloxera infestation also occurs when wineries are in need of fruit immediately, and choose to plant <b>ungrafted</b> <b>vines</b> rather than wait for grafted vines to be available.|$|R

5000|$|Vieille Vignes Françaises (vintage): Regarded as Bollinger's {{prestige}} cuvee, this blanc de noirs is made {{in small}} quantity with wine from two small plots of ungrafted rootstock planted in low density (3000 vines per hectare). The English wine writer Cyril Ray suggested {{the idea of using}} the <b>ungrafted</b> <b>vines</b> to produce a separate wine to Madame Bollinger in the 1960s. The first vintage was 1969. The total area of vines used for this rare Champagne is less than half a hectare. Vieille Vignes refers to how the vines are trained rather than the age of the rootstock. The low-density vineyards, Clos St-Jacques in Aÿ and Chaudes Terres in Aÿ, are severely pruned, and thus produce 35% less juice per vine, creating a [...] "super rich wine." [...] In 2005, phylloxera destroyed the third vineyard used for this wine, Croix Rouge in Bouzy. Bottles are numbered and the annual production of the ungrafted plots has varied between 3000 and 5000 bottles.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Figure 2. 5 (p. 41) is missing. A {{rootstock}} {{trial was}} established in 1997 at the OSU Woodhall vineyard, located in the Southern Willamette Valley, which included two experiments. The first experiment was a factorial of four varieties grafted on to 9 rootstocks, and also as <b>ungrafted</b> <b>vines</b> (a split-plot design). The second experiment was a randomized complete block design of Pinot noir on 19 rootstocks, and <b>ungrafted</b> <b>vines.</b> Evaluation of these experiments was conducted {{in order to assess}} rootstock impact on vine physiological performance, and fruit and wine composition, between 2002 and 2005. While there were changes in gas-exchange and the hydraulic properties of the scion in response to the different rootstocks, these changes were not directly linked to vine size. Some rootstocks could not cope with the large water demand that their larger canopies required, while other rootstocks appeared to have reduced canopy size as a strategy of drought avoidance. Evidence also indicated that Vitis rootstocks can induce changes to the scion stomatal behavior under drought conditions. The vegetative growth potential of the rootstock appeared to interact with the scion, affecting the hydraulic properties and water status of the vines, as well as fruit composition. Sugars levels across all rootstocks were very similar, provided that rootstocks achieved an adequate leaf area to fruit ratio, suggesting that rootstock growing cycles are not necessarily different. Juice titratable acidity (TA) increased with vegetative growth. Skin tannin (proanthocyanidin) concentration was independent of the vigor imposed by the different rootstocks. Skin proanthocyanidin (mg/berry) was highest for 125 AA, 1616 C, and 420 A, while 161 - 49 C, Schwarzmann, 3309 C and Riparia Gloire had the lowest tannin content. Rootstocks SO 4, 8 B, 420 A, and 140 Ru had higher levels of anthocyanins. Differences in berry weight were not related to the concentration of skin tannin or total anthocyanin (mg/kg fruit) found. In order to produce wine lots from the different rootstocks, a micro-scale fermentation technique was developed. Based upon chemical and spectral analyses, this technique approximated the results obtained with a commercial red wine fermentation. In 2005, Pinot noir wines were made from all rootstocks. The wine phenolic profile did not entirely reflect fruit composition, since extraction of skin components into wine varied greatly with the rootstock. These results suggest that there was a direct effect of the rootstock on fruit and wine chemistry, rather than a consequence of differences in crop size, vine vigor or berry weight...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} focused on the {{viticulture}} of the island of Lampedusa, located in the strait of Sicily 113 km from the African coast and 205 km from the Sicilian coasts. It is a study that has no previous recorded documentations. The research was conducted on the island to a various number of vineyard farmers in order to describe cultivation techniques and the grape germplasm utilized. Viticulture is present on several tens of hectares but in recent years is vanishing quickly and currently survives thanks to a small number of old farmers who still practice agriculture. Moreover, the strong competition for land use strongly linked to tourism, makes the survival of farming in general even more precarious. <b>Ungrafted</b> <b>vines</b> were cultivated in a difficult environment because of severe drought and within valleys that typically characterize the island and plants are usually protected by stone walls that divide the parcels. The product was typically grown for wine but also for the production of fresh and sun-dried grape or preserved in alcohol. The trades made by the inhabitants of Lampedusa, who were fishermen and farmers, with other Mediterranean areas such as Tunisia, Malta, and Southern Italy promoted the introduction of new grape germplasm. In fact, several cultivar names of grape lead us to suspect that grape germplasm might be introduced in Lampedusa from Italy and Tunisia. Because of the small size of farmland and their fragmentation, agriculture can not be supported by the European Community. However, special systems of assistance should be considered {{in order to maintain the}} conservation of viticulture in the island...|$|R
50|$|Like many Vitis vinifera varieties, plantings of Bouchalès were {{decimated}} {{during the}} phylloxera epidemic {{of the late}} 19th century. The fact that Bouchalès experienced difficulties in taking the grafting of American rootstock (like Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris) also contributed to its decline. However, in 2009 a Libournais vineyard belonging to Château de la Vieille Chapelle was discovered to contain <b>ungrafted</b> Bouchalès <b>vines</b> over 100 years old. Wine expert Jancis Robinson and others have speculated that these vines survived the phylloxera epidemic due to the frequent winter flood irrigation of the vineyards that was a tradition of Libournais viticulture for many centuries. This flooding with waters from the nearby Dordogne River would disrupt {{the life cycle of}} the phylloxera louse by inhibiting its growth during its nymph stage.|$|R
5000|$|Colares is a Portuguese wine region {{centered}} on the Colares municipality in Estremadura region. The region has Portugal's highest wine classification as a Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC). Located along the southwestern Atlantic coast, vineyards {{in the area are}} protected from the strong ocean winds by sandy dunes. In 1940s, vineyards covered 2,500 acres but have since been reduced by suburbanization to 50 acres. [...] Between 1934 and 1994, only the local co-op could use the Colares appellation. Because grapevines there are grown directly upon the sand, and phylloxera aphids cannot live on sand, Colares vineyards are some of the only European vines that are not grafted upon American rootstocks. The <b>ungrafted</b> Ramisco <b>vines</b> of the Colares region are some of the oldest in Portugal. The region is known for its deep colored, full bodied red wines that are high in astringent tannins.|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIPlant-parasitic {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} important group of root pathogens affecting vineyards for fresh fruit and wine production in Chile. Due to the low efficacy of presently available nematicides and their high variability of control, new alternatives were evaluated in order to obtain a faster and more reliable control. The aim of this work was to assess the use of the soil fumigant Cordon (R), containing 81. 4 % of 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) plus emulsifiers that allow 1, 3 -D to be mixed with water and applied at low rate via drip irrigation systems over established vines for the control of Xiphinema index, the main nematode species associated with grapevine injury in the country. During the first year of studies, one trial was performed in a group of <b>ungrafted</b> <b>vines</b> cv Chardonnay, applying the treatments twice, one in autumn, and the second one in the next spring, with three Cordon (R) concentrations, 100, 200 and 400 ppm, equivalent to 3. 7, 7. 4 and 14. 8 L ha(- 1) according to the irrigation system water flow. A second trial was performed the following year to determine limits of crop safety by applying 200, 400 and 800 ppm, equivalent to 12, 24 and 48 L ha(- 1) in two established vineyards, cv Thompson Seedless and Cabernet Sauvignon. Results showed that 200 ppm, equivalent to 7. 4 or 12 L ha(- 1) depending of the field, achieved good results considering efficacy and phytotoxicity, with a 93. 2 % control and no crop damage. Two non-fumigant nematicides, Nemacur (R) 240 CS (24 % Fenamiphos) and Rugby (R) 200 CS (20 % Cadusaphos), used as chemical controls, did not show differences in X index populations when compared to the untreated plants. At rates over 400 ppm of 1, 3 -D, although no visible foliar injury was observed, the pruning weight of treated plants was reduced, indicating a growth reduction.

25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their <b>vines</b> <b>ungrafted</b> on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Winegrape growing is {{extremely}} dependent upon site-specific variables. To {{better understand the}} effect of rootstock-scion interaction in a cool climate region, an experimental vineyard was planted in 1997 at the Oregon State University Woodhall III property in the southern Willamette Valley. The first experiment consists of Pinot noir (clone FPMS 2 A) grafted to 19 rootstocks and an own-rooted control. Two years of growth responses and one year's harvest data were analyzed. Rootstocks affected shoot length and shoot diameter, leaf gas exchange rates, leaf chlorophyll contents, cluster size and yield components, soluble solids, pH and titratable acidity. Treatments with long, thick shoots and heavy pruning weights tended to have high chlorophyll contents, with two exceptions. The Pinot noir own-rooted control and Riparia Gloire-Pinot noir vines had elevated chlorophyll levels but shorter shoots and had smaller shoot diameters. Pinot noir grafted to 1103 Paulsen, 99 Richter, 110 Richter and 140 Ruggeri set fewer berries per cluster. 1103 Paulsen, 99 Richter, 110 Richter rootstocks effected scion fruitfulness by lowering cluster weights. 125 AA Kober and 1103 Paulsen had the lowest levels of soluble solids but the highest pruning weights, indicating a lack of fruit-to-canopy balance. Establishment rate was highest for <b>ungrafted</b> Pinot noir <b>vines</b> and Pinot noir on 3309 Couderc, 4453 Malegue, 8 B Teleki, Selection Oppenheim 4, 161 - 49 Couderc, and 420 A Millardet et de Grasset and the slowest for 110 Richter, 99 Richter, and 1103 Paulsen. The second experiment consists of a 4 x 9 factorial trial. Four V. vinifera scions on 9 rootstocks were planted and, as in the first experiment, physiological responses and harvest data were analyzed. Responses of the interactions of rootstock-scion were analyzed and affinity of scion to rootstock was observed. Pinot noir grafted to 110 Richter showed low leaf chlorophyll contents. Rootstock-scion interactions were observed in shoot length and diameter. V. riparia x V. berlandieri crosses grew longer shoots of larger diameter. 3309 Couderc, Riparia Gloire and 4453 Malegue yielded smaller vines regardless of scion choice. The counts of berries per cluster were different among treatments. Affinity of scion to rootstock effected soluble solid content, pH and TA of musts, although further study into vineyard maturation is needed...|$|R
