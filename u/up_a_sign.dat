A mix of feelings took place between the protesters, some burning a picture of the Minister of the Interior and stepping on it while another held <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> to dismiss him. There's even a short video on YouTube asking a young girl who the daughter of the prisoner why she's there at the protest.

He marries every gay couple in town, and then puts <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> saying [...] "Will marry anyone to anything." [...] While debating the issue with Lovejoy on the television show Smartline, Homer makes a case for gay marriage and mockingly joins the Bible and Lovejoy in matrimony—adding that Lovejoy is the wife and that he owes Homer $200.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the capture}} of Lord, the {{remaining}} prisoners agreed that 25 April would be {{the final day of}} the protest. Prison officers entered the prison early in the morning and gradually began to occupy the upper landings. At 10:20 am one of the remaining prisoners, a seventeen-year-old on remand for joyriding, was captured leaving five prisoners remaining on the roof. When prison officers reached the roof they put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> similar to the ones used by prisoners throughout the protest, which read [...] "HMP in charge—no visits". At 6:20 pm the remaining five prisoners were removed from the roof in a [...] "cherry picker" [...] hydraulic platform, giving clenched fist salutes to the press and public as they descended. During the course of the 25-day riot, the longest in British penal history, 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners had been injured.|$|E

500|$|Briarcliff Manor's {{original}} {{settlement was}} known as Whitson's Corners for brothers John H., Richard, and Reuben Whitson, who owned adjoining farms in the area totaling [...] Whitson's Corners was named after the corner of Pleasantville and South State Roads, where John H. Whitson's house, the Crossways, stood from 1820 until the 1940s. The Briarcliff Congregational Church's parish house currently stands at its former location. The neighboring community of Scarborough {{was known as}} Weskora until it was renamed in 1864, after resident William Kemey's ancestral hometown in Yorkshire. After the community was incorporated into Briarcliff Manor in 1906, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> reading [...] "Briarcliff West" [...] at the village's Scarborough station.

500|$|Some protesters {{moved from}} Tahrir Square {{to the area}} outside the {{parliament}} buildings, while demanding the assembly's immediate dissolution. The demonstrators put <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that said: [...] "Closed until {{the fall of the}} regime". Cabinet offices in Cairo were evacuated after anti-government protesters gathered outside the building. Meanwhile, labour unions across the country, and particularly in Alexandria, Cairo and Suez, staged general strikes, demanding higher wages and better treatment. The strikers were said to number around 20,000 workers. Violent clashes were reported in Wadi al-Jadid, where police stations and the NDP party building were destroyed, and several deaths and hundreds of injuries also occurred. Protesters in Port Said burnt down the governor's office in response to his reluctance to provide enough housing for the city's residents. Clashes were said to have killed three people and wounded hundreds more in the past two days.|$|E

It {{is set in a}} warehouse in New York City that is used for people who are taking part in an audition. It begins with a yellow taxi driving on a New York City road with apartment complexes. As the song begins, Buena sings her verse while looking into a mirror, and other people in the warehouse begin to hold up signs of the song's lyrics. During the chorus, they begin to showcase their talents such as dancing and juggling. Buchanan's chorus features her sitting on a staircase; during this part, a child holds <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> reading [...] "short" [...] while a woman carries a sign saying [...] "loneliness". As Range sings the bridge, she is leaning on a wall in the warehouse while more people begin dancing. When Sugababes sing the chorus again, they dance with the people who also begin to show other talents, including instrumentation and magic tricks. As the video ends, a row of people hold up signs containing one word from the song's lyrics, [...] "people are all the same".|$|E

Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 26, the Erie Railroad sent a {{statement}} out from Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey to disregard the order from the previous day. The new sign came down instantly and the conductors continued to call the station Turner once again. Old time locals felt the name Turner had more value to them and shouldn't be touched. A self-appointed committee run by the priest proposed a meeting on Saturday, June 4, 1910 at nearby Gillette Hall to protest the name change. The priest also offered that if the name was to remain Turner's, he would contribute $500 towards {{the construction of a}} new station. The post office also said they would remain named Turner even if the signage on the Erie Railroad station went back to the Harriman name. Sometime during the night between June 1 and June 2, the Erie Railroad took the station depot sign for Turner down once again and re-attached the Harriman sign to the station depot. Local resolutions were sent to the Erie showing citizens' displeasure at changing the signage once again. The order from the Erie stated that beginning on July 15, the station name would remain [...] "Harriman" [...] permanently. Father McAran returned to his outrage and continued to go to the press and give interviews on the issue at hand. To wrap the issue <b>up,</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> in the front of the local church proclaiming [...] "LONG LIVE TURNER" [...] was destroyed. This hurt the enthusiasm of locals, who suggested renaming the local Arden station near the Harriman estate instead.|$|E
500|$|Controversy began {{before the}} 1995 season when the Jets drafted Kyle Brady over Warren Sapp. At {{the press conference}} announcing Kotite's hiring, Hess told the media, [...] "I'm 80 years old, I want results now." [...] However, {{the first game of}} the Kotite era proved to be a harbinger – a 52-14 loss to the Dolphins. [...] A month later, they lost to the Oakland Raiders 47-10 in the Jets' sole {{national}} television appearance of the season. [...] The Jets defeated the Seattle Seahawks on the Sunday following Thanksgiving after an inspirational speech by Hess, but again had trouble in December, losing all four games in the month to finish 3–13. In 1996, the Jets brought in veteran quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who had just led Pittsburgh to Super Bowl XXX, to lead the offense. The Jets, for the first time since the leagues merged, were in possession of the first pick overall in the NFL Draft, which they used to select wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. O'Donnell proved injury-prone, and the Jets suffered the worst season in franchise history. They lost their first eight games, beat the Arizona Cardinals in Tempe, then proceeded to lose their remaining seven games. Two days before the season finale, on December 20, 1996, Kotite announced his resignation effective at season's end. After the last game, a 31–28 home loss to the Dolphins, Kotite was hit with a full cup of beer as he left the field; another fan (fewer than 22,000 attended the game; almost 56,000 ticketholders stayed home) held <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign,</b> [...] "The End of an Error".|$|E

As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to {{communicate}} by holding up signs through their bedroom windows. Till closes his curtains, and Swift holds <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> saying, [...] "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance {{in front of a}} mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times. Afterward, Swift is sitting in a bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two converse. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, the antagonist, kisses him and gives a hostile look towards the protagonist. Suddenly, she is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate, resulting in a heated argument which results in their breakup. Meanwhile, Swift, the protagonist stares in amazement. Back in their bedroom windows, they again communicate through signs, Till asked Swift, the protagonist, if she was attending prom and she responded, [...] "no, studying". Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves and changes her mind. Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift, the antagonist in a red dress, attempts to impede him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying [...] "I love you" [...] and kiss. To date, the video has over 770 million views on YouTube, making it the most viewed country song on YouTube.|$|E
