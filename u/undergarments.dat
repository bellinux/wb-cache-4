5|$|Playtex is an American {{brand name}} for <b>undergarments,</b> baby products, gloves, {{feminine}} products and sunscreen. The brand began in 1947, when International Latex Corporation (ILC) created a division named Playtex {{to produce and}} sell latex products. Playtex {{was the first to}} advertise <b>undergarments</b> on national television in 1955 and the first to show a woman wearing only a bra from the waist-up in a commercial in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In July, the Federal Bureau of Prisons {{rejected}} {{a request by}} the Army to transfer Manning from the USDB to a civilian facility for treatment of her gender dysphoria.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured <b>undergarments.</b> Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation <b>undergarments,</b> from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
25|$|The loincloth is the {{simplest}} form of underwear; {{it was probably}} the first <b>undergarment</b> worn by human beings. In warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an outer garment rather than an <b>undergarment),</b> as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments. In most ancient civilizations, this was the only <b>undergarment</b> available.|$|R

5|$|In {{their attempt}} to create a world where humans and Tayutai can peacefully coexist, Yuri and Mashiro battle the members of the Three Mightiest in a successive, {{nonlinear}} order determined by the player's decisions. In one scenario, Nue, a young female Tayutai, begins to steal <b>undergarments</b> from the Flawless dormitories due to her curiosity in them. She is defeated by Mashiro and Mifuyu Kisaragi, and finds herself befriended by Mifuyu, who later begins {{to take care of her}} as a guardian. Yumina Takanashi, Yuri's stepsister, also begins to take care of Hou, an exhausted bird Tayutai who begins to nest on Yumina's head. Yumina is later attacked by Ou, another Tayutai who makes up the Houou couple with Hou, before the couple reconciles with the help of Yuri and Mashiro.

5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her <b>undergarments.</b> When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's <b>undergarments</b> were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undergarments</b> are {{items of}} {{clothing}} worn beneath outer clothes, usually in {{direct contact with}} the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of <b>undergarments</b> have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as <b>undergarments,</b> while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as <b>undergarments</b> and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some <b>undergarments</b> can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal.|$|E

25|$|The onera (onnara) is a loincloth worn as an <b>undergarment</b> by {{conservative}} Nair women. The <b>undergarment</b> was noted as beautifying and slimming the waist.

25|$|Men {{are said}} to have worn loincloths in ancient Greece and Rome, though it is unclear whether Greek women wore <b>undergarments.</b> There is some {{speculation}} that only slaves wore loincloths and that citizens did not wear <b>undergarments</b> beneath their chitons. Mosaics of the Roman period indicate that women (primarily in an athletic context, whilst wearing nothing else) sometimes wore strophiae (breastcloths) or brassieres made of soft leather, along with subligacula which were either in the form of shorts or loincloths. Subligacula were also worn by men.|$|E
25|$|Dry suits with {{adequate}} thermal <b>undergarments</b> are standard environmental protection for ice diving, though {{in some cases}} thick wetsuits may suffice. Hoods, boots and gloves are also worn. Full-face masks can provide more protection for the divers' facial skin.|$|E
