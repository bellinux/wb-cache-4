5|$|In 1552 {{the fort}} was decommissioned, but was {{subsequently}} recommissioned by Mary I. In {{addition to the}} fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority all the way <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were clogged with dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Xscape match between Shocker, Michael Shane (who was {{accompanied}} Trinity), Sonjay Dutt, and Chris Sabin {{in the following}} bout. It lasted 15 minutes and 42 seconds. In this match, the four competitors fought until two were eliminated by pinfall or submission; the two remaining wrestlers then fought {{to escape from the}} cage, with the first to do so the winner. Dutt was the first wrestler eliminated after Shocker slammed him into the steel cage. After this elimination, Trinity climbed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cage and performed a backflip off the top onto the three wrestlers below. Traci then entered the arena and forced Trinity to the backstage area. The second eliminated was Shane, after Sabin forced him back-first into the mat with his signature maneuver the Cradle Shock. Sabin and Shocker remained as they both fought to escape the cage, which Shocker did first to win the contest.|$|E
5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway steps <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Barça's 2012–13 season {{yet again}} {{began with a}} Supercopa contention, this time another {{incarnation}} of El Clásico. Barcelona would win the first leg at home 3–2 with goals from Messi, Pedro and Xavi, but in the second leg, despite a wonderfully-struck free kick from Messi from 35 yards out, Barcelona would succumb 2–1 to their fiercest foes with goals from Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín. In La Liga, Barcelona would shoot straight <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the league table with a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad. In the most-hyped {{game of the season}} so far, Barcelona and Real Madrid would play out what many regard as the best Clásico in recent memory, ending in a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou with both Messi and Ronaldo netting twice for their respective clubs. Barça would also kick of their Copa del Rey defence with a 3–0 win over Alavés. In the Champions League on 7 November 2012, Barcelona would fall 2–1 to Celtic, with Messi grabbing his third Champions League goal of the 2012–13 season in the 90th minute in Glasgow. Barcelona were eliminated from Europe 0–7 on aggregate in the semi-finals against eventual champions Bayern Munich, the worst-ever aggregate loss in any European competition for the club.|$|E

Ronaldo scored his final league goal of the season from the penalty spot in the title decider against Wigan on 11 May, as United claimed a second successive Premier League title. His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot, as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.|$|E

Also later in the year at the start of autumn, Tori was released from the WWF entering September while Chyna left the WWF towards the end of November due to real-life issues between herself, Triple H, and Stephanie McMahon. Chyna's departure (who was the reigning Women's Champion) lead to the Women's Championship being vacant for the second time until Survivor Series. Also in the autumn of 2001, Trish Stratus was trained by Fit Finlay, who was the road agent responsible for the women's matches, and drastically improved her in-ring ability. She worked her way <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the division and eventually won the Women's Championship at Survivor Series.
