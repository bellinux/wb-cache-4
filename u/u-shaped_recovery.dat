This paper presents a new economic theory to explain {{the formation of a}} crisis and why a major crisis may {{take a long time to}} recover. It suggests that asymmetric psychological reaction of market players to gains and losses is the principal cause of a crisis and responsible for a prolonging recovery. Three different shapes of recovery, V, U and L, are defined and explained. During the current financial crisis, some countries such as China and India may have a V-shaped recovery, some countries such as the UK and the US may have a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>recovery.</b> An important policy implication is that effective macro-economic policies should be designed to smooth market movements and implementation of such policies has to be counter-cyclical rather than pro-cyclical...|$|E

Data for several modern Western nations including the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands suggest a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>recovery</b> in rate of entrepreneurship (as measured by business ownership) {{toward the end of the}} 20 th century. However, the timing, pattern and extent of this recovery vary substantially across nations. The reasons for this large variation in rate of entrepreneurship across time and by country are by no means straightforward. This paper provides a framework explaining the causes of the variation in rate of entrepreneurship across countries. The last part of the paper illustrates the framework with two historical case studies: the Dutch Golden Age of the 17 th century and Britainâ€™s First Industrial Revolution (1760 - 1830). The approach taken is eclectic, integrating various research streams in the social sciences. Policy implications are also proposed...|$|E
