40|$|A novel {{transportable}} electronic platform {{aiming to}} characterize the performance of successive fast vertical visually guided pointing movements toward two fixed targets (eCAM test: electronic counting arm movement test) is described and one validation test is presented. This platform {{is based on an}} Arduino H micro-controller and a Processing ® routine. It records both the pointing performance (number of clicks) and the elapsed time between two successive pointing movements. Using this novel platform, we studied the effects of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied on the dominant <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> in 15 healthy volunteers (mean age ± SD: 22. 3 ± 4. 3 years; 5 males/ 10 females). The following muscles were stimulated: flexor carpi radialis (FCR), extensor carpi radialis (ECR), biceps brachii (BB), and triceps brachii (TB). The intensities of the stimulation were 2 and 3 mA above the sensory threshold (ST). Movement times were lesser when performed against gravity and pointing performance improved with FES. We provide the first demonstration that low-intensity FES impacts on motor performances during successive vertical goaldirected pointing movements under visual guidance. The eCAM test is currently the sole electronic tool to assess quickly and easily the performances of successive vertical pointing movements. Future potential applications include, in particular, the follow-up of the effects of neurorehabilitation of neurological/ neurosurgical disorders associated with hand-eye incoordination, the functional evaluation of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prosthesis</b> or <b>orthosis,</b> and the analysis of the effects of FES in central or peripheral nervous system disorders.

English-language articles were identified in a search of Ovid, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science (1980 until February 2006) for key words <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> and <b>prosthesis.</b> Articles focused on <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> and addressing: (i) Factors associated with abandonment; (ii) Rejection rates; (iii) Functional analyses and patterns of wear; and (iv) Consumer satisfaction, were extracted with the exclusion of those detailing tools for outcome measurement, case studies, and medical procedures. Approximately 200 articles {{were included in the}} review process with 40 providing rates of prosthesis rejection. Quantitative measures of population characteristics, study methodology, and prostheses in use were extracted from each article. Mean rejection rates of 45 % and 35 % were observed in the literature for body-powered and electric prostheses respectively in pediatric populations. Significantly lower rates of rejection for both body-powered (26 %) and electric (23 %) devices were observed in adult populations while the average incidence of non-wear was similar for pediatric (16 %) and adult (20 %) populations. Documented rates of rejection exhibit a wide range of variance, possibly due to the heterogeneous samples involved and methodological differences between studies.

Objectives: The purpose of this review was to establish {{what is known about}} adult user’s perceptions of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> in terms of both cosmesis and function. A search of the literature between 1990 and 2010 identified over 600 possible citations; these were reduced to 15 citations based on selection criteria. Results: The main themes arising from the review were user satisfaction ratings with current prostheses, priorities for future design and the social implications of wearing a prosthetic limb. While users of cosmetic prostheses were mostly satisfied with their prostheses, satisfaction rates vary considerably across studies, due to variability in demographics of users and an ambiguity over the definitions of cosmesis and function. Design priorities also varied, though overall there is a slight trend toward prioritising function over cosmesis. The qualitative studies noted the importance users placed on presenting a ‘normal’ appearance and ‘not standing out’.

In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of <b>upper</b> <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria.

A proficient user {{must be able to}} plan/execute arm movements while activating the residual muscle(s), accounting for delays and unpredictability in prosthesis response. There is no validated, low cost measure of skill in performing such actions. Trial-trial variability of joint angle trajectories measured during functional task performance, linearly normalised by time, shows promise. However, linear normalisation of time introduces errors, and expensive camera systems are required for joint angle measurements. This study investigated whether trial-trial variability, assessed using dynamic time warping (DTW) of limb segment acceleration measured during functional task performance, is a valid measure of user skill. Temporal and amplitude variability of forearm accelerations were determined in 1) seven myoelectric prosthesis users and six anatomically-intact controls and 2) seven anatomically-intact subjects learning to use a prosthesis simulator over repeated sessions. 1 : temporal variability showed clear group differences (p< 0. 05). 2 : temporal variability considerably increased on first use of a prosthesis simulator, then declined with training (both p< 0. 05).

This certification was recognized {{by the government of}} Ukraine and the procedure was established by the government on how to reimburse the Ukrainian specialists for such prosthesis in Ukraine.The number of amputees who were being sent abroad to get such prostheses has decreased to 2 or 3 per year (as some of the cases are still too complex). 12 amputees received functional upper/lower <b>limb</b> <b>prostheses</b> and were taught how to effectively use them; 15 specialists were part of the hands-on training; more than 100 Ukrainian specialists attended one-day seminars on prosthetics and rehabilitation. During one of the visits of the Canadian prosthetists in between the mission, Canada-Ukraine International Assistance Fund has arranged formal certification and training of 4 more Ukrainian prosthetists (making it 7 altogether) in fitting myo-electric hand and now also partial hand (digits) prostheses {{for the first time in}} Ukraine.|$|R
