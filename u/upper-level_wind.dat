5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} {{weather in}} the central Atlantic managed to gain enough organization to be designated Tropical Depression Two on July 31. The depression moved across the Atlantic without strengthening due to high <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear, and dissipated near the Lesser Antilles on August 3.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression One {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} disturbance near the Lesser Antilles on July 29. The National Hurricane Center indicated {{the possibility of}} the depression strengthening into a tropical storm in media reports but <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear inhibited any development. The depression dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving {{in the same direction as}} the upper-level winds.|$|E

25|$|Initially a {{tropical}} depression, it headed westward without significant strengthening {{for four days}} due to unfavorable <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds.</b> While nearing the Lesser Antilles <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> decreased, allowing the depression to become Tropical Storm Hortense on September7. Hortense crossed Guadeloupe on September8 and entered the Caribbean Sea. By on the following day, it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward. Hortense made landfall in Puerto Rico on September9 and brushed the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter.|$|R
5|$|On September 18, Tropical Depression Eleven formed {{midway between}} Africa and the Lesser Antilles from a {{tropical}} wave. Ship and reconnaissance aircraft observations {{reported that the}} depression almost reached tropical storm strength. It was sheared by strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> until it dissipated on September 27. The system never affected land.|$|R
5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts particularly difficult. Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear. Low-level moisture wrapped around the circulation during this phase, mitigating {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from satellite image late on August21.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Barry {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance {{that left the}} Northwestern African coast on August 13. Most of the season, the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean had <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear, which had inhibited development of systems. Due to these conditions, the disturbance was unable to strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved the disturbance into an area of low wind shear, and the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression Four {{on the evening of}} August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern Bahamian Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, a {{tropical}} wave became discernible about 800miles (1300km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico, which in the next day developed a large area of convection, or thunderstorms. Initially, conditions were unfavorable for development, due to strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear. Tracking northwestward parallel to the Mexican coast, the system became better organized on August 22, though later that day its structure deteriorated. On August 23, a strong area of convection developed and persisted near a circulation center, despite strong wind shear. With banding features becoming more prominent, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven-E about 345miles (555km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5000|$|Very warm, humid, summertime air {{had pushed}} into central on {{southern}} Minnesota on August 6, 1969. Minneapolis saw a high temperature of 93 F with dew points near 70 F. [...] Meanwhile, strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> over northern Minnesota and an approaching cold front {{from the west}} added the needed ingredient for the strong storms.|$|R
50|$|Dr Rossby {{returned}} to Sweden {{after the war}} to found the International Institute of Meteorology, and invited Namias to Stockholm. He used his time there to investigate variations in upper airflow patterns. He and colleague Phil Clapp issued a 1949 paper describing asymmetric variations in the <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds,</b> and in 1950 he issued a notable study of the index cycle.|$|R
5|$|Katia tracked west-northwestward {{for several}} days, steered by an {{expansive}} mid-level ridge to the cyclone's north. The strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> that were affecting the cyclone gradually slackened, {{allowing for the}} expansion of a central dense overcast, the formation of a large curved band in the southern semicircle, and development of a banding eye on microwave imagery. Satellite intensity estimates increased accordingly, prompting the NHC to upgrade Katia to hurricane intensity at 00:00UTC on September1, while the storm was situated about 1,350miles (2,175km) east of the Leeward Islands. Although conditions were forecast to remain conducive for further intensification, water vapor satellite and microwave imagery indicated that mid-level dry air began eroding eyewall convection immediately after the storm's upgrade, and <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> eventually became less favorable as Katia approached a sharp upper-level trough. As a result, the storm maintained its status as a minimal hurricane for almost three days, with only a partial eyewall or banding-eye feature appearing on satellite.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Jeanne {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 7. Containing a scattered area of moderate convection, the wave tracked westward at 12–17mph (19–28km/h), located to the south of a large ridge. The system initially showed no signs of development, with unfavorably dry air persisting across the region. On September 11, convection became slightly better organized, and the next day broad cyclonic turning became evident. However, overall development was hindered by <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear from Hurricane Ivan in the Caribbean Sea, as well as from an upper-level low {{to the north of the}} wave.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Claudette {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August7. On August11, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the wave when it was located roughly 600mi (965km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity was associated with the westward moving wave; however, the NHC did not anticipate further development of the system. By the afternoon of August12, little convective activity remained with the wave. Strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear created an unfavorable environment for the system to re-organize as it tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was poorly organized, {{with much of}} the convection located well to the southeast of the broad center due to strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear. The shearing environment was caused by a trough in the Gulf of Mexico and from the outflow from Pacific Hurricane Celia. This was reflected in forecasts, with the National Hurricane Center predicting no significant change in intensity or structure. The depression moved northward before turning to the northeast, and on June 26 the poorly organized system made landfall just north of Tampa, Florida. The low-level circulation dissipated while crossing the Florida peninsula, with the remnants continuing northeastward before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone over the western Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of September 5, <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> which had {{affected}} the deep convection {{to the north of}} the depression's circulation centre began to weaken, allowing the convection to wrap around the north side of the system. Based on this, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Joel. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the storm to Tropical Storm 9422 early the next morning local time.|$|R
50|$|Launching {{a balloon}} {{requires}} the conjunction of light low-level winds (to {{comply with the}} limitations of the CSBF dynamic launch technique) and suitable <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> (so the balloon remains within telemetry range of a ground station, and within the permitted flight region). The payload may be rolled out to the launch area several times before surface and upper atmosphere conditions are acceptable for launch.|$|R
50|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September 11,traversed the Caribbean {{and crossed the}} Yucatán on September 21. The disturbance developed a small surface low on September 24 while moving erratically over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> initially prevented the system from developing convection; however, the shear relaxed {{on the following day}} and convection increased. On the evening of September 25, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft found evidence that the low qualified as a tropical depression. Under weak steering currents, the depression drifted south and southwest, executing a small cyclonic loop into the Bay of Campeche. <b>Upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> gave way to an anticyclone above the depression, and the system became Tropical Storm Lorenzo on September 27 about 130 nmi km east of Tuxpan. Rapid intensification brought Lorenzo to hurricane status early that evening, less than twelve hours after becoming a tropical storm. Lorenzo reached its peak intensity on September 28, then weakened slightly before making landfall near Tecolutla, Mexico as a minimal hurricane. The small circulation weakened rapidly after landfall, and the system dissipated the next day.|$|R
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 27. It tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge, becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the Cape Verde islands on September 28. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the Lesser Antilles it organized further, and despite unfavorable <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 while located about 115miles (185km/h) east of Dominica. Located in an area of weak steering currents, the depression drifted to the northwest, and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the National Hurricane Center designated it with the name Klaus.|$|E
5|$|Later on June20, {{convection}} {{near the}} center of circulation began to decrease–an indication of weakening–and the eye was no longer visible. <b>Upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear rapidly increased to 55km/h (35mph), preventing re-intensification of the cyclone. Taking a more northward track than anticipated, Linfa began to interact with land and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June21. Around 1230UTC, the storm made landfall in southern Fujian as a tropical storm with winds of 85km/h (50mph 10-minute winds). Deep convection rapidly dissipated shortly thereafter due to interaction with land. Several hours later, the JTWC downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression. The following day, the JMA also downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression as the storm moved away from the Chinese coastline. The system later dissipated just offshore; a circulation was no longer evident on satellite imagery.|$|E
50|$|In early June, a {{large area}} of {{disturbed}} weather persisted over the Greater Antilles, bringing heavy rains to the islands. The area moved northward, developing a circulation over the Bahamas. Strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> caused when satellite imagery showed a circulation developing over the Bahamas. Strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> caused the structure to resemble a subtropical cyclone, and as a result, the system was classified as a subtropical depression on June 5. The depression moved to the northwest and transitioned into a tropical storm on June 6; it was named Andrew about 258 mi southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The tropical storm approached the South Carolina coast within 115 mi before recurving to the northeast on June 7. The storm passed within 70 mi of Cape Hatteras while recurving, while near its peak intensity of 50 mi/h km/h. The storm accelerated to the northeast, briefly crossing into the forecasting territory of Environment Canada, {{the first of three}} storms of the season to do so, before ultimately being absorbed by a low pressure system over Canada on June 8.|$|R
5000|$|Moisture {{levels were}} high on June 18, with surface dew {{points in the}} middle 60s °F (18 °C). Some morning cloud cover along the North Dakota/South Dakota border lifted north by {{afternoon}} which allowed a period of heating. Although the <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> were fairly light, another {{in a series of}} upper-level disturbances shifted over this region by mid-afternoon. This helped initiate thunderstorm development over southeast North Dakota and west central Minnesota, leading to two tornadoes near Carlisle and Dent.|$|R
40|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} over mountainous terrain {{often results}} in catastrophic flooding and presents a great challenge for forecasters. Statistical downscaling methods provide a way to bridge across the scale gap between rainfall forecasts from Numerical Weather Prediction models and the high resolution needs of hydrologic models for flash flood prediction. In this study, multi-scale statistical {{analysis was used to}} analyze several heavy convective rainfall events that produced catastrophic flooding in the Appalachian Mountains and Front Range of the Rocky Mountains with the motivation of developing predictive relationships for a priori parameter estimation needed in downscaling applications. The multi-scale behavior of the rainfall was analyzed over time and linked to underlying topographic elevation and predominate orographic forcing. It was found that in storms located on the leeward-side (i. e., side of mountain facing away from the <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds),</b> one of the parameters increased with increasing topographic elevation. An opposite trend was found for this parameter in storms located on the windward-side (i. e., side of mountain facing towards the direction <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds).</b> These trends held across different geographical regions and both upslope and downslope directions of storm motion. The interaction between orographic and meteorological forcings was found to be important i...|$|R
5|$|The first National Hurricane Center {{forecast}} on Nicole {{noted the}} development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend continued, transitioning into a tropical cyclone would be possible. The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60miles (95km) northwest of Bermuda. Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core within the system. Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward {{under the influence of}} a large extratropical storm south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). Subtropical Storm Nicole lost its circulation as it was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm on October 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Nora {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that exited {{the west coast of}} Africa on September13. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing. The wave axis crossed Central America on September25, with its convection tracking westward along the southern Mexican coastline. On September29, the system became better organized when it reached a position about 100mi (160km) south of Acapulco. Although <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear was only marginally favorable, the National Hurricane Center first noted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis on September30 over the subsequent few days. This verified on October1 after the thunderstorms organized enough for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. At the time, it was located about 600mi (975km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{system from}} which Hurricane Alex {{developed}} was first discernible as a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June17, 2010. Over {{the next few}} days, most of its associated thunderstorm activity was embedded within the ITCZ. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned it {{as a candidate for}} tropical cyclone formation on June20, while it was crossing the Windward Islands into the southeastern Caribbean Sea; at the time, some <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear was present, leading to conditions only marginally favorable for development. The system moved through the Caribbean, and on June21, it developed {{to the extent that the}} NHC assessed a 50%chance of development into a tropical depression within 48hours. The next day, however, the feature deteriorated as thunderstorm activity spread across the Greater Antilles, although the upper-level regime remained favorable for eventual redevelopment.|$|E

The eddy vorticity lengths exhibit a strong seasonal cycle, with the largest scales occurring in the winter season. The maximum zonal eddy lengths closely follow the contours of the strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds,</b> while the maximum meridional lengths are found in jet exit regions and in the stratosphere. 1...|$|R
50|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 6, and almost immediately it became associated with a broad surface circulation. With favorable <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> the system quickly became better organized, and on September 8 it possessed enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen while located about 290 mi (465 km) southeast of the southernmost Cape Verde islands. Initially the depression failed to maintain an inner core of deep convection, and despite its occurrence with nearby dry air, the depression was forecast to intensify to hurricane status due to anticipated favorable conditions.|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Jerry was a {{short-lived}} tropical storm that {{formed in the}} latter half of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming as a tropical depression from a tropical wave on October 6 near Barbados, Jerry intensified into a tropical storm early the following day on October 7 while initially located under an environment of weak vertical wind shear. After reaching its peak of 50 mph (80km/h), Jerry passed just south of Barbados late on October 7 and through the Windward Islands on October 8. Shortly after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, moderate <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear affected Jerry's upper-level outflow, and the cyclone weakened to a depression shortly afterwards. Deterioration in organization continued, and Jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of Puerto Rico. Jerry caused minimal effects in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Located to {{the south}} of a mid-level ridge, the {{depression}} moved to the west-northwest. With weak to moderate <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear over the system, the depression gradually organized, and intensified into Tropical Storm Erin on September 2. Though Erin had favorable upper-level outflow and developing convection, the inner core of the storm remained disorganized. The storm slowly strengthened, and attained an initial peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h) while located about 1,150miles (1,855km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Favorable conditions were expected to allow Erin to continue to strengthen to reach winds of 85mph (135km/h). However, an upper-level low to the northwest of Erin produced strong vertical shear over the storm, and Erin quickly weakened as the low-level circulation became exposed {{to the south}}west of the deep convection. The shear slightly abated on September 4, allowing Erin to briefly re-strengthen. However, the storm remained disorganized, and following an increase in southwesterly wind shear Erin began a weakening trend. On September 5, Erin weakened to a tropical depression, and hours later the low-level circulation dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The season, {{which began}} on June 1 and ended on November 30, was very {{inactive}} because of strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>wind</b> shear. The wind shear was unusually strong throughout the Caribbean and open Atlantic, and disrupted convection {{in areas of}} disturbed weather so they could not develop. Over sixty African systems had formed and made it westward, but {{when they reached the}} Lesser Antilles, they were dissolved easily. The only area where the shear was minimal—a region encompassing the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic north of the Bahamas and east of Florida—was where the four named storms developed. This makes the 1983 season the least active season since the 1930 Atlantic hurricane season which had only two storms. 1983 and the prior season became the first example of two consecutive years to have no storms form in the Caribbean Sea since 1871, when reliable record began. 1983 also proved to be the first season since 1871 that a storm did not form south of 25°N latitude.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the National Hurricane Center did not {{anticipate}} strengthening; however, Peter intensified to winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) late on December 9, after an eye feature developed. Usually that would indicate hurricane intensity, but as the eye was short-lived, Peter remained a tropical storm. It turned northward ahead of the same frontal system that absorbed Tropical Storm Odette, and the combination of strong <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> and cooler water temperatures caused quick weakening. By December 10, Peter degenerated into a tropical depression, and after turning northeastward it was absorbed by the cold front the next day.|$|R
5000|$|A broad low {{pressure}} area developed over Central America on May 19, accompanied by heavy rainfall. The system drifted eastward into the Caribbean Sea, and by May 23 was located in the central Caribbean, producing rainfall across Jamaica, eastern Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. <b>Upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> prevented tropical cyclogenesis of the system. However, the low had characteristics of a subtropical cyclone, with a closed atmospheric circulation and extensive convection extending to the northeast of the system. The interaction between the low and a high pressure area over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean produced winds of around 25 mph across the region.|$|R
40|$|The 30 th Operational Support Squadron Weather Flight (30 OSSWF) {{provides}} comprehensive weather {{services to}} the space program at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) in California. One of their responsibilities is to monitor <b>upper-level</b> <b>winds</b> to ensure safe launch operations of the Minuteman Ill ballistic missile. The 30 OSSWF requested the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) analyze VAFB sounding data to determine the probability of violating (PoV) <b>upper-level</b> thresholds for <b>wind</b> speed and shear constraints specific to this launch vehicle, {{and to develop a}} graphical user interface (GUI) that will calculate the PoV of each constraint on the day of launch. The AMU suggested also including forecast sounding data from the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model.
