After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created <b>under</b> <b>Mr</b> Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E

Back at the house, Brain, chris, and peter watches tv and saids that quahog is {{suffering}} a heat wave across the city, with superstore USA takeing away the nighborhood power to allow temperatures to up with any cooling.

Later, his daughter is promoted to assistant manager by Mr. Penisburg, who immediately instructs her to fire Peter.

5|$|The Delius {{household}} was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, {{and played}} for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz {{was drawn to the}} music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies <b>under</b> <b>Mr.</b> George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to London for Delius to attend concerts and opera.|$|E

25|$|King-street from Elizabeth-street to Macquarie-street, was thronged, and {{it became}} {{exceedingly}} difficult for the police, who were present in considerable force <b>under</b> <b>Mr.</b> sub-inspector Anderson, to preserve anything like order. Not only was the street thronged, but the balconies and {{the windows of the}} houses opposite the church were filled with sight-seers, the stone wall and railings enclosing the church were thick with people, and even the roof of the Supreme Court gave footing or a precarious support to adventurous individuals who were determined to see all that could be seen of the viceregal wedding. The crushing towards the church gates was enough to endanger life and limb. The persistent efforts made by the crowd to get within the railed enclosure caused the churchwardens to lock the gates, and to refuse, for some time, admittance to anybody, and even the guests specially invited to witness the marriage ceremony were subjected to much inconvenience and delay before they could reach the church doors. This, however, was almost unavoidable, for the crowd and the crushing were such that the severest measures were necessary to prevent the church being rushed by the people.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Captain of the Guard {{declared}} his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, saying to the duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there {{that this was the}} reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he had never thought to have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off the order of St. George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they saw all the King's archers <b>under</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cheyney {{at the door of the}} prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods.|$|E

25|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Jean is being helped by the nurse Marjorie on trying to recall her name. Marjorie starts {{speaking}} name after name and would not stop even though Jean asked her to. Jean became confused and not realizing what she was doing, lost control of her telekinetic powers. This caught Emma Frost's attention when it registered on Cerebro and went {{to pick her up}} with Cyclops. Meanwhile, Jean is being chased by the MRD in the hospital and, once cornered, ratted out by Marjorie, she unintentionally manifested her enormously powerful Phoenix abilities in the heat of her fear and hopelessness, which caused an intense psionic wave that affected almost the entire city. Archangel, <b>under</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sinister's command, went to capture Jean but Cyclops and Emma intervened. They soon discovered that the reason why Jean was not in mental contact with Scott was because she had no memory of Scott. Archangel pursued them as they tried to get Jean home, Cyclops desperately fought him, but in the end both he and Jean were captured so that Sinister could take samples of their DNA for his experiments. The X-Men came to rescue them and fought the Marauders, but just as Archangel is about to kill Cyclops, Jean manifests her immensely powerful Phoenix Force abilities and defeats him. Scott was able to calm her down and take her to the Institute for rest and promised her that she would regain her memories in conjunction with Emma's help. Everyone at the institute then became unconscious, except Emma, an undercover agent of the Hellfire Club who now had Jean, and therefore the Phoenix Force itself, in their hands.|$|E
