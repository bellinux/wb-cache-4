5|$|His {{refusal to}} accept {{anything}} short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid {{with the news that}} López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. PedroII turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> build elementary schools.|$|E

5|$|At the plantation, Northup meets Patsey, {{a favored}} slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps {{regularly}} rapes and abuses. Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail {{a letter to his}} friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, Rhodes, aged 22, married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe, {{who lived}} in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior. They lived in a farmhouse, shared with other people, at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton. On 25 August 1902 his wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, their only child. Rhodes found Yorkshire's {{dealings}} with money to be ungenerous; following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire, as was their custom, paid only one-third of the money to Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf, only paying out the interest. Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> build a stone house at Marsh, Huddersfield, which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912. He lived there until 1956.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy a new television set.|$|E

25|$|On April 14, 1949, {{the state}} {{announced}} that Dewey had authorized {{the purchase of}} the structure, the last remaining privately owned toll bridge in New York State.As part of the deal, the state had {{through the end of the}} fiscal year (April 1, 1950) to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> acquire the bridge, at a cost of $30,000 or less. On June 14, 1949, two months after the appropriation, the state extended the charter through January 1, 1950 to work with negotiation of the transactions. In the time span of more than a year after the appropriation, negotiations were made for a fair purchase price to acquire the structure, which came to an amount of $26,000 by September1950. As part of the purchase, the bridge would be made toll-free. However, the state was not able to acquire the structure until August 6, 1952, when the state officially took over, abandoning the toll. Albro, who was at a ceremony removing the sign denoting the toll, noted that there was multiple issues in the three-year span involving transfer of the bridge, such as titles of the approaches and miscellaneous technicalities.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 1825, {{a second}} loan to Greece was {{floated in the}} City of London. Despite {{the fact that the}} Greek {{government}} had squandered the money from the first loan, the second loan was oversubscribed and raised some £1.1 million. Unlike the first loan, the second loan from the City was to be managed by a Board of Control in London, consisting of the banker Samson Ricardo, two MPs, Edward Ellice and Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse of the London Greek Committee, who were to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy warships and other supplies, which would then be handed over to the Greeks. After the Greek government had wasted most of the money from the first loan, the City did not trust them to spend the money from the second loan wisely. The Board of Control used the money to hire the naval hero, Lord Cochrane, to command the Greek Navy and to buy steamships. One of the British philhellenes, Frank Abney Hastings believed that the use of mechanised warships powered by steam and using red-hot shot would allow the Greeks to destroy the Ottoman navy, powered as it was by sail. Hastings persuaded the Board of Control to invest in the revolutionary technology of the steamship, making the first use of a mechanised warship in a war. The two loans from the City imposed a crippling burden on a poor nation like Greece, and only in 1878 was a deal struck between the British creditors and the Greek government to reduce the loans, now worth £10 million, with unpaid interest down to one and a half million pounds sterling, and even then it took the Greeks decades to pay off the loans.|$|E

500|$|In {{keeping with}} Sifton's policy of {{excluding}} all prominent {{players in the}} A affair from cabinet, Cross was not re-appointed (Cushing, Rutherford, and Boyle were also left out). Despite this, Cross declared his support for Sifton's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford's. In response to the A's default of its obligations to the government, Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A had raised through the sale of government-guaranteed bonds. Cross, still a supporter of building the A and concerned that the bill {{did not include a}} commitment to <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> do so, opposed it. The bill passed, but was disallowed by the courts. Sifton, left with little choice but to use the money for the purpose for which it had been raised, announced a new policy of railway construction. At the same time, he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney-General. Boyle was also admitted to cabinet, as Minister of Education; Cushing and Rutherford, the other major players in the A affair, had withdrawn from the limelight, and neither would return to the legislature after the 1913 election. Cross accepted Sifton's offer, telling the public that Sifton's new railway policy [...] "made it proper for me to support and join his government".|$|E
