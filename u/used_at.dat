40|$|Background: Condom use remains low {{among young}} people despite high {{prevalence}} of HIV, STIs, and unplanned pregnancy in Uganda. Objectives: This paper presents patterns of condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> first and latest sexual events and associated factors. Methods: The data were obtained from 445 sexually active unmarried people aged 15 - 24 from one peri-urban and another rural district. Stratified multi-stage cluster sampling technique was applied. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> {{each of the two}} sexual events, while multinomial logistic regression was used to establish factors correlated with condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> both first and last sex. Results: Factors associated with condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> each event were residence in the peri-urban district and higher education attainment. Factors correlated with condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> both first and last sex were residence in peri-urban district (p< 0. 001) and being in school (p< 0. 01). Alcohol consumption and age at first sex were only significant at one event. Conclusion: Some factors that influence condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> first sex are different from those that affect condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> latest sexual event. Prevention programmes against STIs, HIV and unplanned pregnancies {{among young people}} focus more on rural areas and those with minimal or no education...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{factors associated}} with condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> last sexual intercourse among adolescents. Methods: Cross-sectional study of {{a representative sample of}} 368 sexually active adolescents aged 13 - 17 years from eight public high schools on Santiago Island, Cape Verde, 2007. The level of significance was 5. 0 % obtained from logistic regression, considering the association between condom use and socio-demographic, sexual and reproductive variables. Results: The prevalence of condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> last sexual intercourse was 94. 9 %. Factors associated with condom <b>use</b> <b>at</b> last sexual relationship were: non-Catholic religion (OR= 0. 68, 95 %CI: 0. 52; 0. 88) and affective-sexual partnership before the interview (OR= 5. 15, 95 %CI: 1. 79; 14. 80).
