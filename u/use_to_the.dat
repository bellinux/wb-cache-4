5|$|At {{the same}} time, Monsabert's attempt to {{liberate}} Marseille commenced. At first, a German force at Aubagne was defeated before French troops attacked the city directly. Unlike Toulon, the German commander at Marseille did not evacuate the civilian population, which became increasingly hostile. The resulting fighting with FFI troops further weakened the German units, which were exhausted from partisan fighting. The Wehrmacht {{was not able}} to defend on a broad front and soon crumbled into numerous isolated strongpoints. On 27August most of the city was liberated, with only a few small strongpoints remaining, and on 28August German troops issued the official surrender. The battle caused 1,825 French casualties, but 11,000 German troops were captured. In both harbours, German engineers had demolished port facilities to deny their <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{declaration}} from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee {{that neither the}} harbour nor its ships {{would be used for}} military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised. The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port's entrance channel, with the intention of preventing Goliath and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, Dupleix and Helmuth, to carry his raiding parties.|$|E
5|$|Gorizia {{entered the}} dry dock in La Spezia to begin repairs on 4 May; {{she was still}} under repair when Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies in September. The ship's commander initially ordered the caretaker crew to flood the drydock and scuttle the ship when German troops occupied the port, but cancelled the order {{when it became clear}} the ship would be of no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans anyway. The Germans later moved the ship out of the dock, anchored her in the harbor, and abandoned her. On the night of 2122 June 1944, British and Italian frogmen used Chariot manned torpedos to infiltrate the harbor to sink Gorizia and Bolzano to prevent the Germans from using them as blockships; while the commandos did sink Bolzano, they were unsuccessful with Gorizia. She remained afloat and heavily listing in April 1945, when Allied forces liberated La Spezia. Judged to be too badly damaged to repair, the postwar navy decided to discard the ship. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 27 February 1947 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that Edison {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} light bulb. He claims instead that Edison made the first commercial electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected {{at the same time to}} a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic went to {{war with}} the French Republic, joining the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Despite {{resistance}} from the Dutch Army and a British expeditionary force, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French {{in the winter of}} 1794–1795, the French reforming the country into the Batavian Republic, a client state of the French regime. Although war between Britain and the Batavian Republic had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to be seized and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French. On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the Batavian Republic.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> members of the imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did {{not have the right to}} wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E

5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories {{in the first three}} months of 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E
5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|The {{decipherment}} of the Mycenaean Linear B script, {{a writing}} system adapted {{for the use}} of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age, demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period. Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the Iliad, in reference to the Trojan War. The latter was supposed to have happened in the late 13thearly 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of Troy. Homer used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers. These names appear to have passed down from the time they were in <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his Iliad. There is an isolated reference to a-ka-wi-ja-de in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.|$|E

5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid {{to move the}} ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her to pass up the river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She burned {{through the rest of the}} day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of the Ionian Islands sought not only to deny their <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French, but also to foster Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire, with whom Britain was still at war. Local Greek nationalists and brigands were formed into the 1st Greek Light Infantry under John Oswald and later Richard Church. This was the first modern independent Greek military unit, and its existence encouraged other Greek nationalists to join the British forces in the region, forming the core {{of what was to}} become the United States of the Ionian Islands. Troop withdrawals late in 1809 delayed any further invasions until March 1810, when Collingwood's temporary successor Thomas Byam Martin detached a squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet for an operation against Santa Maura. Landings were effected on March 22, and the island surrendered on April 16 after an eight-day siege of the principal fortress, the attackers considerably aided by the desertion of the garrison's native Greek troops to Oswald's Greek Light Infantry.|$|E
5|$|The paratroopers and glider-borne {{airborne}} {{troops of the}} division, commanded by Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area, near {{to the city of}} Caen, tasked with a number of objectives. The division was to capture two strategically important bridges over the Caen Canal and Orne River which were to be used by Allied ground forces to advance once the seaborne landings had taken place, destroy several other bridges to deny their <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans and secure several important villages. The division was also assigned the task of assaulting and destroying the Merville Gun Battery, an artillery battery that Allied intelligence believed housed a number of heavy artillery pieces, which could bombard the nearest invasion beach (codenamed Sword) and possibly inflict heavy casualties on the Allied troops landing on it. Having achieved these objectives, the division was then to create and secure a bridgehead focused around the captured bridges until they linked up with advancing Allied ground forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
5|$|Two days late, the {{parachute}} infantry battalions of Stanisław Sosabowski's 1st (Polish) Parachute Brigade {{were able to}} take off in England. 114 C-47s took off but 41 aircraft turned back after Troop Carrier Command decided it would be too dangerous to land if the aircraft were up too long. The remainder pressed on; they did not have the correct transmission codes and did not understand the messages. One of the few messages to get out of Arnhem warned the Poles that DZ 'K' was not secure and to land instead on the polder east of Driel where they should secure the Heveadorp ferry on the south bank of the Rhine. The Poles dropped under fire at 17:00 and sustained casualties but assembled in good order. Advancing to the river bank, they discovered that the ferry was gone; the ferryman had sunk it to deny its <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans.|$|E
