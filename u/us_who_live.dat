One {{or more of these}} features can be found in numbers of Vincent's paintings from his Antwerp period onwards. Van Gogh wrote, [...] "If we study Japanese art, we see a man who is undoubtedly wise, philosophical and intelligent, who spends his time… studying a single blade of grass. [...] But this blade of grass leads him to draw every plant, and then the seasons, the wide aspects of the countryside, then animals, then the human figure… isn't it almost a true religion which these simple Japanese teach <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in nature as though they themselves are flowers. [...] And you cannot study Japanese art, it seems to me, without becoming much gayer and happier." ...|$|E

5000|$|None of this throws Hobsbawm {{into the}} embrace of free-market capitalism: [...] "Those of <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> through {{the years of the}} Great Slump still find it almost {{impossible}} to understand how the orthodoxies of the pure free market, then so obviously discredited, once again came to preside over a global period of depression in the late 1980s and 1990s, which once again, they were equally unable to understand or to deal with." ...|$|R

60|$|To me, I confess the {{constant}} necessity of drinking {{under which the}} majority of men labor is quite unaccountable. I can understand people drinking to drown care or to drive away maddening thoughts well enough. I can understand the ignorant masses loving to soak themselves in drink--oh, yes, it's very shocking that they should, of course--very shocking to <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in cozy homes, with all the graces and pleasures of life around us, that the dwellers in damp cellars and windy attics should creep from their dens of misery into the warmth and glare of the public-house bar, and seek to float for a brief space away from their dull world upon a Lethe stream of gin.|$|E

Among <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> by peaceful trade, we still hope for peace; for we see not what good comes of war, save to those who make raids in England, and {{as often as not}} these get more hard knocks than plunder; but to the quiet trader it means loss, and may well mean ruin, if the English army again marches through Scotland. We can discover no reason why the two countries should not live peaceably together, each going about its own business. I have heard it said, before now, {{that it would be a}} good thing for both countries if the border districts on both sides were stripped altogether of their people, and allowed to lie desolate.|$|E

25|$|FI {{is thought}} to be very common, but much under-{{reported}} due to embarrassment. One study reported a prevalence of 2.2% in the general population. It affects people of all ages, but is more common in older adults (but it should not be considered a normal part of aging). Females are more likely to develop it than males (63% of those with FI over 30 may be female). In 2014, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that one out of every six seniors in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in their own home or apartment had FI. Men and women were equally affected. 45–50% of people with FI have severe physical and/or mental disabilities.|$|R

6000|$|It was {{a melancholy}} sight {{to see him}} seated, his battle-axe and shield by his side, his chin upon his mailed breast, with but one old crone for companion, and {{notwithstanding}} his crimes and misdeeds, a pang of compassion shot through me as I looked upon Twala thus [...] "fallen from his high estate."

It is difficult for <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in an age of railroads, telegraphs, penny posts and penny newspapers, to realise how uneventful, how limited in thought and feeling, as well as in incident, was the life of an English family of retired habits and limited means, only forty years ago.

60|$|The belled group, of the {{hyacinth}} and convallaria, is as delicate as {{the other}} is coarse; the unspeakable azure light along the ground of the wood hyacinth in English spring; the grape hyacinth, which is in south France, as if a cluster of grapes and a hive of honey had been distilled and compressed together into one small boss of celled and beaded blue; the lilies of the valley everywhere, in each sweet and wild recess of rocky lands,--count the influences of these on childish and innocent life; then measure the mythic power of the hyacinth and asphodel as connected with Greek thoughts of immortality; finally take their useful and nourishing power in ancient and modern peasant life, {{and it will be}} strange if you do not feel what fixed relation exists between the agency of the creating spirit in these, and in <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> by them.|$|E
60|$|When we {{got into}} the {{latitude}} of Port Jackson, the crew was put on two quarts of water a man, three quarts having been stipulated for in the articles. This produced a mutiny, the men refusing duty. This was awkward enough, in that distant sea. The captain took advantage of the men's going below, however, to secure the scuttle and keep them there. He then mustered <b>us,</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> aft, six men and three boys, and laid the question before us, whether we would take the ship into Canton, or go into Port Jackson, and get some water. He admitted we were about seventy-five days run from Cauton, but he himself leaned to the plan of continuing on our course. We saw all the difficulties before us, and told him of them.|$|R
