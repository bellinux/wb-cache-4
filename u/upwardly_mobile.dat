5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member).

We use well-established methods based on the concept of the concentration curve to compare the cumulative distribution of health care utilisation with the cumulative distribution of the population ranked by income. The results find evidence of inequity in specialist and dental care, but only slight inequity for GP care and not significant inequity in hospital admissions. Levels of inequity are highest for specialist and dental care, even when users of the private sector are excluded from analyses.

These deportations took place {{under the direction of}} the minister of the Interior, D. F. Malan, later notorious as the initiator of the apartheid policy.

While turn-of-the-century British immigrants to southern Africa are generally thought of as <b>upwardly</b> socially <b>mobile,</b> a minority took a downward path. As ‘poor whites’ they constituted a threat to racial boundaries. Malan, concerned to police these boundaries, sought to remove them from society. But he was constrained by his political alliance with the British immigrant labour movement and in the end was selective in his strategy, deporting the most marginalised or lumpen proletarian, while allowing those who could claim some shreds of respectability to remain. The organisational and bureaucratic processes of deportation are traced in detail. The article endorses Robert Bickers’ view that imperial history has given too little attention to poor and working class British immigrants in the Empire. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{procedures}} and results obtained from linking marriage registers with the 1851 and 1881 censuses for Birmingham, a major industrial center, {{and rural areas}} in Norfolk. The results underscore regional contrasts in mobility processes. Those starting out in Birmingham from unskilled origins whether parental or initial occupation, had quite high probabilities of experiencing upward occupational mobility. Probabilities for those of unskilled origin were considerably lower in rural Norfolk; but for those of higher origins mobility rates could at least equal if not exceed those in Birmingham. More strikingly, literacy offered considerably greater prospects for advancement for those in rural Norfolk than industrial Birmingham. Basic education could matter more to the aspiring farm bailiff or rural shopkeeper than for the nail-maker or gunsmith. The career impact of literacy over and above impact on initial occupation at marriage was especially sizable for agricultural Norfolk in the earlier time period. The results suggest differences in the migration patterns in the two areas with overall rates of migration being higher in Norfolk, but migration rates for the <b>upwardly</b> occupationally <b>mobile</b> being greater in Birmingham. There was no clear connection between literacy and geographic mobility. Thus, the results here do indicate a positive association between industrialization and occupational mobility. But they also underscore that mobility did occur in agricultural areas and that education could play at least as great a role in facilitating mobility in agricultural as in industrial areas.

40|$|Background Evidence on the {{relative}} influence of childhood vs adulthood socioeconomic conditions on obesity risk is limited and equivocal. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate associations of several indicators of mothers 2 ̆ 7, fathers 2 ̆ 7, and own socioeconomic status, and intergenerational social mobility, with body mass index (BMI) and weight change in young women. Methods This population-based cohort study used survey data provided by 8756 women in the young cohort (aged 18 - 23 years at baseline) of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health. In 1996 and 2000, women completed mailed surveys in which they reported their height and weight, and their own, mother 2 ̆ 7 s, and father 2 ̆ 7 s education and occupation. Results Multiple linear regression models showed that both childhood and adulthood socioeconomic status were associated with women 2 ̆ 7 s BMI and weight change, generally in the hypothesized (inverse) direction, but the associations varied according to socioeconomic status and weight indicator. Social mobility was associated with BMI (based on father 2 ̆ 7 s socioeconomic status) and weight change (based on mother 2 ̆ 7 s socioeconomic status), but results were slightly less consistent. Conclusions Results suggest lasting effects of childhood socioeconomic status on young women 2 ̆ 7 s weight status, independent of adult socioeconomic status, although the effect may be attenuated among those who are <b>upwardly</b> socially <b>mobile.</b> While the mechanisms underlying these associations require further investigation, public health strategies aimed at preventing obesity may need to target families of low socioeconomic status early in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives...|$|R
50|$|Sapir {{was born}} into a family of Lithuanian Jews in Lauenburg in the Province of Pomerania where his father, Jacob David Sapir, worked as a cantor. The family was not Orthodox, and his father {{maintained}} his ties to Judaism through its music. The Sapir family did not stay long in Pomerania and never accepted German as a nationality. Edward Sapir's first language was Yiddish, and later English. In 1888, when he was four years old, the family moved to Liverpool, England, and in 1890 to the United States, to Richmond, Virginia. Here Edward Sapir lost his younger brother Max to typhoid fever. His father had difficulty keeping a job in a synagogue and finally settled in New York on the Lower East Side, where the family lived in poverty. As Jacob Sapir could not provide for his family, Sapir's mother, Eva Seagal Sapir, opened a shop to supply the basic necessities. They formally divorced in 1910. After settling in New York, Edward Sapir was raised mostly by his mother, who stressed the importance of education for the <b>upwardly</b> social <b>mobile,</b> and turned the family increasingly away from Judaism. Even though Eva Sapir was an important influence, Sapir received his lust for knowledge and interest in scholarship, aesthetics, and music from his father. At age 14 Sapir won a Pulitzer scholarship to the prestigious Horace Mann high school, but he chose not to attend the school which he found too posh, going instead to DeWitt Clinton High School., and saving the scholarship money for his college education. Through the scholarship Sapir supplemented his mother's meager earnings.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{historians and}} {{historical}} geographers have {{become interested in}} the use of GIS to study historical patterns, populations, and phenomena. The result has been {{the emergence of a new}} discipline, historical GIS. Despite the growing use of GIS across geography and history, the use of GIS in historical research has been limited largely to visualization of historical records, database management, and simple pattern analysis. This is, in part, due to a lack of accessible research on methodologies and spatial frameworks that outline the integration of both quantitative and qualitative historical sources for use in a GIS environment. The first objective of this dissertation is to develop a comprehensive geospatial research framework for the study of past populations and their environments. The second objective of this dissertation is to apply this framework to the study of daily life in the nineteenth-century city, an important area of scholarship for historical geographers and social historians. Other daily life studies have focused on various experiences of daily life, from domestic duties and child rearing to social norms and the experience of work in early factories. An area that has received little attention in recent years is the daily mobility of individuals as they moved about the ‘walking city’. This dissertation advances our understanding of the diurnal patterns of daily life by recreating the journey to work for thousands of individuals in the city of London, Ontario, and its suburbs in the late nineteenth century. Methodologies are created to capture past populations, their workplaces, and their relationship to the environments they called home. Empirical results outline the relationship between social class, gender, and the journey to work, as well as how social mobility was reflected through the quality of individuals’ residential and neighbourhood environments. The results provide a new perspective on daily mobility, social mobility, and environment in the late nineteenth-century city. Results suggest that individuals who were able to be <b>upwardly</b> socially <b>mobile</b> did so at the expense of substantial increases in their journey to work...|$|R

We focus on the strategies that these youth and their families employ for social mobility as well as the role of public policy in these processes. We examine the trajectories of three groups: sons and daughters of the 2000 migration wave from Ecuador to Spain who study at universities in Spain, those who have returned to Ecuador for their studies, and Ecuadorians who move to Spain in order to carry out postgraduate studies, some of them funded by scholarships from the Ecuadorian government. The research project employed a qualitative methodology based on interviews, focus groups and a survey with Ecuadorians in Spain who took the entrance exam for admittance into Ecuador’s public university system. Our findings highlight the varied forms of capitals that these diverse students employ, as well as the social and economic constraints that they encounter. In a period of economic crisis in Spain, the first group of students must often downgrade their expectations in order to continue their studies. Their experience contrasts starkly with Ecuadorians undertaking postgraduate studies in Spain, whose heterogenous trajectories are <b>upwardly</b> and geographically <b>mobile.</b> The case of the return university students to Ecuador shows us that education is inserted into a broader strategy that depends on transnational networks shaped over {{more than a decade of}} Ecuador-Spain migration...|$|R
