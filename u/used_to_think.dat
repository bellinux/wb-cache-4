500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I couldn't leave my projects.

The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E

500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it was Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I {{can look at it}} now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate.

500|$|In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas {{was married}} to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually {{shortened}} to [...] "Kasturba", and affectionately to [...] "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the {{custom of the region}} at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} and mixed by Max Martin and Rami Yacoub. Max Martin {{began working on}} the song at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-2001 and Spears recorded in June {{of the same year}} at Battery Studios in New York City, New York. The June 20, 2001 recording session aired on MTV Diary on September 1, 2001. Background vocals were provided by Martin and Jeanette Oison. Spears considered the song as one of her favorites, while praising Dido for [...] her input into its songwriting, saying [...] "it was truly an honor for you to be part of my album. Thanks for your input." [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] is a pop power ballad, founded on a strong piano melody, that lasts for three minutes and 49 seconds. The song is composed in the key of E♭ major and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 76 beats per minute. The song's lyrics talk about the angst and heartache that teenage girls suffer with puberty, where Spears claims, [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I had the answers to everything." [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] has a basic sequence of E♭–A♭2–Fm7–B♭ as its chord progression.|$|E

500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E
500|$|Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first {{adaptation}} {{outside of}} comic books {{took place in}} the third season of Batman (1967), Barbara Gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and Batman in the second season episodes, [...] "Batman's Waterloo" [...] and [...] "The Duo Defy". Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to [...] "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men." [...] According to Craig: [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice." [...] A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, [...] "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl {{through the use of a}} straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use." [...] However, Craig has also stated: [...] "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that’s lovely." [...] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} vocals for Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid project Sun City in August 1985, Bono made {{an additional}} {{contribution to the}} album in October that was inspired by his burgeoning interest in roots music. While in New York, he spent time with musicians Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who played him blues and country music. Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genres, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. He realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition" [...] and {{felt as if they}} [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood and convinced Van Zandt to add to Sun City. Until that time, U2 had been apathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with the Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they felt a sense of indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Richards encouraged Bono to look back to rock's roots and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. He explained, [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For The Joshua Tree, I felt {{the time had come to}} write words that meant something, out of my experience." [...] Dylan told Bono of his own debt to Irish music, while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track [...] "In a Lifetime".|$|E

500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E

Since Batman, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media.

The Batman series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode [...] "Artifacts" [...] (2007). She also appears in DC Super Hero Girls voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's Batman Beyond, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.|$|E
500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I {{think one of the}} biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E
