5|$|Once, {{while working}} at the Sanitarium, Beilhart was called to the bedside {{of a young girl}} for whom doctors had given <b>up</b> <b>hope.</b> When Beilhart prayed for her, she {{experienced}} a quick and complete recovery. Beilhart's conviction that faith-healing was the remedy for illness put him in disfavor with the sanitarium officials and he was asked to resign.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} days Hoesin repeatedly visits Rasminah, and slowly the two begin {{to fall in}} love. When Rasminah takes her aunt to Batavia to live, Hoesin follows. They begin discussing their future together, but Rasminah insists that she will only marry when her aunt is reunited with Kasimin. After a lengthy search, in which he almost gives <b>up</b> <b>hope,</b> Hoesin finds Kasimin at a small plantation in the hills outside of the city– Hadidjah's long-lost husband previously operated his own orchard, but had been evicted by a conniving and greedy landlord only days before. Kasimin and Hadidjah are reunited, allowing Hoesin and Rasminah to begin their own preparations.|$|E
5|$|Though Wiggins did {{not give}} <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> {{for a return to}} baseball, he began to study the {{real-estate}} market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.|$|E

5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide debate. This one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E
5|$|His first 13 {{games for}} the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio {{throughout}} the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making any impact {{in any of the}} major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> for the future.|$|E

5|$|Melvin served out {{his term}} until October 31, 1906, when he {{suffered}} a stroke while holding a session of the circuit court in Wellsburg. He was paralyzed and lost consciousness {{as a result of}} the stroke, and was assisted from the bench and taken to Wheeling City Hospital in Ward5. By the following day physicians had given <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> for his recovery. Melvin died at 16:00 on November 9, 1906, at the hospital as a result of apoplexy. His body was taken to the McLure Hotel on November 10, where it lay in state until November 12. Melvin was interred next to his father and mother in his family's graveyard at United Methodist Cemetery in his hometown of Fairview (present-day New Manchester) in Hancock County.|$|E
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no clear}} {{solution}} to combating Britain from the air. Göring {{had not given}} <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> of winning a victory by airborne assault. He discussed the possibility of invading Ireland (Fall Grün, or Operation Green) with Kurt Student in January 1941, in order to surround Britain by land, sea and air. The operation was shelved. Instead, the Luftwaffe, {{with varying degrees of}} success, carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities. The lack of RAF night defences in this stage of the war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage without suffering the heavy losses of the daylight campaign. It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2,800 killed, 340 wounded, 750 captured. Overall losses were cut by one-third of daylight operations.|$|E

5|$|D. Michael Harris and Jack Grimm {{had failed}} to find Titanic but their expeditions did succeed in {{producing}} fairly detailed mapping of {{the area in which}} the ship had sunk. It was clear that the position given in Titanics distress signals was inaccurate, which was a major expedition difficulty because it increased the search area's already-massive size. Despite the failure of his 1977 expedition, Robert Ballard had not given <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> and devised new technologies and a new search strategy to tackle the problem. The new technology was a system called Argo / Jason. This consisted of a remotely controlled deep-sea vehicle called Argo, equipped with sonar and cameras and towed behind a ship, with a robot called Jason tethered to it that could roam the sea floor, take close-up images and gather specimens. The images from the system would be transmitted back to a control room on the towing vessel where they could be assessed immediately. Although it was designed for scientific purposes, it also had important military applications and the United States Navy agreed to sponsor the system's development, on condition that it was to be used to carry out a number of programmes – many still classified – for the Navy.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{search was}} cancelled {{soon after the}} storm and newspapers reported the children as dead. On Thursday, 18 August, a neighbour of the Duff's suggested asking Dick-a-Dick and other Wotjobaluk trackers for assistance and the parents, who had not given <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> of finding their children, readily agreed. Dick-a-Dick took two other Wotjobaluk men, Jerry and Fred, with him and within hours had rediscovered the children's trail and hours later had found the children near death.|$|E
