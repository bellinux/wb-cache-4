25|$|<b>Unpolarized</b> <b>light,</b> after {{reflection}} at a specular (shiny) surface, generally obtains {{a degree}} of polarization. This phenomenon was observed in 1808 by the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus after whom Malus's law is named.

The quarter-wave plate has a horizontal slow axis and a vertical fast axis and they are also represented using orange lines. In this instance the <b>unpolarized</b> <b>light</b> entering the linear polarizer is displayed as a single wave whose amplitude and angle of linear polarization are suddenly changing.|$|E
25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} birefringent material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. <b>Unpolarized</b> <b>light</b> consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a birefringent material such as calcite.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unpolarized</b> <b>light</b> can be {{described}} as a mixture of two independent oppositely polarized streams, each with half the intensity. Light is said to be partially polarized when there is more power in one of these streams than the other. At any particular wavelength, partially polarized light can be statistically described as the superposition of a completely unpolarized component and a completely polarized one. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarization and the parameters of the polarized component. That polarized component can {{be described}} in terms of a Jones vector or polarization ellipse, as is detailed above. However, in order to also describe the degree of polarization, one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.|$|E

This change is complete within 25 minutes of the onset of irradiation. In contrast, if the electrical vector of the green light is parallel to the cell axis, no chloroplast reorientation is induced, even with a fluence rate as high as 3 watts per square meter. Furthermore, <b>unpolarized</b> far-red <b>light</b> (727 nanometers, 2 watts per square meter) given alone has no effect on chloroplast reorientation. Simultaneous and continuous irradiation with polarized green light, regardless of its plane of polarization, together with <b>unpolarized</b> far-red <b>light,</b> however, does lead to chloroplast reorientation.

We report here self assembly of ordered and aligned solution processible Poly(3, 3 ‴-dialkylquaterthiophene) (PQT- 12) polymer at macroscopic level using Floating Film Transfer Method (FTM). PQT- 12 polymer film is formed over solution of ethylene glycol and glycerol at different temperatures viz. 22, 26, 33, and 38 C. PQT- 12 films formed by FTM technique are further characterized for optical and morphological properties.

[...] The amplitude of light scattered from within any transparent dielectric {{is proportional to the}} inverse square of its wavelength and to the volume of material, that is to the cube of its {{characteristic length}}. The wavelength dependence is characteristic of dipole scattering and the volume dependence will apply to any scattering mechanism. Objects with x ≫ 1 act as geometric shapes, scattering light according to their projected area. At the intermediate x ≃ 1 of Mie scattering, interference effects develop through phase variations over the object's surface. Rayleigh scattering applies to the case when the scattering particle is very small (x ≪ 1, with a particle size < 1 /10 wavelength) and the whole surface re-radiates with the same phase. [...] Because the particles are randomly positioned, the scattered light arrives at a particular point with a random collection of phases; it is incoherent and the resulting intensity is just the sum of the squares of the amplitudes from each particle and therefore proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength and the sixth power of its size.
