5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
25|$|It transpires that Husk's {{personality}} {{shifts and}} subsequent mental breakdown and betrayal where {{caused by a}} secondary mutation which means her powers now also affect her mind {{as well as her}} body. Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him for what he really was. Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E

500|$|Before New Amerykahs release, {{the album}} was {{tentatively}} called KahBa, which Badu derived from her name, as a reference to Islam and Kemetism. The title of the album series, New Amerykah, is a pun of Badu's name. She has explained one meaning of it as [...] "a statement that simply says, 'This {{is the beginning of}} the new world'-for both the slaves and the slave masters. In other words, everybody has to wake <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> This new world moves much faster. We don't even realize how fast we're moving."
