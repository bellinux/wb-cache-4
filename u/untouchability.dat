5|$|Abolition of untouchability: Article 17 of the {{constitution}} abolishes the practice of <b>untouchability.</b> Practice of <b>untouchability</b> is an offence and anyone doing so is punishable by law. The <b>Untouchability</b> Offences Act of 1955 (renamed to Protection of Civil Rights Act in 1976) provided penalties for preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from taking water from a tank or well.|$|E
5|$|In the Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924, Periyar and Gandhi both cooperated and confronted {{each other}} in socio-political action. Periyar and his {{followers}} emphasised the difference in point of view between Gandhi and himself on the social issues, such as fighting the <b>Untouchability</b> Laws and eradication of the caste system.|$|E
5|$|P.Sampath, {{president}} of the Tamil Nadu <b>Untouchability</b> Eradication Front (TNUEF) and an office-bearer politician from the Tamil Nadu unit of Communist Party of India (Marxist) (known as CPI (M)), calls the Chidambaram fire-trail as Brahmin propaganda to conceal the truth that Nandanar was burnt at the stake.|$|E
5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} <b>untouchability</b> to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the booklet}} Gandhi and Periyar Periyar {{wrote in his}} paper Kudi Arasu, in 1925, {{reporting}} {{on the fact that}} Gandhi was ousted from the Mahasabha, because he opposed resolutions for the maintaining of caste and <b>Untouchability</b> Laws which would spoil his efforts to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity. From this Gandhi learned the need of pleasing the Brahmins if anything was to be achieved.|$|E
5|$|The capital, Kolkata, was the {{workplace}} of several social reformers, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda. Their social reforms {{eventually led to}} a cultural atmosphere {{that made it possible}} for practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or <b>untouchability,</b> to be abolished. The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Prabhupada, and Paramahansa Yogananda.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{rights for}} Indians {{have also been}} aimed at {{overturning}} the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish <b>untouchability</b> and thus prohibit discrimination {{on the grounds of}} religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of Indian constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Dravidar Kazhagam {{came to be}} {{well known}} among the urban {{communities}} and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of <b>untouchability</b> amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of <b>untouchability</b> {{has been declared}} an offence punishable by law under Article 17, and the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 has been enacted by the Parliament to further this objective. Article 18 prohibits the State from conferring any titles other than military or academic distinctions, and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign state. Thus, Indian aristocratic titles and title of nobility conferred by the British have been abolished. However, awards such as the Bharat Ratna have been held to be valid by the Supreme Court {{on the ground that}} they are merely decorations and cannot be used by the recipient as a title.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his {{business}} and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating <b>untouchability.</b> In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes <b>untouchability</b> and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on state action {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check not only on the executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Nehru Commission {{composing}} {{of representatives}} of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for dominion status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for {{religious and ethnic}} minorities, and limit {{the powers of the}} government. In 1931, the Indian National Congress (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the minimum wage and the abolition of <b>untouchability</b> and serfdom. Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the constitution of the erstwhile USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.|$|E
5|$|In Vaikom, a {{small town}} in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of <b>untouchability</b> in and around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste {{feelings}} were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised Satyagraha. Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On the fourteenth of April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation. In spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title Vaikom Veeran, given by his followers who participated in the Satyagraha.|$|E
5|$|Social reforms {{aimed at}} {{removing}} {{practices such as}} sati and social discrimination based upon <b>untouchability,</b> as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted the permission to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the Kanara uprising of 1837. The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries, notably Hermann MÃ¶gling, resulted in the founding of printing presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the Pampa Bharata and the Jaimini Bharata), a Kannada-language Bible, a bilingual dictionary and a Kannada newspaper called Kannada Samachara {{began in the early}} 19th century. Aluru Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. <b>Untouchability</b> was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E
25|$|The Vedic texts neither {{mention the}} concept of {{untouchable}} people nor any practice of <b>untouchability.</b> The rituals in the Vedas ask the noble or king to eat with the commoner from the same vessel. Later Vedic texts ridicule some professions, but {{the concept of}} <b>untouchability</b> is not found in them.|$|E

25|$|Article 15 of the Constitution of India prohibits {{discrimination}} based on caste and Article 17 declared the practice of <b>untouchability</b> to be illegal. In 1955, India enacted the <b>Untouchability</b> (Offences) Act (renamed in 1976, as the Protection of Civil Rights Act). It extended the reach of law, from intent to mandatory enforcement. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was passed in India in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Dr. B.R.Ambedkar {{writes about}} his {{experience}} with <b>untouchability</b> in Baroda in the second chapter of his autobiographical book, Waiting for a Visa.|$|E
25|$|The Government of India has {{attempted}} {{on several occasions}} to legislate specifically {{to address the issue}} of caste-related violence that affects SCs and STs. Aside from the Constitutional abolition of <b>untouchability,</b> there has been the <b>Untouchability</b> (Offences) Act of 1955, which was amended in the same year to become the Protection of Civil Rights Act. It was determined that neither of those Acts were effective, so the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 (POA) came into force.|$|E
25|$|Dumont, in {{his later}} publications, {{acknowledged}} that ancient varna hierarchy was not based on purity-impurity ranking principle, and that the Vedic literature is devoid of the <b>untouchability</b> concept.|$|E
25|$|The {{declaration}} by princely {{states of}} Kerala between 1936 and 1947 that temples {{were open to}} all Hindus {{went a long way}} towards ending <b>Untouchability</b> there. However, educational opportunities to Dalits in Kerala remain limited.|$|E
25|$|Dalit {{is mostly}} used to {{describe}} communities that {{have been subjected to}} <b>untouchability.</b> Such people were excluded from the four-fold varna system of Hinduism and thought of themselves as forming a fifth varna, describing themselves as Panchama.|$|E
25|$|Baloo died in Bombay in July 1955. He was remembered most fondly for {{his great}} skill on the cricket field, but his passing was also {{marked by a}} large crowd {{including}} members of the Bombay Legislative Assembly at his cremation, recognising the role he played in overcoming the chains of <b>Untouchability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kolkata {{was also}} the {{workplace}} of several social reformers, like Raja Ram Mohan Ray, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda. These social reforms have eventually led to a cultural atmosphere where practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination or <b>untouchability,</b> the evils that crept into the Hindu society, were abolished.|$|E
25|$|After {{his release}} from jail on 6 January 1924. Savarkar helped found the Ratnagiri Hindu Sabha, aiming {{to work for the}} social and {{cultural}} preservation of Hindu heritage and civilisation. Becoming a frequent and forceful orator, Sarvakar agitated for the use of Hindi as a common national language and against caste discrimination and <b>untouchability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like {{that of his}} {{political}} mentor Annadurai, Karunanidhi's movies carried elements of Dravidian political ideologies such as anti-Brahminism and anti Congress Party messages. Two of the movies that contained such messages were Panam and Thangarathnam. The overall themes of the movies were remarriage of widows, <b>untouchability,</b> self-respect marriages, abolition of zamindari and abolition of religious hypocrisy.|$|E
25|$|Mahatma Gandhi {{coined the}} word Harijan, {{translated}} roughly as people of God, to identify untouchables in 1933. The name was disliked by Ambedkar as it emphasised the Dalits {{as belonging to}} the Greater Hindu Nation rather than being an independent community like Muslims.. When <b>untouchability</b> was outlawed after Indian independence, {{the use of the}} word Harijan to describe the ex-untouchables was more common among other castes than the Dalits themselves.|$|E
25|$|The rise of Gandhi's {{popularity}} and his satyagraha art of revolution led to support from: Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Khan Mohammad Abbas Khan, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Chakravarti Rajgopalachari, Dr. Anugraha Narayan Sinha, Jayaprakash Narayan, Jivatram Kripalani, and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. As {{a result of}} prevailing nationalism, Gandhi's popularity, and polices aimed at eradicating caste differences, <b>untouchability,</b> poverty, and religious and ethnic divisions, the Congress became a forceful and dominant group. Although its members were predominantly Hindu, it had members from other religions, economic classes, and ethnic and linguistic groups.|$|E
25|$|Mulk Raj Anand's debut novel, Untouchable (1935), {{is based}} on the theme of <b>untouchability.</b> The Hindi film Achhut Kannya (Untouchable Maiden, 1936), {{starring}} Ashok Kumar and Devika Rani, was an early reformist film. The debut novel of Arundhati Roy, The God of Small Things (1997), also has themes surrounding the caste system across religions. A lawyer named Sabu Thomas filed a petition to have the book published without the last chapter, which had graphic description of sexual acts between members of different castes. Thomas claimed the alleged obscenity in the last chapter deeply hurts the Syrian Christian community, the basis of the novel.|$|E
25|$|From {{soon after}} its {{independence}} in 1947, India introduced a reservation system {{to enhance the}} ability of Dalits to have political representation and to obtain government jobs and education. In 1997, India elected K. R. Narayanan as the nation's President. Many social organisations have promoted better conditions for Dalits through education, healthcare and employment. Nonetheless, while caste-based discrimination was prohibited and <b>untouchability</b> abolished by the Constitution of India, such practices still continue. To prevent harassment, assault, discrimination and similar acts against these groups, the Government of India enacted the Prevention of Atrocities Act on 31 March 1995.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} {{objections}} from his father-in-law, Pratap went to Kolkata in 1906 {{to attend the}} Congress session, and met several leaders involved in the Swadeshi movement, deciding to promote small industries with indigenous goods and local artisans. He was very much against social evils, especially <b>untouchability.</b> To eliminate this evil he dined with a Tamata family of Almora in 1911, and a Mehtar family of Agra in 1912. He {{was influenced by the}} speeches of Dadabhai Naoroji, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Maharaja Baroda, and Bipin Chandra Pal, helping to make him a patriot who turned Swadeshi. He started the movement to burn the foreign-made clothes in his state.|$|E
25|$|The show {{focuses on}} {{sensitive}} social issues prevalent in India such as female foeticide, child sexual abuse, rape, honour killings, domestic violence, <b>untouchability,</b> alcoholism, and the criminalization of politics. It aims {{to bring the}} great achievements of people which often go unnoticed {{in order to encourage}} the audience to achieve their goals no matter what comes in between. It also aims to empower citizens with information about their country, and urge them to take action. While the primary language of the show is Hindi, it is simulcast in eight languages such as Bengali, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu, and subtitled in English, to ensure maximum reach.|$|E
25|$|The text {{prepared}} by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections {{for a wide}} range of civil liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of <b>untouchability,</b> and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other Backward Class, a system akin to affirmative action. India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures. The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Saint Thomas Christians {{formed the}} League for Equal Civic Rights, which sought {{the opening of}} all {{branches}} of government service to Christians, Muslims and avarna Hindus, {{as well as an}} end to the practice of <b>untouchability.</b> Their demands were partially met in 1922 when the Revenue Department was separated from the Devaswom, a semi-government organization that managed the Hindu temples, thus removing the restriction on non-Hindus and avarnas in the executive service. In the 1920s, Saint Thomas Christian leaders such as George Joseph were advised by Mahatma Gandhi to detach from Vaikom Satyagraha, an agitation for the temple entry rights of avarna Hindus, as he considered the issue to be one of concern to Hindus alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of the society into castes and communities was conspicuously absent and practices of <b>untouchability</b> and exclusiveness were unknown. There was dignity of labour accorded to all work {{and no one was}} looked down upon due to their work or occupation. A striking feature of the social life of the Cheras in the Sangam age is the high status accorded to women. Women enjoyed freedom of movement as well as the right to full education. Child marriage was unknown in the early Sangam era and adult marriage was the general rule. The practice of 'bride-price', where the groom would pay the girl's parents, appears to be prevalent in the time. Women were free to follow any occupation though most of them were involved in weaving or the sale of goods. A martial spirit was pervasive and women even went to the battlefield along with the men, largely playing a key role in keeping up the morale of the fighting forces.|$|E
