25|$|On {{an audio}} {{commentary}} {{track in the}} Criterion edition of the DVD, Gilliam expresses great pride in the film and says {{it was one of}} the few times where he did not have to fight extensively with the studio during the filming. Gilliam chalks this <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that many of the studio executives read Thompson's book in their youth and understood it could not be made into a conventional Hollywood film. However, he does express frustration with the advertising campaign used during its initial release, which he says tried to sell it as wacky comedy. The film was later released by Universal Studios on HD DVD and, subsequently, Blu-ray; Criterion released the film on Blu-ray on April 26, 2011.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tout also {{introduced}} original {{research into the}} undergraduate programme, culminating {{in the production of}} a Final Year thesis based on primary sources. This horrified Oxbridge, where college tutors had little research capacity of their own and saw the undergraduate as an embryonic future gentleman, liberal connoisseur, widely read, and mainstay of country and empire in politics, commerce, army, land or church, not an apprentice to dusty, centuries-old archives, wherein no more than 1 in 100 could find even an innocuous career. In taking this view they had a fair case, given the various likelihoods and opportunities for their charges. Tout's ally C. H. Firth fought a bitter campaign to persuade Oxford to follow Manchester and introduce scientific study of sources into the History programme, but failed; there was failure too, at Cambridge. Other universities, however, followed Tout, and Oxbridge, but very slowly, [...] had to face <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> and fundamental changes to the selection of college fellows across all disciplines ensued.|$|E
2500|$|Superintendent James {{retired in}} 1875 {{and he was}} succeeded by his deputy, Colonel John Cameron. He died {{suddenly}} in 1878 and after his death Clarke was made acting head of the Survey until the appointment of Colonel Anthony C. Cooke. It was surprising that Clarke himself was not appointed. Three years later the War Office intervened in his career once again; [...] "an official of a well-known type woke <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that he had been}} at a home station (i.e. the Survey at Southampton) for twenty-seven years, and he was ordered to go to Mauritius" [...] [...] Clarke, a man of some-what hasty temper (Close), strongly resented this summary order which involved such a complete break with his life's work and he promptly sent in his resignation from the Army. Despite protestations to the War Office from the scientific establishment, Clarke's resignation was allowed to stand. [...] "Clarke's retirement was a veritable disaster for the Survey, and his departure lowered the whole tone and scientific status of the department for many a long year." [...]|$|E
2500|$|Guthrie was a {{prolific}} writer, penning {{thousands of pages}} of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood. During this time Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia, a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious Martha Graham Dance School, where she was assisting Sophie Maslow with her piece Folksay. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by Carl Sandburg, Folksay included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads for the dance. Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, Bound for Glory, was completed with the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943. It is vividly told in the artist's down-home dialect, with the flair and imagery of a true storyteller. Library Journal complained about the [...] "too careful reproduction of illiterate speech." [...] But Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in the New York Times, paid the author a fine tribute: [...] "Someday people are going to wake <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world." [...] A film adaptation of Bound for Glory was released in 1976.|$|E

In a June, 2006 column in Scientific American magazine, Skeptics Society president Dr. Michael Shermer called the Popular Mechanics article [...] "the single best debunking of this conspiratorial codswallop." [...] In 2006, the magazine published the book Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why Conspiracy Theories Can't Stand <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Facts,</b> which greatly expanded on the original story, including new myths and much more detail than could fit in the original, magazine article.|$|R
