To gain additional insights, we then focus on firms that face stochastic demand functions with constant price elasticity and have contingent pricing power. Assuming a general forecast evolution process, we characterize the impact of the option to trade and the firms' cooperation on equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus. Finally, to study the main driving forces of trading, we employ a well-established and empirically tested forecast updating model in which the forecast evolution process follows a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion. Under this model, we prove that <b>the</b> <b>equilibrium</b> investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus are nondecreasing in the quality and timing of forecast revisions, in market variability, and in foreign exchange volatility, but are nonincreasing in market correlation. forecast updating, pricing, risk pooling, subcontracting, transshipment...|$|R

40|$|Imperfect {{information}} is the imbalance {{of information in}} the credit market when lenders usually have less information than borrowers about the attributes of borrowers. Imperfect information affects <b>the</b> credit market <b>equilibrium</b> and poses several interesting questions. Does credit rationing occur in markets with adverse selection? What are other characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>equilibrium</b> credit contract besides rationing? Are multi-period contract better than a sequence of one-period contracts? What are the differences between contracts with more self-selection instruments and those with fewer self-selection instruments? <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> general <b>equilibrium</b> scheme, what are the behaviors of the credit market with or without adverse selection? With the continuous production function of borrowers, lenders may combine two ways of credit rationing.
