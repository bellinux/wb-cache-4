25|$|In {{response}} to U.S. lobbying, and also concerns raised by diplomats from Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and others, the treaty includes a provision allowing signatory nations to cooperate militarily with non-signatory nations. This provision {{is designed to}} provide legal protections to the military personnel of signatory nations engaged in military operations with the U.S. or other non-signatory nations that might use cluster munitions. David Miliband, who was Britain's foreign secretary under Labour, approved the use of a loophole to manoeuvre around the ban and allow the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the munitions on British territory.|$|E
25|$|The US {{military}} {{still wants}} to run {{a section of the}} jail and is not handing over hundreds of detainees, saying it has the right to hold insurgents caught on the battlefield said the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Kabul. They include individuals from Pakistan, Tunisia, Yemen and detainees transferred to Bagram from other wars, such as Iraq. The U.S. will retain custody of these non-Afghan prisoners until their fate is addressed in another agreement between the Afghan and U.S. governments. Jason Ditz from ANTIWAR.COM noted that the retention of a portion of the Parwan Detention facility will allow the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> detainees there more or less forever, but will create a PR problem for the Afghan government.|$|E

25|$|Following Finland's trade {{agreement}} with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia. However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.|$|E

Five points {{separated}} the two clubs at the start of play, with Arsenal positioned second in the league table on 18 points, behind Liverpool, and Manchester United in sixth. Ferguson assessed United's title chances in his press conference before the game: [...] "At the moment, there is a group of six clubs behind Liverpool {{at the top of the}} table.

500|$|After {{selecting}} the music by Alexandrov for the anthem, Stalin needed new lyrics. [...] He {{thought that the}} anthem was short and, because of the Great Patriotic War, that it needed a statement about the impending defeat of Nazi Germany by the Red Army. The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan were called to Moscow by one of Stalin's staffers, and were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov's music. They were instructed to keep the verses the same, but {{to find a way}} to change the refrains which described [...] "a Country of Soviets". Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song, that idea was dropped from the version which El-Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight. After a few minor changes to emphasize the Russian Motherland, Stalin approved the anthem and had it published on 7 November 1943, including a line about Stalin [...] "inspir <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the faith with the people". The revised anthem was announced to all of the USSR on January1, 1944 and became official on March15, 1944.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{also argued}} that our primary {{categories}} for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, {{that gave rise to}} most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society. Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, [...] "Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.|$|E

On {{the first day of}} the month, Benfica played away to Belenenses.

Assistant manager Bruins Slot said, [...] "The win allows <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pressure on our opponents and give us morale for Barcelona". The following Wednesday, Benfica visited the Nou Camp in the second leg of the quarter-finals. Barcelona pressured hard and almost scored in the first five minutes with a penalty kick, with Moretto defending Ronaldinho's shot. A few minutes later, the Brazilian scored to make it 1–0 for Barça from open play. Benfica had the best chance to level in the 61th minute, but Simão missed an opportunity.

The presence of all eight living (past and present) Barcelona presidents: Agustí Montal Galobart, Raimon Carrasco, Josep Lluís Núñez, Joan Gaspart, Enric Reyna, Joan Laporta, Sandro Rosell and Josep Maria Bartomeu; 5.) A commemorative video honouring Cruyff's life will be shown on the big screens at Camp Nou stadium. An open letter signed by Barcelona's eight current and previous presidents reads: “With Cruyff we began to play differently, breaking new ground and innovating. With him, both as a player and coach, we established our own style on the field, what is traditionally known as 'total football,' the Barça style everyone admires. The arrival of Cruyff altered the history of Barça. He contributed decisively to a change of mentality. He got <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> our heads up and to see that no opponent was invincible, that we could attain what we were aiming for. Cruyff was an icon who explained, better than anyone, that Barça is more than a club. (...) Without Cruyff's unabashed and non-conformist spirit, we quite possibly wouldn't have become the greatest club in the world.” ...|$|E
