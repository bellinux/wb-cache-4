40|$|I {{have been}} trying to decide what it is that librarians do, and I see that the {{traditional}} role of librarians has changed greatly. They are no longer merely the custodians of shelves of dusty books, the shushers of small children, the sorters of cards, and the extorters of fines from miscreant bookborrowers. If we examine the full range of their activities, the only thing we can say is that they help people get access to information, help people find new ways of enriching their lives, and play a large role in community development. Some librarians administer systems that serve these ends, which may be just another way of saying that libraries, like universities, are cultural and educational institutions, and those institutions may, in the long run, turn out to be among the heaviest <b>users</b> <b>of</b> CATV. <b>Figure</b> 1 is a picture of a CATV system, which I will explain somewhat superficially.

30|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that can}} {{have an effect on}} the cooperation region is the location <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> In <b>Figure</b> 8, the cooperation region is shown as a function <b>of</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>user</b> 3 from its corresponding base station; a Doppler frequency of 0.05 and a feedback and back-haul delay of 1 symbol time each are used. It can be observed that distance from the cell center has almost no impact on the cooperation region; the region is affected only by the cell-edge SNR, which is determined by the transmit power and the cell radius. The reason for the minimal impact <b>of</b> location <b>of</b> <b>users</b> can be explained as follows. When a user moves towards a cell edge (away from its local BS), the SNR it receives decreases due to path loss while the interference it encounters from other BSs increases. The decrease in SNR encourages the use of EgBf, while the increase in interference encourages the use of AlBf. Therefore, both the EgBf and AlBf sum rates suffer drastically as shown in Figure 5. Unless a constant SNR can be kept as a user moves towards the cell edge, there will be no clear winner between EgBf and AlBf.|$|R
40|$|SINCETEACHERS {{began to}} teach and {{students}} began to learn, materials {{have been used to}} educate. The evaluation, selection, organization, and dissemination of these materials have been the province of librarians. Publishers and producers of materials supply their needs. In all, in the United States in 1973, approximately 5 million educators, librarians, and publishers are involved in this cycle, serving at least 75 million students and <b>users</b> <b>of</b> libraries-a <b>figure</b> that represents just under 40 percent of the population. These three occupation groups inform and influence citizens in a special and important way. They are essential to the process of communication since they help to create, publish, disseminate, and use ideas in all forms with people who want or need to learn, to know. Thus, publishers, teachers and librarians are catalysts, and they share many important mutual concerns. Some of these are philosophical, such as intellectual freedom; others are practical, such as efforts to make the acquisition of materials by schools and libraries more efficient. Developments that work {{for the good of the}} professional groups-educators and librarians-work for the good of the commercial groups-publishers, producers, and distributors of materials. This rare symbiotic relationship exists between few, if any, other professionals and their commercial suppliers. No such relationship is more important because the people in this one are involved in the dissemination of ideas, not just things. One might assume, therefore, that a great body of reading research exists that relates to library development and the use of general, or trade, books in schools and libraries. That, however, is not the case. By far the largest percentage of research that has been done in the area o...|$|R

The aims {{of this study is to}} assess the risk of obesity in hormonal contraceptive users in the District of Kulon Progo, Jogjakarta, Indonesia. A cross sectional study was used to determine the prevalence <b>of</b> obesity among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> contraception. A systematic cluster random sampling, using villages as clusters, was used to choose 647 <b>users</b> <b>of</b> contraception in Kulon Progo.   A hundred and two obese cases and 102 control, matched-for-age and socioeconomic status, controls were included in the case control study used to evaluate the risk <b>of</b> obesity among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> hormonal contraception. The prevalence <b>of</b> obesity among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> contraception in Kulon Progo was 15. 9 %. <b>Users</b> <b>of</b> hormonal contraception has a increased risk for obesity, OR: 9. 4 (95 % CI: 1. 1 – 81. 5). <b>Users</b> <b>of</b> combination pills faced the highest risk, followed by <b>users</b> <b>of</b> injected progesterone depot, while the risk in implant users was the same as that in <b>users</b> <b>of</b> non-hormonal contraception. The risk of obesity was significantly higher after 7 years of hormonal contraception use. The risk of obesity was neither related to energy intake nor expenditure. The increased risk <b>of</b> obesity in <b>users</b> <b>of</b> hormonal contraception was still significant after controlling for age, parity, initial weight, socioeconomic status, energy intake and expenditure, and parental obesity.

The AAS users were compared to 68 deceased <b>users</b> <b>of</b> amphetamine and/or heroin who were consecutively tested and found to be negative for AAS. Use of AAS was {{in the majority of}} cases (79 %) associated with concomitant use of psychotropic substances. AAS-related deaths differed in several respects from deaths among <b>users</b> <b>of</b> heroin or amphetamine, most strikingly with regard to: (a) the median age at death, which was significantly lower for AAS users (24. 5 years) than for <b>users</b> <b>of</b> heroin and/or amphetamine (34 and 40 years, respectively); (b) the manner of death, with AAS users dying significantly more often from homicide or suicide than <b>users</b> <b>of</b> other drugs; and (c) the body mass index (BMI), with AAS users exhibiting significantly higher BMI than <b>users</b> <b>of</b> other drugs. These results support the earlier reported association between use of AAS and use of other psychoactive substances. In addition, the data suggest that AAS users are more likely to become involved in incidents leading to violent death and have a higher risk of dying at a younger age than <b>users</b> <b>of</b> other drugs.
