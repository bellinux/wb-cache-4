40|$|Objective We set out {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> and common child psychiatric disorders, including both internalizing and externalizing diagnoses. Methods The 1999 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey provided a nationally representative sample of over 10, 000 children aged 5 – 15 years. Measures included assessment of diagnoses of psychiatric disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury,</b> and a range of potentially related psychosocial factors. Results Children with psychiatric disorders had higher rates of <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury.</b> After accounting for psychosocial risk factors and comorbid psychopathology, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) was independently associated with burns and poisoning. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was related to fractures, and depression and anxiety also showed independent links to some injury types. Conclusions ODD and ADHD, rather than conduct disorder, appear to be the externalizing disorders associated with <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury.</b> We discuss possible models of the relationships between internalizing disorders and <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury.</b> Key words accident; psychopathology; children; adolescents...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To explore {{maternal}} {{perceptions of}} supervision and childhood <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> {{in order to}} develop understanding and explanation for differences in <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> rates between an advantaged and disadvantaged area. Background: <b>Unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> is the second cause of mortality and a significant cause of morbidity in the zero to four year age group. Children living in socio economic disadvantage are at a greater risk of <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> than their more affluent counter-parts. Methods: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews; content data analysis was undertaken. Participants included 37 mothers with a child aged less than five years; 16 living in an area of disadvantage (and high rate of childhood <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury)</b> and 21 = living in an advantaged area (and low rate of childhood <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury).</b> Findings: Parents in both areas described the importance of parental supervision in reducing child <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> risks. Parents in both areas used listening as a supervision strategy. Parents in both areas described how ‘when the child goes quiet’ that is a cue for them to make a visual check on the child. Listening was used more for boys than girls in both areas, but parents in the advantaged area used listening as a supervision strategy more frequently than those in the disadvantaged area. Parents described supervision strategies as being shaped by child character and age rather than child gender. Parents in both areas described similar strategies for managing distractions. An important difference was found with regard to older siblings; parents living in the advantaged area described older siblings as an injury risk to younger children. Parents in the disadvantaged area described older siblings as providing some supervision for younger children. Parents living in disadvantaged circumstances may face greater challenges with regard to supervision than parents living in advantaged circumstances and this may partly explain differences in injury risk...|$|R
25|$|In 1401, the English case Beaulieu v Finglam imposed strict {{liability}} for the escape of fire; additionally, {{strict liability}} was imposed {{for the release}} of cattle. Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also emphasized in the medieval period. <b>Unintentional</b> <b>injuries</b> were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records. In general, scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against champerty and maintenance and vexatious litigation existed. The restriction on assignment of a cause of action is a related rule based on public policy.|$|E
2500|$|Living {{in a rural}} community, {{whether in}} the United States, or around the globe, reduces access to medical services, health insurance, and changes health culture. Differentials exist between rural and urban communities, and some health {{disadvantages}} exist for impoverished rural residents. Since health of a population increases in geographical locations that have a higher prevalence of primary care physicians, rural areas face worse health. According to certain studies, measures of health and well-being indicate that rural populations have worse health outcomes. Rural residents have a greater rate of premature mortality (less than age 75 at death) than urban residents. According to certain studies in the United States, the death rate of individuals age 1–24 years was 31% higher than those in urban counties. The death rate of adults 25 to 64 years old was 32% higher among rural residents than those of suburban counties and of urban counties. These higher death rates were contributed to <b>unintentional</b> <b>injuries,</b> suicide, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 1997 in the United States, 18% of adults in rural areas had chronic health conditions, compared to only 13% of suburban adults. The National Health Interview Survey indicated that in 1998, 16% of rural adults reported poor health. Poor rural residents have only 21% Medicaid coverage, while poor urban populations report 30% coverage. Demographic and socioeconomic factors vary between rural and urban areas, which contributes to some health disparities. For extremely poor rural communities, variables in the community, like ecological setting, including climate, soil, rainfall, temperature, altitude, and seasonality greatly impact health. [...] "In rural subsistence societies, these variables can have strong influence on child survival by affecting the quantity and variety of food crops produced, the availability and quality of water, vector-borne disease transmission" ...|$|E

A blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting <b>unintentional</b> <b>injuries</b> upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil war occurring in a country, where foreigners reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have so far as possible heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There is still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the Government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those states are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.|$|E

The prevalence of disability caused by <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> in this target group in sampled cities across the country was estimated from data from the Second Chinese National Sample Survey on Disability.

The results show that the prevalence of disability due to <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> in the target population group varied significantly across the 16 types of city investigated, but that it was particularly common among the unemployed and poor.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preliminary {{evidence}} suggests that injury survivors {{are at increased risk}} for having experienced traumatic events before their injury or having a lifetime psychiatric history. We aimed to extend the previous research by examining in the same sample whether trauma history or lifetime psychiatric history represented risk pathways to injury for intentional or <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> survivors. We also aimed to describe the co-occurrence between trauma history and psychiatric history in unintentionally injured survivors. METHODS: In this multisited study, randomly selected injury survivors admitted to five trauma services in three states of Australia (April 2004 to February 2006) completed two structured clinical interviews that assessed their history of traumatic life events and lifetime psychiatric disorder (n = 1, 167). chi analyses were conducted to compare the lifetime prevalence of traumatic events and psychiatric history for intentional and <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> with population norms. RESULTS: Both intentional and <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> survivors were at increased risk for reporting all types of trauma and reporting all measured psychiatric diagnoses compared with population norms. The majority of <b>unintentional</b> <b>injury</b> survivors with a psychiatric history were likely to have a trauma history. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified that prior trauma or prior psychiatric illness may represent risk for injury in both intentionally and unintentionally injured survivors. The results highlight the need for injury-care services to address mental health issues in injury patients as part of routine care. M. L. O'Donnell, M. Creamer, P. Elliott, R. Bryant, A.
