25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, well before the {{computer}} era, business data processing was done using <b>unit</b> <b>record</b> equipment and punched cards, most commonly the 80-column variety employed by IBM, which dominated the industry. Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.|$|E
25|$|Leslie Comrie's {{articles}} on punched card methods and W.J. Eckert's publication of Punched Card Methods in Scientific Computation in 1940, described punched card techniques sufficiently advanced to solve some differential equations or perform multiplication and division using floating point representations, all on punched cards and <b>unit</b> <b>record</b> machines. Such machines were used during World War II for cryptographic statistical processing, {{as well as}} a vast number of administrative uses. The Astronomical Computing Bureau, Columbia University, performed astronomical calculations representing {{the state of the art}} in computing.|$|E

50|$|In March 2005 The US Department of Education {{released}} {{a study on}} the Feasibility of a Student <b>Unit</b> <b>Record</b> System Within the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. This <b>Unit</b> <b>Record</b> proposal met with immediate and vocal opposition from congressional leaders as well as colleges and universities. The US Department of Education argued that the development of a national student <b>unit</b> <b>record</b> tracking system, with appropriate privacy safeguards, which collects, analyzes and uses longitudinal student progression data was a vital tool for accountability and policy-making. This sparked an immediate reaction regarding the implications of what this means for Institutions of Higher Education.Unit Record reporting, as originally conceived, would require institutions that report to IPEDS to upload not summary data but rather to upload files that contain individual student records. These files would contain a wide range of information on the student but would, most importantly, include the student's Social Security Number. Concerns were raised that attending even one course would mean you are added to a federal database {{for the rest of your}} life. In a report issued in March 2006 by the US Department of Education, Social Security Number was specifically excluded from the <b>Unit</b> <b>Record</b> upload data. It has been suggested that SSN will still be collected but it will be done so by a third-party before it is uploaded to the IPEDS <b>Unit</b> <b>Record</b> Database.|$|E
