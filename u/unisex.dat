5|$|A small, <b>unisex</b> monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos.

Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E

The furthest that most men went in the 1960s in this regard were velvet trousers, flowered or frilled shirts and ties, and long hair.|$|E

25|$|The {{portable}} toilet is used {{on construction}} sites, film locations, and large outdoor gatherings {{where there are no}} other facilities.

For servicing multiple portable toilets, tanker trucks (vacuum trucks or honeywagons) are equipped with large vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
25|$|Obligate {{parthenogenesis}} is {{the process}} in which organisms exclusively reproduce through asexual means. Many species {{have been shown to}} transition to obligate parthenogenesis over evolutionary time. Among these species, one of the most well documented transitions to obligate parthenogenesis was found in almost all metazoan taxa, albeit through highly diverse mechanisms. These transitions often occur as a result of inbreeding or mutation within large populations. There are a number of documented species, specifically salamanders and geckos, that rely on obligate parthenogenesis as their major method of reproduction. As such, there are over 80 species of <b>unisex</b> reptiles (mostly lizards but including a single snake species), amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process. A female will produce an ovum with a full set (two sets of genes) provided solely by the mother. Thus, a male is not needed to provide sperm to fertilize the egg. This form of asexual reproduction is thought in some cases to be a serious threat to biodiversity for the subsequent lack of gene variation and potentially decreased fitness of the offspring.|$|E
