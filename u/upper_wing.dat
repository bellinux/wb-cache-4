5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Antoniu {{wrote that}} he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated {{on the basis of}} the {{evidence}} of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> fuel tank, and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
50|$|The {{airframe}} of the C2 {{was virtually}} {{identical to the}} model C1. Differences included an aileron control system that actuated the single set ailerons on the <b>upper</b> <b>wings</b> via torque tubes internal to the <b>upper</b> <b>wings</b> rather than from vertical push-pull rods connected to the lower wings. All further C-series Stearmans had this system.|$|R

5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located {{on either side of the}} cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The Port Victoria aircraft, {{designed}} by W.H. Sayers, was designated P.V.7. It {{was a very}} small single bay tractor biplane, of sesquiplane configuration, with its lower wing much smaller than its <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b> The wings featured the same high-lift section as used in previous Port Victoria aircraft, and were fitted with ailerons only on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b> It was intended, as was the competing Eastchurch design, to use a 45hp (34kW) geared ABC Gnat two-cylinder air-cooled engine. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted above the <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite {{corrective}} measures, the Dr.I {{continued to}} suffer from wing failures. On 3 February 1918, Leutnant Hans Joachim Wolff of Jasta 11 successfully landed after suffering {{a failure of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> leading edge and ribs. On 18 March 1918, Lothar von Richthofen, Staffelführer of Jasta 11, suffered a failure of the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> leading edge during combat with Sopwith Camels of No. 73 Squadron and Bristol F.2Bs of No. 62 Squadron. Richthofen was seriously injured in the ensuing crash landing.|$|E
25|$|The KDW was {{produced}} in Austria-Hungary under license by Phönix. 58 were built in five production batches. The first batch entered combat in late 1916. The wings extended well beyond the outboard ends of the star struts, and {{it was found that}} this unbraced part of the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> flexed when the ailerons were actuated, reducing their effectiveness. Starting with the second batch a light steel-tube vee brace was added outboard of the star struts to stiffen the outer <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 1918 von Brumowski became {{involved}} {{in a fight with}} eight enemy fighters. Some of the 26 bullets striking his Albatros ignited the fuel tank built into the <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b> He managed to land at his home field without serious injury, becoming a rare survivor of an in-craft fire. The fire ate the fabric off the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> and the inboard portions of the lower one, leaving only the scorched bare spars and struts of the wing roots.|$|E

25|$|The PWS-6 was a {{two-seater}} biplane of {{a wooden}} construction. A fuselage, oval in cross-section, was covered with canvas skin on a wooden frame, except the engine part, which was covered with aluminium sheets. The wings were two-spar, two-section, rectangular with rounded tips, covered with canvas and plywood (in front). Lower and upper wings halves had the same dimensions, therefore the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> had smaller span, lacking a central section. The <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> was staggered forward, and connected with a lower wing by N-shaped struts and a slanted transverse strut, without wires. The empennage was of wooden construction, canvas covered.|$|E
25|$|The hull was a two-step design {{using the}} Linton Hope {{construction}} method. This used {{a system of}} circular formers separated by stringers {{and covered with a}} double layer of 0.125in (3.2mm) mahogany strips, the second at right angles to the first. This allowed the construction of smooth curved surfaces. The Pellet was a single-bay biplane without stagger and was often described as a sesquiplane because the lower wing was not only of smaller span but also of smaller chord. The lower wing was mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage and carried wingtip floats mounted directly below the N-type interplane struts. There was another pair of these struts between the fuselage and <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> supporting the engine, which was mounted tractorwise above the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> surface in a streamlined nacelle. The engine, a 450hp (340kW) Napier Lion was cooled with radiators fitted flush in the lower surface of the <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b> The pilot sat in front of the propeller. At the rear of the aircraft, the braced tailplane was mounted about halfway up the single fin.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat was {{powered by}} a {{water-cooled}} 275hp (210kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine with a nose radiator, driving a four-bladed wooden propeller. As on the Velos, the upper engine cowling dropped smoothly away from the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> leading edge.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{characteristics}} of the Andover were the two large fuel tanks on the <b>upper</b> <b>wings</b> and the dual exhaust pipes of the Rolls-Royce Condor III engine.|$|R

25|$|De Ridder left a {{description}} of Frommherz's Fokker D.VII insignia. It consisted of the yellow nose and tail common to his Jasta, along with red and black chevrons of a Staffelführer (squadron leader) painted {{on top of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Developed by Marcel de Bruyere, the C1 was a single-bay biplane with {{staggered}} equal-span {{wings and}} inverted V-struts. An all-moving one piece canard controlled pitch, while roll control {{was provided by}} unusual full chord tip ailerons on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
25|$|In mid-1914, Oskar Ursinus, {{the founder}} {{and editor of the}} German flying {{magazine}} Flugsport, began designing a large twin-engine seaplane of unconventional configuration. While most biplane designs have the fuselage attached to the lower wing, Ursinus had a snub-nosed fuselage attached to the <b>upper</b> <b>wing,</b> and twin engine nacelles mounted on the lower one. The purpose of this arrangement was to allow the engines to be kept close together thereby minimizing asymmetrical thrust {{in the event of an}} engine failure, although Ursinus later also claimed that this design balanced out the lowering of the centre of pressure as speed increased, and minimised the drag on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> caused by turbulence from the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} reaches about 34 - 36 mm. The dorsal sides of the <b>upper</b> <b>wings</b> are bright blue with white transversal bands and white spots. The sapphire blue of the <b>upper</b> <b>wings</b> may appear black or neon blue {{depending on how the}} light is reflected. The undersides of the hindwings have a cryptic coloration, as they are mottled with different shades of color, varying from gray to brown, while the under sides of the forewings are black with white patches. The larvae feed on Dalechampia triphylla and Adelia triloba (Euphorbiaceae family). Adults usually feed on rotting fruit and animal dung.|$|R
5000|$|Graphium androcles has a {{wingspan}} reaching about 80 - 120 mm. Females {{are relatively}} larger than males.

The hindwings are white, with black markings on the lower margin. The underside is similar to the upperside, but the white is partially greenish. The hindwings terminate in a very long [...] "tail", which is the longest among all members of the relevant family. The body is black, with white sides of the abdomen.|$|R

25|$|Production {{aircraft}} {{differed in}} having the front elevator mounted on an upswept outrigger {{on the front}} of the nacelle. Additionally, the outer panels of the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> had a swept back leading edge, and were rigged with a slight dihedral.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} dogfight, Boelcke and Böhme, unaware of each other's presence, {{closed in on}} the same aircraft, flown by Captain Arthur Knight. Von Richthofen dived in on the flight path of that very same aircraft; he was chasing the other DH.2, piloted by Lieutenant Alfred Edwin McKay. Boelcke swerved to avoid a {{collision}} with the interceding aircraft. Böhme's landing gear brushed Boelcke's <b>upper</b> <b>wing.</b> As the fabric peeled off the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> of his aircraft, Boelcke struggled for control. He and his aircraft fell out of sight into a cloud. When it emerged, the top wing was gone. However, Boelcke made a relatively soft crash-landing. The impact seemed survivable. However, his lap belt did not restrain him, and he never wore a helmet when he flew.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I {{it was difficult for}} the neutral Dutch armed forces to obtain aircraft from abroad and so the Ammunition Agency approached the Nederlands Automobile and Aeroplane Co. for an indigenous fighter. This request resulted in the Spijker V.1, a conventionally laid out tractor biplane powered by a 60kW (80hp) Swedish licence built Thulin Gnôme rotary engine. It was a single bay design with pairs of parallel interplane struts assisted by four parallel cabane struts between the central <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> and the fuselage. There was neither stagger nor sweep to the fabric covered wings, which had constant chord and squared tips. A semi-circular cut-out in the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> trailing edge over the cockpit enhanced the pilot's upward view.|$|E
50|$|Positive stagger {{is by far}} {{the most}} common, as this {{positioning}} of the <b>upper</b> <b>wing(s)</b> allows better visibility for the crew as well as increased aircraft longitudinal stability, aerodynamic efficiency and maximum lift.|$|R
