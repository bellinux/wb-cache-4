5000|$|A similar {{incident}} on 9 February 2011 saw an Air Nelson Q300 flying from Hamilton to Wellington diverted to Blenheim when the nose wheel failed to deploy. The plane made a successful nose down landing {{with none of}} the 44 passengers injured. It was later determined that the pilots failed to release the <b>uplock</b> lever with the necessary pressure for the landing gear to release.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 February 2011, an Air New Zealand Bombardier Q300 Dash 8 {{aircraft}} - Flight NZ8309, {{operated by}} the subsidiary Air Nelson again suffered a nose wheel failure upon landing at Blenheim Airport. It {{had been scheduled to}} fly from Hamilton to Wellington (in the North Island), but was diverted to Blenheim after crew reported a problem with the undercarriage. After circling the airport four times, the aircraft landed with the nose gear undeployed coming to a stop approximately two thirds {{along the length of the}} runway. No injuries were sustained. A Transport Accident Investigation Commission report (#11-002), found a faulty inhibit switch caused the loss of nosewheel steering on departure and was the cause of the landing gear later not extending normally. The pilots were unable to utilise the alternate extension system as they did not apply enough force to the release handle for the <b>uplock</b> (or possibly did not hold the release handle in position long enough for the <b>uplock</b> to disengage). This was found to be at least in part due to the flight simulators not requiring the full 40 kg (90 lbs) or more force as required in the actual aircraft.

40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue test}} of a {{full-scale}} aircraft body aims to understand the initiation and development of fatigue damage and fatigue crack of its critical structures, and hence to determine fatigue life, maintenance and repairing cycles. The work of non-destructive testing and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring during the whole fatigue test {{plays a key role}} in guaranteeing the success of the test and achieving the prescribed goal. The controlling test of landing gears is part of this fatigue test. The main structures under considerations are uplocks and lower locks of main landing gears, <b>uplock</b> of nose landing gear, and actuator cylinder flanges of both gears. By using the combination of trend analysis and correlation analysis of AE parameters, real time monitoring of landing gear condition is realized, and the leak in the actuator and the linkage wearing were successfully predicted. The methods used are straightforward and direct, they can supply fast analysis speed and realize real time monitoring. The work provides a useful reference for AE signal processing in the future fatigue test or for AE monitoring technique used in the same environment of high background noise...|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{since the}} Shuttle landed {{at high speed}} and could not abort its landing attempt, the gear had to deploy {{reliably}} {{on the first try}} every time. The gear were unlocked and deployed by triple redundant hydraulics, with the gear doors actuated by mechanical linkages to the gear strut. If all three hydraulic systems failed to release the landing gear <b>uplocks</b> within one second of the release command, pyrotechnic charges automatically cut the lock hooks and a set of springs deployed the gear.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{redundancies}} {{are usually}} provided {{to prevent a}} single failure from failing the entire landing gear extension process. Whether electrically or hydraulically operated, the landing gear can usually be powered from multiple sources. In case the power system fails, an emergency extension system is always available. This may {{take the form of}} a manually operated crank or pump, or a mechanical free-fall mechanism which disengages the <b>uplocks</b> and allows the landing gear to fall due to gravity. Some high-performance aircraft may even feature a pressurized-nitrogen back-up system.|$|R

40|$|When {{models are}} used to {{describe}} physical phenomenon during development or modification of a technical system, it is often possible to reduce both the time needed and the overall development cost. With the use of models {{it is also possible}} to investigate the potential of the selected solution, without the need for any expensive details and testrigs. In many cases it is also not possible to test all the aspects regarding the functionality that are desired from the system, without using the complete and final product. In this case a model based approach has been used to optimize the different parameters in the new snubbing mechanism for the Nose Landing Gear Retract Actuator on the JAS 39 Gripen. During the simulations, upper and lower boundaries were calculated for the length of the spring and the diameter for the restrictor. The governing constraints were given by the requirements for the retraction time during cold conditions and that the amplitude of the alternating loads in the <b>uplock</b> mechanism were brought to an acceptable level. The most promising results from the simulations were then used in a limited number of trials in the hydraulic rig to verify that the configurations comply with the requirements. The final parameters for the snubbing mechanism were chosen to 35 Â± 1 mm for the spring and 0. 4 - 0. 5 mm diameter for the restrictor...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{task was}} performed under the Technology for Readiness and Sustainment (TRS) contract (F 33615 - 99 -D- 6001) for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Sustainment Logistics Branch (HESS) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. The period of performance spanned one year starting 29 January 1999. The {{objective of this}} task was to develop and demonstrate a framework that can support the automated validation and verification of aircraft maintenance Technical Orders (TOs). The research team examined all stages ofTO generation to determine which tasks most warranted further research. From that investigation, validation and verification of appropriate, safe, and correct procedure steps emerged as the primary research target. This process {{would be based on}} available computer-aided design (CAD) data, procedure step ordering from existing sources, and human models. This determination was based on which tasks could yield the greatest impact on the authoring process and offer the greatest potential economic benefits. The team then developed a research roadmap and outlined specific technologies to be addressed in possible subsequent Air Force research tasks. To focus on the potential technology integration of the validation and verification component into existing or future TO generation procedures, we defined a demonstration scenario. Using the Front <b>Uplock</b> Hook assembly from an F/A- 18 as the subject, we examined task procedure steps and failures that could be exposed by automated validation tools. These included hazards to personnel, damage to equipment, and incorrect disassembly order. Using the Parameterized Action Representation (PAR) developed on previous projects for actions and equipment behaviors, we characterized procedure steps and their positive and negative consequences. Finally, we illustrated a hypothetical user interface extension to a typical Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) authoring system to demonstrate how this process might appear to the TO author...|$|E
