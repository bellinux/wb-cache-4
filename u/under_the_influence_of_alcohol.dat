5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

Brahma is <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five mala, Vishnu is <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> four, Hara is <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> three, Isa is <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> two and Sadāsiva is <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> ānava mala. Thus, the mala-free states begin only from Sakthi. Tirumūlar describes the ānava, kanmam and maya as the inner covering, husk and awn that encase a paddy grain. Thus, the mala do not change the soul but cover it like a shell (v 2192). Paul Murphy (1986 : 27) quotes verse 57 from Abhnivagupta’s Paramartasara which uses an identical imagery of a husk, awn and chaff and says that without these coating the seed will be “freed” from growth.|$|R

According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E

Olds, briefly hospitalized during the incident for facial cuts, pleaded guilty in return for charges of weaving and felony vehicular eluding being dropped.

40|$|Objectives: To examine {{correlates}} of perpetration and victimization of intimate partner violence (IPV) under and not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance, {{we conducted a}} study among women in Russia. Methods: In 2011, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients receiving services at a clinic for sexually transmitted infections in St. Petersburg, Russia. Multinomial logistic regression was used for analysis. Results: Of 299 women, 104 (34. 8 %) and 113 (37. 8 %) reported a history of IPV perpetration and victimization, respectively. Nearly half (47. 1 %) of perpetrators and 61. 1 % of victims reported that the latest IPV event (perpetration and victimization, respectively) was experienced <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance. Factors independently associated with IPV victimization <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance were alcohol misuse and a higher number of lifetime sex partners, whereas only experience of childhood abuse (emotional and physical abuse) was independently associated with IPV victimization that did not occur <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance. Childhood physical abuse, lower age of first sex, sensation seeking, and alcohol misuse were independently associated with IPV perpetration <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance, while only childhood abuse (emotional and physical abuse) was independently associated with IPV perpetration that did not occur <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> a substance.

5|$|Following its {{announcement}} in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated. Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and players' ability to drive <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered {{one of the most}} significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. A sequel, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{state of}} civil {{disorder}} {{existed in the}} island's mountainous region after {{the invasion of the}} United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Flexible systems which {{function}} <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction {{are very}} common in many applications such as flexible robot arms. The precision motion control of such systems is a difficult task because of the modelling difficulties involved in modelling friction and various flexible modes of the system. This paper presents {{the design of a}} nonlinear adaptive robust controller (ARC) to the precision motion control of a floating oscillator system <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction. This system consists of two masses moving on a track <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction and coupled by a spring. The floating oscillator acting <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> friction can be used to represent many applications such as hard disk drives and flexible robots where friction is present and the end effector position is to be controlled.
