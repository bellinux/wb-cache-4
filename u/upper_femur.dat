50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that once a human reaches adulthood, bone density {{steadily}} decreases with age, to which loss of trabecular bone mass is a partial contributor. Loss of bone mass {{is defined by the}} World Health Organization as osteopenia if bone mineral density (BMD) is one standard deviation below mean BMD in young adults, and is defined as osteoporosis if it is more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean. A low bone density greatly increases risk for stress fracture, which can occur without warning in those at risk. The resulting low-impact fractures from osteoporosis most commonly occur in the <b>upper</b> <b>femur,</b> which consists of 25-50% trabecular bone depending on the region, in the vertebrae which are about 90% trabecular, or in the wrist.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} results of X-ray and CT scan for dysbaric osteonecrosis in Chinese divers. Methods: Both shoulders, hips and knees of 66 {{asymptomatic}} divers with diving duration {{of more than one}} year were examined by X-ray and CT scan. Results: The most frequent locations of dysbaric osteonecrosis were the <b>upper</b> <b>femurs,</b> followed by the <b>upper</b> humerus, lower <b>femurs</b> and <b>upper</b> tibias, and the most frequent radiographic lesions were calcification spots and cystic changes. Of the lesions detected, 38 % (27 / 71) and 42 % (95 / 229) were juxta-articular of the femoral and humeral heads by X-ray and CT respectively. The detection rates of dysbaric necrosis (juxta- and/or other lesions) of X-ray and CT scan were 42. 4 % (95 % confidence interval: 30. 5 %- 54. 3 %) and 81. 8 % (95 % CI: 72. 4 %- 91. 2 %) respectively (p< 0. 05). If CT scan was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity of X-ray was 100 % and the specificity was 31. 6 %. Conclusion: CT scan showed a higher detection rate of dysbaric necrosis than X-ray. We recommend that CT scan be used for early diagnosis of dysbaric osteonecrosis. Copyright © 2005 Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{fluoride}} on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients treated chronically with glucocorticosteroids, 15 subjects (renal grafted, n = 12; skin disease, n = 1; broncho pulmonary disorder, n = 1; Crohn's disease, n = 1) were prospectively studied in a double-blinded manner and randomly allocated either to group 1 (n = 8) receiving 13. 2 mg/day fluoride given as disodium monofluorophosphate (MFP) supplemented with calcium (1, 000 mg/day) and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) (50 micrograms/day), or to group 2 (n = 7) receiving Cas+ calcifediol alone. An additional group of 14 renal transplant patients treated chronically with glucocorticosteroids but exempt of specific therapeutic intervention for bone disease was set up as historical controls. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic QDR 1000) performed at months 0, 6 and 12 for groups 1 and 2 (lumbar spine, total <b>upper</b> <b>femur,</b> diaphysis and epiphysis of distal tibia), or 11 - 31 months apart with calculation of linear yearly changes for the historical cohort. Lumbar BMD tended to rise in groups 1 and 2, and to fall in group 3, the change reaching statistical significance (p < 0. 05) in group 1, thus leading to {{a significant difference between}} groups 1 and 3 (p < 0. 05). At <b>upper</b> <b>femur,</b> tibial diaphysis and tibial epiphysis, no significant change in BMD occurred in any of the groups. In conclusion, lumbar BMD rises more after a mild dosis of fluoride given as MFP and combined to calcium and calcifediol than on Ca+ calcifediol alone, without changes in BMD at the <b>upper</b> <b>femur</b> or distal tibia...|$|E
