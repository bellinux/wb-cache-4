5|$|In 1929, the {{university}}'s fifth president, Robert Maynard Hutchins, took office; {{the university}} underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure. Hutchins eliminated varsity football {{from the university}} {{in an attempt to}} emphasize academics over athletics, instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the Common Core, and organized the university's graduate work into four divisions. In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> and Northwestern University into a single university. During his term, the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> Hospitals (now called the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> Medical Center) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students. Also, the Committee on Social Thought, an institution distinctive of the university, was created.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago,</b> {{fearful that}} its vast {{resources}} would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under {{the terms of}} the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago.</b> A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago,</b> and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chicago</b> professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.|$|E
