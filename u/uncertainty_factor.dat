5000|$|The EPA {{determined}} the acute RfD to be 0.005 mg/kg/day {{based on a}} study in which male rats were administered a one-time dose of chlorpyrifos and blood cholinesterase activity was monitored. Cholinesterase inhibition was observed at all dose levels tested, the lowest of which was 1.5 mg/kg. This level was thus identified at the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). A NOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg was estimated by dividing the LOAEL by a three-fold <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factor.</b> The NOAEL was then divided by the standard 10-fold inter- and 10-fold intraspecies uncertainty factors {{to arrive at the}} RfD of 0.005 mg/kg/day. Other studies showed that fetuses and children are even more sensitive to chlorpyrifos than adults, so the EPA applies an additional ten-fold <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factor</b> to protect that subpopulation. A RfD that has been divided by an additional <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factor</b> that only applies to certain populations is called a [...] "population adjusted dose" [...] or PAD.

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> {{as applied to}} noncancer endpoints in the IRIS database harkens back to traditional safety factors. In the era before risk quantification, these were used to build in a “margin of safety. ” As risk quantification takes hold, the safety factor methods yield to quantitative risk calculations to guarantee safety. Many authors believe that <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> can be given a probabilistic interpretation as ratios of response rates, and that the reference values computed according to the IRIS methodology can thus be converted to random variables whose distributions can be computed with Monte Carlo methods, based on the distributions of the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors.</b> Recent proposals from the National Research Council echo this view. Based on probabilistic arguments, several authors claim that the current {{practice of}} <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> is overprotective. When interpreted probabilistically, <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> entail very strong assumptions on the underlying response rates. For example, the factor for extrapolating from animal to human is the same whether the dosage is chronic or subchronic. Together with independence assumptions, these assumptions entail that the covariance matrix of the logged response rates is singular. In other words, the accumulated assumptions entail a log-linear dependence between the response rates. This in turn means that any uncertainty analysis based on these assumptions is ill-conditioned; it effectively computes uncertainty conditional {{on a set of}} zero probability. The practice of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> is due for a thorough review.

This database was used to derive pathway-related <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> for chemical risk assessment that allow for human variability in toxicokinetics. Probe substrates for each pathway of elimination were {{selected on the basis}} that oral absorption was > 95 % and that the metabolic route was the primary route of elimination of the compound (60 – 100 % of a dose). Intravenous data were used for compounds for which absorption was variable. Human variability in kinetics was quantified for each compound from published pharmacokinetic studies (after oral and intravenous dosing) in healthy adults and other subgroups of the population using parameters relating to chronic exposure (metabolic and total clearances, area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) and acute exposure (Cmax) (data not presented here). The pathway-related <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> were calculated to cover 95 %, 97. 5 % and 99 % of the population of healthy adults and of each subgroup. Pathway-related <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> allow metabolism data to be incorporated into the derivation of health-based guidance values.

Applications of pathway-related <b>uncertainty</b> <b>factors</b> for chemical risk assessment and future refinements of the approach are discussed.
