25|$|The letterforms of Caslon's roman, or <b>upright</b> <b>type</b> {{include an}} 'A' with a concave hollow at top left and a 'G' without a downwards-pointing spur at bottom right. The {{sides of the}} 'M' are straight. The 'W' has three {{terminals}} {{at the top and}} the 'b' has a small tapered stroke ending at bottom left. Ascenders and descenders are relatively short and the level of stroke contrast is modest in body text sizes. However, Caslon created subtly different designs of letter at different sizes, with increasing levels of fine detail and sharp contrast in stroke weight at larger sizes. Caslon's larger-size roman fonts have two serifs on the 'C', while his smaller-size versions have one half-arrow serif only at top right. In italic, Caslon's h folds inwards and the A is sharply slanted. The Q, T v, w, and z all have flourishes or swashes in the original design, something not all revivals follow. The italic 'J' has a crossbar and a rotated version was used by Caslon in many sizes on his specimens to form the pound sign.|$|E

Foram utilizadas as avaliações de número de tripes por folíolo e nota de sintomas obtidos aos 56 e 57 dias do plantio, em Campinas e Pindorama, quando foram registradas as maiores populações do inseto nesses locais. A severidade da verrugose foi avaliada aos 79 e 91 dias após o plantio, em Campinas e Pindorama, respectivamente, através de escala de notas baseada nos sintomas exibidos nas hastes e pecíolos. Os resultados mostraram a eficiência do inseticida thiamethoxam no controle do tripes em todos os cultivares. Nos dois locais observou-se a redução na severidade da verrugose, quando foi aplicado o thiamethoxam. A severidade da verrugose foi maior nos cultivares de porte ereto, com o IAC-Caiapó apresentando os menores índices de severidade.
