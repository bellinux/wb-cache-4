The application of ultrasonic technology can make enzymatic degradation of SB more effective, which has no comparable alternative for treatment. The SB was homogenized by grinding it for 10 minutes at 10, 000 rpm as a pretreatment for preventing its clotting, and then ultrasonic treatment was attempted to solubilize protein in SB. To maximize the efficiency of ultrasonic treatment for SB, the optimum condition of ultrasonic frequency (UF) {{was determined to be}} 20 kHz. To optimize the operation conditions of <b>ultrasonification</b> with 20 kHz of frequency, we used response surface methodology (RSM) based on ultrasonic density (UD) and <b>ultrasonification</b> time (UT).

40|$|Objectives. This work {{aimed to}} enhance anti-skin cancer {{activities}} of Apostichopus japonicus, spiky sea cucumber, through <b>ultrasonification</b> extraction process at low temperature. Methods. Dried Apostichopus japonicus was extracted with an <b>ultrasonification</b> process at 50 °C and 95 [*]kHz {{for two hours}} (UE), and anti-skin cancer activities of the extract from the UE were also compared with those from conventional extraction processes using hot water (WE) or 70 % ethanol at 80 °C (EE) for 12 hours. Results. The amount of canthaxanthin in the UE was higher than that in the WE or EE, and its cytotoxicity against human keratinocytes was less than the others. The extract from the UE showed 93. 5 % inhibition against human malignant cell growth, which was also higher than those from both WE and EE. The extract from the UE demonstrated the ability of inhibiting both cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by downregulating the skin tumor-promoting genes such as Bcl- 2, STAT 3, and MMP- 9. Conclusions. The <b>ultrasonification</b> process was proved to be effective especially in extracting heat-sensitive marine biomass, A. japonicus having higher amounts of canthaxanthin and better anti-skin cancer activities, possibly due to less destruction and high elution of bioactive substances under low temperature extraction condition...|$|E

Based on ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopy results, it was found out that PHB within the artificial granules were in crystalline form. The native PHB granules were isolated from Cupriavidus necator using either lysosyme, deoxyribonuclease and cell disruption by <b>ultrasonification</b> or digestion with alcalase, SDS and EDTA. Granules obtained by both isolation procedures were characterized by ATR-FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, light scattering techniques and DSC. According to the analyses results, the second mentioned procedure {{turned out to be more}} effective for obtaining the polymer in amorphous state. Furthermore, the polymer within granules recovered by using this procedure was thermally more stable. Last but not least, the native PHB granules samples were exposed to effect of acetone, lipase and sodium hypochlorite, assuming that polymer crystallinity should be increased by these chemicals in varying degrees. The highest degree of crystallinity was achieved after their treatment with lipase...|$|E
30|$|The CoFe 2 O 4 /polymer nanostructured {{films were}} {{prepared}} via multiple spin coating and cast coating followed by thermal treatment. N,N-dimethylformamide {{was first used}} to dissolve CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles and P(VDF-HFP) pallets or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) powder separately, with concentration of 20 mg/ml. Then, the two suspensions were mixed under <b>ultrasonification,</b> according to the weight ratio of CFO versus polymer, and spin-coated or cast-coated on Si or glass substrates and dried at 90 °C under vacuum. The thickness of the obtained thin films (200 nm to 1.6 μm) was controlled by the times and/or rotation speed (300 to 1000 rpm) of the spin coating. To measure film thickness, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional analysis was applied. The Si substrate was scored and cut/fractured in order to observe film cross sections, which were then easily analyzed by SEM. Correct instrumental calibration and review of the film over several regions confirmed thin film uniformity, expected for spin/cast coating, and thicknesses could be determined to within ± 7 %. For dielectric measurements, the glass substrates were pre-deposited with rectangular (1 mm × 5 mm) Ag bottom electrodes by a thermal evaporator. Top electrodes were deposited (5 mm × 1 mm) after the films were coated and dried, leaving the composite sandwiched between two electrodes with square crossed area of 1 mm × 1 mm.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} facile method to {{synthesize}} anisotropic platelike gibbsite amp; 8722;polymer core amp; 8722;shell particles. Dopamine is selfpolymerized {{on the surface}} of gibbsite nanoplates and forms a homogeneous layer on it. Transmission electron microscopy characterization of the resulting latexes demonstrates the formation of well defined platelike core amp; 8722;shell particles. Reaction time and <b>ultrasonification</b> are found to be important factors to control the thickness of the polymer shell and avoid aggregation. Good control over the platelike morphology and 100 encapsulation efficiency have been achieved via this novel route. The resulting well defined gibbsite amp; 8722;polydamine G PDA core amp; 8722;shell nanoplates show excellent colloidal stability and can form opal like columnar crystal with iridescent Bragg reflection after modest centrifugation. In addition, G PDA core amp; 8722;shell nanoplates can serve both as reductant and stabilizer for the generation of Au nanoparticles NPs in situ. Au NPs with tunable size have been formed on the G PDA particle surface, which show efficient catalytic activity for the reduction of 4 nitrophenol and Rhodamine B RhB in the presence of borohydride. Such nanocatalysts can be easily deposited on silicon substrate by spin coating due to the large contact area of platelike G PDA particles and the strong adhesive behavior of the PDA layer. The substrate deposited nanocatalyst can be easily recycled which show excellent reusability for the reduction of Rh...|$|E
40|$|Methods of {{determination}} of cobalt and nickel in copper concentrates currently used in factory laboratories are very labor intensive and time consuming. The limiting {{stage of the}} analysis is preliminary chemical sample preparation. Carrying out the decomposition process of industrial samples with concentrated mineral acids in open systems does not allow to improve the metrological characteristics of the methods, for this reason improvement the methods of sample preparation is quite relevant and has a practical interest. The work was dedicated to {{the determination of the}} optimal conditions of preliminary chemical preparation of copper concentrate samples for the subsequent determination of cobalt and tellurium in the obtained solution using tellurium-spectrophotometric method. Decomposition of the samples was carried out by acid dissolving in individual mineral acids and their mixtures by heating in an open system as well as by using <b>ultrasonification</b> and microwave radiation in a closed system. In order to select the optimal conditions for the decomposition of the samples in a closed system the phase contact time and ultrasonic generator’s power were varied. Intensification of the processes of decomposition of copper concentrates with nitric acid (1 : 1), ultrasound and microwave radiation allowed to transfer quantitatively cobalt and tellurium into solution spending 20 and 30 min respectively. This reduced the amount of reactants used and improved the accuracy {{of determination}} by running the process in strictly identical conditions...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{biodiesel}} {{is currently}} shifting {{from the first}} to the second generation in which the raw materials are mostly from non-edible type oils and fats. Biodiesel production is commonly conducted under batch operation using mechanical agitation to accelerate mass transfers. The main drawback of oil esterification is the high content of free fatty acids (FFA) which may reduce the yield of biodiesel and prolong the production time (2 - 5 hours). <b>Ultrasonification</b> {{has been used in}} many applications such as component extraction due to its ability to produce cavitation under certain frequency. This research is aimed to facilitate ultrasound system for improving biodiesel production process particularly rubber seed oil. An ultrasound unit was used under constant temperature (40 oC) and frequency of 40 Hz. The result showed that ultrasound can reduces the processing time and increases the biodiesel yield significantly. A model to describe correlation of yield and its independent variables is yield (Y) = 43, 4894 – 0, 6926 X 1 + 1, 1807 X 2 – 7, 1042 X 3 + 2, 6451 X 1 X 2 – 1, 6557 X 1 X 3 + 5, 7586 X 2 X 3 - 10, 5145 X 1 X 2 X 3, where X 1 is mesh sizes, X 2 ratio oil: methanol and X 3 type of catalyst. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Functional food {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the prevention, management and treatment of chronic diseases. One of the most interesting techniques of functional food production is extrusion-cooking. Functional foods may include such items as puffed cereals, breads and beverages that are fortified with vitamins, some nutraceuticals and herbs. Due to its pharmacological activity, chamomile flowers are the most popular components added to functional food. Objective. Quantitative analysis of polyphenolic antioxidants, as well as comparison of various methods for the extraction of phenolic compounds from corn puffed cereals, puffed cereals with an addition of chamomile (3, 5, 10 and 20 %) and from Chamomillae anthodium. Material and Methods Two modern extraction methods – ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) at 40 o C and 60 o C, as well as accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) at 100 o C and 120 o C were used for the isolation of polyphenols from functional food. Analysis of flavonoids and phenolic acids was carried out using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Results and Conclusions For most of the analyzed compounds, the highest yields were obtained by ultrasound assisted extraction. The highest temperature during the <b>ultrasonification</b> process (60 o C) increased the efficiency of extraction, without degradation of polyphenols. UAE easily arrives at extraction equilibrium and therefore permits shorter periods of time, reducing the energy input. Furthermore, UAE meets the requirements of ‘Green Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|AbstractÐAlumina-pillared {{montmorillonite}} clays (Al-PILC), prepared under ultrasonic (US) agitation {{and normal}} stirring (S) methods, {{have been used}} as a host material to encapsulate Co phthalocyanine (CoPc) complex. The amount of Co varies from 0. 27 to 1. 48 wt. % in the samples, depending on the input concentration of Co. Powder X-ray diffraction and other characterization techniques reveal that the structure of Al-PILC remains intact after the incorporation of the complex into the pores through a pyridine solution of the complex by ultrasonic agitation. A substantial decrease in the BET surface area and total pore volume of Al-PILC points to the occupation of the CoPc moieties within the porous structure of the pillared clay. This is further supported by the observation of a band at 1489 cm ÿ 1 in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the encapsulated samples. The FTIR and diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DRUV-Vis) spectral results indicate that the encapsulated CoPc complex in the clay matrix undergoes distortion in order to accommodate itself within the pores of the Al-PILC. The encapsulated samples prepared by <b>ultrasonification</b> show better dispersion of the complex than the samples prepared under normal stirring conditions. Compared to the `neat ' complex, the encapsulated samples (CoPc in Al-PILC) exhibit greater turnover in the test reaction of the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with tert-butyl hydroperoxide as the oxidant at 373 K. The method of preparation and consequent site isolation of CoPc in Al-PILC influence the catalytic activity...|$|E
