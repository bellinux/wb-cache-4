The key to UAC {{lies in its}} ability to elevate privileges without changing the user context (user [...] "Bob" [...] is still user [...] "Bob"). As always, it is difficult to introduce new security features without breaking compatibility with existing applications.|$|R

5|$|Video game journalists {{questioned}} {{the choice to}} use the Danganronpa series to create a touchscreen-based action game, but still felt {{that it should be}} given a chance; one noted however that the game retained the style of the previous games in the series, and one called it unusually good for its genre. By May 2015, over 700,000 <b>user</b> <b>accounts</b> had been registered for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in December 2014 by developer Spike Chunsoft, and received a promotional video on December 24, 2014. It was released on January 7, 2015 for iOS, and on April 17, 2015 for Android. By May 2015, over 700,000 <b>user</b> <b>accounts</b> for the game had been registered. The game was free to play and had in-app purchases, which allowed the player to buy Monokuma Coins. In September 2015, Spike Chunsoft announced that microtransactions would be stopped on October 13, 2015, and that the game would end service a month later, on November 13.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, between Steam-based game inventories, trading cards, {{and other}} virtual goods {{attached}} to a user's account, Valve stated that the potential monetary value had drawn hackers to try to access <b>user</b> <b>accounts</b> for financial benefit, and continue to encourage users to secure accounts with Steam Guard; when trading was introduced in 2011. Valve reported that in December 2015, around 77,000 accounts per month were hijacked, enabling the hijackers to empty out the user's inventory of items through the trading features. To improve security, the company announced that new restrictions would be added in March 2016, under which 15-day holds are placed on traded items unless they activate, and authenticate with Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} means {{giving a}} <b>user</b> <b>account</b> only those privileges which {{are essential to}} perform its intended function. For example, a <b>user</b> <b>account</b> {{for the sole purpose}} of creating backups does not need to install software: hence, it has rights only to run backup and backup-related applications. Any other privileges, such as installing new software, are blocked. The principle applies also to a personal computer user who usually does work in a normal <b>user</b> <b>account,</b> and opens a privileged, password protected account (that is, a superuser) only when the situation absolutely demands it.|$|R
