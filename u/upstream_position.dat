Quorum-sensing E. coli regulator A (QseA) is found in LuxS systems and activates transcription of ler. Fis, a nucleoid associated protein essential for EPEC’s ability to form attaching and effacing lesions, partly acts through activation of Ler expression. BipA, a ribosomal binding GTPase and prolific regulator of EPEC virulence, transcriptionally regulates Ler from an <b>upstream</b> <b>position</b> where it also regulates other genes.|$|E

Rotate the rod steadily into an <b>upstream</b> <b>position,</b> keeping your rod tip horizontal & low to the river surface and your right arm extended.3. The line, leader and fly will come upstream towards you, and the fly and leader should end up about a rod length away from your position, downstream {{and out into the}} river some. The tip of the rod is upstream of your position. 4. The rod tip is then swung out and around horizontally and quickly downstream, resulting in the line upstream of your position being gradually lifted or ripped from the water downstream, but not moving the 'anchored' position of the fly and leader; as you move the rod out and around downstream, the line follows the rod tip, and you will continue this rotation of the rod and lift the rod tip gradually as the rod tip passes your right shoulder, and the line will then follow to create the D loop downstream and behind your position; 5. Just as the creation of the D loop behind and downstream of your position is about the lift the anchored line tip, leader & fly, begin the forward casting stroke to launch the line, leader & fly in the direction opposite (180 degrees around) the D loop, and in the direction of your target across the river.|$|E

An earlier in vitro study of the transcriptional activity of this 5 '-flanking region suggested that transcription can start <b>upstream</b> from <b>position</b> + 1. We have investigated this phenomenon by cell-free transcription and transient transfection of chimeric constructs in cultured pituitary cells and in HeLa cells and by analysis of RNA from human pituitary glands and HeLa cells. Transcription initiation sites were identified at positions - 54 and - 197 by cell-free transcription assays and by RNAse mapping of human pituitary RNA. In transfection assays, the hGH gene 5 '-flanking sequence <b>upstream</b> from <b>position</b> - 197 displayed transcriptional activity, which critically depended on the upstream stimulatory factor-binding site located between positions - 253 and - 266.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence(s) specifying RNA polymerase I initiation {{has been}} investigated by studying the transcription of deleted and nondeleted mouse ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) templates in vitro. The deletion of 5 '-flanking sequences <b>upstream</b> from <b>position</b> [...] 39 did not affect transcriptional activity, but removal of sequences between positions [...] 39 and [...] 34 resulted in a 90 % decrease of rDNA transcription. The template activity was completely eliminated by the further deletion of nucleotides [...] 33 to [...] 13. It is concluded that sequences between [...] 34 and [...] 12, upstream from the transcribed region, represent an essential control region for the initiation of transcription in vitro.

Using a simple inexpensive laboratory set-up, we have shown that connecting an extension cable to the seepmeter has a negligible effect on its measuring capability.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the conflict over}} the Euphrates and Tigris waters {{from the perspective of}} negotiation theories, by examining the role of power in upstream/downstream negotiations. Conceptual and empirical links are established between water, negotiation (structure, process), power (asymmetries, coalition dynamics, strategies, development of alternatives) and security (direct/indirect interests such as national security, border security, territorial claims, economic development and environmental concerns). The study concludes that asymmetries in power have favored upstream/downstream interactions towards bilateral if not basin-wide arrangements. The framework shows that traditional elements of power, such as <b>upstream</b> <b>positions,</b> military and economic resources, do not constitute the only sources of power. Bargaining power can also determine the dynamics between respective riparians. Time constitutes an important source of power, and interests vary over time when political settings and security concerns shift. Downstream or more vulnerable riparians can invert situations of power asymmetry by acting on the basin-dominant riparian's interests and thus reduce its alternatives. Syria's use of 'issue-linkage' in its interactions with Turkey over water and wider security issues serves as the primary example. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009...|$|R
40|$|A mutant of polyomavirus, F 441, {{selected}} {{to grow in}} undifferentiated mouse F 9 embryonal carcinoma cells, carries a single-base change in the enhancer region at nucleotide (nt) 5233 of the viral genome. Enhancers {{of most of the}} F 9 mutants have a duplicated segment of viral DNA encompassing nt 5233. The minimum duplicated segment of all the known F 9 mutants is from nt 5218 to nt 5239. We prepared oligonucleotides spanning the sequence from nt 5218 through nt 5239 of the genome of the wild type and F 441 and examined the biological activities of the oligonucleotides by a transient assay of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression in F 9 cells. The oligonucleotide harboring the F 441 mutation was shown to increase cat gene expression in F 9 cells when linked at an <b>upstream</b> <b>position</b> in both orientations. When dimerized at an <b>upstream</b> <b>position,</b> the F 441 oligonucleotide showed even higher cat gene expression enhancing activity. In contrast, no such effects were observed with the oligonucleotide of the wild-type sequence. In addition, the F 441 oligonucleotide, but not the wild-type sequence, could inhibit the activity of whole enhancer fragment of F 441 when cotransfected into F 9 cells in excess amounts. On the basis of the results obtained, we suggest that the segment of F 441 enhancer encompassing the point mutation contains a target for a cellular factor(s) which acts in a positive manner to increase the transcription of a gene in undifferentiated mouse F 9 cells...|$|E
40|$|We cloned the 5 ' nontranslated region (NTR) {{from the}} genome of swine {{vesicular}} disease virus (SVDV), {{a member of the}} family Picornaviridae, and used it to construct a bicistronic retroviral vector. The vector is characterized by coexpression of two genes from a single transcript. We found that inclusion of the 5 ' NTR of SVDV did not negate the viral vector titer. Protein analysis indicated that the 5 ' NTR could efficiently direct internal initiation, thus allowing the downstream gene to be translated. Translation of the internally initiated porcine growth hormone gene was about 30 -fold less than that when the porcine growth hormone gene was at the <b>upstream</b> <b>position</b> in NIH 3 T 3 cells but was about equivalent to that in HeLa cells, implying that some cellular factors that stimulated internal initiation of the SVDV 5 ' NTR are present in HeLa cells.

Compared with the conventional double-gene vector or the U 3 -based vector, the bicistronic vector coexpressed two genes much more efficiently, owing to elimination of promoter interference. Furthermore, this type of vector infected and expressed the target genes efficiently in two primary cell lines, rat embryo and human skin fibroblast cells, which we tested.

The inlet recirculation results in a decrease in the flow rate of unstable flow inception, and an up to 8 % improvement in stall limit was obtained by the ring groove arrangement at a small expense of the delivery pressure drop. The improvement of stall limit in the present experiment seems to be mainly due to decrease in flow incidence based on the inlet recirculation flow.

40|$|Plants use {{signaling}} pathways involving salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene {{to defend}} against pathogen and herbivore attack. Many defense response genes involved in these signaling pathways have been characterized, but {{little is known about}} the selective pressures they experience. A representative set of 27 defense response genes were resequenced in a worldwide set of 96 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, and patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated in relation to an empirical distribution of SNPs generated from either 876 fragments or 236 fragments with > 400 bp coding sequence (this latter set was selected for comparisons with coding sequences) distributed across the genomes of the same set of accessions. Defense response genes have significantly fewer protein variants, display lower levels of nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity, and have fewer nonsynonymous segregating sites. The majority of defense response genes appear to be experiencing purifying selection, given the dearth of protein variation in this set of genes. Eight genes exhibit some evidence of partial selective sweeps or transient balancing selection.

40|$|Chromatin {{structure}} is central for {{the regulation of}} gene expression, but its genome-wide organization is only beginning to be understood. Here, we examine the connection between patterns of nucleosome occupancy {{and the capacity to}} modulate gene expression upon changing conditions, i. e., transcriptional plasticity. By analyzing genome-wide data of nucleosome positioning in yeast, we find that the presence of nucleosomes close to the transcription start site is associated with high transcriptional plasticity, while nucleosomes at more distant <b>upstream</b> <b>positions</b> are negatively correlated with transcriptional plasticity. Based on this, we identify two typical promoter structures associated with low or high plasticity, respectively. The first class is characterized by a relatively large nucleosome-free region close to the start site coupled with well-positioned nucleosomes further upstream, whereas the second class displays a more evenly distributed and dynamic nucleosome positioning, with high occupancy close to the start site. The two classes are further distinguished by multiple promoter features, including histone turnover, binding site locations, H 2 A. Z occupancy, expression noise, and expression diversity. Analysis of nucleosome positioning in human promoters reproduces the main observations.

To elucidate what essentially contributes to the onset and progression of IPAH, we investigated factors playing an important role in IPAH by searching discrepant or controversial expression patterns between our murine model and those previously published for human IPAH. We employed the mouse model, which induced muscularization of pulmonary artery leading to hypertension by repeated intratracheal injection of Stachybotrys chartarum, a member of nonpathogenic and ubiquitous fungus in our envelopment. Methods Microarray assays with ontology and pathway analyses were performed with the lungs of mice. A comparison was made of the expression patterns of biological pathways between our model and those published for IPAH. Results Some pathways in our model showed the same expression patterns in IPAH, which included bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling with down-regulation of BMP receptor type 2, activin-like kinase type 1, and endoglin. On the other hand, both Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling and its downstream Rho/ROCK signaling were found alone to be activated in IPAH and not in our model.

The modi-fied nucleotides were directed to positions from − 9 to + 6 {{with respect to the}} first nucleotide of the P site bound codon by a tRNA cognate to the triplet targeted to the P site. Upon mild UV-irradiation, the modified nucleotides at positions + 4 to + 6 cross-linked to protein S 15 and 18 S rRNA nucleotides A 1823 –A 1825.

Cross-linking from the <b>upstream</b> <b>positions</b> was mainly to protein S 26 that has no prokaryotic homologues.

The behaviours used by Arctopsyche ladogensis larvae fighting for nets, and Agrypnia pagetana larvae fighting for cases, agreed well with predictions from the sequential assessment game, which is an ESS model of animal fighting behaviour. Establishment by net-spinning Hydropsyche siltalai larvae on artificial substrates was highest at intermediate densities of residents. Emigration/mortality was density independent, and it was higher at a poor site (low food availability) than at a rich site. Establishment was unaffected by site quality. Growth was density dependent because larvae in <b>upstream</b> <b>positions</b> reduced both current velocity and concentration of food particles for larvae in downstream positions. A field experiment involved manipulations of the density of H. siltalai larvae and their nets in a lake outlet stream. H. siltalai larvae affected all abundant taxa, but the mechanism involved varied between taxa. Rhyacophila nubila (Trichoptera) and chironomid larvae benefited from the presence of H. siltalai nets. Negative effects on nymphs of the mayfly Ephemerella ignita were due to predation by H. siltalai larvae, while a combination of predation and increased emigration in response to nets depressed densities of Simulium truncatum blackfly larvae.

Studies with a translational fusion between the Escherichia coli lacZ and the Bacillus subtilis subtilisin (aprE) genes indicated that the stimulatory site of DegR lay <b>upstream</b> of <b>position</b> - 140, with the region <b>upstream</b> of <b>position</b> - 200 being the major target. It was also found that degS and degU were epistatic to degR. These results suggested some relationship among the degR, degS, and degU gene products. The DegR protein was purified to homogeneity, and its in vitro effect on the phosphorylation reaction involving DegS and DegU was studied. For this purpose, a soluble-extract system in which the formation and dephosphorylation of DegU-phosphate could be examined was devised. The addition of DegR to the soluble-extract system enhanced the formation of DegU-phosphate. The enhancing effect was found to be due to the protection of DegU-phosphate from dephosphorylation. From these results, it was concluded that the positive effect of DegR on the {{production of}} the extracellular proteases is brought about by the stabilization of DegU-phosphate, which in turn may result in the stimulation of transcription of the exoprotease genes...|$|R
50|$|As {{promoters}} {{are typically}} immediately {{adjacent to the}} gene in question, positions in the promoter are designated relative to the transcriptional start site, where transcription of DNA begins for a particular gene (i.e., <b>positions</b> <b>upstream</b> are negative numbers counting back from -1, for example -100 is a position 100 base pairs upstream).|$|R
40|$|Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a translation-linked {{process that}} destroys mRNAs with {{premature}} translation termination codons (PTCs). In mammalian cells, NMD is also linked to pre-mRNA splicing, usually PTCs trigger strong NMD only when <b>positioned</b> <b>upstream</b> {{of at least}} one intron. The exon junction complex (EJC) is believed to mediate the link between splicing and NMD in these systems. Here, we report that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe splicing also enhances NMD, but against the EJC model prediction, an intron stimulated NMD regardless of whether it is <b>positioned</b> <b>upstream</b> or downstream of the PTC and EJC components are not required. Still the effect of splicing seems to be direct—we have found that the important NMD determinant is the proximity of an intron to the PTC, not just the occurrence of splicing. On the basis of these results, we propose a new model to explain how splicing could affect NMD...|$|R
