Invariant sets such as edge states and unstable travelling waves are identified. Turbulent activity is observed to randomly switch from one wall to the opposite one. Such structures are characterised using properly designed symmetry variables. The phase space is visualised using these symmetry-based projections revealing how the invariant sets structure the turbulent dynamics. Finally, we investigate whether these invariant sets obey an inner <b>unit</b> <b>scaling</b> (as is the case for turbulent fluctuations) or an outer scaling, as implied in most investigations of exact coherent states in other wall-bounded shear flows...|$|E

40|$|Privacy-preserving {{record linkage}} (PPRL) aims at {{integrating}} sensitive information from multiple disparate databases of different organizations. PPRL approaches are increasingly required in real-world application {{areas such as}} healthcare, national security, and business. Previous approaches have mostly focused on linking only two databases {{as well as the}} use of a dedicated linkage <b>unit.</b> <b>Scaling</b> PPRL to more databases (multi-party PPRL) is an open challenge since privacy threats as well as the computation and communication costs for record linkage increase significantly with the number of databases. We thus propose the use of a new encoding method of sensitive data based on Counting Bloom Filters (CBF) to improve privacy for multi-party PPRL. We also investigate optimizations to reduce communication and computation costs for CBF-based multi-party PPRL with and without the use of a dedicated linkage unit. Empirical evaluations conducted with real datasets show the viability of the proposed approaches and demonstrate their scalability, linkage quality, and privacy protection.

40|$|On {{invariant}} {{control design}} for systems admitting classical symmetries The notion of symmetry of a dynamical {{system has been}} a subject of long standing interest {{in the treatment of}} dynamical systems. Roughly speaking, a transformation (or a family of transformations) is a symmetry (group) of a dynamical system if the transformation maps solutions to solutions. The knowledge of admitted symmetries of a dynamical system can help to obtain a qualitative understanding of the dynamics and the underlying problem that has been modeled. Numerous control problems naturally admit symmetries (e. g. rotation & translation, <b>unit</b> <b>scaling).</b> Therefore, the problem of designing invariant feedback laws, i. e. control laws that preserve an existing symmetry of a non-linear control system, arises [RR 99]. Further, the availability of input sig-nals can be used to address the question of designing a feedback such that a desired symmetry group is admitted by the controlled system leading to controlled symmetries [SB 05]. In this talk both aspects are addressed by means of examples. To this end, the design of invariant feedback laws is motivated by pre-senting a tracking control scheme for a kinematic car which is invariant under rotation and translation. After a short excursion to more general re-sults taken from [MRR 04], two controlled symmetries are designed in order to render the feedback for a predator-prey bioreactor set-point invariant and growth kinetic invariant, respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{vortical}} {{structures of}} near-wall turbulence at moderate Reynolds number are analyzed and compared in datasets obtained from stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) in a {{turbulent boundary layer}} and from direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a turbulent channel flow. The SPIV data are acquired in the LTRAC water tunnel at Re=+= 820 in a streamwise/wall-normal plane, and in the LML wind tunnel at Re=+= 2590 in a streamwise/wall-normal plane and in a plane orthogonal to the mean flow. The DNS data is taken from DelAlamo et al. (Self-similar vortex clusters in the turbulent logarithmic region, J. Fluid Mech. 561 (2006), pp. 329 - 358), at Re= 950. The SPIV database is validated through an analysis of its mean velocity profile and power spectra, which are compared with reference profiles. A common detection algorithm is then applied to both the SPIV and DNS datasets in order to retrieve the streamwise and spanwise vortices. The algorithm employed {{is based on the}} 2 D swirling strength and on a fit of an Oseen vortex model, which allows to retrieve the vortex characteristics, including its radius, vorticity, and position of the center. At all Reynolds numbers, the near-wall region is found to be the most densely populated region, predominantly with streamwise vortices that are on average smaller and more intense than spanwise vortices. In contrast, the logarithmic region is equally constituted of streamwise and spanwise vortices having equivalent characteristics. Two different scalings were employed to analyze the vortex radius and vorticity: the wall <b>unit</b> <b>scaling</b> and the Kolmogorov scaling. In wall <b>unit</b> <b>scaling,</b> a good universality in Reynolds numbers of the vortices radius and vorticity is observed in the near-wall and logarithmic regions: the vorticity is found to be maximum at the wall, decreasing first rapidly and then increasing slowly with wall-normal distance; the radius is increasing slowly with wall-normal distance in both the regions, except for the streamwise vortices, for which a sharp increase in radius is observed in the near-wall region. However, wall units scaling is found to be deficient in the outer region, where Reynolds number effects are observed. The Kolmogorov scaling appears to be universal both in Reynolds number and wall-normal distance across the investigated three regions, with a mean radius of the order of 8 and a mean vorticity of the order of 1. 5 - 1, but for the SPIV data only. In the DNS dataset, the radius in the Kolmogorov scaling slowly decreases with wall-normal distance. This difference between the SPIV and DNS datasets may be linked to a difference between the boundary layer flow and the channel flow, rather than to the techniques themselves. Finally, the distribution of the vorticity of the detected vortices seems to follow faithfully a log-normal distribution, in good agreement with Kolmogorov's theory (A refinement of previous hypothesis concerning the local structure of turbulence in a viscous incompressible fluid at high Reynolds number, J. Fluid Mech. 13 (1962), pp. 82 - 85) ...|$|E

Margaritifera density exhibited a unimodal distribution while Anodonta and Gonidea density increased in a downstream direction.

Physical habitat characteristics such as woody debris, emergent aquatic vegetation, substrate size, and channel shape generally had higher variable importance than hydraulic, biotic, and chemical variables.

The model used regionally aggregated at-home consumption data from 2000 to 2005. Estimated uncompensated own price elasticities for fresh potatoes were highly significant and ranged between − 0. 5 and − 1. 6. The {{study was designed}} to capture the effects of the aggregate organic market on the prices, expenditures, and demand for each potato category. Organic food market penetration elasticities suggest that specialty potatoes (organic and minor-colored) are particularly well positioned if demands for organic products continue to rise, red potatoes are not well positioned and evidence of the early warning signs of slippage in market share for white and russet potatoes may exist. Producers and promoters of conventional potato products should account for the increasingly important role of organic products in making decisions. As an auxiliary exercise, we also statistically sourced the variance of the organic potato price premium relative to the other four fresh potato prices. At the present time, the variability of the organic potato premium is not much affected by production costs or other supply-related factors: the premium variability was driven largely by demand, and demographic|seasonal factors. Producers should be cautious about shifting to organic potato production until lower cost practices emerge. [JEL Codes: D 120, Q 130, Q 180 ]. Â© 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|E
40|$|JSim is a {{simulation}} system for developing models, designing experiments, and evaluating hypotheses on physiological and pharmacological systems through {{the testing of}} model solutions against data. It is designed for interactive, iterative manipulation of the model code, handling of multiple data sets and parameter sets, and for making comparisons among different models running simultaneously or separately. Interactive use {{is supported by a}} large collection of graphical user interfaces for model writing and compilation diagnostics, defining input functions, model runs, selection of algorithms solving ordinary and partial differential equations, run-time multidimensional graphics, parameter optimization (8 methods), sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation for defining confidence ranges. JSim uses Mathematical Modeling Language (MML) a declarative syntax specifying algebraic and differential equations. Imperative constructs written in other languages (MATLAB, FORTRAN, C++, etc.) are accessed through procedure calls. MML syntax is simple, basically defining the parameters and variables, then writing the equations in a straightforward, easily read and understood mathematical form. This makes JSim good for teaching modeling as well as for model analysis for research.    For high throughput applications, JSim can be run as a batch job.   JSim can automatically translate models from the repositories for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and CellML models. Stochastic modeling is supported. MML supports assigning physical units to constants and variables and automates checking dimensional balance as the first step in verification testing. Automatic <b>unit</b> <b>scaling</b> follows, e. g. seconds to minutes, if needed.

40|$|Studies on the {{relationship}} between psychosocial determinants and HIV risk behaviors have produced little evidence to support hypotheses based on theoretical relationships. One limitation inherent in many articles in the literature is the method of measurement of the determinants and the analytic approach selected. ^ To reduce the misclassification associated with <b>unit</b> <b>scaling</b> of measures specific to internalized homonegativity, I evaluated the psychometric properties of the Reactions to Homosexuality scale in a confirmatory factor analytic framework. In addition, I assessed the measurement invariance of the scale across racial/ethnic classifications in a sample of {{men who have sex with}} men. The resulting measure contained eight items loading on three first-order factors. Invariance assessment identified metric and partial strong invariance between racial/ethnic groups in the sample. ^ Application of the updated measure to a structural model allowed for the exploration of direct and indirect effects of internalized homonegativity on unprotected anal intercourse. Pathways identified in the model show that drug and alcohol use at last sexual encounter, the number of sexual partners in the previous three months and sexual compulsivity all contribute directly to risk behavior. Internalized homonegativity reduced the likelihood of exposure to drugs, alcohol or higher numbers of partners. For men who developed compulsive sexual behavior as a coping strategy for internalized homonegativity, there was an increase in the prevalence odds of risk behavior. ^ In the final stage of the analysis, I conducted a latent profile analysis of the items in the updated Reactions to Homosexuality scale. This analysis identified five distinct profiles, which suggested that the construct was not homogeneous in samples of men who have sex with men. Lack of prior consideration of these distinct manifestations of internalized homonegativity may have contributed to the analytic difficulty in identifying a relationship between the trait and high-risk sexual practices. ...|$|E
