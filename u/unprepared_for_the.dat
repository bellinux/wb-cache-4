5|$|Across {{the eastern}} Caribbean, Hurricane Lenny damaged vital infrastructure, {{including}} roads and piers in the tourism-dependent islands. Most of the islands' tourism areas were on western-facing beaches, {{many of which}} were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> high waves and winds produced by Lenny.|$|E
5|$|Residents and {{tourists}} in southern Florida were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unusual off-season storm. Winds {{of up to}} 65mph (105km/h) spread across the area, causing damage to windows and power lines. The storm dropped 2–4inches (50–100mm) of precipitation along its path; the combination of unseasonable rainfall and winds resulted in crop damage in Miami-Dade County.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after forming, gale {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles of the Leeward Islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla. Klaus {{was the first}} tropical cyclone on record to hit the Leeward Islands from the west, {{and as a result}} many were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> strong winds and rough seas from the southwest.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} in June 1941 the Red Army was roughly twice the size it had been in September 1939, but was sorely <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> war. <b>The</b> doctrine of Deep Battle was still the official line, but few of the soldiers were trained or prepared to utilize it correctly.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, Logan proves <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> {{office and}} the crisis. When CTU arrests an American {{civilian}} named Joe Prado due to his employment under Marwan, Logan is hesitant to face the political risk of detaining Prado without charge. Logan is slow to act, even though CTU and Novick point out that Prado is their only means of finding Marwan in time.|$|R
40|$|If <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> them, <b>the</b> {{realities of}} {{teaching}} can challenge, confront and paralyse the valued ideals and philosophies of teachers. An orientation to teacher education that embraces the ambiguous, dilemma ridden nature {{of teaching and}} encourages teachers to contextualise personal knowledge and ways of knowing within an understanding of story, time and place is crucial if teachers are to stay the course, manage surprise, and maintain their hope and vision...|$|R
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arrival of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E

25|$|In 1812, the U.S. was financially <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> war. <b>The</b> Democratic Republicans {{allowed the}} First Bank of the United States to expire in 1811, over Gallatin's objections. He had to ship $7 million to Europe {{to pay off}} its foreign {{stockholders}} just at a time money was needed <b>for</b> war. <b>The</b> heavy military expenditures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> War of 1812, and the decline in tariff revenue caused by the embargo and the British blockade cut off legitimate trade (there was plenty of untaxed smuggling).|$|R
5|$|Offshore, Ismael {{produced}} {{waves of}} up to 30feet (9m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, {{and as a result}} 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26million in damage (1995USD, $ USD). The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000people homeless. Moisture from the storm extended into the United States, causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} education improved as well, though the extreme growth in the new boomtowns initially caused severe strain on school systems <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rapid influx of students. Even as money was rapidly flowing in the communities, obtaining tax revenue efficiently where it was needed was often complex. Communities dealt with these problems by establishing independent school districts, education districts formed independently of city or county government with their own independent taxing authority. This type of school district is still the standard in Texas today.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Allied {{operation}} at Guadalcanal, the initial Japanese response included airstrikes and an attempted reinforcement. Mikawa, {{commander of the}} newly formed Japanese Eighth Fleet headquartered at Rabaul, loaded 519 naval troops on two transports and sent them towards Guadalcanal on August 7. However, when the Japanese learned that Allied forces at Guadalcanal were stronger than originally reported, the transports were recalled.|$|E

5|$|The US Army's 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, a {{newly formed}} unit {{consisting}} mostly of inexperienced new arrivals, {{was ordered to}} move to the South Korean village of Hadong to hold the pass there from advancing forces of the North Korean People's Army. <b>Unprepared</b> <b>for</b> combat, <b>the</b> American forces walked into an ambush in which most of the battalion's command staff was killed in the pass, leaving lower-ranking soldiers to mount a disorganized defence against North Korean troops occupying prepared positions on higher ground.|$|R
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99typhoon bulletins, warning {{residents}} about Mireille. There were 236warnings {{related to}} storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents {{were aware of}} the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did not expect significant effects. In general, residents were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> storm, partly {{due to the lack of}} recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E
50|$|Although the Polish forces {{managed to}} halt the German blitzkrieg and the {{fighting}} resembled World War I on the western front, the besieged garrison was suffering heavy losses and desperately needed to shorten its front lines. As {{there was no chance}} of relief of the besieged Polish forces by a strong force from the Polish mainland, the Heights offered a decent defensive position. Although completely <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> defence, <b>the</b> area was densely forested and made enemy penetration and aerial and naval bombardment much more difficult.|$|R

50|$|Kickapoo Indians {{inside the}} camp had been {{peaceful}} {{since the days}} of the Black Hawk War, but they were not <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> violence. <b>The</b> Kickapoo benefited from the well-placed camp, located on a tall bank covered with light timber and protected by natural brier thickets common to the Cross Timbers area. The first militia attacks suffered from brier hazards while under intense Indian rifle fire. According to a witness, three Texan officers (including Gillentine) and sixteen enlisted men were killed in the first few minutes.|$|R
5|$|On October2, the {{government}} of Belize {{declared a state of}} emergency and activated the entire Belize Defence Force due to the storm's threat. The airport in Belize City was closed during Keith's passage, limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands. In Corozal, Belize, authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk. Officials were also ordered evacuations for Belize City, setting up shelters in Belmopan. Overall, about 25,000people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize's population. Three hospitals were evacuated in the country. In a post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> storm and did not anticipate such intensity.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Tidewater region, {{there were}} {{estimates}} {{of thousands of}} downed trees, and hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged. Of these, about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable. Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast. Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge, where about 12 homes were severely damaged. It is reported that the state was <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> damage, expecting a strike from a weakened tropical storm. About $15.3million (1998 USD) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas. Throughout the state, insured losses totaled $95million (1998 USD).|$|E
5|$|From mid-1944, the USNavy {{pressed for}} B-29s {{to be used}} to lay naval mines in Japan's home waters to {{strengthen}} the blockade of the country. Arnold and his staff were unenthusiastic about these proposals, however, as they believed that such missions would divert too many Superfortresses away from precision bombing attacks. In response to repeated requests from the Navy, Arnold decided in November 1944 to begin mine-laying operations once sufficient aircraft were available. In January 1945, LeMay selected the 313th Bombardment Wing to be the Twentieth Air Force's specialist mine-laying unit, and the Navy provided assistance with its training and logistics. LeMay designated the aerial mining campaign Operation Starvation. As the United States had only occasionally used mines up to this time, the Japanese military had placed relatively little emphasis on keeping its minesweeping force up to date. As a result, the IJN was <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> large-scale USAAF offensive.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 25, 1950, ten {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> war. <b>The</b> numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.|$|R

5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{chilling}} water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 2005, {{the crew}} began {{shooting}} at Dominica, a location Verbinski had selected {{as he felt}} it fitted the sense of remoteness he was looking for. However, this was also a problem; the Dominican government were completely <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> scale of a Hollywood production, as while the 500-strong crew occupying around 90% of the roads on the island they had trouble moving around on the underdeveloped surfaces. The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving the Pelegosto and the forest segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief. Dominica was also used for Tia Dalma's shack. Filming on the island concluded on May 26, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and <b>unprepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> war; {{outdated}} equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly {{had a profound effect}} on the outcome of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also said he felt he had stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back.|$|E
