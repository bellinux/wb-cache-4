Each GPC examines the policies, programmes and proposed legislation of a particular government ministry, provides the ministry with feedback and suggestions, and is consulted by the ministry on issues of public interest.|$|E

The quarantine station received the call at 7:56 p.m. They blew the emergency whistle, and five minutes later Captain Thomas Riley took out the government steamer Madge to go to the scene (Madge as the quarantine vessel always had steam <b>up,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> never knew when a ship might arrive.) When they got there, they cruised around in the dark for about two hours looking for bodies or wreckage, but found none.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the legal}} system is assumed to contain some earlier law {{influenced}} by the church, and adaptation through methods of reasoning the Irish jurists would have sanctioned. There is dispute, however, as to just how large a role each of these aspects may have played in creating the legal texts. The subject is an important scope for debate. There is, however, one area where scholars have found material that is clearly old. A number of legal terms {{have been shown to}} have originated in the period before the Celtic Languages split <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are preserved in both Old Irish and in the Welsh legal texts. On the other hand, this is not regarded as unquestionable evidence that the practices described by such terms are unchanged or even have their origins in the same period as do the terms.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{marked the}} climax of the {{relationship}} between Maggie Greene and Glenn, in which they engage in sexual intercourse at a pharmacy. Writer Robert Kirkman insisted {{that it was important to}} view the storyline in a different perspective, explaining, [...] "I don't think we wanted to turn that into some kind of steamy, pornographic sex romp." [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] marked a turning point in the character development of Daryl Dixon. It contains a monologue that references the cherokee rose and its association to the Trail of Tears. The scene was devised and written by Evan Rielly. [...] "I was actually on set during the filming of that," [...] stated Kirkman. [...] "Almost every actor in the cast showed <b>up,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> absolutely loved that scene and they wanted to see Melissa and Norman’s portrayal of it as it unfolded." ...|$|E

The writers’ agents sent denial after denial for interview requests and eventually stopped responding altogether." [...] He added, [...] "There was one 'D'oh!' in James L.

It was revealed that one had failed to disclose that he had a criminal record during the application process, while information on the second contestant was withheld. A third contestant was subsequently removed by ITV. Each contestant was from a different night, with the first removed on the programme aired 7 September; however footage pre–filmed revealed his identity. One of the three contestants removed, Ryan Keating, was later interviewed by The People, which revealed that he received a 12–month community order and £50 fine in 2008 after he got into a drunken altercation with his wife. He argued that he should not have been removed from the show, saying that he [...] "was honest with them from the outset. I've been totally on the level.

Diệm went on to predict that [...] "sometime I'm going to get shot right {{in the back of the}} neck. Sometime they'll get me that way". (He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that [...] "e don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more... had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition. If we take these people in, there will be another opposition springing <b>up,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are controversial men." [...] Madame Nhu added, [...] "ou open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> know how true it is.'" ...|$|E

500|$|On 21 October, {{soldiers}} again attacked an army {{barracks in}} what the New York Times said was a coup attempt against the interim government. It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions {{that he was the}} power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: [...] "People say I’m a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are the people who came in {{to pick up the pieces}} after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give <b>up</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have nothing to eat."
