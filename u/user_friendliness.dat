Several reviews noted the gameplay's similarity to Ocarina of Time despite the cel-shaded graphics, though they praised enhancements {{such as the ability}} to move the camera, counter attacks, and use enemy items. IGN reassured players that beyond visual differences between The Wind Waker and Ocarina, [...] "these two games are very much alike". Game Informer wrote that the gameplay expanded upon that in its predecessors to become [...] "far greater, deeper, and more complex", while Electronic Gaming Monthly said that [...] "Wind Wakers core gameplay is the best the series has ever had". On the other hand, Edge said that while the game would awe new players, its similarity to previous Zelda games meant that veteran players may find it [...] "'merely' brilliant." [...] Famitsu wrote that the game's <b>user</b> <b>friendliness</b> would appeal even to novice players. IGN praised the intuitive controls, the especially interactive environment, and the variety of game actions, which [...] "can be executed with a precision that few other games could offer". GameSpot appreciated the breadth of items that can be used. Electronic Gaming Monthly said that the high variety of options for progressing through fights and puzzles kept the game from ever getting boring. GamePros Star Dingo enjoyed the variety of combo attacks and puzzles, and called the game [...] "a combination of vivid artistry and timeless gameplay".|$|E
2500|$|Revolver {{technology}} {{lives on}} in other weapons used by the military. Some autocannons and grenade launchers use mechanisms similar to revolvers, and some riot shotguns use spring-loaded cylinders holding up to 12 rounds. In addition to serving as backup guns, revolvers still fill the specialized niche role as a shield gun; law enforcement personnel using a [...] "bulletproof" [...] gun shield sometimes opt for a revolver instead of a self-loading pistol, because the slide of a pistol may strike {{the front of the}} shield when fired. Revolvers do not suffer from this disadvantage. A second revolver may be secured behind the shield to provide a quick means of continuity of fire. Many police also still use revolvers as their duty weapon due to their relative mechanical simplicity and <b>user</b> <b>friendliness.</b>|$|E

The shrinking size {{and cost of}} the units and their increasing <b>user</b> <b>friendliness</b> makes them very attractive to clinicians for minor soft tissue procedures. Diode wavelengths range from 810 [...] to 1,100 nm, are poorly absorbed by soft tissue, and are not used for cutting or ablation. Soft tissue is not cut by the laser’s beam, but is instead cut by contact with a hot charred glass tip. The laser’s irradiation is highly absorbed at the distal end of the tip and heats it up to 500°C to 900°C. [...] Because the tip is so hot, {{it can be used}} to cut soft-tissue and can cause hemostasis through cauterization and carbonization.

40|$|Grounded on {{the need}} for higher {{education}} institutions to promote and practice knowledge management and research culture through technology, the present study reports the development of a web - based research portal in one government - owned university. To add ress the objectives of designing, developing, and evaluating the research portal, the study implemented three phases: Phase 1 focused on the planning and designing of the research portal; phase 2 involved the development and try - out of the research portal; and phase 3 refers to the evaluation of the research portal. The output of the design and development phases is a web - based research portal that has automated features on research procedures, publication processes, database management, and research dissem ination and utilization. The results of the quantitative part of the evaluation phase indicate that the research portal has high to excellent quality in terms of the following features: construction and features; design and aesthetics; completeness; accura cy; functionality; usefulness; and <b>user</b> - <b>friendliness.</b> The high to excellent rating may be sourced from the novelty of the program, but the platform’s user - friendly features encouraged users of all ages, to make their research activities more manageable and more efficient. Qualitative comments from the evaluation of the portal supported the quantitative results although certain limitations were identified for the enhancement of the research portal. Researchers recommend that the web - based research portal be fully operational and be made accessible to various stakeholders while continually monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing its design and features...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{our world}} has {{witnessed}} major {{improvements in the}} areas of transportation and telecommunications. These important changes have permitted the rise of the phenomenon of globalization by which regional economies, societies, and cultures have become integrated through a global network of people. As a result, all the emerging needs of modern life accentuate the importance of learning foreign languages (Kurata 2010). Considering the scientific area of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), there is an increasing interest in the use of computer-assisted foreign language instruction (Virvou & Troussas 2011). In this way, students may learn a foreign language, by using a computer-assisted application. Especially, when these systems offer the possibility of multiple-language learning at the same time, the students may further benefit from this educational process (Virvou et al. 2000). The need for tutoring systems that may provide <b>user</b> interface <b>friendliness</b> and also individualized support to errors via a student model are even greater when students are taught more than one foreign languages simultaneously (Virvou & Troussas 2011). A solution to this problem may be the integration of the technology of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), so as to provide adaptive tutoring to individual students. ITSs offer intelligence and adaptivity to individual students’ needs, via student modeling. The individual student model for each student contains information about the knowledge level and the error handling of the student in each concept of multiple language learning. Hence, error diagnosis is a module which supports the students while studying theory and solving exercises (Tsiriga & Virvou 2004). Socialization has important pedagogical implications in collaborative learning that support the learners’ personal relationships and social interaction with their classmates (Caballé et al. 2010). Therefore, the support of collaboration in multiple language learning may promote the learning process. When adaptive personalized e-learning systems could accelerate the learning process by revealing {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each student in a collaborative environment, they could dynamically plan lessons and personalize the communication and didactic strategy (Licchelli et al. 2004). Machine learning techniques can be used for acquiring models of individual users interacting with educational systems and group them into communities or stereotypes with common interests (Papatheodorou 2001), so that the student reap the benefits of collaboration.|$|R

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{indicators of}} recovery from schizophrenia yielded two concepts of recovery. The {{first is the}} reduction of psychiatric symptoms and functional disabilities ('clinical recovery'), while the second describes the individual adaptation process to the threat posed to the individual sense of self by the disorder and its negative consequences ('personal recovery'). Evidence suggests that both perceptions contribute substantially {{to the understanding of}} recovery and require specific assessment and therapy. While current reviews of measures of clinical recovery exist, measures of personal recovery have yet to be investigated. Considering the steadily growing literature on recovery, this article gives an update about existing measures assessing personal recovery.; A literature search for instruments was performed using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO&PSYNDEXPlus, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were: (1) quantitative self-report measures; (2) specifically developed for adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or at least applied to individuals suffering from severe mental illness; (3) empirically tested psychometric properties and/or published in a peer-reviewed, English-language journal. Instruments were evaluated with regard to psychometric properties (validity and reliability) and issues of application (<b>user</b> and administrator <b>friendliness,</b> translations).; Thirteen instruments met the inclusion criteria. They were individually described and finally summarized in a table reflecting {{the pros and cons of}} each instrument. This may enable the reader to make an evidence-based choice for a questionnaire for a specific application. The Recovery Assessment Scale is possibly the best currently available measure of personal recovery when all evaluation criteria are included. However, the ratings listed in the current paper depended on the availability of information and the quality of available reports of previous assessment of the measurement properties. Considering the significant amount of information lacking and inconsistent findings, further research on the reviewed measures is perhaps more important than the development of new measures of personal recovery...|$|R
