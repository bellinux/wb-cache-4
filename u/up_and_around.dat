A walkway was constructed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the canopy, allowing visitors to view figures of the royal party exiting the waiting room and the queen boarding her Ascot landau. Over seventy wax figures of 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards formed part of this scene.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{somewhere on}} the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, Nór had either gone all the way <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the Gulf, or skied across; it was winter, and the gulf might have been frozen. Nór ended up attacking the area around Trondheim in central Norway and later the lake {{district}} in the south, conquering the country and uniting it under his rule. There {{is no mention of}} Kvenland after that. Again only a handful of words are devoted to Kvenland, mainly telling where it was.|$|E

Based on the {{information}} revealed, the Birkarls then inhabited areas, e.g., in Northern Hälsingland, which covered the western coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and from there all the way <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the gulf to Oulu River. Tälje Charter is a state treaty ratified between the Kvens and the Swedish crown, in which the king of Sweden guarantees the Brkarl Kvens trading and tax-collecting rights as chief enforcement officers (Swedish term: Fogde) in the North.|$|E

25|$|Receiving {{an influx}} of Irish, Italian and other {{immigrants}} in the 1930s, the Castro gradually became an ethnically mixed working-class neighborhood, and it remained so until the mid-1960s. There was originally a cable car line with large double-ended cable cars that ran along Castro Street from Market Street to 29th St., until the tracks were dismantled in 1941 and the cable car line {{was replaced by the}} 24 MUNI bus. The Castro {{is at the end of}} the straight portion of the Market Street thoroughfare, and a mostly residential area follows Market Street as it curves and rises <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the Twin Peaks mountains.|$|E
500|$|Flower spikes {{are held}} erect and are {{typically}} terminal on a branch; often other branchlets grow <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> a spike from below. The fruiting structure is a stout woody [...] "cone", around five centimetres (2inches) in diameter, with a hairy appearance {{caused by the}} persistence of old withered flower parts. A [...] "cone" [...] may be embedded with up to 60 follicles, although usually {{there are very few}} or even none at all. Unusually for Banksia, each follicle contains just one seed. This is shiny black, oval in shape, about 20 millimetres (¾in) long, with a brown papery wing.|$|E
500|$|Emigration Canyon (Donner Hill) ( [...] west) — About a {{year before}} the Latter-day Saint emigrants, the Reed–Donner wagon train carved the first road through the final {{geographic}} obstacle between Big Mountain and the Salt Lake Valley. About halfway through, the group changed course and went <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the final constriction near the valley's mouth. The resulting exhaustingly brutal climb over rock and sage most likely contributed to the historic tragedy that befell the travelers three months and [...] to the west. When an advance team from the Latter-day Saint vanguard company came through, it chose to stick to the valley floor and hacked its way through to the bench overlooking the Great Salt Lake basin in less than four hours.|$|E

[...] He went to Chicago to receive treatment and change of air to ward off an attack of malaria. [...] While feeling badly, {{he was able to}} be <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> until a few days before his death. [...] His friends and family did not anticipate his demise would come so soon, but it appeared the captain himself did. [...] He made his will while in Chicago and prepared for the end. [...] A few days before his death, however, his condition grew so bad that his family were summoned to his bedside. [...] Thursday morning about 3 o’clock he lost consciousness, and although life was kept up by artificial means for many hours, he slept away and Friday night at midnight the final dissolution came.|$|E
500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E
2500|$|This trail {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with the Pump Station Trail and goes east to Guess Road.

The trail passes the chimney and foundation of an old hunting lodge, the mostly-intact Guess Mill Dam, enters the millrace and comes out at the chimney at the Guess Mill site. Future plans are for Laurel Bluffs Trail to extend west to Cabelands Trail and to connect with West Point on the Eno city park trails. This connection will be {{a component of the}} Mountains-to-Sea Trail.|$|E

This giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters' Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone. Some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams—unless the beams were imitation wood. She thought not.|$|E
2500|$|Borg's {{physical}} conditioning was legendary and unrivalled. He could outlast most of {{his opponents}} under the most grueling conditions. Contrary to popular belief, however, this wasn't due to his exceptionally low resting heart rate, often reported to be near 35 beats per minute. In his introduction to Borg's autobiography My Life and Game, Eugene Scott relates that this rumor arose from a medical exam the 18-year-old Borg once took for military service, where his pulse was recorded as 38. Scott goes on to reveal Borg's true pulse rate as [...] "about 50 when he wakes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> 60 in the afternoon." [...] Borg is credited with helping to develop the style of play {{that has come to}} dominate the game today.|$|E

[...] " [...] Talune's captain told the medical officer, Doctor Atkinson, that nothing was serious, but that [...] "'One old reverend told me he had been sick back in Auckland, but he seems fine now. Two Samoan kids, Tau and Faleolo, had headaches yesterday but are <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> again today.'" [...] The doctor [...] "questioned the pastor and two boys as they went by", but no one complained of being ill. Two hours later the yellow flag was lowered.

2500|$|It is {{possible}} to slow down or stop a fixed-gear bike in two ways. The first, most efficient, and least stressful on the rider's body is by resisting the turning cranks as they come <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around,</b> shedding speed with each pedal rotation. The second way, less efficient but more showy, is to bump or skid the rear wheel along the pavement. Such a move is initiated by shifting the rider's weight slightly forward and pulling up on the pedals using clipless pedals or toe clips and straps. [...] The rider then stops turning the cranks, thus stopping the drivetrain and rear wheel, while applying body weight {{in opposition to the}} rotation of the cranks. This causes the rear wheel to skid, and slow the bike. The skid can be held until the bicycle stops or until the rider desires to continue pedaling again at a slower speed. The technique requires practice and is generally considered dangerous when used during cornering [...]|$|E
2500|$|Mirza [...] is an {{offensive}} baseliner with very powerful groundstroke {{and is known}} for setting up good attacks with the sheer velocity of her groundstrokes. Her main strength is her forehand, {{as well as her}} volleying skills. Her power game has drawn comparisons to Romanian legend Ilie Năstase. She is also a great returner of serve finding many return winners during matches. Mirza goes for winners, which means she goes for lots of angles. Mirza has said that [...] "There's no doubt that my forehand and backhand can match anyone, it's about the place that they're put in. I can hit the ball as hard as anyone can". [...] "I'm not that fast on my feet", she added as her most evident weakness is her movement around the court, where Mirza usually struggles moving <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> the court. Mirza's second serve and relatively poor mobility are often quoted as her big weaknesses. But by 2012, a series of injuries had effectively ended her singles career.|$|E
2500|$|The Fool {{leads the}} {{procession}} {{and has the}} right to kiss any woman on the way. Once at the green in front of Parish Church, at around 2:30pm, the Fool makes his traditional speech of welcome standing on an old mounting block in front of the church known as the Mowbray Stone. During this speech a fire is lit with damp straw behind him. The smoke rises <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> him and this is known as ‘Smoking the Fool’. This is in fact a watered-down version of the earlier custom (abandoned {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century due to its obvious danger) in which a more substantial fire was lit with damp straw beneath a tree. The Fool was then suspended over the fire and swung back and forth until he was almost suffocated before being cut down and dropped into the fire, where he had to make his escape as best he could. At the end of the speech, the Fool finishes with the traditional words that the crowd chant along with him. They are: [...] "hoose agen hoose, toon agen toon, if a man meets a man knock 'im doon, but doan't 'ot 'im," [...] which translates as: [...] "house against house, town against town, if a man meets a man, knock him down but don’t hurt him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{moved around}} Schofield's now rapidly {{retreating}} force, Hood hoped {{to catch and}} destroy it near Spring Hill, {{to the north of}} Columbia. The 33rd Alabama and her sister regiments were moved rapidly along back-country roads and through fields and woods, with the men required to keep in ranks at all times while stragglers were dealt with severely. Forrest's cavalry arrived at the crossroads around 11:30am on November 29; they ran into elements of the Federal IV Corps, which had been rushed ahead to hold the crossing until the rest of Schofield's army could arrive. Cleburne's division arrived in the afternoon just as Forrest's men were about to exhaust their ammunition; they immediately deployed for an attack, with the 33rd Alabama crossing a small stream and advancing around 4:00pm with the rest of their division toward a Federal brigade under the command of Colonel Luther Prentice Bradley. Cleburne staggered his brigades in echelon formation, with Lowrey's Brigade on the far right. [...] Lowrey's men engaged first, with the 33rd advancing [...] "across a slope and across a field, [...] the Federals from behind some rail defenses, then on <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>around...</b> a horse lot rail fence, barn and dwelling where we were making a stand... we followed them down a slope, where we halted and reformed the line." [...] With Cleburne personally leading Govan's Arkansas Brigade in support of their Alabama comrades, his division soon routed the Federals and advanced toward Schofield's line of march on the Columbia Pike. Here they were stopped cold by Federal artillery; as darkness fell, the entire Confederate attack ground to a halt. Although Hood planned to attack Schofield's approaching army in the morning, the Federals slipped by him in the darkness as he and his men slept, moving on to the nearby town of Franklin, where the 33rd and the rest of Hood's army were about to experience their worst day of the war.|$|E
