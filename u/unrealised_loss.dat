It first provides a brief analysis of IAS 39 and fair value accounting for financial instruments. It then sets out the relationship with the Basel II banking regulatory regime. The main part of the paper is a chronological presentation of the events of 2008 as they impact upon the international standard-setting institution. In particular, we analyse the impact of the G 20 requirements and the blunt intervention of the European Commission that led to amendments to IAS 39. The final part of the paper looks at the consequences as they are so far discernible and the damage done to the IASB by shooting the messenger...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the links that continue to be forged between security pricing and accounting, building on recent findings that firms tend to be asymmetrically conservative in the timeliness of earnings recognition. The evidence is that firms in the European Union tend to recognise <b>unrealised</b> <b>losses</b> more quickly in their earnings than unrealised gains (Giner and Rees, 2001; Raonic et al., forthcoming), and {{there is evidence of}} even greater accounting conservatism in the USA (Basu, 1997; Ball et al., 2000; Givoly and Hayn, 2000). This paper investigates whether the Czech market exhibits conformity with the behaviour that has been documented elsewhere by examining the earnings/returns relationship, focusing to begin with on the impact of losses on earnings response coefficients and then considering the asymmetric timeliness of income recognition in the Czech market. The findings indicate that the Czech market is similar to more developed markets, at least in one respect: there is statistically significant evidence of different market effects of profits and losses, in that profits are more persistent than losses. However, contrary to the findings in more developed markets, there is no statistically significant evidence of earnings conservatism in the Czech market. These results are most probably due to the continuing influence of restrictive tax regulations that mitigate any tendency towards conservatism, as well as the transitional nature of the economy. A further reason is likely to be that the regulatory environment in the Czech Republic is close to the kind of stakeholder corporatism that is described by Ball et al. (2000), who show that conservatism tends to be less pronounced in such regimes where there are fewer managerial incentives to bias current earnings. In conclusion, if changes in market prices signal good news and bad news about future risky outcomes, {{there is no evidence of}} asymmetry in the Czech market in accounting for such risks. ...|$|R

From 2005, the Australian accounting standard on financial instruments, AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, requires measurement of financial instruments based on fair values.

Further analysis provides evidence that the explanatory power of net fair value and the <b>unrealised</b> gain or <b>loss</b> beyond the book value and earnings valued at historical costs is very low...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of International Accounting Standard 41 (IAS 41) for European Union (EU) entities reporting on material holdings of forest assets. To all intents and purposes, Australia has been a test for IAS 41 because of the close similarities between IAS 41 and the relevant Australian regulation on forestry that has been operational {{for the last four}} years. The Australian reporting experience is used to identify potential implications for EU reporting entities. Evidence suggests that constituents’ key concerns with IAS 41 relate to the measurement 1 of biological assets at fair value and the inclusion in income of <b>unrealised</b> gains or <b>losses</b> from measuring these assets at fair value. These concerns are borne out by the Australian experiences. Evidence is presented that suggests that compliance with IAS 41 will allow statement preparers a choice of methods to determine the fair value of timber assets. Additionally, it seem likely that the recognition of <b>unrealised</b> gains and <b>losses</b> from timber assets from changes in fair value and the harvest of agricultural produce will markedly affect income statements, introducing greater volatility into reported income. The impact has been greater for government departments. The median timber gain expressed as a percentage of net profit ranged from 44. 5 % to 79. 9 % in individual years. An unresolved issue has been identified – do such accounting procedures reflect the nature of investment in forestry...|$|R
40|$|The IASB and FASB are {{currently}} conducting a project on performance reporting which broadly addresses the definition and presentation of income in financial statements. This study examines and compares the current practice of performance reporting under IFRS and US GAAP within a homogenous institutional setting. Therefore, {{it uses a}} sample of companies which were listed in the major segments of the German stock exchange during the period 2001 – 2004 and which voluntarily applied IFRS or US GAAP. The major results of our study are that: comprehensive income appears to provide no incremental value relevant information beyond net income in explaining stock returns; comprehensive income under IFRS provides more incremental value relevant information than comprehensive income under US GAAP; concerning the components of other comprehensive income, only <b>unrealised</b> gains and <b>losses</b> from available-for-sale financial assets in the IFRS sample are clearly incremental value relevant. comprehensive income; income components; International Accounting Standards; IAS; International Financial Reporting Standards; IFRS; performance reporting; United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; US GAAP; value relevance; German stock exchange; Germany; stock returns. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Taxation) One of the {{canons of}} context {{requires}} that a liability {{will be in}} 1986 :para 4. 47). taxation is certainty. "Certainty taxpayer be reasonably certain of what any given set of circumstances" (Margo in this his tax Report, It is submitted that, at present, {{there is not the}} desired certainty regarding the treatment of unrealised foreign exchange differences. This is proven by the internal memorandum circularised by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, advising local Receivers of Revenue to put on hold all income tax returns with <b>unrealised</b> foreign exchange <b>losses</b> and all objections to the disallowance of these losses until such time that it has, in consultation with professional bodies, been able to establish an acceptable solution to the problem (Commissioner for Inland Revenue, n. d.). No finality has been reached to date and uncertainty therefore still prevails {{on either side of the}} fence, resulting in losses to both parties. As a result of the Commissioner's instruction not to assess income tax returns with foreign exchange differences, Revenue suffers significant losses from a cash flow point of view. This is because a taxpayer is entitled to base his first and second provisional tax payment for a particular tax year on his "basic amount", this being his taxable income or assessed loss for the last tax year for which he has been assessed. For many affected taxpayers, this is their 1984 tax year in respect of which they reported a considerably lower taxable income than for their last year of assessment. This means that their first two provisional tax payments in respect of a particular tax year can be extremely low in comparison to their taxable income for their last year of assessment. There are also quite a few taxpayers who had an assessed loss for their 1984 tax year who are therefore not required to make a payment at all. It follows, therefore, that Revenue could improve its cash flow position by not allowing assessments to fall too far in arrears. Conversely, disallowance response to pay tax on purposes. taxpayers lose where they have objected to the of their foreign exchange losses and are still awaiting a their objections as, in the meantime, they will have to the basis that the losses are not deductible for tax The direct effect of the disallowance of <b>unrealised</b> foreign exchange <b>losses</b> would be that the after tax cost of borrowings from abroad would be unacceptably high, thus creating a bias towards local borrowing. In a country in dire need of foreign capital, this situation is obviously totally undesirable...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{events in}} the {{business}} world have focused attention on the importance of high quality financial reporting. Of particular interest is where the collapse of prominent companies such as Baring Plc. was due to the company's involvement with derivative instruments. In Australia, some derivative instruments are not recognised in the balance sheet. However, the Australian accounting standard AASB 1033 Presentation and Disclosure of Financial Instruments requires extensive disclosures to overcome the lack of guidance with regard to the recognition and measurement. Therefore, AASB 1033 may be regarded as a high quality disclosure standard. This thesis investigates the transparency or information quality of derivative disclosures of Australian firms in the extractive industries using 1998 to 2001 financial reports. The extractive industries {{play a major role in}} the Australian economy, where they generated exports worth more than A$ 30 billion in 2000 to 2002 (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2003 a and 2003 b). Further, firms in the extractive industries extensively use derivative instruments for hedging purposes (Berkman, Bradbury, Hancock and Innes, 1997). The objective of this study is, first, to examine the relationship between the transparency or disclosure quality of derivative information and firm characteristics. Second, this study investigates the value relevance of derivative disclosures in particularly hedge information, net fair value information and risk information. Quality is measured based on a disclosure index developed from AASB 1033 Presentation and Disclosure of Financial Instruments. A finding of concern is that the majority of firms in this study provide less than complete information and therefore enforcement power is required to ensure compliance (Kothari, 2000) Prior studies have related disclosure quality of accounting information with firm characteristics but no attempt has been made to relate those characteristics with the disclosure quality of derivative instruments. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the relationship between firm characteristics and the quality of derivative disclosures. Firm characteristics investigated are size, profitability, price-earnings ratio, market-to-book ratio, research and development activity, auditor, debt-to-equity ratio and type of extractive firm. This study finds that the variables, firm size, price-earnings and debt-to-equity ratios are associated with the disclosure quality of derivative information. To a lesser extent, the variables, market-to-book ratio and profitability, are also associated with disclosure quality. High disclosure quality has been argued to lead to a reduction in the cost of debt (Sengupta, 1998) and equity (Botosan, 1997), resulting in higher security prices (Miller and Bahnson, 2002). The results of this study indicate that high quality derivative information, as represented by the disclosure index, is value relevant. Market participants do consider hedge information and risk information components as important for decision-making. However, examining the specific information disclosed in the financial statements indicate that some of the disclosed information such as the <b>unrealised</b> gain or <b>loss</b> on financial assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments are not significant. These results contribute to the value relevance literature as this study focuses on the extractive industries which have been neglected in the literature. This study provides important information for standard setters and regulators for future directions in developing accounting standards and is particularly relevant for the impending adoption of International Accounting Standards...|$|R
