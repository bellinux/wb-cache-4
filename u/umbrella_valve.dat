40|$|Conventional {{gasoline}} engine with an <b>umbrella</b> <b>valve</b> control cylinder intake and exhaust, {{in order to}} achieve sealing effect, the valve is driven by the spring force; at the same time, when the cam opens the valve to overcome the spring force acting. Sealing the better, the more power consumed in the engine mechanical losses, the valve mechanism consumes about 30 %, which is not a small loss! This article describes a new type of rotary valve is to significantly reduce mechanical losses, so as to achieve energy saving purposes...|$|E
