For comparison purposes, samples of old corrugated cartons were also slushed and used. Pulps were ground and screened through a 200 mesh screen (accepts were less than 75  μm in size) using a Wiley mill. The fines were not ground given their small particle size.

30|$|The {{presence}} of significant mineral particles {{can reduce the}} yield of sugar by interference with {{the action of the}} enzymes. Most often, this can take the form of simple competitive adsorption of the enzymes reducing the net activity in solution. The impact of mineral fillers was demonstrated in the present study by mixing kaolin or calcium carbonate filler with samples of <b>unbleached</b> hardwood <b>kraft</b> pulps and subjecting them to hydrolysis. The hydrolysis yield was measured for several enzyme dosages. The results indicate that calcium carbonate particles have a dramatic impact, reducing hydrolysis yields as compared to kaolin, which was minimally active.|$|R
50|$|Wood fiber, {{distinguished}} from vegetable fiber, is from tree sources. Forms include groundwood, lacebark, thermomechanical pulp (TMP), and bleached or <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> or sulfite pulps.

50|$|Fodder: Not {{widely used}} as fodder, but in India 1-year-old {{plantations}} are browsed by cattle. Apiculture: The flowers {{are a source}} of pollen for honey production. Fuel: A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark. Fibre: The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Large-scale plantations have already been established, as in Kerala, India, for the production of pulp. Timber: The sapwood is yellow; the heartwood light brown to dark red, straight grained and reasonably durable. The wood has a high basic density (500-650 kg/m³), is fine-grained, often attractively figured and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available. Tannin or dyestuff: The bark contains sufficient tannin (13-25%) for commercial exploitation and contains 6-14% of a natural dye suitable for the soga-batik industry. In India, the bark is collected locally for use as tanning material. A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark. Other products: An edible mushroom, Tylopylus fellus, is common in plantations of A. auriculiformis in Thailand.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} filler on hydrolysis yield, synthetic reject mixtures were generated in the laboratory using <b>unbleached</b> softwood <b>kraft</b> pulp (USKP) mixed with various proportions of calcium carbonate (in two commonly used forms: ground, GCC, and precipitated, PCC) and kaolin. The filler content was varied to understand the influence of each on hydrolysis yield. The total filler content in this mixture was adjusted to yield comparable filler content levels in the original fines (the proportions of calcium carbonate and kaolin were adjusted to a total of 30  % (w/w) and the ratio of fillers was varied between 0 and 30  %) (Lavrykov and Ramarao 2012; Singh et al. 2009).|$|R

30|$|Change in the {{oxidation}} state of manganese atoms in <b>unbleached</b> hardwood <b>kraft</b> pulp (UKP) during the biological bleaching of UKP withPhanerochaete sordida YK- 624 {{was determined by}} the electron spin resonance (ESR) method. The spectrum of Mn(II), which reveals hyperfine splitting, was not observed in the ESR analysis of UKP, but the spectrum for manganese dioxide was observed. After fungal treatment of UKP withP. sordida YK- 624, the spectrum of Mn(II) was detected. The reduction of manganese dioxide was triggered by the increase in NADPH-dependent ferrireductase activity. It is concluded that the manganese dioxide dominant in UKP was reduced byP. sordida YK- 624 to Mn(II), which stimulates the production and function of manganese peroxidase.|$|R
30|$|We also {{conducted}} control experiments {{with a sample}} of an <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> hardwood pulp (UKHP: sugar maple) in the never dried state and another sample of an <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> softwood pulp (UKSP: spruce) obtained as dried laps and reslushed in water. The hydrolysis was conducted with a dosage of 50 FPU of cellulase at 50  ℃ for 72  h and the yields were measured after 72  h. The yields of the Avicel, UKHP, UKSP and the fines sample were 92 (4.5), 92 (1.3), 58 (1.8) and 44 (1.7), respectively. The yields were determined from an assay of the sugars and the numbers in the parentheses represent the standard deviations determined from hydrolysis runs in triplicates. Nearly all the cellulose in Avicel was readily converted into glucose. Similarly, the conversion of the sample of the <b>unbleached</b> <b>Kraft</b> hardwood pulp (UKHP) was extremely high. <b>Unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> softwood pulp (UKSP) shows lower yields primarily because this pulp was dried and reslushed before enzymatic hydrolysis. The process of drying causes the pulps to hornify, i.e., limits the accessibility of cellulose by reducing the cell wall porosity. Upon reslushing, therefore, a dried pulp fiber will not rehydrate to the same extent as virgin fibers and the cellulases are blocked from entering the crystalline structure (Cao et al. 1999). The maximum hydrolysis yield was around 44  % of OD (oven dry mass basis) fines and was found at 50 FPU of the enzyme. The maximum hydrolysis yield was the same at 100 FPU but is not shown here.|$|E

40|$|Kraft pulp fibers lose inter-fiber bonding ability {{when they}} are dried during the {{manufacture}} of paper. Adverse environmental consequences of this loss include (a) limitations {{on the number of}} times that kraft fibers can be recycled, (b) reduced paper strength, sometimes making it necessary to use heavier paper or paperboard to meet product strength requirements, increasing the usage of raw materials, (c) decreased rates of paper production in cases where the fiber furnish has been over-refined in an attempt to regain inter-fiber bonding ability. The present study is the first of its type to focus on <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> fibers, which are a main ingredient of linerboard for corrugated containers.

40|$|Direct {{synthesis}} of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on cellulose fiber {{has been successfully}} performed via facile green approach using lignin-containing <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> softwood pulp. The resulting AuNPs composited fibers showed apparent color change from pale yellow to purplish-dark brown by varying the amount of gold ions (Au 3 +) due to the surface plasmon resonance of nanogold. Further confirmation of AuNP formation on the fiber surface was conducted by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that gold nanoparticles formed on the fiber are well-defined pure metallic gold, indicating that Au 3 + ions are efficiently bioreduced into Au 0 and bind to the fiber surface. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by decomposition of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) in dark and light condition.

30|$|The role of Tween 80 in biobleaching of <b>unbleached</b> {{hardwood}} <b>kraft</b> pulp (HWKP) with manganese peroxidase (MnP) was investigated. Among the surfactants (e.g., Tween 80, Tween 20, CHAPSO) {{the most}} significant brightness increase was obtained with Tween 80. Tween 80 and Tween 20 exhibited several effects, such as dispersion of degraded lignin and activation of MnP, that partly contributed to the brightening of HWKP during MnP treatment. However, these characteristics did not explain the most appreciable effect on the brightness increase by Tween 80. Lipid peroxidation of surfactants during MnP biobleaching was determined by measuring the peroxide value (POV). The order of the POV increase was consistent {{with that of the}} brightness increase of pulp during MnP treatment in the presence of various surfactants or linolenic acid. However, radicals and peroxides derived from lipid (linolenic acid) peroxidation by lipoxidase hardly brightened the HWKP by themselves. These results suggested that Tween 80 was peroxidized by Mn(III), and that Mn(III) and lipid peroxidation of Tween 80 synergistically brightened HWKP.|$|R
40|$|Hot water {{extraction}} (HWE) of pulp in a flow-through reactor was evaluated {{as a method}} to purify paper-grade pulps. About 50 – 80 % of the xylan and up to 50 % of the lignin in <b>unbleached</b> birch <b>Kraft</b> pulp was extracted by the HWE without losses in cellulose yield. The residual xylan content in the extracted pulps was predominantly too high for dissolving-grade applications, {{but some of the}} pulps with a xylan content of 5 – 7 % might still be suitable as rayon-grade pulps. Increasing extraction temperature lowered the xylan content at which cellulose yield started to decrease. Furthermore, at any given xylan content, increasing extraction temperature resulted in cellulosic pulp with higher degree of polymerization. The extracted xylan was recovered almost quantitatively as xylo-oligosaccharides. The results suggest that HWEs at elevated temperatures may be applied to purify cellulosic pulps, preferably containing a low xylan content, and to recover the extracted sugars.

40|$|The {{influence}} of high temperature pressing on paper properties was investigated. Handsheets made of TMP, bleached and <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp were pressed {{in a press}} simulator with the press surface heated to 300 °C. The density, tensile strength and air permeance of the press dried sheets are compared with the values for conventionally pressed and dried reference sheets.

A further increase to 300 °C gave only a minor compressibility increase. The increase in density and tensile index for the press dried sheets is higher for the high yield, low refined sheets than for the bleached kraft sheets. The air permeance of the press dried sheets was significantly lower than that of the conventionally pressed and dried sheets for TMP and for the low refined <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft.</b> The bleached sheets showed the reverse behaviour and the air permeance was higher after press drying.

40|$|The {{formation}} of organically bound chlorine during the bleaching of chemical pulp with chlorine dioxide {{can be reduced}} by equimolar replacement of part of the chlorine dioxide by chlorite.

The addition of hydrogen peroxide also reduces the {{formation of}} organically bound chlorine during chlorine dioxide bleaching. When an <b>unbleached</b> softwood <b>kraft</b> pulp of kappa number 28. 7 was treated with chlorine dioxide at a kappa factor of 0. 11, the addition of 0. 1 % Hz 02 (based on pulp) reduced the organically bound chlorine by 20 %.

30|$|Structural {{changes of}} {{residual}} lignin in <b>unbleached</b> softwood <b>kraft</b> pulp (SWKP) during manganese peroxidase (MnP) treatment were investigated to obtain {{some understanding of}} the biobleaching action of SWKP with MnP treatment. Alkaline-extracted lignin from darkened SWKP by MnP showed more intense color and contained moreo-quinone than that from control SWKP. However, {{no difference in the}} conjugatedα-carbonyl was observed between the lignins from MnP-treated and control SWKP. The nitrobenzene oxidation analysis revealed that oxidative condensation of non-condensed lignin in SWKP occurs during an early stage of MnP treatment. These observations were supported by the model experiment in which the lignin prepared from control SWKP was subjected to MnP treatments three times, and the changes of color and functional groups in the lignin were determined after each treatment. These results suggested that an increase ino-quinone and the condensation reaction of non-condensed lignin in SWKP are responsible for the characteristic darkening of SWKP during MnP treatment. It was also ascertained that darkened lignin was degraded and brightened by repeated MnP treatments.|$|R
40|$|Bleached {{eucalypt}} kraft pulps {{are widely}} used in print and writing (P&W) and tissue paper manufacture. Among the quality requirements of pulp for these papers, xylan content has been controversial. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of xylan content on bleachability, hygroscopic, physic-mechanical and optical properties of the pulp. In this study industrial <b>unbleached</b> eucalyptus <b>kraft</b> pulp (15. 6 % xylans) treated with different NaOH loads to change its xylan content was used. Subsequently, pulps were bleached by the ODHT(EP) D sequence to achieve 90 % ISO of brightness, then refined and submitted to hygroscopic, physicomechanical and optical tests. NaOH treatments decreased the xylan content to 14. 5 - 5. 9 % using NaOH loads of 10 - 70 g L- 1. Pulp bleachability was not significantly affected by xylan content decrease.

40|$|The {{influences}} of pulp type, content of acidic groups (i. e., sulfonic and carboxylic groups) in CTMP, kappa number (i. e., residual lignin content) of <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp, and beating degree of {{bleached kraft pulp}} on the conductivity of polyaniline (PAn) -coated conductive paper were investigated. The amounts of PAn coated on chemical pulps were higher than those coated on high yield pulps, and the surface resistivities of conductive papers prepared from chemical pulps were lower than those prepared from high yield pulps. As the substrates {{for the production of}} PAn-coated conductive paper, bleached chemical pulps were better than unbleached chemical pulps. The conductivity had a significant positive linear correlation with the amount of PAn coated. The amount of PAn coated increased with increasing content of sulfonic groups in CTMP or decreasing kappa number of <b>unbleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp. We hypothesized that this might be associated with the ionizability of acidic groups and the inhibiting effect of lignin on aniline polymerization. The beating degree of pulp seemed to have an insignificant effect on the conductivity of PAn-coated conductive paper.

40|$|Three {{microcrystalline}} cellulose (MCC) samples were manufactured from bleached and <b>unbleached</b> softwood <b>kraft</b> pulp, and their properties {{were compared to}} those of the commercial MCC, Avicel PH- 101. One of the produced samples retained a large portion of lignin (10. 3 %), while the two others retained only some. The physical, chemical, thermogravimetric, and molecular properties were analyzed. The presence of lignin caused a substantial effect on the thermogravimetric and chemical properties of the MCC, as well as on its surface characteristics.

40|$|A model {{describing}} the sorption kinetics for black liquor birch xylan onto <b>unbleached</b> softwood <b>kraft</b> fibers at industrially relevant process conditions has been developed. The experimental {{results support the}} suggestion that xylan sorption is a physical process.

The effects of changes in process conditions like temperature, NaOH concentration and ion strength are included in the model. The model fits the experimental data quite well for sorption temperatures between 87 and 127 degrees C. Other mechanisms affect the observed sorption at higher sorption temperatures. Consequently, more data is needed to produce a model for sorption at elevated temperatures. Deviations from the experimental data at temperatures up to 127 degrees C are proposed to be a result of competing mechanisms not accounted for in our model. These can, for instance, be the transportation of xylan from the surface into the cell wall, the degradation of xylan in solution, the removal of substituents from the xylan backbone, or a decrease in NaOH concentration in the solution...|$|R
