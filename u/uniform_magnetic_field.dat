5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and <b>uniform</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E

40|$|Bearing in {{mind the}} {{application}} to the outer crust of the neutron stars (NSs), we investigate the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> decay {{by means of the}} fully relativistic Particle-In-Cell simulations. Numerical computations are carried out in 2 -dimensions, in which the initial <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are set to be composed both of the <b>uniform</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> that model the global fields penetrating the NS and of the turbulent <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> that would be originated from the Hall cascade of the large-scale turbulence. Our results show that the whistler cascade of the turbulence transports the magnetic energy preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the <b>uniform</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> It is also found that the distribution function of electrons becomes anisotropic because electrons with lower energies are predominantly heated in the direction parallel to the <b>uniform</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> due to the Landau resonance, while electrons with higher energies are heated mainly by the cyclotron resonance that makes the distribution function isotropic for the high energy tails. Furthermore we point out that the degree of anisotropy takes maximum {{as a function of the}} initial turbulent magnetic energy. As an alternative to the conventional ohmic dissipation, we propose that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in the outer crust of NSs, cascading down to the electron inertial scale via the whistler turbulence, would decay predominantly by the dissipation processes through the Landau damping and the cyclotron resonance.

2500|$|In the Faraday's disc example, {{the disc}} is rotated in a <b>uniform</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{perpendicular}} to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. It is interesting to understand how it arises that mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère's circuital law (labeled [...] "induced B" [...] in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law). On {{the far side of}} the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through {{the far side of the}} rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to decrease the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the increase in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field increases the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the decrease in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.|$|E
