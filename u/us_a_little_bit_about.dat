This nonconservation is a microscopic purely quantum effect, but it needs to be taken into account in future free-will quantum theories. Physics is mostly deterministic. Traditionally, in physics, the state of world changes with time in accordance with appropriate differential equations; see, e. g., [5].

However, the band would also cite more diverse influences (such as Robert Fripp, or Mook’s childhood love of diva singers including Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand and Billie Holiday).

40|$|À guisa de uma reflexão introdutória, são apresentadas, no início do presente trabalho, algumas das principais concepções de mito, surgidas no decurso da História do Pensamento e sistematizadas por diversos autores. O objetivo {{principal}} do artigo, porém, é dar um destaque especial ao que Freud e Lacan disseram sobre o mito, bem como à sua articulação com a Psicanálise, destacando a relação estreita de ambos com a Linguagem. Quando se afirma que o inconsciente é estruturado como uma linguagem por meio da ação significante e se constata que o mito é significante, pode-se dizer que o inconsciente estrutura-se numa dimensão mítica, no linguajar do mito. Sendo assim, o mito é um saber que nos atravessa sem que o saibamos, assim como o inconsciente. Concluímos que o mito, linguagem literária por excelência, tem a função de dizer o indizível, fornecendo-lhe um pouco de organização e proporcionando um resgate necessário à fala do inconsciente.

When its affirmed that the unconscious is structures with language through a meaning action, and its confirmed that the myth is meaningful, {{it can be said that}} the unconscious structure itself is in a mythic dimension, in myth language.

40|$|There was {{a strong}} dispute, in the XVIIIth century, about the "true definition" of "force of a certain body".

If we consider D'Alembert's contribution to make a distinction between the spatial and temporal evolution of force, we may sometimes be led to believe that the above mentioned controversy is completely overcome. As we demonstrate in this paper, some experienced teachers of physics are usually encountered showing some doubts similar to those historical ones occurred in XVIIIth century. A simple piece of apparatus was constructed in order to investigate this issue. Its main goal was to provoke some doubts about the conceptual distinction between kinetic energy and linear momentum. A case study approach was adopted to investigate the opinions of three teachers of physics, all three with more than ten years experience. Their responses exhibit similar epistemological obstacles to those someone could encounter in the minds of XVIIIth century physicists...|$|R
