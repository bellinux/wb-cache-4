The power of repeating or doubling any idea we have of any distance, and adding it to the former as often as we will, without being ever able to come to any stop or stint, let <b>us</b> <b>enlarge</b> it as much as we will, is that which gives us the idea of IMMENSITY.|$|R

PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report a 63 year old female patient who presented to our hospital with a reducible right superior lumbar hernia. She underwent repair with underlay mesh after inversion of the sac and had a smooth postoperative course. DISCUSSIONIn contrast to the classical procedure the underlay mesh modification saved <b>us</b> from <b>enlarging</b> the defect, and was quick and associated with minimal tissue injury.

From her vantage point eco-evo-devo, the study of phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic and exogenetic inheritance, have not yet demonstrated the need for any revolutionary change in evolutionary thought. For us they highlight the extent to which proximate developmental mechanisms can inform ultimate biology. 15 page(s...|$|R
