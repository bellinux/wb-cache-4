40|$|The {{provision}} of NaCl, according to current recommendations, to horses in moderate {{work has been}} shown to induce immediate postprandial acidosis. The present study aimed to clarify whether this NaCl induced acidosis i) persists beyond the immediate postprandial period, and ii) is still present after a 2 week adaptation period. Six adult warmblood mares in moderate work received daily 1. 00 kg hay per 100 kg body weight (bwt) only together with 0. 64 kg <b>unprocessed</b> <b>cereal</b> grains/ 100 kg bwt. d as fed basis. Using a 3 x 3 Latin Square, either 0 (NaCl- 0), 50 (NaCl- 50) or 100 (NaCl- 100) g NaCl/d were fed together with the concentrates in two equal doses for 3 weeks. During the final week, a mineral digestibility trial was undertaken. The middle sodium and chloride intake (NaCl- 50) at least met the most common recommendations for moderate work. Morning (7 : 00 AM) urine and venous blood samples were collected on days 0, 1 - 4, 8, and 15, and analysed for pH, acid-base status, creatinine and electrolyte concentrations. Fractional electrolyte clearances (FC) were determined. Mean apparent sodium digestibility ranged between 60 - 62 % whereas chloride digestibility was consistently above 94 %. Supplementing 100 g but not 50 g of NaCl resulted in significant reduction of blood pH and base excess as well as urinary pH and urine acid excretion. Both 50 g and 100 g NaCl supplementation caused a significant reduction in base and net acid-base excretion, urine density and potassium concentration, but increased urine sodium concentration and the FC of sodium and chloride (P < 0. 05). This suggests that a high proportion of the recommended salt doses is excreted renally. The above effects of NaCl supplementation persisted over the 2 week measurement period. Results suggest that feeding 100 g NaCl to moderately exercising horses results in mild metabolic acidosis, whereas feeding 50 g according to current recommendations resulted in compensated acidosis...|$|E

40|$|Fusarium {{pathogens}} {{can cause}} ear blight of cereals which {{can result in}} the contamination of grain with mycotoxins. The European Commission has set maximum limits for fusarium mycotoxins in <b>unprocessed</b> <b>cereals</b> and cereal foodstuffs intended for human consumption. Legislation for deoxynivalenol and zearalenone will be introduced in July 2006. A five-year investigation was started in 2001 to assess the extent of fusarium mycotoxin contamination in UK wheat production {{and the degree to}} which agronomic factors such as variety, crop rotation, land cultivation and fungicide application could affect this contamination. Each year about 300 samples of wheat from fields of known agronomy were collected and analysed for fusarium mycotoxins, mould analysis and agronomic factors. Results from the first four years show that the incidence of mycotoxins has been generally low. Deoxynivalenol was the predominant mycotoxin found. Preliminary statistical analysis of the four year dataset shows that maize as previous crop in combination with minimum cultivation were important agronomic factors for deoxynivalenol contamination. Results from the project will be used to determine “Good Agricultural Practice ” to minimise mycotoxin contamination of wheat...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 45 samples of wheat from three {{different}} locations in Vojvodina were analyzed {{for the presence of}} zearalenone. Analytical methods based on clean-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns and detection by liquid chromatography were used after validation. Limit of detection for ZEA in wheat was 18. 6 μg/kg and the limit of quantification was 56. 5 μg/kg. Recovery values ranged between 86 % and 97 %. The occurrence of ZEA in wheat was rather high with 53. 3 % of positive samples with the average value of 330 μg/kg. Incidences were found from 68 μg/kg to 1079 μg/kg. Contamination levels were above the established maximum limit for <b>unprocessed</b> <b>cereals,</b> other than maize, in as many as seventeen samples. These results were compared to the results of investigation of deoxynivalenol and fumonisin content, established in our previous work on the same samples.

40|$|In this study, the {{occurrence}} of Fusarium mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins (FUM) was investigated {{in a total of}} 257 samples of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>cereals</b> (maize, wheat and barley), sampled annually in Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout the 2013 - 2015 harvesting period. The levels of mycotoxins were determined using a validated ELISA method. The results showed maize to be the most contaminated cereal among the three, with DON detected in 85 %, ZEA in 73 % and FUM in 67 % of samples, the mean concentrations of the toxins observed during the study period thereby being 984 ± 957 μg/kg, 326 ± 314 μg/kg, and 1, 259 ± 1, 161 μg/kg, respectively. Twenty samples (7. 8 %) were proven inadmissible for consumption as foodstuffs (Commission Regulation 1881 / 2006), and 3 samples (1. 2 %) were proven inadmissible even as feedstuffs (Commission Recommendation 2006 / 576 /EC). Significantly higher (p < 0. 05) mycotoxin levels determined in samples harvested in 2014 as compared to those harvested in 2013 and 2015 could be associated with heavy rainfall periods witnessed in 2014 that could favour the formation of moulds, and consequently also the increased production of Fusarium mycotoxins...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} for the protection of public health that maximum levels are set on <b>unprocessed</b> <b>cereals</b> in order to avoid, that highly contaminated cereals can enter the food chain and to encourage and ensure that all measures are taken during the field, harvest and storage stage of the production chain. The contamination of winter wheat grain by toxins with focus on the genus Fusarium was monitored within the years 2009 – 2011 under the official control according to EC Regulation 401 / 2006 and 178 / 2010 on the territory of the Slovak Republic. The concentration of deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol was determined by HPLC/DAD detector and concentration of zearalenone (ZEA) by HPLC/FLD detector. Deoxynivalenol was the most common (dominant) Fusarium toxins in 2009 - 2011 with a concentration ranging from 20 µg. kg- 1 - 2 651. 79 µg. kg- 1. 4 samples contained the content of deoxynivalenol which was over the EC Regulation no. 1881 / 2006 about setting the maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuff.

40|$|Liposomes {{loaded with}} {{water-soluble}} and water-insoluble quantum dots (QD) {{were for the}} first time applied as labels in different heterogeneous immunoassays for the determination of food contaminants, using mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) as a model. A great deal of work was devoted to the optimal choice of phospholipids for the liposomes preparation and to the factors which are important for the stability and size of obtained liposomes. Thin-film hydration and reverse-phase evaporation techniques were evaluated in terms of stability of the obtained liposomes and their efficiency for QD loading. Conjugation of liposomes with proteins and the influence of cross-linkers to the nonspecific interaction of the obtained liposomes with the surface of microtiter plates and cartridges were investigated and 3 -(2 -pyridyldithio) propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester was found as the optimal cross-linker. The limits of detection (LOD) for ZEN of fluorescence-labeled immunosorbent assays were 0. 6 mu g kg(- 1), 0. 08 mu g kg(- 1), and 0. 02 mu g kg(- 1), using QD, liposomes loaded with water-soluble QD, and water-insoluble QD, respectively.

40|$|An LC-MS/MS based {{method of}} {{analysis}} to determine the four Fusarium toxins deoxynivalenol, HT- 2 toxin, T- 2 toxin, and zearalenone in cereals and cereal-based compound animal feed has been validated through a collaborative study. After extraction of the mycotoxins with ethyl acetate / water, and addition of sodium sulphate an aliquot of the organic phase was spiked with stable-isotope labelled isotopologues of the targeted analytes and dried down. The dry extract was then reconstituted with mobile phase and injected into a LC-MS. The described use of the isotopologues keeps costs down while still offering many of their benefits. This is evidenced by relative repeatability standard deviations (RSDr) between 5 and 15 %. Exceptions were T- 2 toxin at 7 μg/kg with 27 %, and at 3. 5 μg/kg with 35 %, and zearalenone at 3. 4 μg/kg with 32 % RSDr. The tested contamination ranges were 88 to 559 μg/kg for deoxynivalenol, 22 to 178 μg/kg for HT- 2 toxin, 3. 5 to 50 μg/kg for T- 2 toxin, and 3. 4 to 430 μg/kg for zearalenone. For 10 of the 20 analyte / matrix combinations (four analytes in five matrices) Horwitz ratios between 0. 6 and 0. 9 were computed, for another six the ratios were below 1. 5. The remaining four test samples were associated with Horwitz ratios between 2. 0 and 4. 4. They were the samples described above, two containing T- 2 toxin and one zearalenone, plus one complex matrix sample containing zearalenone at a low contamination level. For this complex matrix sample {{we were able to}} show the importance of proper separation in LC-MS. Because of the use of test materials having assigned reference values in this study trueness could be assessed. The observed biases were small and only significant for deoxynivalenol (- 8 %) and HT- 2 toxin (- 11 %). For T- 2 toxin and zearalenone they were insignificant. To facilitate the checking of compliance of a test result produced with this method with legislation a description on how to estimate measurement uncertainty based on these results is provided. All of the above shows that the studied method is fit for the purpose of enforcing existing and anticipated legislative limits of the four Fusarium toxins deoxynivalenol, HT- 2 toxin, T- 2 toxin, and zearalenone in <b>unprocessed</b> <b>cereals</b> and cereal-based compound animal feed.

40|$|The Swedish National Food Agency (NFA) {{has until}} {{recently}} focused its environmental {{work on the}} direct environmental impact of its actions, such as on heating, waste separation and travelling. However, since 2006 the Agency has been given another role with increased sector responsibilities regarding national environmental quality objectives and is now expected to coordinate and support players {{at the national level}} to strive towards ecologically sustainable development. With this report, the Agency lays the foundations for its work on environmentally sound dietary advice, which is based on nutritional needs. The report discusses how Swedish consumers can eat from several food groups in a more environmentally sound manner. Based on present knowledge, the report indicates possible ways to decrease the environmental impact from consumption within the food groups discussed. The report is not intended to provide definite solutions but rather act as the foundation for a continuing process where future knowledge adds to further discussion, generating tangible advice regarding the food habits of Swedish consumers. The report covers topics relating primarily to four of Sweden’s 16 national Environmental Quality Objectives (Reduced Climate Impact; A Non-Toxic Environment; A Varied Agricultural Landscape; A Rich Diversity of Plant and Animal Life) and to the national Strategy for Non-Toxic, Resource-Efficient Cyclical Systems (the GRK strategy). Overall, a number of different environmental impacts are discussed, rather than only climate-related impacts. An additional consideration was inclusion of the Zero Eutrophication objective for animal products. Depending on how the studies available were delimited, the report discusses food production, transportation and handling of food in the household. The National Food Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency have prioritised those food groups that are nutritionally desirable, i. e. products such as sweets, soft drinks, ice cream, pastries, snacks and alcoholic beverages are not included. Eggs are not included due to lack of data. Within the food group fruit and vegetables, it would be an environmental advantage to consume more Swedish apples and Swedish root crops (preferably grown on mineral soils), and less bananas, grapes and citrus. A larger proportion of organic products would be favourable, particularly regarding bananas, grapes and citrus. It would be advantageous to increase the proportion of processed products originating from raw materials from local areas and processed using the Swedish electricity mix, and also to avoid freight by air or lorry. It would be environmentally favourable to adapt consumption of fruit and vegetables to the domestic growing season and using products that store well (with litte waste relative to the environmental impact of the storage process) from harvest to consumption. This {{is not a matter of}} excluding for instance bananas, mangos or imported winter-grown salad vegetables, but of regarding and valuing these products as more of a luxury in the diet. It is thus a matter of eating more products with less environmental impact and eating smaller amounts, less often, of products with relatively greater environmental impact. Regarding cereals, rice and potatoes, it would be environmentally beneficial to increase the proportion of locally produced potatoes and to decrease the consumption of dried potato products. An increased proportion of cereal products from Sweden and its neighbouring countries would be an advantage. It would be desirable not to increase rice consumption further but rather replace it with relatively <b>unprocessed</b> <b>cereals</b> and potatoes. From an environmental point of view, organic products have an advantage in that they do not contribute to the dispersion of pesticides in ecosystems and that they are likely to contribute to increased biodiversity. A general conclusion regarding legumes is that they have less impact than meat on the environment, regardless of whether they are locally produced or imported. Seasonally based consumption could be an important aspect of fresh legumes. Long transport, especially by air, of fresh legumes such as sugar snap peas and green beans generates a disproportionately large impact on the environment. There is scope to decrease meat consumption without alterations to the present dietary advice. Lower meat consumption with appropriate prioritisation and distribution among meat types (beef, pork, chicken, lamb) may have several environmental advantages. From an environmental and an international perspective, Swedish meat production performs well according to the literature. As a first means to reach the Environmental Quality Objectives, meat consumption can be adjusted by lowering the imports of meat and animal feedstuffs. Meat imports currently represent about one-third of Swedish meat consumption. National production of beef and lamb is necessary for the preservation of grazing areas. Beef and lamb should primarily be produced from grazing areas. Furthermore, choosing locally produced meat carries several advantages. For instance, it reduces the need to transport animals and feedstuffs and it also favours a more even balance between animal production and crop production within the Swedish agricultural system. Regarding dietary fats and oils, it would be environmentally beneficial to lower the use of palm oil in the first instance, and olive oil in the second instance, in favour of rapeseed oil. It is generally desirable to choose organic dietary fats and oils. Concerning butter, from an environmental point of view, it is important that all products from the cow are utilised, i. e. both the lean and the fatty products. Bottled water is considered a luxury product without any nutritional advantages over tap water. Lower use of bottled water would make a positive contribution to the GRK strategy. Bottled water generates only a small part of the environmental impact from total consumption in Sweden, but nevertheless contributes 34 000 - 74 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. Conclusions and recommendations from the report are simplified in the following points Fruit and vegetables •	Increase consumption of fruit and vegetables •	Adapt consumption to the Swedish season •	Increase the proportion of Swedish apples •	Increase the proportion of Swedish root vegetables •	Source perishable fruit and vegetables from relatively local and regional areas •	Reduce consumption of bananas, citrus fruits and grapes •	Increase the proportion of organically produced fruit and vegetables •	Avoid products freighted by air and long-distance truck transport Cereals, rice and potatoes •	Use primarily domestic cereals •	Do not increase rice consumption •	Increase the proportion of potatoes from relatively local and regional areas Legumes •	Increase the amount of dried legumes •	Increase the proportion of domestically produced legumes Meat and meat products •	Decrease total meat consumption •	Increase the proportion of domestic products •	Increase the proportion of meat and milk produced by domestic feed •	Concerning beef and lamb: increase the proportion based on grazing and roughage •	Concerning beef and lamb: increase the proportion of natural pasture-based production •	Increase the proportion of meat from combined milk and meat production Dietary fats and oils •	Increase the proportion of domestically produced and domestically processed rapeseed oil •	Decrease the proportion of palm oil •	Decrease the proportion of olive oil •	Concerning butter: increase the proportion of butter from cows that consume an increased proportion of domestic feed In addition to the above, in order to decrease the environmental impact from the Swedish food consumption, it is vital to decrease food waste, particularly in households and food service institutions, and to decrease transport along the entire food chain. It is also important that consumers acquire knowledge about how different foodstuffs should be handled and stored in order to avoid shortening the shelf-life. There are several possibilities for households to decrease their climate impact through more environmentally sound methods of food preparation, e. g. by choice of preparation method and by climate-smart behaviour within preparation methods. Other behaviours also need to be challenged to achieve a decreased environmental impact from food consumption. To increase the effect, environmentally sound dietary advice should include advice about consumer behaviours. The report identifies areas where knowledge is lacking and where there is a need for further research. ...|$|R
40|$|Perfluorinated {{carboxylates}} (PFCAs), sulfonates (PFSs) and perfluoroalkylsulfonamides (PFOSAs) {{have been}} detected in whole blood and serum of non-occupationally exposed humans, yet sources of exposure have not been fully elucidated. The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate dietary exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), PFCAs (C 7 [...] C 11) and fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylates (FTUCAs) for the general Canadian and Inuit populations prior to the phase-out of perfluorooctyl-sulfonyl production by 3 M and voluntary reductions in PFOA emissions under the PFOA stewardship program. PFCs were measured in 65 archived composite food samples prepared for the 1998 Canadian Total Diet Study (TDS) and 68 archived traditional foods from Nunavut using a newly developed methanol extraction combined with a solid phase extraction clean up. Dietary exposure was estimated using food intake data available from studies carried out between 1997 and 1998 in southern Canada and Nunavut. PFCs were detected in eight composite food samples from the Canadian TDS and in 61 traditional food samples. Elevated concentrations of PFCs were found in caribou liver (6. 2 +/- 5. 5 ng/g), ringed seal liver (7. 7, 10. 2 ng/g), polar bear meat (7. 0 ng/g), beluga meat (7. 0, 5. 8 ng/g), luncheon meats (5. 02 ng/g), cookies (2. 7 ng/g), processed cheese (2. 1 ng/g) and peppers (1. 8 ng/g). Low levels of total PFCs (< 1. 5 ng/g) were measured in 41 traditional foods including: meat (caribou, ptarmigan, snow goose, bearded seal, walrus, black duck), berries, and fish (lake trout, arctic char). PFCs were not detected in beverages, <b>unprocessed</b> meats, breads, <b>cereals</b> and fruits from the TDS composite samples analyzed. The ranges of estimated daily exposure to PFCs were between 2 and 59 ng-person- 1 and 210 to 610 ng-person- 1 for average Canadians and Inuit in Nunavut respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in mean PFC exposure levels for different age and gender groups in the general Canadian population. Inuit men in the 41 to 60 year old age group had statistically significantly higher estimated daily exposure to PFCs (p< 0. 05) than younger men and women from the same age group. This higher exposure was associated with the consumption of beluga muktuk, caribou liver and bearded seal intestine. Traditional foods contributed a higher percentage to PFC exposure than market foods in all age and gender groups for the Inuit population. In general, caribou meat, arctic char meat and cookies contributed most to dietary exposure for Inuit, with caribou flesh contributing 43 to 75 percent to daily PFC dietary exposure. Dietary exposure for the general Canadian population was associated with the consumption of cakes and cookies, processed cheese, and regular cheese. Levels of dietary exposure to PFCs estimated in these studies do not pose any significant health risk to either population based on current toxicological information...|$|R
