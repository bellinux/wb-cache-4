This development gives rise to data protection concerns. The aim {{of this article is}} to examine how these data protection concerns have been recognized by the <b>Union</b> <b>legislator</b> in the recent and fast process towards a comprehensive automatic exchange of tax data of private taxpayers in the European Union. It will be shown that the combination of data protection rights and exchange of tax information legislation proves to be an uneasy one as the <b>Union</b> <b>legislator</b> appears reluctant to provide for data protection safeguards in Union legislation on tax information exchange...|$|E

40|$|Mutual {{trust is}} one of the {{cornerstones}} of cooperation in the field of European Union private international law. Based on this principle the rules on the cross-border recognition and enforcement of judgments in the European Union are still subject to simplification. The step-by-step approach of the implementation of this principle led to the abolition of the exequatur, often accompanied by a partial harmonization of enforcement law to improve and support the smooth working of cross-border enforcement without exequatur. In this regard, it seems that the Member States still want to have control over the ‘import’ of judgments which results in maintaining the ground for non-recognition and the possibility of relying on them in the Member State of enforcement. This article considers the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition in three areas of justice: civil and commercial matters, family law and maintenance. In these areas the European <b>Union</b> <b>legislator</b> has chosen three different approaches for the implementation of this principle...|$|E

40|$|Although not {{explicitly}} {{regulated by the}} EU treaties, EU agencies not only exist but also have increased in number and power. In addition, while EU agencies may exercise very similar functions {{to those of the}} Commission, Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) do not list agencies among the possible authors of non-legislative acts. The existing situation raises the questions {{of the extent to which}} the ongoing agencification in the EU is legitimate and what its limits are. This article addresses these questions in the light of the old and new Treaties and case law, including the just released ESMA-shortselling case. It shows that while the Lisbon Treaty made a few steps forward on the road of legitimizing EU agencies and delegating important powers to them, the scope of powers that EU agencies can have remains unclear. In this respect, the European Court of Justice’s lenient approach in the ESMA-shortselling case is unfortunate because it neither clarifies the issue nor pushes the <b>Union</b> <b>Legislator</b> and the Member States to address it. Consequently, in the absence of clear limits, further agencification is likely to persist at the risk of increasing the democratic legitimacy deficit and remaining accountability gaps...|$|E
40|$|EU {{criminal}} {{law is a}} controversial area of Union law. It is quite clear that the founding fathers of the Rome Treaty conceived the Union to primarily constitute an economic space where Member States originally had no intention to transfer their sovereignty {{in the field of}} {{criminal law}}. Despite this, {{it is clear that the}} Union subsequent to the Lisbon Treaty have gained a specific competence to legislate in criminal matters. There are however constraints as to how this power should be exercised. The constraints primarily concern the Union’s struggle to overcome Member States’ strong sovereignty claims and a perceived lack of legitimacy on the part of the Union in the field of criminal law. In terms of legitimacy, it appears that democratic participation by Union citizens is not self-evident in the shaping of the Union’s criminal policy. It is therefore essential to analyse how the <b>Union</b> <b>legislator</b> can legitimately exercise a criminal law power if the citizens of the Union do not participate in the legislative procedure. Further, do Union law and the constitutional traditions of the Member States recognise the existence of a democratic principle implying that the European Parliament shall be involved in the adoption of Union criminal law legislation? And, if so, can the democratic principle constitute a ground for judicial review of Union criminal law legislation...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade the {{collection}} and processing of human biological samples and that of related data gained an increasingly important role in both medical research and the forensic field. Th e European <b>Union</b> <b>legislator</b> tried {{to keep up with}} this phenomenon, and attempted to reconcile freedom of research in the classical biobank context and the principle of availability in the criminal context with European Union-wide data protection safeguards. In the lack of a sufficiently homogeneous legal framework European jurisdictions greatly differ in regulating the protection of genetic data. Two main country groups can be identified: Member States can be grouped along the question whether they have or do not have specific biobank laws. In countries that do have such laws, comparison is easier, and they are following international standards. Whenever such specific laws are lacking, not only the identification of the respective legal rules, but also their comparison is difficult, since the interpretation of these vague and more general laws is left to the stakeholders, law enforcement agencies, and finally to the judiciary. Since in this latter group of countries however relevant judicial cases are very rare, the interpretation of the codes and other comprehensive laws happens on an ad hoc basis, and remains invisible. Th e differing legal and ethical issues concerning patients’ data in the classical context, and suspects’, convicts’, victims’ and other persons’ data protection in a forensic context will be addressed in light of the 2003 International Declaration on Human Genetic Data. Actual examples from Central European jurisdictions will highlight the related theoretical and practical problems both in terms of bioethical research and forensic sciences {{on the one hand and}} data protection and privacy on the other...|$|E

In October 2012, the European Parliament and Council adopted Regulation 1025 / 2012 on European Standardization, the long awaited formal legal framework for the cooperation between the Commission and the European Standards Organizations. It is very unlikely that either the Court or the <b>Union</b> <b>legislators</b> were planning in these instances to affect a radical overhaul of the New Approach to technical harmonization. And yet, {{that is exactly what}} they did. The result of Fra. bo and the new Regulation is to subject European harmonized standards to judicial challenge by any disgruntled manufacturer of products excluded or adversely affected by the contents of such a standard. To have each and every manufacturer or importer complain in each and every court of the Union about each and every harmonized standard that adversely affects its position on the market, however, is much more likely to lead to wholesale paralysis than it is to increase the procedural integrity of European standardization...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} European Union law {{can serve as}} an {{instrument}} for {{the extension of the}} values of justice beyond the nation state. Approaching the question of justice from this perspective, however, presupposes three things: it challenges us to think beyond the contractarian reflex that equates justice with political self-determination by a demos; it demands that we allocate legal authority between the national and European level in accordance with their respective capacity to 'do' justice; and it requires that we construct transnational ideas of solidarity that integrate the different elements into a single, coherent, ethics of justice. This thesis offers all three. It argues that the ethics of justice that is emerging in the European Union focuses on allowing its citizens to live a 'good life', which both requires access to the positive entitlements that emerge from the national welfare states and depends on the capacity of the free movement rights to enlarge the range of available choices for citizens in deciding how to live that life. The stability of this tiered conception of justice, however, presupposes the careful incorporation of the normative assumptions that bind and connect individual citizens in Europe within the reciprocal structures that sustain the national welfare state. This thesis suggests that transnational solidarity can serve as a device for such incorporation. The first part describes a theory of transnational solidarity that distinguishes between the rights that Union citizens accrue under market solidarity, communitarian solidarity, and aspirational solidarity. The bulk of the thesis offers a critical in-depth comparative analysis of the incorporation of the demands of transnational solidarity by the <b>Union</b> <b>legislator</b> and the Court of Justice within the particular context of healthcare, education, social security and social assistance, and labour law...|$|E

Hong Kong Federation of Trade <b>Unions</b> <b>legislator</b> Pan Pey-chyou also expressed concern that increasing the labour supply by giving FDHs the freedom to pursue other employment could put other workers at a disadvantage.

40|$|The neofunctionalist {{literature}} {{asserts that}} supranational institutions {{play a crucial}} role in shaping the process of European integration. Yet, it is not apparently obvious why institutions with far less capabilities and resources than national ones can be so effective. The thesis tries to explain this puzzle focusing on the European Commission. It takes up two related questions: Which motives drive this institution. Under which conditions does it reach its objective (and, hence, affect integration). In other words, the thesis applies domestic theories of bureaucratic and executive politics to the European Union. First, it tests Niskanen's and Dunleavy's hypotheses on bureaucratic preferences on the Union competition and regional policies. It asserts the preeminence of the work-related preferences of the Commission, consisting of managerial discretion and broad scope of functions. Second, it uses a formal model of EU legislative politics and the work of Epstein and O'Halloran and of Gilligan and Krehbiel to quantitatively test the factors that increase the statutory discretion delegated to the Commission. The results show that the uncertainty facing <b>Union</b> <b>legislators</b> about policy actions, policy types and informal decision rules are the most important determinants. Finally, it uses the work of McCubbins and Page to quantitatively test the factors that increase the likelihood and the stringency of procedural controls of the Commission's functions. The results show that unanimity, level of conflict among the Union institutions and uncertainty are key determinants for the establishment of these controls. Level of conflict and uncertainty are also important factors affecting the degree of stringency in control. In conclusion, the Commission enjoys broader discretion and, hence, affects integration when 1) qualified majority is used in the Council and 2) only the Commission is in charge of implementation. However, we should be cautious about its actual room of maneuver because broader discretion correlates positively with the stringency of control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{arguments in}} favour {{and against the}} legal basis of the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament (EP) and the Council on a Common European Sales Law (CESL), published as COM(2011) 635 final of 11 October 2011. It considers the international private law {{as well as some}} individual substantive rules of both the Regulation and the actual Sales Law. Suggestions are made on how to adjust and complement this instrument in order to achieve what the European <b>Union</b> (EU) <b>legislator</b> is setting out to do and indeed what the legal and trading community, including consumers, need. Central problems with the proposal are found to be the intended exclusive role of CESL in relation to existing transnational rules of international commercial contracts and the weakly identified reasons for there being separate regimes for consumers and merchants in the first place. Both consumer and commercial contracts have specific characteristics and requirements that need legislative attention within the EU and beyond but that have not been carved out sufficiently by legal doctrine yet. Further research into the contents of typical consumer and merchant contracts, both formal and substantive in nature, is therefore needed. A consolidated and possibly separate and mandatory consumer law for the Common Market could then be tailored in a more integrated and convincing way...|$|R
