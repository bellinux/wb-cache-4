5|$|Gresley's initial Pacific {{project of}} 1915 was for an {{elongated}} {{version of the}} Ivatt Atlantic design with four cylinders. Finally realising {{that he was in}} a design impasse, he took as a model the new American Pennsylvania Railroad class K4 Pacific of 1914. This in turn had been <b>updated</b> <b>from</b> a series of prototypes scientifically developed in 1910 under Francis J. Cole, Alco's Chief Consulting Engineer at Schenectady and the Pennsylvania's K29 Alco prototype of 1911, also designed by Cole. Descriptions of those locomotives appeared in the British technical press at the time and gave Gresley the elements necessary to design a thoroughly up-to-date locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Left 4 Dead is a first-person shooter {{survival}} horror {{video game}} released in November 2008 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. Turtle Rock led the game's development, with assistance provided by publisher Valve. It puts emphasis on co-operative gameplay, in which players must fight against zombies {{in order to}} complete levels. In addition, the game features an asymmetrical multiplayer mode called Versus mode, in which players fight against a zombie which is controlled by another player. The game was built atop the most advanced version of the Source Engine {{available at the time}} and introduced version 2 of Turtle Rock's AI technology, which had since been <b>updated</b> <b>from</b> the AI used for the bots in Condition Zero. The game was released on Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360 in November 2008. The game received critical acclaim. The PC version of the game received an 89 out of 100 from Metacritic, a review aggregator. The title was thought to have redefined co-operative gameplay. The success of Left 4 Dead led Valve to develop Left 4 Dead 2, the next installment in the series. Alongside its sequel, the franchise had collectively sold 12 million copies as of October 1, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo {{presented}} {{the game at}} the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2001 as a playable demonstration. The next major exposition of the game came in August 2001 at Spaceworld, when Nintendo displayed a playable demo that <b>updated</b> <b>from</b> the previous demo displayed at E3. Nintendo offered a playable tournament of the games for fans in which a GameCube and Super Smash Bros. Melee were prizes for the winner. Before the game's release, the Japanese official website included weekly updates, including screenshots and character profiles. Nintendo followed this trend with Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in which there were daily updates by the game's developer, Masahiro Sakurai. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu reported that Nintendo advertised the game in between showings of Pokémon 4Ever across movie theaters in Japan. In January 2003, Super Smash Bros Melee {{became part of the}} Player's Choice, a marketing label used by Nintendo to promote video games that have sold more than a million copies. In August 2005, Nintendo bundled the game with the GameCube for $99.99.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Chou–Fasman parameters {{found some}} strong tendencies among individual amino acids to prefer {{one type of}} secondary structure over others. Alanine, glutamate, leucine, and methionine were identified as helix formers, while proline and glycine, due to the unique conformational properties of their peptide bonds, commonly end a helix. The original Chou–Fasman parameters were derived from a very small and non-representative sample of protein structures due to {{the small number of}} such structures that were known {{at the time of their}} original work. These original parameters have since been shown to be unreliable and have been <b>updated</b> <b>from</b> a current dataset, along with modifications to the initial algorithm.|$|E

By March 2 (UTC), 2010, owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31, 1999. Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a leap year, because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date. However, for some users, the hardware's operating system clock (mainly <b>updated</b> <b>from</b> the internet and not associated with the internal clock) needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet.|$|E
25|$|The setting {{has been}} heavily <b>updated</b> <b>from</b> its last event book series, Firestorm, which covered {{the opening of}} the Fourth Corporate War. The {{aftermath}} of the Fourth Corporate War has resulted in widespread corruption of the Net and major losses of hardcopied data, to the point that all data is intangible and recent recorded history is in doubt. An example that pops up in Pondsmith's demos at conventions, releases on the Internet, and in the finished game is that history has become so corrupted that many people in the world now believe Richard Nixon, instead of resigning over Watergate, committed suicide on camera and that memes such as the moon landing being hoaxed become prevalent.|$|E

GameSpot noted that the game's audio did fit the game, although they commented that it [...] "is largely recycled from Mario Party 4". IGN criticized the [...] "cheesy" [...] and unadventurous soundtrack, as well as a lack of voice acting. The game won the Console Children's Award at the 2004 Interactive Achievement Awards.|$|E

500|$|While {{the trailer}} did not confirm that a Tron sequel was in production, {{it showed that}} Disney was serious about a sequel. In an {{interview}} with Sci-Fi Wire, Bridges revealed that the test footage was unlikely {{to appear in the}} finished film. On July 23, 2009, Disney revealed film's title at their panel at Comic-Con. Bridges explained that the title is in reference to the story's theme: [...] "It's basically a story about a son's search for his father." [...] They also showed a trailer similar to the one shown at Comic-Con 2009, with updated visuals. At the time, the film had just wrapped production and they had a year of post production ahead of them. Because none of the footage from inside the computer world was finished, they premiered concept images from the production. Art included the Recognizer, which has been <b>updated</b> <b>from</b> the original film. Concept photos were also shown of Disc Wars, which has also been revised from the original film into a 16-game tournament. The arena is set up so that the game court organically changes, and all 16 games are going on at the same time. The boards also combine in real time until the last two Disc warriors are connected.|$|E
