50|$|The 2.4 GHz ISM band {{is fairly}} congested. With 802.11n, {{there is the}} option to double the {{bandwidth}} per channel to 40 MHz which results in slightly {{more than double the}} data rate.

30|$|Most WSN {{solutions}} {{operate in}} <b>unlicensed</b> frequency <b>bands.</b> In general, they use ISM bands, like, the worldwide available 2.4 GHz band.

For this reason, the <b>unlicensed</b> spectrum <b>bands</b> are becoming overcrowded with the increasing use of WSN-based systems. As a result, coexistence issues in <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands</b> have been subject of extensive research [2, 3], and in particular, {{it has been shown that}} IEEE 802.11 networks [4] can significantly degrade the performance of Zigbee/ 802.15. 4 networks when operating in overlapping frequency bands [3].|$|R

The task group TG3c developed a millimeter-wave-based alternative physical layer (PHY) for the existing 802.15.3 Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) Standard 802.15.3-2003. The IEEE 802.15.3 Task Group 3c (TG3c) {{was formed in}} March 2005. This mmWave WPAN is defined {{to operate in the}} 57-66 GHz range. Depending on the geographical region, anywhere from 2 to 9 GHz of bandwidth is available (for example, 57-64 GHz is available as <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band</b> defined by FCC 47 CFR 15.255 in North America). The millimeter-wave WPAN allows very high data rate, short range (10 m) for applications including high speed internet access, streaming content download (video on demand, HDTV, home theater, etc.), real time streaming and wireless data bus for cable replacement.

Early versions of the controller's radio transceiver run in the 900 MHz <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band,</b> while later versions of the controller use a transceiver that operates at 2.4 GHz. The range of the WaveBird controller is officially 6 meters (20 ft), but some users have reported ranges of 18-21 meters (60-70 ft). The WaveBird includes a small receiver unit which must be plugged into the controller port of the GameCube. Made of the same gray-colored plastic as the standard WaveBird, it features a channel-selection wheel and an LED to indicate when a signal is received. Up to sixteen WaveBird controllers {{may be used in}} the same area if each is set to a different channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band</b> in {{accommodating}} a range of wireless devices and services has led the FCC to consider opening further bands for unlicensed use. In contrast, the licensed bands are underutilized due to static frequency allocation. Realizing that CR technology {{has the potential to}} exploit the inefficiently utilized licensed bands without causing interference to incumbent users, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making which would allow unlicensed radios to operate in the TV-broadcast bands. The IEEE 802.22 working group, formed in November 2004, is tasked with defining the air-interface standard for wireless regional area networks (based on CR sensing) for the operation of unlicensed devices in the spectrum allocated to TV service. To comply with later FCC regulations on unlicensed utilization of TV spectrum, the IEEE 802.22 has defined interfaces to the mandatory TV White Space Database in order to avoid interference to incumbent services.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{dramatic}} growth in mobile data traffic {{on one hand}} and the scarcity of the licensed spectrum on the other hand, mobile operators are considering the use of <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands</b> (especially those in 5 GHz) as complementary spectrum for providing higher system capacity and better user experience. This approach is currently being standardized by 3 GPP under the name of LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). In this paper, we take a holistic approach for LTE-LAA small cell traffic balancing by jointly optimizing the use of the licensed and <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands.</b> We pose this traffic balancing as an optimization problem that seeks proportional fair coexistence of WiFi, small cell and macro cell users by adapting the transmission probability of the LTE-LAA small cell in the licensed and <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands.</b> The motivation for this formulation is for the LTE-LAA small cell to switch between or aggregate licensed and <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands</b> depending on the interference/traffic level and the number of active users in each band. We derive a closed form solution for this optimization problem and additionally propose a transmission mechanism for the operation of the LTE-LAA small cell on both bands. Through numerical and simulation results, we show that our proposed traffic balancing scheme, besides enabling better LTE-WiFi coexistence and efficient utilization of the radio resources relative to the existing traffic balancing scheme, also provides a better tradeoff between maximizing the total network throughput and achieving fairness among all network flows compared to alternative approaches.

40|$|In future networks, an {{operator}} may employ {{a wide range}} of access points using diverse radio access technologies (RATs) over multiple licensed and <b>unlicensed</b> frequency <b>bands.</b> This paper studies centralized user association and spectrum allocation across many access points in such a heterogeneous network (HetNet). Such centralized control is on a relatively slow timescale to allow information exchange and joint optimization over multiple cells. This is in contrast and complementary to fast timescale distributed scheduling. A queueing model is introduced to capture the lower spectral efficiency, reliability, and additional delays of data transmission over the <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands</b> due to contention and/or listen-before-talk requirements.

40|$|The recent global {{increase}} in mobile data traffic has service providers examining {{new ways to}} meet this traffic demand. While the licensed spectrum is the main way of providing data services, the available spectrum in the licensed band is limited and expensive.

Based on the link performance, medium access control, and advanced scheduling algorithms, LTE is an efficient way of leveraging the unlicensed spectrum by service providers. Depending on the regulation requirements, LTE in the <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band</b> can be deployed as LTE-U (unlicensed) or as LAA (licensed assisted access). However, deploying LTE in the <b>Unlicensed</b> <b>band</b> interferes with the existing technologies that use the same frequency band like Wi-Fi.

40|$|The global {{mobile data}} usage has grown nearly 70 % {{annually}} in recent years. The huge mobile data usage requirement drives the mobile industry to brace the formidable challenge and invent next-generation mobile technologies. LTE, {{as a successful}} cellular technology, has gained tremendous importance in recent years due to its high data-rates and improved data access method for mobile devices. Even though LTE still {{may not be able}} to meet the mobile data challenge due to current spectrum scarcity in licensed bands. Thus, cellular network faces serious challenges to provide high performance mobile service to end users in the near future. In order to sustain the possible increase in mobile capacity demand, utilizing the <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band</b> as a supplementary band for LTE is being considered as a promising solution to expand the capacity of mobile systems. Based on the innovation of carrier aggregation, 3 GPP has approved a study item on LAA-LTE, which will assist LTE by offloading mobile data in <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band.</b> Thus, LAA-LTE will operate in the spectrum that overlaps with WiFi, which is another popular <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band</b> technology. The concern is that LAA-LTE and WiFi are unlikely to have mechanisms to directly coordinate with each other, considering different core networks, backhauls and deployment plans of LAA-LTE and WiFi networks. The overarching goal of my research is to investigate the following two aspects: 1) Investigate how LTE will impact on WiFi using experimental analysis when both of them share the same channel, 2) Develop a possible coexistence algorithm to trigger the coexistence between LAA-LTE and WiFi in <b>unlicensed</b> <b>band.</b> M.

While the mobile data traffic including high volume of video traffic {{is expected to}} increase significantly, an efficient management of radio resources from multiple bands is required to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of different traffic types. In this context, we formulate an optimal resource allocation by using different utility functions for heterogeneous traffic and the two-step resource allocation algorithm including resource grouping has been proposed.

40|$|Since their introduction, <b>unlicensed</b> ISM <b>bands</b> have {{resulted}} {{in a wide range of}} new wireless devices and services. It is fair to say that the success of ISM was an important factor in the opening of the TV white space for <b>unlicensed</b> access. Further <b>bands</b> (e. g., 3550 - 3650 MHz) are being studied to support unlicensed access. Expansion of the <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands</b> may well address one of the principle disadvantages of unlicensed (variable quality of service) which could result in a vibrant new group companies providing innovative services and better prices. However, given that many commercial mobile telephone operators are relying heavily on the <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands</b> to manage growth in data traffic through the “offloading” strategy, the promise of these bands may be more limited than might otherwise be expected (Musey, 2013). Wireless data traffic has exploded in the past several years due to more capable devices and faster network technologies. While there is some debate on the trajectory of data growth, some notable reports include AT&T, which reported data growth of over 5000 % from 2008 to 2010 and Cisco, who predicted that mobile data traffic will grow to 6. 3 exabytes per month in average by 2015 (Hu, 2012). Although the data traffic increased dramatically, relatively little new spectrum for mobile operators has come online in the last several years; further, the “flat-rate” pricing strategy has led to declining Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for the mobile operators. Their challenge, then, is how to satisfy the service demand with acceptable additional expenditures on infrastructure and spectrum utilization. A common response to this challenge has been to offload data traffic onto unlicensed (usually WiFi) networks. This can be accomplished either by establishing infrastructure (WiFi hotspots) or to use existing private networks. This phenomenon leads to two potential risks for spectrum entrants: (1) the use of offloading may overwhelm unlicensed spectrum and leave little access opportunities for newcomers; (2) the intensity of the traffic may increase interference and degrade innovative services. Consequently, opening more <b>unlicensed</b> frequency <b>bands</b> alone may not necessarily lead to more unlicensed usage. In this paper, we will estimate spectrum that left for unlicensed usage and analyze risks for unlicensed users in <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands</b> in terms of access opportunities and monetary gain. We will further provide recommendations that help foster unlicensed usage in <b>unlicensed</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R
