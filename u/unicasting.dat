40|$|Different {{multicast}} {{routing protocols}} construct their distribution trees {{based on the}} information obtained from the <b>unicast</b> routing infrastructure. Nevertheless, the design of most of these protocols do not take into account that <b>unicast</b> routes may be asymmetric. Indeed, <b>unicast</b> routes in the Internet are very asymmetric. The effects {{on the quality of the}} multicast trees vary according to the routing protocol. These are particularly important for protocols that use the recursive <b>unicast</b> approach to allow the progressive deployment of the multicast service. This paper analyses the effects of asymmetric <b>unicast</b> routing on different multicast protocols. We concentrate on two approaches that implement the multicast service trough recursive <b>unicast</b> trees, HBH (Hop-By-Hop multicast routing protocol) and REUNITE (Recursive <b>UNIcast</b> TrEes). Both protocols construct source-specific trees exclusively, which simplify address allocation. As data packets have <b>unicast</b> destination addresses, pure <b>unicast</b> routers are transparently supported. The branching-nodes recursively create packet copies to implement the distribution. Nevertheless, the tree construction algorithms implemented by HBH and REUNITE are different. The design of HBH takes into account the <b>unicast</b> routing asymmetries of the network. HBH is able to always construct a Shortest-Path Tree. Consequently, HBH provides shorter delay routes in asymmetric networks, and provides smaller bandwidth consumption because useless data duplication is avoided. The results obtained from simulation show the effects of <b>unicast</b> routing asymmetries in the different multicast protocols...|$|R
50|$|If the DHCP server is {{unreachable}} for {{an extended}} period of time, the DHCP client will attempt to rebind, by broadcasting its DHCPREQUEST rather than <b>unicasting</b> it. Because it is broadcast, the DHCPREQUEST message will reach all available DHCP servers. If some other DHCP server is able to renew the lease, it will do so at this time.|$|E
5000|$|No {{quality of}} service (QoS). Compared to <b>unicasting</b> (the {{standard}} server-client architecture used in streaming media) no one can guarantee a reliable stream, since every user is a rebroadcaster. Each viewer {{is a part of}} a chain of viewers who can all have a negative influence on the reliability of the stream (by having a slow PC, a filled downlink or uplink or an unreliable consumer grade DSL or cable connection).|$|E
50|$|The {{protocol}} was developed {{because of the}} inherent spectral inefficiency of <b>unicasting</b> high-rate full-motion video to multiple subscribers. Additionally, traditional analog television and over-the-air terrestrial digital television signals (DVB-T) were difficult to implement on mobile devices, due mostly to issues of power consumption. ATSC, used only by the United States and its neighbors, also has difficulty even with fixed reception due to multipath, and mobile ATSC-M/H (which is free-to-air from individual TV stations) was not finalized until 2008.|$|E

30|$|Different <b>unicast</b> flows can be {{combined}} to reduce the use of network resources when there are bottlenecks in the network. Our goal is to apply CNC {{as much as possible}} while guaranteeing the QoS of <b>unicast</b> flows of different data sublayers. However, if combining <b>unicast</b> flows for CNC leads to a violation of the QoS requirement, CNC will not be performed and <b>unicast</b> flows will be separately transmitted.|$|R
5000|$|A {{point-to-multipoint}} channel, {{also known}} as broadcasting medium (not {{to be confused with}} broadcasting channel): In this channel, a single sender transmits multiple messages to different destination nodes. All wireless channels except radio links can be considered as broadcasting media, but may not always provide broadcasting service. The downlink of a cellular system can be considered as a point-to-multipoint channel, if only one cell is considered and inter-cell co-channel interference is neglected. However, the communication service of a phone call is <b>unicasting.</b>|$|E

This standard {{is composed of}} two parts: low-rate WPAN mesh less and high-rate WPAN mesh networks. The low-rate mesh is built on IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC, while the high rate mesh utilizes IEEE 802.15.3/3b MAC. The common features of both meshes include network initialization, addressing, and multihop <b>unicasting.</b> In addition, the low-rate mesh supports multicasting, reliable broadcasting, portability support, trace route and energy saving function, and the high rate mesh supports multihop time-guaranteed service.|$|E

The OMVC commissioned a study to emphasize the fact that broadcasting is a far more efficient use of bandwidth than <b>unicasting</b> the same live video stream hundreds of times to every mobile phone that wants to watch local television.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{concept of an}} IP address is in <b>unicast</b> addressing, {{available}} in both IPv4 and IPv6. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, {{and can be used}} for both sending and receiving. Usually, a <b>unicast</b> address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one <b>unicast</b> address. Some individual PCs have several distinct <b>unicast</b> addresses, each for its own distinct purpose. Sending the same data to multiple <b>unicast</b> addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.|$|R

[...] <b>Unicast</b> bundles are much more efficient because network switches route them only to devices which actually want to receive them. Despite their name, <b>unicast</b> bundles may still be sent to multiple devices, either by transmitting multiple copies of the audio data or using multicast addressing. Bundle numbers 256–65279 are reserved for <b>unicast</b> bundles.|$|R

50|$|The eMBMS {{service can}} offer many more TV {{programs}} {{in a specific}} radio frequency spectrum as compared to traditional terrestrial TV broadcasting, since {{it is based on}} the principles of Interactive Multicast, where TV content only is transmitted in where there currently are viewers. The eMBMS service also provides better system spectral efficiency than video-on-demand over traditional cellular <b>unicasting</b> services, since in eMBMS, each TV program is only transmitted once in each cell, even if there are several viewers of that program in the same cell. The MBSFN transmission mode further improves the spectral efficiency, since {{it is based on the}} principles of Dynamic single frequency networks (DSFN). This implies that it dynamically forms single-frequency networks (SFNs), i.e. groups of adjacent base stations that send the same signal simultaneously on the same frequency sub-carriers, when there are mobile TV viewers of the same TV program content in the adjacent cells. The LTE OFDMA downlink modulation and multiple access scheme eliminates self-interference caused by the SFN:s. Efficient TV transmission using similar combinations of Interactive multicast (IP Multicast) and DSFN has also been suggested for the DVB-T2 and DVB-H systems.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to a multi-user network with mixed multicasting and <b>unicasting</b> traffic. The proposed design of beamforming and power allocation ensures that the <b>unicasting</b> performance is improved while maintaining the reception reliability of multicasting. Both analytical and simulation results are provided {{to demonstrate that the}} use of the NOMA assisted multicast-unicast scheme yields a significant improvement in spectral efficiency compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes which realize multicasting and <b>unicasting</b> services separately. Since <b>unicasting</b> messages are broadcasted to all the users, how the use of NOMA can prevent those multicasting receivers intercepting the <b>unicasting</b> messages is also investigated, where it is shown that the secrecy <b>unicasting</b> rate achieved by NOMA is always larger than or equal to that of OMA. This security gain is mainly {{due to the fact that}} the multicasting messages can be used as jamming signals to prevent potential eavesdropping when the multicasting and <b>unicasting</b> messages are superimposed together following the NOMA principle...|$|E
30|$|In the “Application requirements” section, it was {{determined}} that <b>unicasting,</b> topology broadcasting, and geo-broadcasting should be supported. However, no requirements are imposed on the unicast technique: {{as long as it is}} possible to address and route data from a source to one well-defined destination, it does not matter if this destination is defined on an IP basis, or on a geographical basis. Combined solutions based on packet encapsulation (section “Combined solutions”) support both, but introduce a complexity in the routing process that could be avoided. If a networking solution would choose to only support IPv 6 <b>unicasting,</b> and not geographical <b>unicasting,</b> it would still fulfill the communication requirements, but it would not need to support the more complex tunneling. Another advantage is that the position service for geographical <b>unicasting</b> is not required in IP <b>unicasting.</b> In a similar manner, support for geo-anycasting can also be omitted without violating the application requirements, since only geo-broadcasting is demanded.|$|E

In such a setting, we study the overall performance of all multiple <b>unicast</b> sessions and propose {{a version of the}} multiple <b>unicast</b> conjecture. One of our main results is a weaker version of the proposed conjecture: Consider all the multiple <b>unicast</b> sessions associated with a number of terminals in an undirected network. Then, the common transmission rate of all these multiple <b>unicast</b> sessions achieved by network coding in the sense of Langberg and Médard [13] can also be achieved by fractional routing. © 2016 IEEE.

The first scheme {{is based on}} <b>unicasting</b> from the base station, whereas the second is based on threshold based multicasting. Long Term Evolution (LTE) is used for long range (LR) communications with the base station (BS) and IEEE 802. 11 p is considered for inter-vehicle collaboration on the short range (SR). The first scheme is shown to outperform non-cooperative <b>unicasting</b> and multicasting, while the second scheme outperforms non-cooperative <b>unicasting</b> beyond a specific number of cooperating vehicles, when the appropriate 802. 11 p power class is used.

40|$|Wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) has {{the ability}} to utilize the enormous bandwidth offered by optical networks using today's electronics. A reservation-based multicasting protocol for local lightwave networks was examined in [5]. If implemented properly, multicasting allows the use of scarce network resources more efficiently than <b>unicasting.</b> On the other hand, a multicasting protocol is usually more complex than a <b>unicasting</b> protocol. An analytical model of a multicasting protocol can enable its comparison with a simpler but less efficient <b>unicasting</b> protocol. We present an approximate analytical solution for the average packet delay in a local lightwave network, which employs the Multicast Scheduling Algorithm [5] as its mediumaccess control (MAC) protocol.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} inter-session network coding for multiple <b>unicast</b> flows over directed acyclic graphs. Our approach consists of the following steps: (i) The <b>unicast</b> flows are partitioned into multiple disjoint subsets of <b>unicast</b> flows; (ii) each subset of <b>unicast</b> flows is mapped to a multicast flow, and linear network codes are constructed for these multicast flows. These linear network codes collectively serve as a linear network code for the original multiple <b>unicast</b> flows, which we refer to as multicast-packing code (MPC). We formulate a linear program to evaluate the performance of MPC for a given partition of the <b>unicast</b> flows. We also propose a practical algorithm, using simulated annealing, for finding such a partition. Using simulations, we demonstrate {{the benefits of the}} multicast packing code in terms of achievable common rate and cost, as well as the efficiency of the partitioning algorithm in terms of running time.

40|$|Currently, the {{communication}} protocols for the World Wide Web {{are based on}} a form of <b>unicasting</b> called the Transport Control Protocol (TCP). One of the assumptions of <b>unicasting,</b> which is point-to-point only, is that the address of the remote endpoint is known in advance. This assumption, however, severely constrains the design of web information systems by forcing them to accept certain compromises, such as being highly centralized. This paper proposes the use of multicast as an underlying technology on which more robust web applications can be based. By using multicast, web information systems gain flexibility and shed the constraints imposed by <b>unicasting.</b> We also describe Jambalaya, a web information system that is based on the multicast protocol and demonstrates these ideas in two ways: by allowing users to perform sender-blind broadcasting of information requests, and by allowing information servers to perform sender-blind advertising of their most-often requested information. 1 [...] ...|$|E
