5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the <b>unreasonableness</b> of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the <b>unreasonableness</b> of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
25|$|The same {{test for}} Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> was {{referred}} to in other cases like Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2006), and City Developments Ltd. v. Chief Assessor (2008). However, the courts also considered whether the decision-makers had taken irrelevant factors into account in deciding whether the decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. This is not necessarily inconsistent with Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> as Lord Greene said that taking extraneous factors into account could be seen an aspect of such <b>unreasonableness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} <b>unreasonableness</b> in the Wednesbury sense, {{the court}} is not entitled to substitute its view of how the discretion should be exercised for what was actually done, nor is <b>unreasonableness</b> established if the court merely comes {{to the view that}} such a policy or guideline may not work effectively as another, since {{the court is}} not exercising an appellate function in respect of administrative decisions. The applicant has the burden of proving that the policy or guideline is illegal or ultra vires.|$|E
25|$|Wellbeloved, Charles (1845) Memoir of Thomas Thrush, Esq: {{formerly}} {{an officer}} of rank in the Royal Navy: who resigned his commission on the ground of the <b>unreasonableness</b> of war. (London: Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans).|$|E
25|$|The {{ground of}} failing {{to take into account}} {{relevant}} considerations and taking into account irrelevant ones may overlap with other grounds of judicial review such as deciding for an improper purpose and irrationality. For example, in Lines International, the High Court considered the ground of relevant and irrelevant considerations together with Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the nuances of the term {{reasonable}} may have allowed the UK courts to deal with the merits of grievances rather than questions of legality, and hence to engage in judicial policy-making. However, it seems that Singapore courts have so far avoided substituting their opinion for that of decision-makers in applying the Wednesbury test. In Lines International, the High Court clearly noted that in considering Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> courts are not entitled to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised, nor is <b>unreasonableness</b> established if the court is of the view that the policy or guideline may not work as effectively as another. This principle has been adopted and emphasized in subsequent cases. In City Developments the court declined to interfere with the Chief Assessor's assessment of the annual value of the applicant's real property for property tax purposes, finding his explanations logical and commonsensical. The courts came to similar conclusions in Chee Siok Chin and Kang Ngah Wei.|$|E
25|$|During 1853, Sophie Cruvelli made {{appearances}} at the Théatre-Italien {{and became a}} favourite of Emperor Napoléon III, despite, or perhaps assisted by, her reputation for mischievous ill-temper and <b>unreasonableness.</b> She was increasingly admired by Giacomo Meyerbeer, and in January 1854 she was (with his support) engaged by the Paris Opéra at the hitherto highest ever fee of 100,000 francs (about €600,000) for eight months. She sang Valentin in Les Huguenots before the Emperor and an audience of the great and famous, scored a triumph, and continued with Julia in Spontini's La vestale and with Rachel in Halévy's La Juive. With each role, Cruvelli's stature as a tragédienne was increasing.|$|E
25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 {{then it is}} also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and <b>unreasonableness</b> are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said that in terms of the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ {{went so far as to}} say that unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable. An exception is that where the search is only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, the {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation has been viewed as an offshoot of natural justice. The duty to act fairly is a core tenet of administrative law and a predominant feature {{in the application of}} the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and fairness, legitimate expectation reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of fairness that made way for the courts' acknowledgement of legitimate expectations. In their elaboration of {{the doctrine}}, courts of the United Kingdom adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness,</b> fairness, and abuse of power to justify the existence and the protection of legitimate expectations.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{lost the}} series three Tests to nil. After {{managing}} {{to draw the}} first two Tests, they lost the next three; the West Indies did not lose a second innings wicket all tour. Hughes {{did not have a}} successful tour with the bat, scoring 215 runs at an average of 21.50. The pressure of the tour told on Hughes. In a match against Trinidad and Tobago, Hughes protested against what he saw as <b>unreasonableness</b> by the opposition by treating the remainder of the match with contempt; not attempting to win. Afterwards Hughes said he could not care less about the welfare of cricket in Trinidad and Tobago; the management fined him for this comment. In the second Test, Rodney Hogg threw a punch at Hughes, frustrated that he was not given the field he wanted by his captain.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{took time}} to rally more men and prepare. By the {{following}} spring, Charles had attracted enough support to invade Neustria. Charles sent an envoy who proposed a secession of hostilities if Chilperic would recognize his rights as mayor of the palace in Austrasia. The refusal was not unexpected but served to impress upon Martel's forces the <b>unreasonableness</b> of the Neustrians. They met near Cambrai at the Battle of Vincy on 21 March 717. The victorious Martel pursued the fleeing king and mayor to Paris, but as he was not yet prepared to hold the city, {{he turned back to}} deal with Plectrude and Cologne. He took the city and dispersed her adherents. Plectrude was allowed to retire to a convent; Theudoald lived to 741 under his uncle's protection, a kindness—unusual for those times, when mercy to a former gaoler, or a potential rival, was rare.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} third types of {{consideration}} may respectively be called mandatory and discretionary relevant considerations. In respect of discretionary relevant considerations, Lord Justice Brown elaborated that there is [...] "a margin of appreciation within which the decision-maker may decide just what considerations should {{play a part in}} his reasoning process", but that this is subject to the principles of Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b>|$|E
500|$|Delivering the {{judgment}} of the Court, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin held that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a precedent fact is involved. If the discretion falls outside the precedent fact category, the scope of judicial review is limited to the normal judicial review principles of illegality, irrationality (that is, Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness)</b> and procedural impropriety. On the other hand, if one or more precedent facts are involved, the scope of judicial review [...] "extends to deciding whether the evidence justifies the decision". However: ...|$|E
500|$|The various {{grounds of}} review under the broad heading of {{illegality}} {{have also been}} termed [...] "weak", [...] "broad", or [...] "general unreasonableness", to be contrasted with [...] "strong" [...] or Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b> In Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation [...] (1947), Lord Greene, the Master of the Rolls, remarked that [...] "a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to {{what he has to}} consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting 'unreasonably.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng, academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it. One is that the definition of mala fides used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually <b>unreasonableness</b> and not mala fides in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith. In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly (1977), Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is [...] "dishonesty" [...] and [...] "always involves a grave charge". This contrasts with the meaning of mala fides in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness. Thus, an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, the Court of Appeal opined in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, {{ex parte}} Hargreaves that [...] "n matters of {{substance}} (as contrasted with procedure) Wednesbury provides the correct test". In Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947), the High Court had introduced {{the idea of}} Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness,</b> that is, a public authority's decision is unlawful if, although they have [...] "kept within {{the four corners of}} the matters they ought to consider, they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it". The inference to be made from ex parte Hargreaves was that where an applicant claimed to have a substantive expectation, it was not for the court to judge if that expectation should be protected vis-à-vis the broader public interest. The court should only intervene if the decision-maker's exercise of its discretion satisfied the Wednesbury threshold.|$|E
500|$|The case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988) is {{the leading}} {{authority}} in Singapore law for the principle that the function of a court in the review of discretionary power depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact was involved. Citing the UK case of Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ("Khawaja", 1983). Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin, {{speaking on behalf of}} the Court of Appeal, held that the scope of judicial review of an executive decision depends on whether a precedent fact is involved. If the discretion falls outside the precedent fact category, the scope of judicial review is limited to the normal judicial review principles of illegality, irrationality (that is, Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness)</b> and procedural impropriety. On the other hand, if one or more precedent facts are involved, the scope of judicial review [...] "extends to deciding whether the evidence justifies the decision".|$|E
500|$|For some time, it was {{doubtful}} that the match would be played at all. Shortly before the match, Fischer {{demanded that the}} players receive, {{in addition to the}} agreed-upon prize fund of $125,000 (5/8 to the winner, 3/8 to the loser) and 30% of the proceeds from television and film rights, 30% of the box-office receipts. He failed to arrive in Iceland for the opening ceremony on July 1. Fischer's behavior was seemingly full of contradictions, as it had been throughout his career. He finally flew to Iceland and agreed to play after a two-day postponement of the match by FIDE President Max Euwe, a surprise doubling of the prize fund by British investment banker Jim Slater, and much persuasion, including a phone call by Henry Kissinger to Fischer. Many commentators, particularly from the USSR, have suggested that all this (and his continuing demands and <b>unreasonableness)</b> was part of Fischer's plan to [...] "psych out" [...] Spassky. Fischer's supporters say that winning the World Championship was the mission of his life, that he simply wanted the setting to be perfect for it when he took the stage, and that his behavior was the same as it had always been.|$|E
500|$|The {{time and}} {{duration}} of the activity is also taken into account when determining <b>unreasonableness.</b> Activities may be reasonable at one time but not at another; in Halsey v Esso Petroleum, filling oil tankers at 10am was held to be reasonable, but the same activity undertaken at 10pm was unreasonable. A private nuisance is normally a [...] "continuing state of affairs", not a one-off situation; there are exceptions, such as in De Keyser's Royal Hotel v Spicer, where piledriving at night was considered a nuisance. In such situations, the normal remedy is to grant an injunction limiting {{the time of the}} activity. Another exception was found in British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd, where an electronics company stored foil strips on their property which blew onto adjoining land, causing the power supply to a nearby yarn manufacturers to be cut off. A similar incident had occurred 3 years earlier and the defendants had been warned to store their strips properly; it was held that even though the power cut was a one-off event, the method of storing the foil strips constituted a continuing state of affairs, and the defendants were liable.|$|E
500|$|The {{locality}} {{where the}} interference occurred also influences {{whether or not}} it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman, Thesiger LJ wrote that [...] "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [...] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [...] ". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd, it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created. The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be [...] "a misuse of language to describe what has happened in the present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood. It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning decision authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail". In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their <b>unreasonableness.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{regards the}} second question, in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{identified}} {{three categories of}} legitimate expectations. Category (b) involves procedural legitimate expectations, and so are not discussed here because breaches of them are a form of procedural impropriety rather than illegality. Categories (a) and (c) relate to substantive legitimate expectations. Category (a) cases are those which lie [...] "in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field". The public authority [...] "is only required {{to bear in mind}} its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b> On the other hand, category (c) cases are usually those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". When assessing such a case, the court decides whether for a public authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy. A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice John Laws. In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999), he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not [...] "hermetically sealed", and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach: ...|$|E
500|$|However, the courts' role in {{protecting}} substantive legitimate expectations was clearly {{established by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999). The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her [...] "home for life". The Court granted the application for review {{on the ground that}} the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying in the nursing home as promised by the local authority. It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned, courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to resile from it (such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case). As regards substantive legitimate expectations, courts would decide whether cases lie [...] "... in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field", or are those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". In the first situation, the public authority [...] "is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b> On the other hand, when assessing a case in the second situation, the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy.|$|E
2500|$|Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> is a [...] "shorthand legal reference" [...] to the {{classical}} common law judicial approach expounded in the English case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947). In that case, Lord Greene, the Master of the Rolls, described two forms of <b>unreasonableness.</b> First, <b>unreasonableness</b> can be a general description of a public authority doing things that must not be done, such as not directing itself properly in law by considering matters which it is not bound to consider and taking into consideration irrelevant matters. Another type of <b>unreasonableness</b> occurs when a public authority does something that is [...] "so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within {{the powers of the}} authority", as illustrated by the dismissal of a teacher because of her red hair. The latter has now come to be termed as Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b> However, Lord Greene recognized that these aspects of <b>unreasonableness</b> are by no means clear, and [...] "all these things run into one another".|$|E
2500|$|Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> {{appears to}} be applied in the UK on a sliding scale with varying levels of {{scrutiny}} depending {{on the nature of}} the case. An applicant must prove a higher level of <b>unreasonableness</b> for matters involving political judgment such as national security and financial administration, than for matters in which the individual's liberty is at stake. The differing levels of intensity of review are set out in the table below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> is {{a ground}} of {{judicial}} review in Singapore administrative law. A governmental decision that is Wednesbury-unreasonable may be [...] by the High Court. This type of <b>unreasonableness</b> of public body decisions was laid down in the English case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947), where it was said that a public authority acts unreasonably when a decision it makes is [...] "so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority". Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> was subsequently equated with irrationality by the House of Lords in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case, 1983). These cases have been applied numerous times in Singapore, though in some decisions it is not very clear whether the courts have applied such a stringent standard.|$|E
2500|$|Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> was {{subsequently}} reformulated by the House of Lords in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case, 1983). Lord Diplock {{stated that it}} applies to a [...] "decision which is so outrageous in the defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it". Evidently, {{this is a much}} higher standard than ordinary <b>unreasonableness.</b> A governmental decision that is Wednesbury-unreasonable may be [...] or invalidated by a court.|$|E
2500|$|In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, {{ex parte}} Brind (1991), Lord Ackner said that {{although}} the standard of Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> had been criticized as too high: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the GCHQ case, irrationality, {{the second}} broad head of {{judicial}} review, was equated with Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness,</b> {{named after the}} UK case Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947). Lord Diplock said: ...|$|E
2500|$|English cases {{dealing with}} Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> {{demonstrate}} {{varying levels of}} scrutiny. The intensity of judicial review varies with {{the subject matter of}} the decision, ranging from [...] "anxious scrutiny" [...] to [...] "light touch" [...] review.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Justice Brown {{elaborated}} {{that for}} the third category, there is [...] "a margin of appreciation within which the decision-maker may decide just what considerations should {{play a part in}} his reasoning process", subject to Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Lord Diplock's {{threefold}} {{classification of}} the grounds of judicial review in the GCHQ case – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – {{was adopted by the}} Singapore Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988). Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case preferred to use the term irrationality to describe Wednesbury [...] <b>unreasonableness,</b> and there is some uncertainty as to whether both concepts refer to the same thing. However, Singapore courts have stated that the test for irrationality is that of Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b> In cases such as Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), Kang Ngah Wei v. Commander of Traffic Police (2002), and Mir Hassan bin Abdul Rahman v. Attorney-General (2009), the courts applied the test of irrationality set out in the GCHQ case.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, where {{human rights}} {{protected}} by the ECHR are prima facie infringed, the courts apply a doctrine of proportionality {{in place of the}} Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> test. Additionally, proportionality is applied in respect of European Union law. Given these developments, the role of Wednesbury in ordinary administrative law cases has been questioned. It has been suggested that proportionality should supplant <b>unreasonableness</b> as a ground of review. The former has occasionally been regarded as superior to Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness</b> since its [...] "emphasis on balance and justification is taken to offer 'a more structured methodology'". Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} proportionality should merge with Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness.</b> It is said to share much in common with the reasonableness doctrine, as [...] "proportionality in the sense of achieving a 'fair balance' has always been an aspect of unreasonableness". As Lord Slynn of Hadley stated in R. (Alconbury Developments Ltd.) v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (2001), [...] "trying to keep the Wednesbury principle and proportionality in separate compartments seems... to be unnecessary and confusing". This may cause the [...] "coherence and comprehensibility" [...] of judicial review to suffer. In any event, as Lord Justice of Appeal John Dyson observed in R. (Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East Region) v. Secretary of State for Defence (2003), [...] "the Wednesbury test is moving closer to proportionality and in some cases it is not possible to see any daylight between the two tests... he result that follows will often be the same whether the test that is applied is proportionality or Wednesbury unreasonableness". However, English courts have been cautious about applying proportionality as it is [...] "often understood to bring courts much closer to reviewing the merits of a decision" [...] than is permitted by the Wednesbury test.|$|E
2500|$|Nor may {{the appellate}} courts adopt a {{presumption}} of <b>unreasonableness</b> as a corollary to {{the presumption of}} reasonableness the Court has sanctioned. [...] Finally, {{the fact that the}} Commission and the sentencing judge have agreed on the range in which the sentence should fall strongly suggests that the sentence is [...] "sufficient, but not greater than necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} are given, for {{the first}} time, the right to appeal decisions by judges in the Crown Court which either terminate the case or exclude evidence. The prosecution has historically {{had the right to}} appeal decisions in the Magistrates' Courts on grounds of error of law or <b>unreasonableness,</b> and the right under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to appeal an [...] "unduly lenient sentence".|$|E
2500|$|Irrationality {{has been}} equated with Wednesbury <b>unreasonableness,</b> which {{is named after}} the UK case Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947). According to Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), a public authority's {{decision}} may be quashed if it is [...] "so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it".|$|E
2500|$|CD/N-VA said Ecolo's demands {{could not}} [...] "be taken seriously" [...] because the CD without the N-VA was unthinkable. They {{also said the}} {{presence}} of N-VA was not a problem, but {{that the problem is}} the <b>unreasonableness</b> of the French-speaking parties to negotiate around the Flemish demands. Groen! said it was unwilling to participate in a coalition in which {{it is not necessary to}} obtain a majority in parliament. The need to undertake the negotiations again also meant the agreement between the partners about the prolonged existence of several nuclear power plants had to be reconsidered.|$|E
