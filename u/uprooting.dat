5|$|November 1619 – Two hurricanes strike Bermuda {{during the}} month, sinking {{at least one}} ship, <b>uprooting</b> large trees, ruining the entire winter corn crop, and {{destroying}} a wooden watchtower constructed seven years earlier. The rapid succession of two hurricanes leaves the colony with a severe food shortage.|$|E
5|$|The tornado took a {{path through}} Rockland, Westchester, and Fairfield counties, downing or <b>uprooting</b> {{thousands}} of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Janet {{skirted the}} ABC islands with strong winds {{as it passed}} to the north from September24–25. In Aruba, gusts peaked at 50mph (80km/h), <b>uprooting</b> trees. However, damage outside of trees was {{primarily}} insignificant. In Bonaire, piers were destroyed, and the island's coastal boulevard was damaged. Beach facilities at Curaçao's Piscadera and Vaersen Bays suffered considerable damage. Quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged.|$|E

They will just graze the tops, but they can’t <b>uproot</b> it. In the plains, the grass can be <b>uprooted.</b> Also the rocks don’t allow the cows {{to step on the}} grass. And in the forest, there is more shade, which allows the grass to last longer.” Mzee S.|$|R
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's <b>uprooting</b> was unknown, although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E
5|$|From 2007 to 2012, {{the number}} of round-leaved {{wintergreen}} footage increased by 50 percent. On the other hand, those of man orchid fall suddenly and continually. Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the <b>uprooting</b> of the wood small-reed, before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management. The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores. Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests <b>uprooting</b> the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of <b>uprooting</b> the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

50|$|The “Uprooted” {{collection}} (2006) contained 100 dolls, {{carrying the}} message “Look up, hold on”. One of the signature dolls {{of the collection}} finds the doll positioned on an <b>uprooted</b> tree branch. Katrina <b>uprooted</b> many old, mighty trees, but the storm also <b>uprooted</b> people's lives. Rukiya explains that she created this collection {{with that in mind}} and wants to make sure people don't forget the hardship experienced when it took the government over a week to bring help. She {{goes on to say that}} some who were <b>uprooted</b> saw a better change and planted new roots elsewhere while others chose to return to New Orleans and rebuild their lives even stronger. Her work in the collection highlights the controversy surrounding the slow government response, which many saw as a sign of institutionalized racism.|$|R

5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and <b>uprooting</b> of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|His parents imbue {{him with}} a strong moral compass during his {{formative}} years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as an outsider {{in the eyes of}} the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (<b>uprooting</b> trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E
5|$|Radical {{feminism}} {{considers the}} male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression {{and the total}} <b>uprooting</b> and reconstruction of society as necessary. Conservative feminism is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. Libertarian feminism conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference. Separatist feminism does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist. Ecofeminists see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the natural environment; ecofeminism {{has been criticized for}} focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.|$|E
50|$|In India, {{this tree}} was {{initially}} promoted for afforestation {{due to its}} fast-growing nature. However, it is now considered unsuitable for urban planting because of its tendency to get <b>uprooted</b> in rain and wind.

5|$|September 16–17, 2014: Hurricane Odile's outer rainbands brought {{thunderstorms}} {{to parts}} of Southern California, as a tropical storm. The remnants of Hurricane Odile also caused damage across central and eastern San Diego County on September16, 2014, generating high winds and several uncharacteristically powerful thunderstorms in the region. Wind gusts over 20knots reportedly <b>uprooting</b> trees, felled branches, cut power lines, crushed several cars, and flipped at least one airplane at Montgomery Field Airport. Dry lightning generated by a line of severe thunderstorms {{in one of the}} rainbands set fire to a palm tree in San Diego and storm force wind gusts within those severe thunderstorms left 6000 customers without power.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Sina {{affecting}} the Fijian islands, from November 27 until November 29, with wind gusts {{of up to}} , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. As the cyclone affected Fiji high winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the Nadi International Airport for around 20 hours. As the cyclone moved towards the east-southeast between November 27–28, it passed near to or over the south-western coast of Viti Levu, Vatulele, Bequa, Northern Kadavu and various islands within the Moala and Southern Lau island groups and caused some coastal erosion. As it moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and <b>uprooting</b> trees. The system also severely affected crops and vegetation including sugar cane and pine forests, however {{the extent of the}} damage was limited by {{the fact that many of}} the crops had already been harvested.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{did not make}} {{landfall}} in the Philippines, its close proximity brought several days of heavy rain to Luzon, leading to widespread flash floods and mudslides. Landslides across the region isolated many cities, including Baguio. Rivers began exceeding their banks on September10 and flooded surrounding areas. In the province of Ilocos Sur, ten {{people were killed in}} a single town after flood waters swept away many homes overnight. In many areas, waters were waist-deep and officials advised residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground. Tropical storm force winds, recorded up to 88km/h (55mph) at the John Hay Air Base, also impacted the country. In Zambales Province, a tornado spawned by the typhoon injured three people and caused approximately $90,000 worth of damage. Another tornado struck the Clark Air Base, <b>uprooting</b> trees and damaging buildings. Losses from this tornado reached $150,000.|$|E

5|$|On 24 February 2009 Stockport {{agreed to}} allow Gannon to hold talks with Brighton & Hove Albion, who were seeking to fill the {{managerial}} position left vacant by Micky Adams. He suggested that his family would play a large part in his decision to move clubs, with Stockport's financial troubles looming but <b>uprooting</b> his family to move to Brighton being undesirable. Gannon was made favourite {{to be given the}} job by several bookmakers, and he met with Brighton chairman Dick Knight on the 25th, before announcing on the 26th that he had chosen not to take the job. Knight had indicated that Gannon was his first choice for the job, and former Stockport players now at Brighton had shown their desire for Gannon to be given the job. However, Gannon turned down the opportunity and vowed stay with at the Edgeley Park club.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of the reconquista, the defeated Muslims were generally given freedom of religion as terms of their surrender. For example, the Treaty of Granada, which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set of rights to the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation. The increasing occurrences of forced conversion triggered a series of Muslim rebellions in Granada (1499–1501). The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were no longer given the rights that had been provided to them by the Treaty of Granada. They were given the choice to remain and accept baptism, to reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to be exiled. The option of exile was often not feasible in practice because of the difficulty in <b>uprooting</b> one's family and making the journey to Muslim lands in North Africa, the inability to pay the fee required by the authorities for safe passage, and the general tendency by the authorities to discourage and hinder such an exodus.|$|E
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves <b>uprooting</b> and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost three}} years in the wilderness, Fingleton {{returned}} to the Test arena in the First Test at Durban. After making two in the first innings, he was unbeaten on 36 when Australia reached their second innings target with nine wickets in hand. During the first innings, a 140km/h gale hit the ground, <b>uprooting</b> trees and forcing balls that were heading into the wind to do U-turns. He followed this with 62—the innings top-score—and 40 in the Second Test at Johannesburg. After taking a 93-run first innings lead, Australia needed a Test record of 399 in the second innings to win on a turning wicket, and after the early demise of Brown, Fingleton joined McCabe in a 177-run partnership that pushed the score to 1/194. Such was the dominance of McCabe that he scored more than 80% of the runs during this partnership. Australia needed only 125 with half the day remaining and eight wickets in hand when poor visibility ended play. McCabe had flayed the attack and reached 189 not out when the South Africans had the match called off, claiming that the fieldsmen were endangered by the batsman's vigorous hitting.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} {{have a huge}} impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of <b>uprooting</b> trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved <b>uprooting</b> the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of three propagation practices and three corm types of enset {{on the production}} of suckers was investigated. After removal of apical buds, mother corms were <b>uprooted</b> and immediately replanted, not <b>uprooted</b> from original positions and <b>uprooted</b> and transferred to new planting holes three months later. Three corm types: whole, halved and quartered corms were used. Suckers were harvested one year after removal of apical buds. After harvest, the suckers were sorted into three size groups: undersized, small and medium to large. The number of suckers produced per plot, from four planting holes, ranged from 40 to 141 depending on the treatments. Halved and quartered mother corms, when transferred to new planting holes three months after removal of apical buds, produced fewer suckers. On the other hand, the halved corms, when <b>uprooted</b> and replanted immediately after removal of apical buds or not <b>uprooted</b> from their original growing sites, gave earlier differentiation of buds and produced more suckers. The halved corms also gave more medium to large suckers than whole and quartered corms when evaluated across all the propagation methods. An {{increase in the number}} of vigorous suckers from halved corms is possible because of elimination of the strong apical dominance while leaving reasonable portions of the mother corm to sustain initiation, growth and development of suckers. Therefore, halved corms <b>uprooted</b> and immediately replanted or left in situ can be used to produce more suckers with better growth...|$|R
