5|$|With {{the start}} of the fire preparation, tank hunting detachments—groups of ten {{equipped}} with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines. When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of October 5, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall. Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa'iqa (lightning; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although {{by the end of the}} day this rose to ten. The air strike put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with anti-radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike. Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.|$|E

25|$|In July 1780, Montréal was escorting six ships {{destined for}} Algiers. She {{was under the}} command of Captain de Vialis de Fontbelle, who was also in charge of the convoy. At 5:30 in the morning, on 30 July 1780, de Vialis de Fontbelle noticed that four vessels to leeward had taken up pursuit of the convoy while the convoy was somewhere between the Tower of Cachique and Cape Caxine, about 12 miles from the Cape. At 6:00, it was {{determined}} that the four pursuing ships were enemy vessels, and that a fifth pursuer was coming <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time, de Vialis de Fontbelle signalled the convoy to make best speed to the Tower of Cachique. He sought refuge under its guns as it was under the control of a vassal of Algiers. The French identified the pursuing British squadron as consisting of two frigates, two brigs, and a xebec.|$|E
25|$|The squadron's first {{operation}} {{on the new}} aircraft type came in mid-February when nine Beaufighters were sent to attack Tandao in the Celebes Sea. Further low level attacks followed, during which the squadron suffered a number of losses before switching to close support operations in April as part of Operation Oboe Six, the Australian landing on Tarakan. The following month, the squadron was scheduled to move to Tarakan, however, due to space and facilities suitability issues the squadron's personnel were split <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, with the aircraft and aircrew remaining on Morotai, while the ground crew were quartered on Tarakan. They continued to fly operations {{right up to the}} end of the war in August. A total of 65 men from No. 22 Squadron were killed during the war. Its members received the following decorations: one VC, one Distinguished Service Order, 13 Distinguished Flying Crosses, two George Medals, one British Empire Medal and five Mentions in Despatches.|$|E

25|$|The {{available}} evidence indicates a construction {{date in the}} Antonine or early Severan period (late 2nd or early 3rd century AD). The scaenae frons (stage front) was certainly put <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time, as the style of both sculpture and architectural ornament suggest. Statue bases terminating the retaining walls of the auditorium bore the names of two brothers, senators in the early Severan period, and two inscribed bases placed symmetrically against the exterior facade held statues of Aphrodisian benefactors, Claudia Antonia Tatiana and her uncle Lucius Antonius Dometinus, who were active {{at the end of}} the 2nd century. Tatiana is known to have had close ties with Ephesus, and it is possible that the striking similarities between this building and the bouleuterion on the civic agora there, dated by inscription to the mid-2nd century, are due to some initiative on her part. We do not know what stood here before the 2nd century AD, but it is likely that the present building replaced a smaller one contemporary with the laying out of the agora in the late 1st century BC.|$|E
500|$|In 1839, at {{the time}} of the Newport Rising, the {{gatehouse}} was garrisoned as the authorities feared a Chartist attack on Monmouth. Later guidebooks suggest that the three loopholes visible on the tower were opened <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time [...] "for musketry in anticipation of the advance of the Chartists", but Rowlands shows that the apertures are visible in illustrations of the gatehouse long before 1839.|$|E

500|$|In 1976 a {{friendly}} at Aston Villa was abandoned owing to hooliganism. This included Rangers fans attacking a pub {{that had been}} bombed by the IRA three years prior, which drew particular criticism from the Orange Order in newspapers. The Orange Order stated [...] "How many of us saw the cruel irony in {{the fate of the}} Tavern on the Town public house – the one bombed three years ago by the IRA – smashed and devastated by the crazed minds who sang Orange songs. Let us be perfectly blunt. The same examples of low animal life who force their support on Glasgow Rangers {{are one and the same}} with the foul-mouthed drunks who cause us great embarrassment every July when they turn up to 'support' our annual rallies". In response, the Rangers manager Willie Waddell declared an intent to change the media perception of Rangers being a sectarian club. While he denied the existence of the signing policy, he stated that [...] "no religious barriers will be put <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> club regarding signing of players" [...] and pledged to remove supporters from Ibrox Stadium who did not accept it. Despite this, no Catholic players were signed by Rangers following it.|$|E
500|$|Árbenz {{decided to}} arm the {{civilian}} population to defend the capital; however, this plan failed, as an insufficient number of volunteers turned <b>up.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point, Colonel Carlos Enrique Díaz de León, {{the chief of staff}} of the Guatemalan army, reneged on his support for the president and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz's resignation. On 27June 1954 Árbenz met with Díaz, and informed him that he was resigning. Árbenz left office at 8pm, after recording a resignation speech that was broadcast on the radio an hour later. Immediately afterward, Díaz announced that he would be taking over the presidency in the name of the Guatemalan Revolution, and stated that the Guatemalan army would still fight against Castillo Armas's invasion. The military junta that took over consisted of Díaz, Colonel H.Elfego Monzón, and Colonel José Angel Sánchez. Peurifoy had not expected Díaz to form a military junta and keep fighting. A couple of days later, Peurifoy informed Díaz that he would have to resign; according to the CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, this was because he was [...] "not convenient for American foreign policy". At first, Díaz attempted to placate Peurifoy by forming a three-person junta, led by himself, but Peurifoy continued to insist that he resign. Díaz was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Monzón Aguirre, a more pliable army colonel. The other members of Monzón's junta were José Luis Cruz Salazar and Mauricio Dubois.|$|E
