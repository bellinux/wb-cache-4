40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> is {{transforming}} micro-communities in {{the heart}} of Italy's Piedmont region. Concerto AL Piano is a European project aimed to demon- strate the economic and social benefits in investing in energy saving and re- newable energy in the process of urban regeneration. Thanks to the co-operation of the many players in this effort, as well as the support from the region, a previous project of a Photovoltaic Village was a success, and Alessandria became the largest PV village in Italy. Alessandria further promoted energy saving concepts, including encouraging sustainable construction under the banner of Concerto AL Piano. The project includes a mix of interventions: the recovery of existing social hous- ing, the construction of new eco-buildings and the provision of a district heat- ing system in cogeneration. The project has been governed by a partnership be- tween the local authority, public housing agencies, private building companies, universities and research centres. An urban regeneration process has been set-up to become a key action in the Strategic Energy Action Plan (SEAP). Concerto AL Piano in Alessandria has motivated many of the local residents to play a part in eco-construction and energy retrofit projects. Getting citizens involved in energy projects is proving to be the key to success for a region's effort to promote sustainable construction and energy saving system...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} throughout Europe in the issue of urban regeneration. Since the 1990 s, the European Union has played an increasingly important role in influencing member states' urban policy and regeneration practice, through {{the implementation of the}} <b>Urban</b> <b>Pilot</b> <b>Projects,</b> the <b>URBAN</b> Community Initiative and the URBACT network. The Urban Acquis, seen as the commonly-approved EU URBAN methodology, supports an integrated approach to regeneration, involving physical, economic, social and environmental initiatives, integrating local residents into inclusive governance and decision-making processes. While this integrated approach was not new in some member states, such as the UK, France and the Netherlands when it was introduced in the 1990 s, it has had a profound impact in other EU 15 countries, particularly in the southern member states such as Spain, where there had been little tradition of integrated urban regeneration initiatives. This process of 'Europeanization' can also been witnessed in some new member states such as Hungary, which has adopted the EU's approach to integrated urban development planning. The influence of the EU methodology is also set to be extended, given the extensive participation in the URBACT networking program, and its concomitant impact on urban regeneration policy and practice in the future...|$|R

The evaluation report revealed key questions to examine as the 4 -H Youth Development program develops new {{efforts to provide}} services to low-income youth. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify solutions to effectively address the issues that arose from the evaluation report by interviewing nine youth practitioners in the state of Texas. The project?s evaluation data was juxtaposed with the perspectives from the youth practitioners to create more effective options for addressing the challenges posed by the participants and staff of the <b>Urban</b> Food Desert <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project.</b> The analyzed data reveals that the perspectives of practitioners and stakeholder groups in the project shared similar concerns, e. g., low retention of participants, lack of parental involvement, and miscommunication among partner organizations. The results signify attributes of successful programs, e. g., building relationships, mentoring, and creating an inclusive environment for the youth, all of which were felt to be essential in youth programs. In addition, challenges identified were as follows: low-income students lack college preparation, more training needed to work with at-risk youth, keeping staff and program participants? motivated, low parental involvement, and better communication among collaborating organizations. The study confirmed that youth practitioners are essential for ensuring youth benefit from program activities, thus their experiences are valuable for enhancing such programs...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis work {{focuses on}} {{complementary}} wood architecture for sustainable urban densification in Tampere’s city district Tammela. Tammela {{had been chosen}} for an <b>urban</b> densification <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> site, supporting the prospective developments of Tampere city center. For the project sites, potential infill plots could be identified by interviewing the co-owner cooperatives of local housing sites, during a university course for students of architecture and of environmental policies. Emerging from those identified spaces for densification this thesis offers three different infill solutions and building typologies for three of the determined sites. The presented designs contain: 1) one extension, placed {{on top of an}} existing building, 2) townhouses in form of terraced houses and 3) an attached block infill with multi-storey buildings. A significant part of the architectural design is the proposal for a conceptual idea of a wood construction system of prefabricated, customized three-dimensional units and their assembly to a multi-storey wooden construction. The designs are discussed in the context of sustainable urban densification and contemporary wood construction as well as in its socio-economic context, focusing on the city of Tampere and Tammela district...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, a {{significant}} shift {{of power to}} NGOs and private companies determinates the new implementation of policy by these actors. Local government and urban authorities are experiencing {{a significant}} decrease of influence and therefore, the public participation’s trust and involvement in decision processes is highly dependent on the cooperation with NGOs {{and their ability to}} provide a significant level of awareness. Central cities due to the shift of governance have been cut off from their “suburban hinterlands” and forced to implement narrower policies. With an involvement of New Labour i n 1997, the new urban regeneration programmes have been implemented into local level. Participation in EU Structural Fund programmes, the URBAN Community Initiative and <b>Urban</b> <b>Pilot</b> <b>Projects</b> has significantly contributed to a change of urban governance in the UK. The UK central government’s effort to retain absolute control over the Structural Funding has been determined by encouragement rather than prevention of further Europeanisation at the local level. Increasing level of Europeanisation in the UK has also a further origin in a connection between the central government with local actors, resulted in formation of new implications in terms of urban governance e.g. “european urban governance”. The centralization of local government is apparent in the weight of legislation directed at local authorities.The local authorities in cities such as Birmingham and Glasgow have participated and encouraged direct lobbying, long-term strategic programming and partnership, to liaise with conditions of The European Union Programme and to benefit from Structural Funding in terms of urban development. This process can be described as “following the European strategies” in terms of urban governance. Internalisation of European Commission’s principles of programming occurs as one of the significant elements within urban local authorities when implementing the policy on European level. Both cities have further developed strong transnational networks within Eastern Europe and strong relationship in terms of international cooperation and development programmes. Observation of their development released the evidence about the adaptation pressure arose from EU Structural Funds. The Europeanisation occurs here as an emerging process, thus a “steering regulator”, which the governments of these countries are more likely to follow than to regulate and govern.|$|R
40|$|NoAccording to Lowe and Phillipson (2006) the {{traditional}} binary division into `basic¿ and `applied¿ research, {{have recently been}} extended to a new category called `strategic¿ research, signifying research which is both inter-disciplinary and interacts with research users. Sharp and Dixon (2007) have argued that there are different level of strategic research, signifying different levels of interaction, resource sharing, and joint development of outputs. Drawing on this understanding, this paper considers two user-oriented `Integrated <b>Urban</b> Drainage¿ <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> conducted during 2006 - 7, in order to consider what insights these `not-quite¿ research projects can yield {{about the nature of}} strategic research. The paper finds that the pilots were similar to other inter-disciplinary research projects ¿ except that they were commissioned and partly managed by practitioners. Common dilemmas, for example about the inter-linkages between work packages and about the extent of stakeholder interaction, highlight the increasingly fluid boundaries between the categories of `policy evaluation¿, `policy pilot¿ and `research project¿. The paper concludes that the concepts of `researcher¿ and `research user¿ might be replaced with a more flexible idea about `research stakeholders¿ whose varied interests in projects require a flexible communication strategy to fulfil a range of needs.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study has been}} structured to give a voice to an often forgotten population within social housing, namely unattached older adult women. To date, limited {{research has been conducted}} with this group. Canadian housing studies have traditionally focused on the needs of the frail elderly and the affluent elderly. However, current and projected demographics of Canadians, aged 65 to 84, indicate that the greatest number of “well older adults” is unattached women living on fixed incomes in subsidized housing. With little attention paid to this group, measures to improve quality of life for low income single women as they age in place are speculative at best.

40|$|Urban heat islands (UHIs) {{are unique}} {{phenomena}} that occur when urban areas experience higher temperatures than surrounding areas. The {{primary cause of}} urban heat islands is the absorption of insolation by urban structures that is nocturnally released. UHIs can cause many problems both environmentally and physically (in terms of human health). In 1998, Chicago joined the EPA’s <b>Urban</b> Heat Island <b>Pilot</b> <b>Project</b> (UHIPP), which aims to mitigate the UHI effect in pilot cities throughout the country. Exactly how effective has UHIPP been in reducing Chicago’s UHI effect? This research examines Chicago’s heat island effect from 1997 (pre-UHIPP) to 2007. Observations of surface temperatures, along with hourly historical air temperature data, and population data provide the information needed to investigate Chicago’s UHI effect. Relationships between temperature and land cover as well as temperature and population will give further indication of the influences of the UHI effect.

Prior to reporting on the results of a specific case of formal resources utilization, this article presents {{a review of the literature}} on the process of seeking help, then it focuses on the major role played by the social support network. Also, it reviews the major studies dealing with the strategies used by women victims of conjugal violence in obtaining help. Finally, the article reports on the main results of a study conducted in the context of a <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> to bring help to victims of conjugal violence by the police and the Local Community Services Centers (CLSC) of the Montreal <b>Urban</b> Community. This <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> started in 1990 has since been extended to the entire territory covered by the Montreal Urban Community. The results of this study show that the majority of the women referred by the police officers did receive help at the CLSC. However, only one third of the women referred did meet with a social practioner following the referral. Also, it was observed that when the period between the referral and the first contact by the social practitioner was short, the women more easily accepted to meet with a worker from the CLSC. A third of the women referred already had a file with the CLSC, which indicated that the violence problem was known in one case out of four.

The challenges that coastal policy faces, {{the frequency with}} which <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are implemented, and the criticisms regarding their efficacy make it interesting and relevant to study <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in this policy field. This dissertation on ‘Narrative perspectives on the development of coastal pilot projects’ aims to deepen understanding of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in their actor-networks. It utilises the concept of narratives both in the conceptualisation of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> and in the design of a research strategy, choosing to learn from the experiences of actors involved in coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> The Sand Engine in the Netherlands and Ystad’s sand nourishment project in Scania, Sweden, are the two coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> from which empirical data are drawn.

The reasons could rely upon the poorness of legal supports and on the lack of awareness about the importance of walking in all processes concerning mobility, sustainability and equity. Till the mid Ô 90 s, topics as safety, environment or street livability played a minor role in all political, social and urban planning processes, though in the Italian urban areas the highest accident rates of Europe were recorded. Important changes occurred when in these last years, the Ministry of Infrastructures and Transportation promoted many laws for financial and technical aids to local Administrations to increase pedestrian mobility.
