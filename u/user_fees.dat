5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing <b>user</b> <b>fees.</b> The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E

Their powers and responsibilities are regulated through the Local Government Act of British Columbia, the Community Charter, and, in the case of Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter. They have the power of a natural person, the power to expropriate, and the power to establish and enforce bylaws. They are able to raise funds through property taxes and <b>user</b> <b>fees,</b> and borrow a limited amount through the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia to pay for capital costs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a utility maximizing model of household choice among garbage disposal, recycling, and littering. The {{impact of a}} <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> for garbage collection is modelled for heterogeneous households with different preferences for recycling. The model explains (1) why some households participate in curbside recycling programs {{even in the absence}} of a <b>user</b> <b>fee,</b> (2) why other households do not participate, even in the presence of a <b>user</b> <b>fee,</b> and (3) why some households choose to litter when others do not. Household choices are aggregated to determine the effect of a <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> on the community-wide quantities of garbage, recycling, and litter. We show how an increase in the <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> can decrease aggregate recycling. ...|$|R

25|$|The rest of {{the costs}} of these {{highways}} are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5percent in 2007), and it makes up about 60percent of the contributions by the states. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides <b>user</b> <b>fees.</b> The portion of the <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> spent on highways themselves covers about 57percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the <b>user</b> <b>fees</b> being sent to other programs, including the mass transit systems in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads. Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as in Connecticut (I‑95), Maryland (I‑95), Virginia (I‑95), and Kentucky (I‑65).|$|E

40|$|This is a {{theoretical}} paper examining {{the effect of}} <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> on patients’ welfare and social welfare under three forms of provider reimbursements: full cost, prospective payment and cost sharing. The paper extends Rickman and McGuire (1999) by introducing <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> to the public sector and maintaining the assumption that providers can work in both {{the private and public}} health sectors. Contrary to previous studies, this study shows that efficiency is possible under the full cost reimbursement. The paper also shows the conditions under which efficiency is possible under each reimbursement scheme. Patient’s welfare can improve with the introduction of <b>user</b> <b>fee</b> when services in the public and private sector are complementary...|$|R
