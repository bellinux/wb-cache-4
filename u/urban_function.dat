40|$|Traffic {{safety is}} a major {{challenge}} in most of cities in South Africa particularly on the arterial roads passing through the sub urban areas. The major contributing reasons for the occurrence of traffic accidents emphasized include human related factors, road related factors and vehicle related factors. However, {{the influence of the}} urban development related factors such as, land use and <b>urban</b> <b>functions,</b> <b>urban</b> form, urban pattern, accessibility, and density on the occurrence of traffic accidents have been least explored, particularly in the sub urban residential areas of the cities of South Africa. Therefore, this paper pertains to investigate the influence of various urban related factors on the occurrence of vehicular traffic accidents on the sub urban arterial roads of a South African city. The investigation was conducted by considering Bloemfontein City as the study area and by employing survey research methodologies, statistical analyses, development and consequent application of empirical regression models. It was revealed that level of accessibility (number of accessible roads) from residential areas to arterial roads is the major variable, which causes traffic accidents. Road geometry variables like median and road width influence the occurrence of traffic accidents to a certain extent. However, variables belonging to land use and <b>urban</b> <b>functions,</b> <b>urban</b> form, urban pattern, location of important <b>urban</b> <b>functions</b> in convoluted areas, and density of population have relatively lesser impact. Reduction in the number of access roads from the sub-urban residential areas to the arterial roads, provision of adequate medians in roads with no divided facility along with urban planning interventions, such as, appropriate urban pattern, and avoidance of location of <b>urban</b> <b>functions</b> in convoluted areas will enable reduction in the occurrence of traffic accidents and improve road safety in the cities of South Africa.

Increasing inland port capacity should however also be aligned with policy measures in urban regions, to avoid the overlapping of inland port and <b>urban</b> <b>functions</b> which could lead to mutually exclusive land-uses. This poses challenges in terms of inland port governance. We observe that cases in which the port and urban administrations open up the policy process to relevant private stakeholders and the civil society, integrated governance strategies for inland port development are more likely to emerge...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{asserted}} that the morphology of urban areas {{is a result of}} the interactions of <b>urban</b> <b>function</b> and urban form. This has led a number of studies to postulate, either explicitly or implicitly, that a mapping exists between the physical form (land cover) of the urban fabric and its corresponding function and activity (land use), although relatively little quantitative evidence has been presented to support this assertion. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the relationship between urban form and <b>urban</b> <b>function</b> using fine spatial scale digital map data. These are used to derive quantitative information on the morphological properties and spatial structure of the buildings present in a series of urban land-use categories identified in two urban areas (Cardiff and Orpington) in the United Kingdom. A statistical separability analysis of these land-use samples suggests that a mapping exists between urban form and function, which, if replicated for other urban areas, would allow urban land use to be inferred from an analysis of the spatial disposition of land-cover parcels, particularly buildings. ...|$|E

40|$|The built {{environment}} {{is a significant}} factor in many urban processes, yet direct measures of built form are seldom used in geographical studies. Representation and analysis of urban form and function could provide new insights and improve the evidence base for research. So far progress has been slow due to limited data availability, computational demands, and a lack of methods to integrate {{built environment}} data with aggregate geographical analysis. Spatial data and computational improvements are overcoming some of these problems, but there remains a need for techniques to process and aggregate urban form data. Here we develop a Built Environment Model of <b>urban</b> <b>function</b> and dwelling type classifications for Greater London, based on detailed topographic and address-based data (sourced from Ordnance Survey MasterMap). The multi-scale approach allows the Built Environment Model to be viewed at fine-scales for local planning contexts, and at city-wide scales for aggregate geographical analysis, allowing an improved understanding of urban processes. This flexibility is illustrated in the two examples, that of <b>urban</b> <b>function</b> and residential type analysis, where both local-scale urban clustering and city-wide trends in density and agglomeration are shown. While we demonstrate the multi-scale Built Environment Model to be a viable approach, a number of accuracy issues are identified, including the limitations of 2 D data, inaccuracies i...|$|E

The tunnel effect generated by the high speed connection seems to be able to allow a new temporal and functional joint among the metropolitan systems consequently supporting the possibility, for the users, to move themselves among the different <b>urban</b> <b>functions</b> belonging to the different cities. The birth of these urban aggregations seems to drive towards new megalopolis, which we can define for the first time with the term: joint-city. For this new metropolitan settlement it seems to be very interesting to investigate the constitutive peculiarities, the systemic articulation, its relational structures, the evolutionary scenarios, and so on.

In the definition set out here the analysis is carried out for many interconnected urban functional system points (specifically those in Rome and Naples). The new high speed railway has to be considered not only as a new channel of mobility between cities, but as a real possibility of joint between the functional systems of the two centres. A final consideration can be carried out in relation to the possibility of implementing new measures of governance of urban transformations considering the new macro-city: the "Joint City"...|$|R

There is no tourism without physical displacements, as the WTO definition affirms, highlighting that the movement of people is connected to two different mobility forms. On one hand, the tourist displacement is generated by the need to reach the destination (transit/access mobility).

40|$|This {{study is}} {{based on the premise that}} <b>urban</b> <b>functions</b> should be located in {{response}} to inner and inter activity relationships. Being one of the important and growing <b>urban</b> <b>functions,</b> office activity was examined to study activity relationships and locational processes. Its growth, changing location in the urban context, and its national pattern was studied in a historical perspective. Then its future growth and development were reviewed. The office types incorporated in this research are: Manufacturing, Transportation, Communication, Utilities, Government, Services, Insurance and Real Estate. These types cover about 900 of the office employment in the New York region. Using a vertical hierarchy office types were broken down into three levels: Headquarter office, Middle office, and Local office. The criterion to differentiate them was the physical jurisdiction of each office level. A one-way matrix was constructed as a tool to trace the "in" and "between" interactions of office functions. Factors that bring about the location of office activity in downtown or suburban office parks were researched from previous studies. Matrices were used for developing a relationship between office types and their locational needs. Concrete application confirms its (matrix) usefulness though the scaler value judgements used are somewhat subjective, based on the knowledge of and research done by the author.
