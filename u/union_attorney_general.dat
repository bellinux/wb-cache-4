5000|$|We want {{a system}} where the right people take the right positions. They should be skilled in Judicial work. Our {{superintendent}} should be more qualified than we are. He or she must have enough working experience. It is absolutely impossible that a sergeant could memorise the penal code, pass the judge exam and become a judge. They should be in leading positions in their own fields. I rose through the ranks to become a credited lawyer and had to start my profession as a legal practice. Some of my peers are now colonels. But {{it would be impossible}} for me to take their positions. So military personnel also should not do so. — Maung Maung Naing, a lawyer On September 9, Pyinmanar lawyers started the Yellow Ribbon Campaign in front of the Court of Dekkhina Thiri District, Naypyidaw Council. Yellow Ribbon Campaign Myanmar Team urges the lawyers, judges, law students and other people who dislike the involvement of military officers in every field to wear Yellow Ribbons.

On September 11, in Yangon the lawyers launched the campaign at the office of lawyer U Aung Soe (the office of Myanmar Media Lawyers' Network) in 37th Road U Aye Myint, a lawyer from Pyay who was just released from the prison, protested to release the arrested 10-10-10 boycout students and to drive out the military officers who were transferred to Supreme Court.U Khin Mg Zaw, the president of Pyinmanar Lawyers' Association, said,"We protest against the entry of people from military in all ministries of Burma including Health and Judiciary. We will continue until all the ribbon movements unite and spread to the whole country."Lawyers want to become a rainbow ribbon campaign with every department coming out their own color.Yellow Ribbon Campaign will be performed by connecting with lawyers' associations all over the country, and Pyinmanar Lawyers' association, Myanmar Independent Lawyers' Association, Upper Myanmar Lawyers' network, Lower Myanmar Lawyers' Network, and Naypidaw Justice Aid Association are planning to make the campaign countrywide.Petitions against these appointments are collected and to be sent to the Office of the <b>Union</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General.</b> Pamphlets of Yellow Ribbon Campaign state that they were trying to stop militarization of Judiciary which they found as strengthening of the military with purpose to prepare for the periods beyond 2015. The Asian Human Rights Commission on Thursday issued a statement, calling {{for an end to the}} practice of appointing military officers as judges by changing the country's constitution to state that only those with legal qualifications and professional experience can become judges of the Supreme Court and other courts.
