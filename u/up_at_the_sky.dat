5|$|The {{storyboard}} {{took six}} months to complete. Kamei struggled with several difficulties as he was under pressure due to how it would influence the entire film. The climax of the film also proved difficult to make. He also noted how the first scene had the challenge of attracting the audience's attention. Kamei's favorite scene is when Yuri looks <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> of Shizontania {{the night before the}} knights' expedition to the old ruins. It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri's decision in regards to his future.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Several twentieth-century German writers, {{including}} Peter Bender, Johannes Lang, Karl Neupert, and Fritz Braut, published works {{advocating the}} Hollow Earth hypothesis, or Hohlweltlehre. It {{has even been}} reported, although apparently without historical documentation, that Adolf Hitler was influenced by concave Hollow Earth ideas and sent an expedition in an unsuccessful attempt to spy on the British fleet by pointing infrared cameras <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E

500|$|On July 20, 2009, {{the crew}} of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House. [...] "We expect that there is, as we speak, another {{generation}} of kids {{out there who are}} looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and {{are going to be the}} next Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin", Obama said.

500|$|In {{the second}} half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the {{citizens}} try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six [...] "strangers" [...] watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually they decide to go outside, where they look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair. During this scene, you hear a voicing softly in Russian, a reference to Moscow.|$|E
500|$|While Lennon was [...] "evangelical in {{his enthusiasm}} for the Maharishi", {{according}} to his wife, Cynthia, she herself was [...] "a little more sceptical". [...] Cynthia later wrote that she [...] "loved being in India" [...] and had hoped she and Lennon would [...] "rediscover our lost closeness"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became [...] "increasingly cold and aloof". The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone. Meanwhile, he walked to the local post office every morning to check for Ono's almost daily telegrams. One of these telegrams read: [...] "Look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and when you see a cloud think of me".|$|E

500|$|According to Chen, Cloud was {{designed}} to [...] "expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke." [...] Chen had the first idea for the game; while walking to school one day he looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> noticing {{the difference between the}} fluffy clouds there and the [...] "polluted and gray" [...] clouds of Shanghai where he was born, and thought about making a game about clouds. It was given a story to [...] "create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested"; however, the team avoided making the story too strong, as it would [...] "distract the player from the core experience" [...] of flying freely and shaping clouds. In the early stages of development, the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment, but this was cut down to [...] "a simple 'poetic' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed." [...] The team intended Cloud to [...] "communicate a feeling of youthfulness, freedom, and the wonder of imagination." [...] It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game, Dyadin. At the 2006 Game Developers Conference student showcase, Chen and Santiago pitched Cloud to Sony representative John Hight as the first game in the [...] "Zen" [...] genre. Hight was interested, but Sony declined to publish the game.|$|E
500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and the sun started to shine {{and all of a}} sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E
500|$|The {{paintings}} show Obrenović {{standing before}} the Serb leaders and clan elders at Takovo and inciting them to revolt. According to legend, he appeared before the crowd and proclaimed: [...] "Here I am, and here you are. War to the Turks!". Obrenović is depicted standing atop a large stone, wearing a turban and a red, Oriental-style costume covered in golden embroidery, surrounded by a semi-circle of followers. A sword hangs from his waist, and two pistols protrude from his belt. His right arm points <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> with the thumb, middle and index finger extended. With his left hand outstretched, Obrenović waves a large revolutionary flag depicting a red cross centered against a white background. The flag is a variant of that used by the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, which ruled Montenegro {{at the time of}} the uprising, and is reminiscent of the Christian flag flown at the Battle of Kosovo, which according to popular belief, marked the beginning of the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans. The flag provokes an enthusiastic response from the crowd, members of which raise their swords in salute. Others gesture with their muskets. To the far left, a woman places her child on top of a headstone, and both raise their hands in salute. Beside Obrenović is a priest who gives him his blessing. The priest is bearded, and wears a typical, long black robe and Eastern Orthodox religious headdress. Behind the priest is a large group of Obrenović's followers, most with their swords sheathed and hands emulating Obrenović's three-fingered gesture. To Obrenović's right, a man wearing Turkish clothes (red fez, dolman and shalvar pants) places his hand on the flagpole the rebel leader is holding. It is unclear if the man wishes to take the flag away from Obrenović or help bear it. Behind him, a large group of mustachioed men wearing similar clothes raise their arms and salute Obrenović.|$|E

500|$|At {{some point}} in the 1896 season, Hogan {{apparently}} secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. [...] On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. [...] "Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, and then looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball", the paper reported. [...] "It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness {{before the end of the}} game". [...] In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The article called Hogan [...] "one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League" [...] and predicted he would [...] "greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield". [...] The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a [...] "mistake", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. [...] The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan [...] "the largest salary he has ever drawn". [...] Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. [...] "He goes about the streets dressed much like an English costermonger", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. [...] "Marty can be seen with a little red wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis". [...] Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was [...] "playing a sensational center field". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. [...] "Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players", the article stated. [...] "Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year". [...] Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. [...] (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) [...] During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. [...] In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were [...] "anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires". [...] The article added, [...] "Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game".|$|E
2500|$|During the {{penultimate}} episode, Drake asks Hunt if {{he killed}} Sam Tyler, with Hunt explaining that Tyler had been acting [...] "weird" [...] {{and asked for}} Hunt's help in faking his own death. However, the vision that Drake has of the police officer with injuries {{to the side of}} his face is connected to Tyler's presumed death, and a roll of undeveloped film apparently reveals where the policeman is supposedly buried. Along with this, Shaz, Ray and Chris all have visions of stars, as if looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and hear strange voices as described by Chris as Nelson (Tony Marshall), the publican from Life on Mars, asking him what he would like to drink.|$|E
2500|$|On September 26, 2015, Scantlin also lip-synced at the TNL Onstage {{concert in}} Colombo, Sri Lanka. Scantlin {{appeared}} intoxicated {{as he struggled}} to mime along the words to their popular tracks including [...] "Blurry", [...] "Psycho" [...] and [...] "She Hates Me". Some audience members proceeded to abandon the concert after it became obvious the band wasn't playing live - Scantlin sang while standing away from the mic, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> without any change in vocals. According to organizers, the band conducted a full sound check pre-event, before using an audio connection to play vocal tracks off an iPod during the show. The organizers released a statement apologizing to unhappy fans, as well as offering refunds on their tickets.|$|E
