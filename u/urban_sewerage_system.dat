Moreover, these effluents usually do not undergo any specific treatment before being discharged into the urban sewage networks. As a consequence, a proper management of hospital effluents is vital. In the present study, {{the quality of the}} effluents generated by 11 important hospitals in Cluj County was investigated.

40|$|Rivers and creeks {{receive a}} lot of sewer solids due to sewer {{overflow}}. This overflow causes a serious concern for the environment, aesthetics and public health. To manage such sewer overflow, different types of screening device were developed. The initial expense, maintenance costs, poor sewer capture efficiency and blinding on the screen were discussed as the limitations of these overflow devices. Most screens had electro-mechanical systems that were expensive, complex and caused concern for possible malfunctions in unstaffed remote locations. Consequently, a novel sewerage overflow device ‘Comb Separator’ was conceived, developed and tested. Optimum criteria were achieved for the device using trial and error method; robustness of the experimental set-up was tested to reproduce consistent results. There was minimal blockage {{on the screen and}} higher capture efficiency than Hydro-JETTM. The ‘Comb Separator’ has a good application potential to improve the sewer solids capture in the <b>urban</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{side weir}} is a {{hydraulic}} structure {{set into the}} side of a channel. This structure is used for water level control in channels, to divert flow from a main channel into a side channel when the water level in the main channel exceeds a specific limit and as storm overflows from <b>urban</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> Computation of water surface over the side weirs is essential to determine the flow rate of the side weir. Analytical solutions for water surface profile along rectangular side weir are available only for the special cases of rectangular and trapezoidal channels considering constant specific energy. In this paper, a rectangular side weir located in a combined (trapezoidal with exponential) channel was considered. Expanding binominal series of integer and fraction powers and the using of reduction formula of cosine function integrals, a general analytical formula was obtained for water surface profile along a side weir in a combined (trapezoidal with exponential) channel. Since triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal and parabolic cross-sections are special cases of the combined cross section, the derived formula, is applicable to triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal cross-sections as analytical solution and semi-analytical solution to parabolic cross-section with maximum relative error smaller than 0. 76 %. The proposed solution should be a useful engineering tool for the evaluation and design of side weirs in open channel...|$|E
25|$|Sewage {{may include}} {{stormwater}} runoff or <b>urban</b> runoff. <b>Sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> {{capable of handling}} storm water are known as combined sewer systems. This design was common when <b>urban</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems</b> were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary sewers. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, {{and they are not}} designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive infiltration/inflow (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.|$|R

The existing <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems,</b> however, are facing a great challenge of fast rising peak flow resulting from urbanization and climate change. It is imperative to construct an efficient and accurate operating prediction model for pumping stations to simulate the drainage mechanism for discharging the rainwater in advance. In this study, we propose two rule-based fuzzy neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and counterpropagatiom fuzzy neural network (CFNN) for on-line predicting of the number of open and closed pumps of a pivotal pumping station in Taipei city up to a lead time of 20 min. The performance of ANFIS outperforms that of CFNN in terms of model efficiency, accuracy, and correctness. Furthermore, the results not only show the predictive water levels do contribute to the successfully operating pumping stations but also demonstrate the applicability and reliability of ANFIS in automatically controlling the <b>urban</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The RNN allows a signal to propagate in backward direction which gives this network a dynamic memory to effectively deal with time-varying systems. The RNN is implemented at both gauged and ungauged sites for 5 -, 10 -, 15 -, and 20 -min-ahead water level predictions. The {{results show that the}} RNN is capable of learning the nonlinear sewerage system and producing satisfactory predictions at the gauged sites. Concerning the ungauged sites, there are no historical data of water level to support prediction. In order to overcome such problem, a set of synthetic data, generated from a storm water management model (SWMM) under cautious verification process of applicability based on the data from nearby gauging stations, are introduced as the learning target to the training procedure of the RNN and moreover evaluating the performance of the RNN at the ungauged sites. The results demonstrate that the potential role of the SWMM coupled with nearby rainfall and water level information can be of great use in enhancing the capability of the RNN at the ungauged sites. Hence we can conclude that the RNN is an effective and suitable model for successfully predicting the water levels at both gauged and ungauged sites in urban sewerage systems...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the major}} {{concerns}} regarding the sewer overflow include serious environmental, aesthetic and public health problems in receiving water bodies. Due to increasing public complains engineers are focusing on retention of the entrained sewer solids within the sewer overflow device. Present study investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of a self cleansing sewer overflow device with no mechanical or electrical components. The device has a rectangular tank and a slotted ogee weir to capture the gross pollutants. The proposed device is deviated from traditional weir as in a traditional weir flow along a creek; the incoming flow is stable without any significant reflection. Whereas, significant reflections of inflow will occur due to smaller dimension of the device, which needs to be accommodated within existing <b>urban</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> State of art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique was used to simulate the flow phenomena and compared with analytical results. In both cases atmospheric pressure was consider as a boundary condition over the ogee weir, therefore good agreement between analytical and numerical results were found. Results show curved face of the ogee spillway remains {{in contact with the}} weir at all low flows. Near {{the right side of the}} device, where inflow is reflected by the side wall, velocity and water level were found almost twice compared to normal flowing water on the sloping plane. Flow undulations across the weir will hamper effectiveness of self-cleansing, as shear force from uniformly distributed (across the width) flow will effectively remove the trapped pollutants from the screen...|$|E

As we all know the temperature is higher than it over the last few decades. Especially the temperature in the city is higher 2 - 3 centigrade than the temperature in the suburb. Based on the data collection of the site I choose, it illustrate that this phenomenon ubiquitous in many city. There are a great numbers of reasons to cause the heat islands effect. While one of the reason cause the phenomenon in the stone forestry is too much hard paving in the city. These hard paving material will absorb heat then release the heat to the atmosphere. To the cities which are located to the south of the Huanghe Rivers in China, the high precipitation in the summer time will burdern the city <b>urban</b> <b>sewerage</b> <b>system.</b> How to deal with the overflow is a big issue to these cities. I choose one of the city Guiyang to be the site to do the correlative study. It aims to change the too much hard paving in the city center meanwhile solve the overflow in the summer time. I choose the main center place to let the overflow water transform into the water streetscape for the citizens. The research part contains the basic information of climate changes, precipitation changes over the decade years in Guiyang. Besides the site basic material of the site, it also contains the correlative case studies the calculation of corresponding rainwater volume of the site place and the reference materials of using the ecological method to purify the rainwater.
