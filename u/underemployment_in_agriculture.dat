It begins by considering published unemployment and part-time work estimates, showing potential labour supply in the UK economy. Analysis is then presented which develops a measure of time-related underemployment using the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which looks at the additional hours that people in employment want to work. Further analysis describes recent trends <b>in</b> <b>underemployment</b> levels and rates, noting the changes that occurred as the UK economy contracted.

40|$|Something must be {{structurally}} {{wrong in}} a labour market when a well developed economy {{like that of}} South Africa {{is not able to}} absorb and allocate an accumulating surplus of labour over a period of 20 years or longer but has instead moved to the use of more capital-intensive technology. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyse the role labour conflict plays in the persistence of macro <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> South Africa. For the analysis two models identified from the literature were used. In these models labour conflict originates from an over-regulated labour market where labour appropriates capital and bad or hostile labour relations. In both models the switch to technology leads to underemployment. It was found that bad labour relations contribute to the persistence of <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> South Africa...|$|R

40|$|In {{this policy}} note I {{wish to make}} four points. First, {{for most of the}} Pacific island {{countries}} (including Papua New Guinea), but particularly for the larger land-rich Melanesian countries, the present focus for employment for the bulk of the population and for economic growth should be on promoting productivity growth <b>in</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Second, while having some benefits for Pacific countries, the movement of unskilled Pacific labour to Australia and New Zealand can make little contribution to overcoming unemployment and <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> the larger Pacific island countries. Third, the small Pacific island countries cannot compete on the global stage in the production and export of large-volume, standard quality, agricultural commodities and should focus on differentiated products that command a premium price that covers the high costs of participating in international trade. Fourth, a wide range of research is needed to support the growth of agricultural productivity in the Pacific island countries and the regional universities, in particular the University of the South Pacific, have an important role to play in the various research areas, in collaboration with regional and other research institutions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} moves beyond preoccupations with deindustrialization, joblessness, and {{the urban}} “underclass ” to examine the role that cities and urbanization in gen eral have played in the reorganization of production and local labor markets. After reviewing recent work on global cities, new industrial districts, and the “new ” social division of labor, the author used Census data to examine the extent and relative causes of rising <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> U. S. metropolitan areas during 1950 – 90. Sever al key findings emerge. First, underemployment increased 35 percent between 1970 and 1990, largely due to shifts in structural rather than personal factors. Second, most of this structural shift occurred within industries, not across them. Third, the consequences of these shifts have been most dramatic at the bottom rather than {{the top of the}} urban hierarchy, despite recent claims regarding global cities. Fourth, fac tors associated with the new social division of labor characterized by growing num bers of smaller workplaces and “routine ” business service firms offer the strongest empirical explanation for rising <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> local metropolitan areas...|$|R

We produce contrary evidence. The MPC further reduces the level of <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom by half. We present arguments as to why we also think this inappropriate. We set out arguments on why we believe the level of slack is greater than the MPC calibrates. Consistent with that is the fact that real wages in the United Kingdom continue to fall...|$|R
3000|$|Ahmad (1982) {{uses the}} labor supply-demand {{framework}} {{to address the}} question as to why widespread unemployment and <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> developing countries would not depress wages <b>in</b> <b>agriculture.</b> He distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary unemployment. The increased labor supply of the involuntarily unemployed casual worker is very small (relative to total unemployment) to depress wages. His contention is that the surplus labor model of Lewis (1954) and the efficiency wage model of Leibenstein (1957) and Bliss and Stern (1976) are not sufficient to explain wage behavior. The reason is that the subsistence wage model necessitates a wage level enough to perpetuate the population; therefore, in a country with an increasing population, wages must be higher than the subsistence level (Ahmad 1982). On the other hand, the efficiency wage model requires a certain caloric intake which Bliss and Stern (1976) found is less than what is needed to support the efficiency wage. Both of these theories alone cannot explain wages in agricultural Bangladesh. Ahmad (1982) postulates that structural factors such as inequality in land distribution, cropping intensity, and tenancy positively affect wages, while the proportion of agricultural wage laborers and uncertainty in production affect wages negatively. 9 [...]...|$|R
30|$|Youth {{employment}} is a many-sided challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Un{{employment is}} high among well-educated young people, {{especially in the}} region’s upper middle-income countries. However, the labor-related difficulties young people face is manifested most <b>in</b> <b>underemployment</b> and low-quality work <b>in</b> <b>agriculture,</b> household enterprises, {{and other types of}} informal employment. Although there is an optimistic view that the region is poised to create substantial numbers of good jobs for young people in the modern wage sector, it is realistic to expect that most of today’s youth will be working <b>in</b> <b>agriculture</b> and <b>in</b> household and micro-enterprises in the foreseeable future. So, the region’s jobs challenge includes both improving productivity and livelihoods in these sectors while, at the same time, establishing the foundations for more opportunities in wage employment.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the high}} {{growth of the}} Peruvian economy during the last decade, college {{graduates}} are facing increasing difficulties to find occupations that match their higher educational background, skills and educational investments. This scenario is embodied in the "professional underemployment" condition by which 4 out of 10 college graduates, by 2012, are overeducated, occupying non-professional and sub-paid positions. We propose that the deterioration in higher education quality has been a trigger for the increase <b>in</b> <b>underemployment</b> of university graduates, {{as an alternative to}} the literature that analyzes its causes related to labor demand. The main objective is to explore and quantify the extent to which higher education quality contributes to professional <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> Peru. Using data from the National Household Survey for the period 2004 - 2012 and the National University Census for the years 1996 and 2010, we propose a discrete choice model that measures the impact of college quality on the individual condition of <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> the long run. The source of variability for identifying this effect is the institutional and legal process of deregulation of universities initiated in the nineties. Our results indicate that the probability of being underemployed among graduates who attended "lower quality" universities increased from 0. 19 to 0. 30 beginning the college market deregulation. These estimation consider a twofold effect of deregulation, over the quality of university to which university applicants are prone to attend and in the probability of acquiring university education among individuals with lower academic skills...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on rural employment and employment generation. It considers three models of rural employment: neoclassical, dual economy, and dynamic linkages. Evidence favors the third model, which explains rural <b>underemployment</b> <b>in</b> terms of labor surplus, and points to local economic linkages {{as a means for}} the rural economy to absorb its own surplus labor. The paper summarizes other patterns particularly in relation to the determinants of rural employment, and enumerates elements of an employment strategy for rural Asia. Two of these elements remain controversial, namely, asset reform and prioritization of <b>agriculture.</b> <b>In</b> some cases both elements prove to be beneficial in terms of generating employment; however the evidence is not sufficiently conclusive for a generalization. Hence the rural employment strategy, while rightfully focusing on the rural economy, should be flexible in terms of specifying the mix and focus of interventions within the sector. I...|$|R
