40|$|The {{implementation}} of this study stems from a major issue {{of the decline in}} motivation suffered by adolescents after some time out of motivation program. This has often been questioned, and whether Islamic motivation programs have also experienced the same problem. Based on the survey of the literature, several matters have been identified as the reasons which contribute to the deterioration in motivation. The gap left by previous studies in discussing this issue warrants further research. Therefore, the present study aims to <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> in greater depth, solve existing problems and provide the best solution. Using a qualitative approach, the study has selected case studies as its research design in examining five cases of adolescents who have participated in the Motivasi Alihan Pelajar (MAP) program. In order to explore the reality of the effect of motivation in the process of self-development of the five informants, data were collected through in-depth interviews, participants’ observation, document analysis and additional interviews with the program regular coach. The theoretical thematic analysis which involves several stages was applied as the analysis method. The results reveal that the effect of self-motivation in the development of informants is a complex process involving various elements relating to the informants and elements that exist in their social context. Awareness to improve themselves and the need for certain skills has encouraged the formation of self-development commitment by the informants while in the program. However, maturity and opportunities to develop themselves have determined the extent that commitment can be implemented. Accordingly, through this study, the reality of the formation of self-development motivation of the informants is highlighted and suitable Islamic motivation model are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Vascular cambium is a meristematic tissue which {{produces}} wood centriphugaly and phloem centripetaly. In {{the structure of}} wood and phloem, data concerning developmental processes {{taking place in the}} cambium is recorded. The history of the cambium is encoded in the dimensions, numbers and arrangements of the wood and phloem cells. For investigations, the wood is usually preferred because it is durable and such data could remain unchanged for centuries, whereas in the phloem due to distorted processes, it deranges after a few years. In broadleaves, the wood is composed of vessels, tracheids, fibers and parenchyma cells. The process of the wood formation consists of the cambial cell derivatives expansion, lignification of its walls and programmed cell death. Since the seventies of the nineteenth century, the process of declining oaks taking place in Europe on a regular basis has been observed. Oak decline is a complex process that involves interactions of both biotic and abiotic factors leading to increased trees mortality. The main goal of the studies is the examination of the structure of wood in declining oaks (Quercus robur L.) in respect to physiological (conductive) role of this tissue. It is known that on the level of the wood structure, water transport efficiency depends on the diameter of vessels - the main elements of the hydraulic conductivity system. Any reduction of the vessels lumen causes the reduction of the water transport to the organs of the trees body and, therefore, influences organisms survival rate. Anatomical analyses were carried out on wood samples (comprising all annual rings formed during the 30 - 40 years life of the analyzed trees) collected at breast height from the main stem of healthy, weakened and dead oaks. The anatomical traits of the wood like as the width of the annual increments, the diameter and density of early wood vessels were measured. The results which are described in the paper by Tulik (2014) revealed that anatomical traits of the wood changed both with the age of trees and in response to unfavorable factors. The largest early wood vessels were observed in healthy trees, which implied that they had the highest hydraulic conductivity, whereas trees considered being in decline produce smaller vessels and hence had reduced conductivity. Therefore, it seems that the size of vessel elements responsible for water transport in whole tree, is a crucial feature that should be taken into consideration in dendro-eco-physiological studies designed to <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of oak-tree decline...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a broad {{overview}} of the field of innovation studies. We focus on the the economics and sociology of innovation, which we can define as the study of the dynamic processes of generation, development, adoption ad diffusion of innovations in the economic and social system, as well as the characteristics of such processes and their effects on society and the economy. In order to present the many, complex and sometimes overlapping strands of research on innovation, we have chosen a disciplinary criterion. We have therefore identified several different theoretical perspectives on innovation and within each one we have tried to <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> main <b>issues</b> that are being investigated. However, any attempt to categorise and streamline such a complex topic does, to some exent, introduce arbitrary distinctions in the analysis. In the last section, we explicitly focus on trying to re-estabilish some connections between different perspectives, and we try to uncover some general trends in innovation studies. ...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{entrenched in}} Islamic Law that khiyar is an {{inherent}} {{right of the}} contracting parties in a contract. This right provides the contracting parties with a right of option to void the contract they entered into if {{the subject matter of}} the contract does not comply with the specifications, terms and conditions of the contract. In Peninsular Malaysia, all house purchasers who wish to buy houses built by the licensed housing developers who are subject to the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (Act 118) and subject to control of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (MHLG) are required to use the prescribed housing statutory standard sale and purchase agreements as contained in Schedules G, H, I and J ('the said agreements'). However after a close scrutiny over the said agreements, there is no term of khiyar provided. Thus, due to the absence of term of khiyar in the said agreements, the said agreements, it is submitted, are null and void under Islamic Law. Likewise, it follows that due to this nullity, the subsequent housing transactions involving loan agreements, effected through Bay' Bithaman al-Ajil (BBA), Musharakah Mutanaqisah, Ijarah Thamma al-Bay' and Istisna' used by Islamic Banks, may also be affected and void. This academic paper is a fruit of a completed research undertaken by the author. Its objective is to discuss and explore <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of khiyar in the said agreements, particularly when the housing projects are abandoned. The author used qualitative legal research methodology to <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of khiyar in the said agreements. This paper contends that due to the absence of khiyar in the said agreements, the said agreements have not complied with the requirements under Islamic law and could cause the housing transactions and the subsequent loan transactions entered into by the purchasers/borrower. developers and Islamic banks, void too. This paper also provides certain proposals to improve the current terms and conditions in the said agreements in order to render them harmonious with the spirit and intent of Islamic Law...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{shows that}} the Scott-Koymans theorem for the untyped λ-calculus extends to the {{differential}} λ-calculus. The main result is that every model of the untyped differential λ-calculus {{may be viewed as}} a differential reflexive object in a Cartesian closed differential category. This extension of the Scott-Koymans theorem depends critically on <b>unravelling</b> <b>the</b> somewhat subtle <b>issue</b> of which idempotents can be split so that differential structure lifts to the idempotent splitting. The paper uses (total) Turing categories with “canonical codes” as the basic categorical semantics for the λ-calculus. It shows how the main result may be developed in a modular fashion by first adding left-additive structure to a Turing category, and then – on top of that – differential structure. For both levels of structure it is necessary to identify how “canonical codes” behave with respect to the added structure and, furthermore, how “universal objects” behave. The latter is closely tied to the question – which is the crux of the paper – of which idempotents can be split in these more structured settings...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The Scottish Parliament has {{recently}} formed Community Health Partnerships (CHPs), in which {{health and social}} care providers come together within a unified organisational framework. This paper aims to assess {{the extent to which}} employees identify with their profession and whether professional identity poses a significant barrier to multi-disciplinary, inter-organisational partnership. Design/methodology/approach – The study adopted a mixed methodology approach. A survey of all CHP staff was conducted, four months after the CHP was created and obtained a 31 per cent response rate. Additionally, to obtain an in-depth understanding of the partnership, 26 interviews were conducted with senior and middle level managers and professional representatives. Findings – A strong professional identity in the health and social care context was evident while the partnership vision, in contrast, lacked clarity. Therefore under these circumstances individuals' sense of occupation has been heightened due to perceived attempts to erode their professional identity, and modifications to their sense of 'self' have not been challenged by a strong partnership ethos. Practical implications – Managers face a deep-rooted cultural based challenge where individuals strongly identify with their profession rather than the ethos of the partnership, which impedes full integration. Managers have a 'balancing act' of addressing structural and processual change within the integration agenda, without losing sight of the outcomes in terms of service delivery and improving health and wellbeing. Originality/value – This paper examines the implications of a new major health policy change that aims to integrate health and social care. In addition, <b>the</b> study <b>unravels</b> <b>the</b> complex <b>issue</b> of professional identity in this context. </p...|$|R
40|$|The strict CO 2 {{emission}} targets set {{to tackle}} the global climate change associated with greenhouse gas emission exerts so much pressure on our cities which contribute up to 75 % of the global carbon dioxide emission level, with buildings being the largest contributor (UNEP, 2015).

40|$|Severe asthma is a {{discrete}} clinical entity characterised by recurrent exacerbations, reduced {{quality of life}} and poor asthma control as ordinary treatment regimens remain inadequate. Difficulty in managing severe asthma derives partly from the multiple existing phenotypes and our inability to recognise them. Though the exact pathogenetic pathway of severe allergic asthma remains unclear, it is known that numerous inflammatory cells and cytokines are involved, and eosinophils represent a key inflammatory cell mediator. Anti-IgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL- 5 (mepolizumab) antibodies are biological agents that interfere in different steps of the Th 2 inflammatory cascade and are licensed in severe asthma. Both exhibit a favourable clinical outcome as they reduce exacerbation rate and improve asthma control and quality of life, while mepolizumab also induces an oral steroid sparing effect. Nevertheless, it is still questionable which agent is more suitable in the management of severe allergic asthma since no comparable studies have been conducted. Omalizumab's established effectiveness in clinical practice over a long period is complemented by a beneficial effect on airway remodelling process mediated mainly through its impact on eosinophils and other parameters strongly related to eosinophilic inflammation. However, it is possible that mepolizumab through nearly depleting eosinophils could have a similar effect on airway remodelling. Moreover, to date, markers indicative of the patient population responding to each treatment are unavailable although baseline eosinophils and exacerbation rate in the previous year demonstrate a predictive value regarding anti-IL- 5 therapy effectiveness. On the other hand, a better therapeutic response for omalizumab has been observed when low forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and increased IgE concentrations are present. Consequently, conclusions are not yet safe to be drawn based on existing knowledge, and additional research is necessary to <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>issues</b> for <b>the</b> severe asthmatic population...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} universal introduction {{of social science}} methods of instruction, the staples of legal education today differ little from those of many decades ago. Even the most sophisticated modern lawyer continues to remember and understand {{the basic principles of}} civil law in terms of rules propounded to resolve discrete disputes between two single parties. If asked to name the foundations of our civil law, the lawyer today, like the lawyer of the 1920 s, would almost certainly list Pennoyer v. Neff, Hadley v. Baxendale, Brown v. Kendall, and, perhaps, Palsgraf v. Long Island R. R. Company. These cases are recognized today as possessing a certain quaintness, but they remain the building blocks from which our conceptions of civil liability derive. Regrettably, this conception of civil law is becoming increasingly anachronistic. The caseload of the modern civil judge is less likely to be dominated by an action involving an attempt to collect on a note against land (Pennoyer), or damages for delay in delivery (Hadley), or for suffering a hit from a stick (Brown) or a scale (Palsgraf), than by an action involving thejoinder of multiple parties with complex third-party liability claims asserting a causative link that requires complicated scientific understanding.
