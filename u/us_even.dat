5|$|The hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) is {{the most}} common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea C. fringillae, is also {{occasionally}} found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the <b>US,</b> <b>even</b> on house sparrows. Lice include Menacanthus eurystemus, Brueelia nebulosa and Stumidoecus sturni. Other arthropod parasites include Ixodes ticks and mites such as Analgopsis passerinus, Boydaia stumi, Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, O. sylviarum, Proctophyllodes species, Pteronyssoides truncatus and Trouessartia rosteri. The hen mite D. gallinae is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite Androlaelaps casalis. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared to reuse old nests.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the <b>US,</b> <b>even</b> in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{during the}} 1950s, anti-miscegenation laws were {{repealed}} or overturned in state after state, {{except in the}} South. Nonetheless, in the 1950s, the repeal of anti-miscegenation laws was still a controversial issue in the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>even</b> among supporters of racial integration.|$|E
50|$|Like many <b>U.S.</b> <b>evening</b> {{newspapers}} in the post-war period, the News sustained declining circulation. Finally, in 1985, the News and Journal merged into a single morning newspaper under the News Journal name.|$|R
5000|$|This {{arrangement}} stood both {{papers in}} good stead for many years. However, the Banner began to suffer in the post-World War II era from the slow loss of readership that became common to most <b>U.S.</b> <b>evening</b> papers, which was largely {{attributed to the}} rise of television.|$|R

25|$|After this Williams {{set about}} {{spreading}} the word and he embarked on lecture tours to set up branches in Jamaica, Trinidad and the United States. On 28 June 1901 the Trinidad branch of the Pan African Association was formed, with branches in Naparima, Sangre Grande, Arima, Manzanilla, Tunapuna, Arouca and Chaguanas. He spent two months here and after his departure for the <b>US</b> <b>even</b> more local branches were formed.|$|E
25|$|In 1930-1940, the U.S. {{collaborated with}} Stalin regime by {{building}} around 1500 {{factories in the}} USSR using a slave labor of political prisoners. The U.S. also covered up genocide of East Ukraine in 1932-1933, that killed between 4 and 6 millions of Ukrainians {{and in the midst}} of it established a diplomatic relationship with the USSR. The <b>U.S.</b> <b>even</b> took as a payment grains and foods confiscated from Ukrainian farmers who were left to starve to death.|$|E
25|$|Wars from 1793 to 1814 caused {{withdrawal}} of most foreign shipping from the U.S., leaving {{trade in the}} Caribbean and Central and South America open for the U.S. Seizure of U.S. ships by France and Britain during the Napoleonic Wars led to the Embargo Act of 1807 which prohibited most foreign trade. The War of 1812, by cutting off almost all foreign trade, created a home market for goods made in the <b>U.S.</b> (<b>even</b> if they were more expensive), changing an early tendency toward free trade into a protectionism characterized by nationalism and protective tariffs.|$|E

25|$|In some tourist spots {{across the}} island, American brands such as Coca-Cola can be purchased. Ford tankers refuel planes in {{airports}} and some computers use Microsoft software. The {{origin of the}} financing behind such goods is not always clear. The goods often come from third parties based in countries outside the <b>U.S.,</b> <b>even</b> if the product being dealt originally has U.S. shareholders or investors. This can be seen, for example, with Nestlé products (which have a 10% US ownership) that can be bought in Cuba with Cuban convertible pesos (CUCs). These CUC pesos are hard currency that are traded in foreign exchange against the US dollar, Euro and other currencies.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} reason for Kol Nidre was {{suggested by the}} Zohar; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre we hope to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor: According to the holy Zohar, Kol Nidre is recited on Yom Kippur because, at times, the Heavenly judgment is handed down as an 'avowed decree' for which there can normally be no annulment. By reciting the Kol Nidre annulment of vows at this time, we are asking of God that He favor us by annuling any negative decrees of judgment that await <b>us,</b> <b>even</b> though we are undeserving of such annulment.|$|E
25|$|Israel and India share {{intelligence}} on terrorist groups. They have developed close defense and security ties since establishing diplomatic relations in 1991. In 2009, Israel overtook Russia as India's biggest arms supplier; the <b>U.S.</b> <b>even</b> gave Israel approval {{to sell the}} Phalcon to India after earlier forcing Jerusalem to cancel a similar deal with China. India has bought more than $5 billion worth of Israeli equipment since 2002. In addition, Israel is training Indian military units and discussing an arrangement to give Indian commandos instruction in counter-terrorist tactics and urban warfare. In December 2008, Israel and India signed a memorandum {{to set up an}} Indo-Israel Legal Colloquium to facilitate discussions and exchange programs between judges and jurists of the two countries. According to an international opinion survey conducted in 2009 on behalf of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, India is the most pro-Israel country in the world.|$|E

25|$|Despite being {{historically}} {{associated with}} doctorates in law, {{the title of}} doctor for lawyers has not customarily been used in English-speaking countries, where lawyers were traditionally not required to have a university degree and were trained by other lawyers by apprenticeship or in the Inns of Court. The exception being those areas where, up to the 19th century, civil law rather than common law was the governing tradition, including admiralty law, probate and ecclesiastical law: such cases were heard in the Doctor's Commons, and argued by advocates who held degrees either of doctor of civil law at Oxford or doctor of law at Cambridge. As such, lawyers practicing common law in England were not doctoral candidates and had not earned a doctorate. When university degrees became more common for those wanting to qualify as a lawyer in England, the degree awarded was the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.). Similarly in the <b>US,</b> <b>even</b> though degrees became standard for lawyers much earlier, the degree was again the LL.B., only becoming the Juris Doctor generally {{in the latter half}} of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The island {{chain saw}} {{significant}} fighting during World War II. Guam, a {{possession of the}} United States since 1898, was captured by Japan in an attack based from the Northern Mariana Islands that began {{on the day of}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 8, 1941, the same time as the Pearl Harbor attack across the international dateline). In 1944, the United States captured the Mariana Islands chain from Japan: the Northern Mariana Islands were desired by the U.S. as bombing bases to reach the Japanese mainland, with the invasion of Saipan being launched for that reason in June before the <b>U.S.</b> <b>even</b> moved to recapture Guam; a month later the U.S. recaptured Guam and captured Tinian. Once captured, the islands of Saipan and Tinian were used extensively by the United States military as they finally put mainland Japan within round-trip range of American B-29 bombers. In response, Japanese forces attacked the bases on Saipan and Tinian from November 1944 to January 1945. At the same time and afterwards, the United States Army Air Forces based out of these islands conducted an intense strategic bombing campaign against the Japanese cities of military and industrial importance, including Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe and others. Both the Enola Gay and the Bockscar (which dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively) flew their missions from Tinian's North Field.|$|E
25|$|Having {{received}} {{repeated and}} cryptic cablegrams from her husband, who {{had returned to}} Norway {{a year and a}} half earlier, Flagstad was forced to consider leaving the United States in 1941. Though dismissing the political implications of the departure of someone of her fame from the United States to German-occupied Norway, it was nonetheless a difficult decision for her. She had many friends, colleagues, and of course many fans all over the <b>US.</b> <b>Even</b> more importantly, her 20-year-old daughter Else had married an American named Arthur Dusenberry and was living with her new husband on a dude ranch in Bozeman, Montana. It was Edwin McArthur who gave the bride away at the wedding in Bozeman a year earlier. Nonetheless, against the best advice of her friends and colleagues, including former president Herbert Hoover, who pleaded with her to stay out of Europe, she returned to Norway via Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona, Marseille, and Berlin in April, 1941. Though during the war she performed only in Sweden and Switzerland, countries not occupied by German forces, this fact did not temper the storm of public opinion that hurt her personally and professionally for the next several years. Her husband was arrested after the war for profiteering during the occupation that involved his lumber business. This arrest, together with her decision to remain in occupied Norway, made her unpopular, particularly in the United States. The Norwegian ambassador and columnist Walter Winchell spoke out against her. In 1948, she performed several benefit concerts for the United Jewish Appeal. In defense of Flagstad's husband, Henry Johansen, it should be noted that after his death it was revealed that during the occupation he was arrested by the Gestapo and held for eight days. Also, one of Johansen's sons by his first marriage, Henry Jr, had been a member of the Norwegian underground throughout the war.|$|E

500|$|Frustrated by {{the lack}} of radio airplay {{received}} by previous Wilco albums, the band decided to branch out into television advertising.

The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982.

The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums. Born Again was panned upon release by critics.
