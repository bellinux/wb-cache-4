From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., {{all members of}} a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught the <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

The Codex contained two statutes that decreed the total destruction of paganism, even in private life; these provisions were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (John Malalas, Theophanes, John of Ephesus) tell of severe persecutions, even of men in high position. In 529, the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens was placed under state control as paganism, strangling this training school for this branch of Hellenistic philosophy..|$|E

The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E

One has a natural notion of an absolute (neighborhood) extensor K of X. It is shown that several concepts of set-theoretic topology can be naturally introduced using ideas of Extension Theory. Also, it is shown that several results of set-theoretic topology have a natural interpretation and simple proofs in Extension Theory. Here are sample results. Theorem. Suppose X is a topological space. Then:(a) X is normal iff every finite partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on a closed subset of X extends to a finite partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on X;(b) X is normal iff every countable partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on a closed subset of X extends to a countable partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on X;(c) X is collectionwise normal iff every partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on a closed subset of X extends to a partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on X;(d) if X is paracompact, then every locally finite partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on a closed subset of X extends to a locally finite partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on X;(e) if X is metrizable, then every point-finite partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on a closed subset of X extends to a point-finite partition <b>of</b> <b>unity</b> on X.
