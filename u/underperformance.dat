5|$|Surprised by the <b>underperformance</b> of Thunderbirds Are Go and {{convinced}} that the franchise still had cinematic potential, United Artists authorised {{the production of a}} sequel. However, Thunderbird 6 received a similarly unenthusiastic response on its release in 1968, and the Thunderbirds franchise was abandoned until the appearance of a reboot, starring live actors, in 2004. Meanwhile, the Zero-X astronauts were featured in their own strip in the Anderson-related TV Century 21 comic until 1969, and the MEV portion of the spacecraft appeared in the pilot episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E
5|$|A {{collectable}} {{card game}} {{based on the}} Shaman King series was produced by Tomy in Japan and released in the United States by Upper Deck in 2005. Upper Deck originally planned a mass market release of the game for January 2005, however, it was later announced that Blockbuster Video would have exclusive rights to sell the game from January 28 to February 15, 2005, after which it would be released to other retailers. In an interview with Upper Deck's Director of Brand and New Product Development, Cory Jones stated {{that it was the}} television show's <b>underperformance</b> and later cancellation which led to the cancellation of the trading card game.|$|E
5|$|Development of Sonic Advance {{began after}} Sega shifted their focus to {{third-party}} software development, {{due to the}} <b>underperformance</b> of the Dreamcast. The company recruited Dimps—a Japanese development studio consisting of former Neo Geo Pocket Color programmers—to lead development, {{with the assistance of}} longtime series developer Sonic Team. While the game follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts and designs were re-used from newer titles such as Sonic Adventure. The game has since been ported to Nokia's N-Gage and Android devices, and is available on the Wii U via the Virtual Console.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Sega, facing {{financial}} {{troubles with}} the <b>underperformance</b> of their Dreamcast console, shifted from first to third-party software publishing, with Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance (GBA) being their primary focuses. A team of developers {{was formed to}} begin development on Sonic the Hedgehog Advance (later renamed Sonic Advance), a Sonic title for the GBA that would commemorate the series' tenth anniversary. Development was led by Dimps—a team formed by several former Neo Geo Pocket Color developers and funded by Sega, Sony, and Bandai—with assistance from Sonic Team. Several of the team members had previously worked on the critically-acclaimed Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure (1999) for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.|$|E
5|$|In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 {{record and}} a PR of 2753. His score was matched by Alexander Onischuk and they played a match to break the tie. After drawing two rapid and two blitz games, Carlsen won the armageddon game. Immediately after the Biel tournament, Carlsen entered the open Arctic Chess Challenge in Tromsø, but his fourth-place result with +5=4 was a slight <b>underperformance</b> in terms of rating. In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034) after having a lost {{position}} at one point. A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.|$|E
5|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like is {{the third}} studio album {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani. It was released on March 18, 2016 by Interscope Records. Initially, the album {{was scheduled to be}} released in December 2014 with Stefani working with a handful of high-profile producers, and Benny Blanco serving as executive producer. However, after the <b>underperformance</b> of her 2014 singles and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she did not feel comfortable curating an album and scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again. The album's release was scheduled after Stefani hinted at it on her Twitter account.|$|E
5|$|When {{released}} on May 16 in the United States and Canada, the film grossed $55 million from 8,400 screens at 3,929 theaters in its opening weekend, ranking #1 {{at the box}} office. Disney said it was happy with the film's performance, although the opening fell short of industry expectations of $80 million and was also behind s opening gross of $65.6 million. By June 1 it grossed $115 million, while the first film had grossed $153 {{million in the same}} amount of time. Disney CEO Robert Iger attributed the film's <b>underperformance</b> to being released between two of the year's biggest hits, Iron Man and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers at {{the time}} of his England career even queried whether his disciplinarian {{upbringing}} in Jamaica to a military family and rumoured beatings as a child from his parents had contributed to his <b>underperformance</b> as an England footballer.|$|E
25|$|The Philippine Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez was impeached by the House of Representatives {{on charges}} of the office's alleged <b>underperformance</b> and failure to act on several cases during the {{presidency}} of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

25|$|While High Heels was a {{box office}} success in Spain, the film {{received}} poor reviews from Spanish film critics due to its melodramatic approach and unsuspecting tonal shifts. The film got a better critical reception in Italy and France and won France's César Award for Best Foreign Film. In the US, Miramax's lack of promotional effort was blamed for the film's <b>underperformance</b> in the country. It was however nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 NAB began a 9-month {{attempt to}} {{purchase}} AXA Asia Pacific. This attempt was blocked twice by the ACCC. The first time, in April 2010, {{was because the}} regulator believed that the merger would cause a substantial lessening of competition in the retail investment platform market. NAB subsequently lodged a revised bid which aimed to address these concerns however, was rejected a second time in September of that year. The AXA deal's drawn out process drew criticism for the Bank's <b>underperformance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kentucky {{also had}} two {{lopsided}} victories over SEC East regular season champion Tennessee. Although Gillispie continued {{to take the}} blame for the Wildcats' woes, he was also a victim of some of his youthful and inexperienced recruits' <b>underperformance</b> and the lack of consistent play at the point guard position. Gillispie continued to publicly encourage his players and praise their work ethic despite the team's inconsistent play during the 2008–09 season. Such encouragement manifested itself in Gillispie's public statements criticizing his players after close losses.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{the album}} brought {{worldwide}} sales of 2.3 million units {{according to the}} International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), making it the ninth best-selling effort of the year. It went on to sell 2.5 million copies as of July 2014. The album's commercial performance has led numerous publications {{to suggest that it}} had fallen short of its sales expectations. Due to claims of Artpop alleged <b>underperformance,</b> Gaga publicly addressed rumors that the album's sales had lost her label $25 million and had led to staff layoffs, calling them fake.|$|E
25|$|Sleeping Beauty is a 1959 American {{animated}} musical fantasy film {{produced by}} Walt Disney based on The Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault. The 16th Disney animated feature film, {{it was released}} to theaters on January 29, 1959, by Buena Vista Distribution. This was the last Disney adaptation of a fairy tale for some years because of its initial mixed critical reception and <b>underperformance</b> at the box office; the studio {{did not return to}} the genre until 30 years later, after Walt Disney died in 1966, with the release of The Little Mermaid (1989).|$|E
25|$|Star Trek Beyond underperformed financially {{at the box}} office. Scott Mendelson of Forbes {{observed}} that one factor contributing to the film's <b>underperformance</b> was its untimely release in a crowded summer {{in which it was}} surrounded by other tentpole films like Ghostbusters, Jason Bourne and Suicide Squad. He also noted that had Paramount released the film for the Star Treks 50th anniversary on September 8, the film could have benefited from that occasion, as demonstrated in 2012 when MGM released the James Bond film Skyfall (which went on to gross over $1 billion) for that series' 50th anniversary.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} {{vulnerability}} in Pakistan are the everyday harassment by corrupt government officials, {{as well as}} their <b>underperformance,</b> exclusion and denial of basic rights to many in Pakistan. Also, lack of adequate health care by the state lead the poor to seek private sources, which are expensive, but still preferable to the possibility of medical malpractice and being given expired medicines in state run medical facilities. Also, the failure by the state to provide adequate law and order {{in many parts of the}} country is a factor in the rise of vulnerability of the poor.|$|E
25|$|During its {{original}} release in January 1959, Sleeping Beauty grossed approximately $5.3 million in theater rentals (the distributor's {{share of the}} box office gross). Sleeping Beauty's production costs, which totaled $6 million, made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features: Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and Lady and the Tramp. The high production costs of Sleeping Beauty, coupled with the <b>underperformance</b> {{of much of the}} rest of Disney's 1959–1960 release slate, resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and there were massive lay-offs throughout the animation department.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened, on {{the same}} date that Mediaset's La Cinq (unrelated to the resort) ceased transmissions. Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A {{government}} survey indicated that {{half a million people}} carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct RER railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible. Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels, leading to <b>underperformance.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the [...] season, {{after playing}} just 54 games with the team, Ball was sent down and {{released}} to the Portland Beavers. He refused to play for the minor league team and this, coupled with the <b>underperformance</b> of the infielders brought in to replace him, resulted in the Naps repurchasing his contract.|$|E

500|$|Despite the <b>underperformance</b> of Thunderbirds Are Go, Gerry Anderson {{received}} two awards for Thunderbirds in 1966, {{first with the}} presentation of a Silver Medal for Outstanding Artistic Achievement by the Royal Television Society, and then an appointment as an Honorary Fellow of the British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society. Dismissing the box office failure of Thunderbirds Are Go as a one-off misfortune, United Artists advised Anderson to produce a second film, which would be titled Thunderbird 6. Anderson remembers the period of transition: [...] "None of us... could understand why the film hadn't succeeded, so it was decided we would make another one." ...|$|E
500|$|In Canada, where [...] "Promiscuous" [...] {{topped the}} singles chart, [...] "Maneater" [...] reached number twenty-two on 23 November 2006 (its fifteenth week). Its <b>underperformance</b> was {{attributed}} to the limited release of the CD single, which had been sold through retailers as early as [...] "Promiscuous".

[...] It had sold 150,000 copies in the US as of May 2015. Elsewhere in North America, the record peaked at number 50 on the Canadian Albums Chart. In August 2012, Diamandis commented that she believed consumers in the United Kingdom had misinterpreted her comical effort with a perceived abandonment of her original musical inspiration, thus resulting in a relative <b>underperformance</b> in the country. In contrast, she felt that her American audience was more receptive of Electra Heart and her evolving public image.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 2015, {{just over}} two weeks after its wide release, Universal pulled the film from 2,072 theaters in the United States. Variety said the film {{suffered}} from fierce competition {{at the box office}}, possible public weariness with Jobs and the low profile of Fassbender in the title role, and that the <b>underperformance</b> at the box office could hurt the film's award chances. After his film was pulled from wide release in the U.S., Danny Boyle expressed disappointment at the box office performance of Steve Jobs, while suggesting that Universal expanded the film's release [...] "too wide too soon" [...] and that the studio's move was [...] "arrogant".|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{was quickly}} {{released}} after the <b>underperformance</b> of the album's first single, [...] "Dirrty". It achieved international success {{and was the}} highest-charting single from Stripped in several territories. The song peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became Aguilera's longest-charting solo track, spending twenty-seven weeks on the chart. The song additionally topped Billboard Adult Contemporary, Hot Dance Club Songs, and Pop Songs component charts. By March 2006, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 copies..

500|$|While Schmidt {{said before}} the game's release that the team wanted to develop [...] "a whole series of games {{that take place in}} the Terra Nova world", the game's poor sales made the {{creation}} of a sequel [...] "impractical", according to Paul Neurath. As the game's publisher, Looking Glass took on the full burden of its commercial <b>underperformance,</b> which contributed to the company's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000. Neurath later said, [...] "If we could do Terra Nova over, I would have dumped the cinematics and done online team play instead. Who knows, maybe then the Tribes II and Halo teams would be talking about the influence of Terra Nova on their games".|$|E

Its producers reported that the venture was commercially successful. Siddharth Roy Kapur (CEO of UTV Motion Pictures) said, [...] "'7 Khoon Maaf' has worked well for us commercially due to a combination of tight production budgeting, optimised spending on prints and publicity and a pre-sales strategy that helped us to de-risk the film via sales of home video, music, satellite and theatrical rights even before the release".|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1950s, with Walt Disney's {{attention}} primarily set on new endeavours such as live-action films, television, and the Disneyland theme park, {{production of}} the animated films was left primarily {{in the hands of}} the [...] "Nine Old Men" [...] trust of head animators and directors. This led to several delays in approvals during the production of Sleeping Beauty, which was finally released in 1959. At $6 million, it was Disney's most expensive film to date, produced in a heavily stylized art style devised by artist Eyvind Earle and presented in large-format Super Technirama 70 with six-track stereophonic sound. However, the film's large production costs and <b>underperformance</b> at the box office resulted in the studio posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, leading to massive layoffs throughout the studio.|$|E
500|$|Box-office {{analysts and}} critics debated the film's <b>underperformance.</b> Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, {{reasoned}} the film underperformed {{at the box}} office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea [...] "of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb". [...] "The horror-comedy genre is the toughest sell in Hollywood", he said. He noted films Tremors, Slither, Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks and The Evil Dead series, and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, [...] "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can." [...] In addition, he labeled the Scream franchise as more [...] "straight-up horror" [...] than comedy and stated Zombielands box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.|$|E
500|$|The group's {{members were}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the release of}} [...] "Soul Sound" [...] as a single, because they wanted to venture into an R sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction. Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals. Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, [...] "New Year", [...] "Run for Cover" [...] and [...] "Soul Sound", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial <b>underperformance</b> was a positive experience because, saying: [...] "Everything happens for a reason and it looks like it has all worked out". [...] "Soul Sound" [...] was featured in the 2001 film Summer Catch, which stars such actors as Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jessica Biel.|$|E
500|$|Paulini's second studio album Superwoman (2006) {{failed to}} match the {{commercial}} success of her debut album, and only managed to reach number 72. Despite the <b>underperformance</b> of Superwoman, the album produced the singles [...] "Rough Day", [...] "So Over You" [...] and [...] "I Believe". During this time, Paulini enjoyed commercial success again {{as a member of}} the Australian girl group Young Divas. The group released two top-ten albums, Young Divas (2006) and New Attitude (2007), and achieved three top-fifteen singles, including the hugely successful [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real". After Paulini parted ways with the Young Divas and ended her contract with Sony BMG in 2008, she focused more on songwriting. Through a publishing deal with independent label Albert Music, Paulini was able to travel and write songs in Europe, New York and Los Angeles. She wrote songs for several recording artists in Europe, including Monrose, Edurne and Yoann Fréget.|$|E

On the UK Singles Chart, [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] debuted at number fourteen, {{becoming}} Furtado's highest charting single since 2006's All Good Things (Come to an End). On the North American Billboard charts, the song became Furtado's first since 2010's [...] "Night Is Young" [...] to not enter the Billboard Hot 100. However, [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] reached the top forty of the Pop Songs chart and the top ten of the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Smith felt the <b>underperformance</b> was helped by moving The Spirit Indestructibles release date, [...] "so there’s no need {{to get this thing}} that supposed to be this club banger intro track and force it up the chart." ...|$|E
500|$|While LucasArts {{proceeded}} to produce Escape from Monkey Island in , they canceled development of sequels to Sam & Max Hit the Road and Full Throttle stating that [...] "After careful evaluation of current market place realities and underlying economic considerations, we've {{decided that this}} was not the appropriate time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC." [...] Subsequently, the studio dismissed many of the people involved with their adventure games, some of whom went on to set up Telltale Games, creating an episodic series of Sam & Max games. These events, along with other changes in the video game market towards action-based games, are seen as primary causes in the decline of the adventure game genre. Grim Fandangos <b>underperformance</b> was seen as a sign that the genre was commercially [...] "dead" [...] to rival Sierra, as well. LucasArts stated in [...] that they do not plan on returning to adventure games until the [...] "next decade". Ultimately the studio stopped developing video games in 2013 after The Walt Disney Company acquisition of Lucasfilm, and was dissolved shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The Princess and the Frog, {{directed}} by Ron Clements and John Musker, was the studio's first hand-drawn animated film in five years. A {{return to the}} musical-comedy format of the 1990s with songs by Randy Newman, the film was released in 2009 to a positive critical reception and was also nominated for three Academy Awards, including two for Best Song. The box office performance of The Princess and the Frog– a total of $267 million earned worldwide against a $105 million production budget– {{was seen as an}} <b>underperformance</b> due to competition with Avatar. In addition, the [...] "Princess" [...] aspect of the title was blamed, resulting in future Disney films then in production about princesses being given neutral/symbolic titles: Rapunzel became Tangled and The Snow Queen became Frozen. In 2014, Disney animator Tom Sito compared the film's box office performance to that of The Great Mouse Detective (1986), which was a step-up from the theatrical run of the 1985 film The Black Cauldron. In 2009, the studio also produced the computer-animated Prep & Landing holiday special for the ABC television network.|$|E
