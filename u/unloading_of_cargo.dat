5|$|A {{flat-bottomed}} design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.|$|E

50|$|As cargo officer, a {{chief mate}} oversees the loading, stowage, {{securing}} and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargoes.</b> Moreover, the chief mate is {{accountable for the}} care <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> during the voyage. This includes a general responsibility for the ship's stability and special care for cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful.|$|R
50|$|Long Load's {{association}} with the river is long standing. A bridge over the river {{is known to have}} existed by 1335, while by 1448 there were wharves for the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargoes</b> from boats using the river. The current five arch bridge has medieval origins, but was rebuilt in the 18th century and widened in 1814 it cost of £452. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and has been designated as a grade II* Listed building.|$|R
25|$|In April 1941, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} Western Command and moved to North West England and the West Midlands, replacing the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division. The division was spread out in the area between Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham, with divisional headquarters established at Ribbesford House near Bewdley. During the Liverpool Blitz, several hundred men were deployed to the city for several weeks {{to help with the}} <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> ships. This deployment also saw {{the division}}'s first casualties of the war due to the German bombing. On 18 July, Alan Brooke (now Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces) inspected elements of the division based in Crewe.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s Parsons was {{recognized}} as a proponent of racial integration, in contrast to most of his professional colleagues. In 1924 the Army War College surveyed commissioned officers about whether and how to integrate Army units. At the time, African Americans served in segregated units, usually under white officers. Based on his experience in the Spanish-American War and his observations of African American soldiers during World War I, Parsons argued for desegregating Army units and having each one incorporate a set percentage of black soldiers. In his view, black soldiers {{could be expected to}} perform capably if given the same training as whites, and incorporating them into units with whites would prevent them from being singled out for inferior duties like kitchen patrol and the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> Parsons was convinced that African Americans could also serve as officers, although his point of view was {{that they would not be}} able to lead white soldiers effectively due to the prejudice of the times, but could instead aspire to command positions in the transportation and supply units that often contained large numbers of black soldiers in wartime. The Army did not agree with Parsons' recommendations, and continued to allow African Americans to serve only in segregated units, and with few opportunities for assignment to leadership positions.|$|E
500|$|Murmansk {{had limited}} port {{facilities}} and slow <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> (often performed by Soviet women and political prisoners), which, coupled with inclement weather and long waits for convoy escorts, often required lengthy stays by Allied cargo ships. El Oriente was no exception, staying in Murmansk {{for nearly five}} weeks. To compound the lengthy wait (and, often, accompanying boredom) faced by cargo ships waiting to unload, the nearest German airfield was [...] away—about 7 to 10 minutes flying time—which gave almost no advance warning of air raids. German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti-aircraft fire, drop their payloads, and fly away. El Oriente was caught in one such attack on 27 February, with four of the ship's Naval Armed Guards men killed in the attack.|$|E
50|$|A {{loadmaster}} is an aircrew {{member on}} civilian aircraft or military transport aircraft tasked with the safe loading, transport and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> aerial <b>cargoes.</b> Loadmasters {{serve in the}} militaries and civilian airlines of many nations.|$|R
50|$|Navigation {{is carried}} out using two {{electronic}} charts which integrate GPS, dGPS, AIS and ARPA, which usually allows {{the position of the}} ship to be plotted with an accuracy of 100 meters. NYK Vega’s computers also assist in the efficient loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cargo</b> and containers.|$|R

500|$|The {{squadron}} operates eight Boeing C-17 GlobemasterIIIs, {{the first}} of which entered service in December 2006. The eighth and last was delivered in November 2015. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, the latter being responsible for the loading, carriage and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> or passengers. The C-17 can carry 70 tonnes of equipment, and is large enough to accommodate helicopters, tanks and other military vehicles. It can also carry over 130 passengers, and is designed for aerial despatch of paratroops or cargo. The C-17 has a range of some [...] and is able to operate from short and unsealed airstrips. Flown with a joystick and fly-by-wire controls, the aircraft is also highly manoeuvrable and responsive considering its size. It can be refuelled in flight by the Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports operated by No.33 Squadron.|$|E
500|$|The {{squadron}} operates twelve Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules, which entered {{service in}} 1999. The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster, {{the latter being}} responsible for the loading, carriage and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> and passengers. The C-130J can carry [...] of cargo, or some 120 passengers. It [...] has a range of over [...] without payload, {{and is able to}} operate from short and unsealed airstrips. No.285 Squadron, also based at Richmond under No.84 Wing, is equipped with a C-130J full-flight mission simulator, [...] C-130 airframes, and other instructional tools, and is responsible for training No.37 Squadron's aircrew and maintenance personnel. [...] maintains a detachment of two aircraft at AlMinhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates to support operations in the Middle East Region under Operation Accordion. The C-130Js are expected to remain in RAAF service until 2030.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the convoy}} {{had arrived at}} its destination, the danger of attack was still present. The nearest German {{airfield}} was [...] away—about 7 to 10 minutes flying time—which gave almost no advance warning of air raids. German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti-aircraft fire, drop their bombs, and fly away. West Cheswald was luckier than some. Her closest call occurred when a bomb fell [...] away from the ship during an air raid on 23 April, destroying a 50-ton crane that had earlier finished unloading the ship; West Cheswald suffered no major damage {{in any of the}} attacks. Despite the fact that Murmansk had limited port facilities and typically slow <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo,</b> West Cheswald was ready to sail in the next departing convoy, Convoy QP 11, on 28 April. West Cheswalds armed guardsmen received a battle star for their participation in Convoy PQ 14.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the modern}} city of Naha was established, Tomari was a magiri, {{a type of}} municipality. Tomari served as the primary port for Ryukyuan ships {{travelling}} within the Ryūkyū Islands to dock and to engage in loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> their <b>cargo.</b> Tribute received from Amami Ōshima was handled by the local officials at Tomari.|$|R

50|$|Initial white {{settlement}} of Stradbroke Island was at Amity Point where a pilot station {{was established in}} 1825. More fertile soil, good sources of fresh water and a better harbour was found at the present location of Dunwich so settlement soon concentrated there. Dunwich became a staging point where larger ships were <b>unloaded</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> which was placed into smaller vessels to be carried over the sand bars of Brisbane River {{and up to the}} penal {{settlement of}} Brisbane. The Dunwich settlement was in close proximity to a major Aboriginal camp at Myora Spring. Whites and Europeans generally lived in reasonable harmony though there were moments of conflict as would be expected within the context of two very different cultures meeting for the first time.|$|R
500|$|After her {{guns were}} installed, West Nohno {{had made her}} way to Sydney, Nova Scotia, by 27 December when she sailed as a part of transatlantic Convoy SC 86. With her {{destination}} set for Murmansk, West Nohno peeled off from the convoy and headed to Reykjavík, Iceland. While at anchor in Iceland, West Nohno experienced a winter storm from 15 to 19 January 1942. On 15 January, the storm, packing winds of [...] and gusts of up to , drove West Nohno into , damaging the heavy cruiser. Apparently suffering no major damage herself in the collision, West Nohno joined Arctic convoy PQ 9, which sailed on 1 February and arrived at Murmansk nine days later. Though the convoy had arrived at its destination, the danger of German attack was still present. The nearest German airfield was [...] away—about 7 to 10 minutes flying time—which gave almost no advance warning of air raids. German dive bombers would silently glide in below Soviet anti-aircraft fire, drop their payloads, and fly away. Despite the fact that Murmansk had limited port facilities and typically slow <b>unloading</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo,</b> sometimes requiring ships to remain in port for weeks or months, West Nohno was ready to sail in Convoy QP 8 on 1 March, returning to Reykjavik on 11 March. She sailed for Halifax eleven days later and arrived on 7 April.|$|E
