50|$|Whatever {{process is}} {{used to make the}} {{tableting}} blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar. First, the powder is filled into the die from above. The mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in the die, the cross-sectional area of the die, and the powder density. At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch. After die filling, the <b>upper</b> <b>punch</b> is lowered into the die and the powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%. The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, pre-compression or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500-50 ms per tablet). Finally, the <b>upper</b> <b>punch</b> is pulled {{up and out of the}} die (decompression), and the tablet is ejected from the die by lifting the lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of the die. This process is repeated for each tablet.|$|E

50|$|Tablet presses, {{also called}} {{tableting}} machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet {{at a time}} (single-station presses), with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer. Common manufacturers of tablet presses include Natoli, Stokes, Fette Compacting, Korsch, Kikusui, Manesty, B&D, PTK, IMA and Courtoy. Tablet presses must allow the operator to adjust {{the position of the}} lower and <b>upper</b> <b>punches</b> accurately, so that the tablet weight, thickness and density can each be controlled. This is achieved using a series of cams, rollers, and/or tracks that act on the tablet tooling (punches). Mechanical systems are also incorporated for die filling, and for ejecting and removing the tablets from the press after compression. Pharmaceutical tablet presses are required to be easy to clean and quick to reconfigure with different tooling, because they are usually used to manufacture many different products.There are 2 main standards of tablet tooling used in pharmaceutical industry: American standard ‘TSM’ and European standard ‘EU’. TSM and EU configurations are similar to each other but cannot be interchanged.|$|R

In the compaction process, the force applied for compaction (<b>upper</b> <b>punch)</b> was greatly influenced by the friction between die wall and powder bed during transmission to the lower punch. Wall friction was found to increase with the increasing load and weight of powder due to an increase in surface contact with the die wall. The coefficients of wall friction decreased from 0. 47 to 0. 36 for increasing weight of powder from 0. 8 – 1. 5 g.

However, there are some interesting features in that study which we wish to revisit before proceeding. One conclusion made was that the measured average surface roughness and the gloss have a linear correlation. Another observation was that although a tablet set consisted of tablets that have varied nominal porosity (volumetric property), the gloss (surface property) value was different for the opposite faces of the flat-faced compacts. In other words, such tablets have different surface roughness/surface porosity due to the compression cycle based on using a dye with <b>upper</b> and lower <b>punches.</b> Differences recorded in the surface roughness for the opposite sides of a given tablet can lead to different dissolution rate of the tablet, and also {{serve as the basis for}} screening of fake tablets as will be shown later in the this study.

The approach {{of the present study}} was to make a comparative evaluation among these polymers and to assess the effect of physicochemical nature of the active ingredient on drug release profile. The study reveals that, the release of water soluble drug as higher than the drug with lower solubility and the extent of release rate was changed with the nature and content of polymer in the matrix. The type of polymers used imparts a conspicuous effect on release mechanism. The data generated in this study also shows that, the drug release from formula based on combination of plastic and elastic matrices was different upon changing the weight ratio of both. The release was more extended by increasing the plastic polymer weight ratio. In addition, different profiles were recorded by combining the plastic polymers with a brittle one, in which the more the plastic content, the higher the release percentage observed. Consequently, the drug aqueous solubility has markedly affected drug release pattern from the tablet formulations. However, a number of critical parameters such as tabletting conditions, compression forces, <b>upper</b> and lower <b>punch</b> compression forces, hardness, tensile strength and friability will affect the physicho-mechanical behavior of the tablets from different matrices. Those parameters should be taken into consideration during formulation design. A confirmatory analytical technique, namely DSC, IR and X-ray diffractometery, were used to prove the physicochemical stability of the used drug and the absence of any chemical interaction with the matrix forming polymers used. In addition, the incorporation of EC resulted in the manufacture of tablets of sufficient hardness.

40|$|This is {{the final}} {{technical}} report for the Department of Energy NETL project NT 01931 Energy Efficient Press and Sinter of Titanium Powder for Low-Cost Components in Vehicle Applications. Titanium {{has been identified as}} one of the key materials with the required strength that can reduce the weight of automotive components and thereby reduce fuel consumption. Working with newly developed sources of titanium powder, Webster-Hoff will develop the processing technology to manufacture low cost vehicle components using the single press/single sinter techniques developed for iron based powder metallurgy today. Working with an automotive or truck manufacturer, Webster-Hoff will demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing a press and sinter titanium component for a vehicle application. The project objective is two-fold, to develop the technology for manufacturing press and sinter titanium components, and to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a titanium component for a vehicle application. The lowest cost method for converting metal powder into a net shape part is the Powder Metallurgy Press and Sinter Process. The method involves compaction of the metal powder in a tool (usually a die and <b>punches,</b> <b>upper</b> and lower) at a high pressure (up to 60 TSI or 827 MPa) to form a green compact with the net shape of the final component. The powder in the green compact is held together by the compression bonds between the powder particles. The sinter process then converts the green compact to a metallurgically bonded net shape part through the process of solid state diffusion. The goal of this project is to expand the understanding and application of press and sinter technology to Titanium Powder applications, developing techniques to manufacture net shape Titanium components via the press and sinter process. In addition, working with a vehicle manufacturer, demonstrate the feasibility of producing a titanium component for a vehicle. This is not a research program, but rather a project to develop a process for press and sinter of net shape Titanium components.

When examining the elastic energy at increasing SP levels, a decrease in elastic energy was evident (0. 60, 0. 50 and 0. 31 Nm for 2. 5 %, 5 % and 10 % starch at 4 % SSG and 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures respectively). At a given composition, an increase in compaction pressure led to an increase in elastic energy (0. 15, 0. 33 and 0. 50 Nm at 4 % SSG and 5 % starch for 96 ± 8, 163 ± 13, 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures, respectively). When changing SSG and binder (SP) concentration levels tensile strength was indirectly proportional to elastic energy during compaction. Negative influence of SSG on elastic energy indicated by increased EE and decreased tensile strength and positive influence of SP was evident onlower elastic energy and higher tensile strength of tablets...|$|R
