The demographics of Johnston High School quickly and dramatically changed, {{as evidenced by}} the White faces of the school’s homecoming court and the “Who’s Who” section of its subsequent yearbooks. In 1985, the school’s homecoming court was entirely White, and only one of 24 students in the “Who’s Who” section of the yearbook had a Hispanic surname. The White editor of the 1984 yearbook shared an idyllic view of racial integration: “Busing would take kids from the different parts of town and all the different walks of life, and gather them all together in one school. Both parents and students alike objected to the busing. Many people went to private schools, or moved into a different school district. Those that went along with busing did suffer some, but the majority of the students had no regrets later.

The integro-differential and ordinary differential equations obtained from the bond graph models are simulated using ODE 45 (Ordinary Differential Equation Solver) on MATLAB and Simulink. The results, thus, obtained are compared with CVS (Cardiovascular System) physiological data present in Simbiosys (a software for simulating biological systems) and also with the CVS Wiggers diagram of heart cycle. As the cardiac activity is a multi domain process that includes mechanical, hydraulic, chemical and electrical events; therefore, for modeling such systems a unified modeling approach is needed.

The Bond Graph conventionalism approach is a graphical method principally powerful to portray multi-energy systems, as it is formulated on the portrayal of power exchanges.

The whole simulator takes independent close-loop position feedback control on each valve-controlled cylinder actuator. A proportional controller with dynamic pressure feedback and feed-forward compensation is proposed.

30|$|A {{preferred}} {{mechanism of}} a reclamation bonding {{system is that}} the bond amount be sufficient for a third-party to do the reclamation work and supervised by the administrative authority. The cost should also include all administrative, maintenance, and monitoring costs (World Bank Group 2008). In Canada, the lack of calculating the reclamation bond with a third-party and administration cost analysis has decreased incentives for companies to act responsibly and complete reclamation and closure, and therefore increases the risk to public financial resources and health (CCSG Associates 2001). In China, few mining companies reclaim the disturbed land, or {{have any of the}} bond refunded, because the bond amount paid is lower than the reclamation costs (Xiao et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2012). This defeats the original intention of a bonding system which should be to encourage mining companies to fulfill reclamation obligations and have the bond money returned. Bond calculations based on a third-party reclamation cost provides an incentive for a company to complete reclamation work by itself because it can do so less expensively than a third-party (CCSG Associates 2001). A <b>unified</b> <b>bond</b> calculation method can help to ensure the adequacy of bond amounts and will contribute to fairness among mining companies for reclamation.|$|E

Evans writes (1977 : 42) "I have argued that actions and feelings should not be separated in the study of social solidarity. Durkheim regarded both of these phenomena as important in his definition of the term. " Evans also suggests (1977 : 31) that "Social solidarity for Durkheim was the ensemble of beliefs and sentiments that are common to the average members of society. These beliefs have {{a life of their own}} (Martindale, 1971 : 89). " Furthermore, (1977 : 30) "To Durkheim, social solidarity was the essential property of all societies. It was the bond that united individuals. " From this reading of Evans, the reader gets two ideas of what social solidarity means to Durkheim: 1) that it is the ensemble of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of society; and 2) that it is the <b>unifying</b> <b>bond.</b> Although Evans presents these two concepts of the meaning of social solidarity, he chooses to utilize the first for his argument.

40|$|Dynastic {{transfer}} in the Dutch Republic. The {{political and religious}} meaning of the Stadholders' funeral processions This article argues that the programme of the funeral processions of the Stadholders in the Dutch Republic {{can be read as}} a response to political and religious tensions in Dutch society after the Revolt. Basing themselves partly on the burial ceremonies of the former Habsburg sovereign, the directors of these processions created a separation between the private and public identities of the deceased. This separation between identities and institutional spheres was essential since the sovereignty of the Dutch state was no longer involved in the symbolic transfer of dynastic powers to a new heir. The first division of the parade was therefore marked by heraldic symbols referring to the princely household as a private institution and to family possessions. In the second, public section of the procession members of republican institutions participated.

Anderson’s reflections on nationalism can inform our readings of select early modern texts: Shakespeare’s history plays, with their tales of ‘civil butchery’, come to mind.

A host of literary historians—Richard Helgerson, Andrew Hadfield, Willy Maley, Vince Carey, Thomas Herron, Andrew Escobedo—have examined Spenser’s contribution to the construction of nationalist discourse in the early modern period. Memory’s place—not just cultural or social memory but mnemonic culture—within this discourse has yet to be fully explored. Spenser’s View is an invaluable text because it posits an alternative, less upbeat, model of the nation as an imagined, fraternal community. Spenser’s prose dialogue forges a collective identity out of shared hatred and, most importantly, bitter, traumatic, and vivid memories of past bloodshed and violence.

Today, {{the most salient}} feature {{of the international system}} is not the presence of multiple opposing great power poles, but rather, an enduring leading power commercial confederacy. The Western order develops out of a US led hegemonic subsystem following World War II and steadily deepens and expands. Chapter 2 of the dissertation argues that this Western order is a great deal more enduring than previously thought, precisely because cohesion rests on the interactive combination of multiple <b>unifying</b> <b>bonds.</b> This order is now a semi-permanent, path-dependent, and remarkably resilient feature of the international political landscape. The commercial confederacy is a leading power configuration that now conditions the behavior, to varying degrees, of every state in the system.

To be competitive, states are led to pursue distinct politico-economic strategies of integration. Chapter 3 develops a novel systemic theory of international politics.

One can tune the properties of the known materials and design the novel materials with desired properties knowing what is responsible for the chemical reactivity, structure, and stability of those materials. The <b>unified</b> chemical <b>bonding</b> theory could address all these questions, but we do not have one available yet. The most accepted general theory of chemical bonding was proposed by Lewis in 1916, though Lewis’s theory fails to explain the bonding in materials with delocalized electron density such as sub-nano and nanoclusters, as well as aromatic organic and organometallic molecules. The dissertation presents a set of projects that can be considered the steps towards the development of the <b>unified</b> chemical <b>bonding</b> theory by extending the ideas of Lewis. The dissertation also presents the studies of the properties of multiply charged anions, which tend to undergo Coulomb explosion in the isolated state and release the excess energy stored in them. It is shown how the properties of multiply charged anions can be tuned upon changing the chemical identity of the species or interaction with solvent molecules. Our findings led to the discovery of a new long-lived triply charged anionic species, whose metastability was explained by the existence of a repulsive Coulomb barrier.

The crucial issue is that the vibration frequency, associated with a certain cation-anion bond, depends on the length of the latter, and the bond length, in its turn, depends not only on the average alloy concentration, but on local variations of it. In an (A,B) C substitutional alloy, the A-C bond length differ in A-rich and A-poor regions, yielding a splitting of the A-C vibration frequency. Such splittings can be measured and reproduced in first-principles calculations. An analysis of vibration spectra helps to get an insight into the structural short-range (clustering) and long-range (formation of extended chains of certain cation-anion pairs and other structural motives at the mesoscopic scale) tendencies. For this however, one needs first-principles benchmark calculations for representative model systems.

In my research the experience of being-in-community is explicated via phenomenological analysis, which allows some of the eidetic structures of the phenomenon to come to light. The experience is represented by four interpretive themes; encountering the other; emptying and emptiness; speaking; and being-in-community, with chapters five arid six showing the meaning of the experience for CBW participants. A phenomenological approach is used to report the meaning of experience, as phenomenology is suited to explicating both ideographic and homothetic representations of experience. The experience of being-in-community is shown to have properties that can profoundly affect and change the experiencing person.
