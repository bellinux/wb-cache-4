5|$|Meanwhile, Meg {{is given}} {{a job at a}} local {{convenience}} store. Meg is extremely happy with her job and she decides to help Chris get a job there, too. Chris immediately becomes friends with the store owner, Carl, and he {{is given a}} large promotion which Carl originally promised to Meg. When Meg takes issue with this, she is fired. Lois, to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him to stand up for Meg by getting her job back. Chris is able to do this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job back to see if he would stand <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Naomi wakes up, with Emily asleep next to her. She {{is tempted}} to stroke her hair, but instead gets dressed and goes to college, leaving Emily in her bed. At college, she sees the massive presidential {{campaign}} staged by Cook and JJ (Ollie Barbieri). She launches her own campaign to rival Cook, but finds that most of her classmates' support is for Cook's anarchist ideas. She is doubly humiliated {{in front of the}} form when Cook ridicules her and Emily subsequently stands <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She flees to Kieran for comfort but leaves him, shocked and disgusted, when he kisses her. She goes home and, after finding a note from Emily in her bed, cries herself to sleep.|$|E

25|$|Duc de la Vauguyon had {{captured}} and ransomed a lobster smack sailing from Norway to Britain. The {{master of the}} smack informed Montague that the privateer had had a consort. Medeas rigging was too cut <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to pursue the consort, so Montague sent Piercy after her. Piercy caught up with Compte de Maurepas {{after a few hours}} and the privateer struck without resistance.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to her brother, who quarreled {{with their father}} and eventually disobeyed his wishes with respect to career path and choice of spouse, Marianne remained entirely subordinate to her father. She {{fell in love with}} Franz d'Ippold, who was a captain and private tutor, but was forced by her father to turn down his marriage proposal. Wolfgang attempted, in vain, to get Marianne to stand <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> own preference.|$|E

25|$|Another {{close friend}} was George Eliot, whom Georgiana met in February 1868. The self-educated novelist {{encouraged}} her young friend to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> lack of education, and Georgiana studied to improve her scant French and German, and took Latin lessons. They remained close until Eliot's sudden marriage in 1880, of which Georgiana had no inkling in advance, left her feeling betrayed and untrusted. The rift was never mended, for Eliot died that December.|$|E
25|$|A {{baroness}} tells Clovis a {{story about}} a hyena that she and her friend Constance encountered while out fox hunting. Later, the hyena follows them, stopping briefly to eat a gypsy child. Shortly after this, the hyena is killed by a motorcar. The baroness immediately claims the corpse as her beloved dog Esmé, and the guilty owner of the car gets his chauffeur to bury the animal and later sends her a diamond brooch to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> loss.|$|E
25|$|Having left Chapman, Cradock {{began the}} next ten years of her life in London living in destitution, selling {{cleaning}} products door to door. She then worked in a dressmaking shop. Things finally picked <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> when she began to work at various restaurants and was introduced to the works of Auguste Escoffier, which proved influential. She later wrote passionately about the change from service à la française to service à la russe and hailed Escoffier as a saviour of British cooking.|$|E

25|$|Ivy's {{father had}} ambitions {{for her to}} become a concert pianist, but she was {{inspired}} to become a jazz musician after hearing a Benny Goodman record and learned to play clarinet and alto saxophone. She left school at 14 and {{took a job at}} the Montague Burton factory in Leeds, putting aside half a crown from her wages each week to save <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> first saxophone. She supplemented her income by playing in dance bands in the evenings.|$|E
25|$|Although he did {{not hold}} her {{responsible}} for Alpha's loss, Sir Alan raised doubts about whether Lucinda was emotionally strong enough {{to continue in the}} process, after Jenny turned hostile against her by the halfway point of the task on the belief that she wasn't working fast enough, berating Sara when she stood <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> while remaining hostile throughout the boardroom. While Jenny was lambasted for her many errors, including her lack of involvement in the pricing strategies, her appalling behaviour towards her teammates, particularly to Lucinda, earned her a warning she would be fired if she acted in this way again.|$|E
25|$|Kristen: A girl who, though squeamish {{about much}} else, has {{a fondness for}} ghost stories and fairy tales.

She loves to dress <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> stories or bring something for effect, sometimes to scare the others with and her stories almost always deal with ghosts from the past who have unfinished business that they cannot complete without the aid of the living. In season 3, she left the Midnight Society due to her and her family moving.|$|E

25|$|Kvitová also {{possesses}} notable {{amount of}} variety in her game. Her volleys {{tend to come}} more from her forehand, her stronger side, which she executes by moving her racket in a straight line, also allowing her to disguise the shot well enough from her opponents. In the slice department, she {{has the ability to}} keep the ball low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. Her game suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.|$|E
25|$|In Jewish law, {{marriage}} {{consists of}} two separate acts, called erusin (or kiddushin, meaning sanctification), which is the betrothal ceremony, and nissu'in or chupah, the actual Jewish wedding ceremony. Erusin changes the couple's interpersonal status, while nissu'in brings about the legal consequences of the change of status. In Talmudic times, these two ceremonies usually took place {{up to a year}} apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (nissuin), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Since the Middle Ages, the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.|$|E
25|$|Graf {{also had}} a {{powerful}} backhand drive but {{over the course of}} her career tended to use this less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.|$|E

25|$|Helene's brother Emil, however, offered abuse {{rather than}} affection. Emil sexually abused Helene {{when she was}} around four years old, and {{continued}} to torment her throughout her childhood. In her later life, Helene saw this affair as the 'root cause of her tendency not only secretly to fantasize, but to relay these fantasies as truth.' As the only son in the family, Emil {{was supposed to be}} the heir apparent to the family. Instead, Emil proved to be a gambler, profiteer and poor student, and a disappointment to the family. Throughout her life, Helene tried to make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> brother's shortcomings, but 'felt she never successfully made up for Emil's failure in her mother's eyes,' but did replace him as her father's favorite.|$|E
25|$|The Geek Chorus {{enters and}} informs the {{audience}} that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced {{that they are not}} finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: Carnage, Swarm, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, The Lizard, and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. With all of these villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention to her or anyone else in his life ("Spider-Man Rising"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be alone now that there is another spider to share her darkness ("Turn Off the Dark"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant lateness and disregard for her after he does not show <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> new play ("Walk Away"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.|$|E
25|$|During lulls in the shelling, Hemingway {{repeatedly}} told Walton {{how much}} he hated his mother. Hemingway loathed her because she had accepted money from him, even while she condemned the books he wrote on moral grounds. Hemingway later saved Walton's life during the battle. Hemingway recognized {{the sound of an}} oncoming German plane, and threw Walton out of the jeep they were riding in just moments before it was strafed. The two men parted, but met again on New Year's Eve in London. Walton told Hemingway {{that he was going to}} have dinner with Hemingway's wife, Martha Gellhorn. Hemingway and Gellhorn were on the verge of divorce after several rocky years of marriage. Hemingway invited himself to the dinner. Hemingway ridiculed and taunted his wife all night, and Walton stood <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> In the early hours of the next morning, Hemingway stripped to his underwear, put a bucket on his head, and banged on Gellhorn's door with a mop, demanding to be let in. Walton moved into the Hôtel Ritz in Paris in January 1945, covering the war from the liberated city. Hemingway, now openly dating Mary Welsh even though his divorce was not yet final, was in one of the happiest moods of his life. He bragged openly to Walton about his powerful sex life and happiness.|$|E
