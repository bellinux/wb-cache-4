50|$|India's Credible minimum {{deterrence}} envisages {{a nuclear}} triad of counter-strike capability which required a long range missile to provide robust second strike capability. A missile {{system that can}} be dispersed far and wide in the Indian mainland, its far flung islands or its blue water naval assets dispersed across the world's oceans. Following this necessity India developed a larger Agni-III missile, with a heavier payload and a longer range but in a compact configuration, i.e. thicker but shorter length. This development is driven by need for a more assured retaliation that can defeat emerging anti ballistic missile (ABM) defence and countermeasures. Such capability requires a compact missile that can also carry ABM counter-measure payloads along with weapons, in a configuration similar to a MIRV, albeit with state-of-the-art decoys.

The results are presented in two parts: Part I, a generic <b>user</b> <b>handbook,</b> and Part II, a series of case studies dealing with specific matters in research and design. Part 1 : RESEARCH AND DESIGN, presents various relationships between scientific inquiry and intuitive design in as broad a context as is possible. Six chapters are arranged to illustrate definitions, major players, · incentives, barriers, solutions, and communications methods. Part II: METHODS FOR INTEGRATION, presents situations and tools which assist in the integration of research and design. Six case studies identify the following methods: design competitions, grantsmanship, financial tools, research methods, and business development strategies. Together, Part I and Part II are intended {{to serve as a}} useful tool for researchers and designers to aid in understanding and executing an integration of architectural research and architectural design. This book {{can be used as a}} teaching and learning aid in architectural schools, conferences or symposia, as a useful method for transferring technology from other disciplines, or as a design practitioner's tool in determining economic feasibility for applications of building technology to the built environment. A conclusion drawn from this investigation is that sufficient demand must be created before optimum communication is reached between the research and design communities. This research addresses this fundamental requirement by seeking to motivate researchers and designers with moral, legal, and economic incentives, and cost-effective methods. by Richard E. Ness.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of the master's project which is {{documented}} with the present thesis a mission planning tool (MPT) for SONATE was developed and implemented. After a thorough research on {{the current state of the}} art of MPTs and taking especially the early stage of the SONATE mission into account, it was decided to develop a generic timeline-based MPT. In contrast to existing MPTs a system is envisioned which is both powerful, regarding advanced features like resource control, and applicable for small satellite missions regarding the overall complexity and the associated configuration and training effort. Although it was obvious from an early stage that this vision cannot be reached in {{the scope of}} this project, it was kept during the project definition, object oriented analysis and early design stages in order to allow future extensions. Also the decision to develop the MPT on top of the Eclipse Rich Client Platform is mainly due to the argument of future extensibility. The MPT, which is released with this thesis, hence is a very basic generic timeline-based MPT omitting all possible advanced features like resource control or procedure validation, but featuring all essential parts of a MPT, i. e. modelling of procedures, scheduling of activities, and the generation of telecommand sequences. Furthermore, the user is supported by an intuitive graphical user interface. The thesis documents the development process, thus giving a broad understanding of the design and the implementation. For specific details of the implementation one may also refer to the separate technical documentation, while a <b>user</b> <b>handbook</b> included as appendix. The characteristics of the SONATE mission as a technology demonstrator for highly autonomous systems raise several important questions regarding the overall mission planning process. Therefore, besides the actual development of the MPT, those questions are discussed in a theoretical manner in the scope of this thesis, taking also account of the general emergence of highly autonomous satellites systems. Three concepts, Safe Planning, Sigma Resource Propagation, and Direct Telemetry Feedback, are proposed to face the challenges rising from the foreseen alternation of phases of classical mission operations and phases of autonomous operations of the satellite. Concluding the thesis, the final software product's features and capabilities are verified against the previously defined requirements and thus the overall success of the project is determined to be a 100 % success fulfilling all primary project objectives. Finally, several fields for further research on the topic in general and work on the MPT itself are identified and outlined to pave the way for follow-up projects. SONAT...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{low earth orbit}} (LEO) {{commercial}} communications satellites provides an opportunity to dramatically reduce Telemetry Tracking and Control (TT&C) costs of launch vehicles and Unpiloted Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by reducing or eliminating ground infrastructure. Personnel from the Goddard Space Flight Center Wallops Flight Facility (GSFC/WFF) in Virginia have successfully used commercial GEO & Big LEO communications satellites for Long Duration Balloon flight TT&C. In addition, TDRSS capability for these balloons has been developed by WFF for the Ultra Long Duration Balloons with the first test flight launch in January 2001 for one global circumnavigation at 120, 000 feet altitude launched from Alice Springs. Australia. Numerous other low cost applications can new utilize the commercial LEO satellites for TT&C. The Flight Modern became a GSFC/WFF Advanced Range Technology Initiative (ARTI) {{in an effort to}} streamline TT&C capability to the user community at low cost. Phase I ground tests of The Flight Modem verified downlink communications quality of service and measured transmission latencies. These tests were completed last year, Phase II consisting of aircraft flight tests provide much of the data presented in this paper. Phase III of the Flight Modern baseline test program is a demonstration of the ruggedized version of the WFF Flight Modem flown on one sounding rocket launched from Sweden. Flights of opportunity have been and are being actively pursued with other centers, ranges and users at universities. The WFF goal is to reduce TT&C costs by providing a low cost COTS Flight Modem with a <b>User</b> <b>Handbook</b> containing system capability and limitation descriptions. Additionally, since data transmission is by packetized Internet Protocol (IP), data can be received and commands initialed from practically any location with no infrastructure. The WFF, like most ranges, has been using GPS receivers on sounding rockets and long duration balloons for several years, The WFF Flight Modem contains a GPS receiver to provide vehicle position for tracking and vehicle recovery. The system architecture which integrates antennas, GPS receiver, commercial satellite packet data modem. and a single board computer with custom software is described and a number of technical challenges are discussed along with the plan for their resolution. These include antenna development, high Doppler rates, reliability, environmental ruggedness, hand over between satellites and data security. An aggressive test plan is included which in addition to environmental Testing measures bit error rate latency and antenna patterns. Additional flight tests are planned far the near future on aircraft, long duration balloons and sounding rockets and these results as well as the current status of the project arc reported. Use of the WFF Flight Modem on small satellites is also being pursued. The LEO satellite constellation altitude above 1400 km is not an obstacle because most spacecraft do not require continuous Communications. The challenge is scheduling where store and forward techniques for command are required and downlink when the communications link allows connection (above 60 percent of the time depending on the satellite altitude). Sophisticated scheduling techniques utilizing 2 -line orbital element sets available on the NASA/NORAD Internet site could be implemented for rare special cases. The current 9600 baud rate of the LEO communications link may be increased With special techniques that are planned for development in the WFF Flight Modem project...|$|E

40|$|Introduction In {{the present}} report a {{technique}} to study long-term temporal variations of the X-ray emission from NGC 5548 using ROSAT PSPC data is suggested. The capacity of the ROSAT PSPC instrument is described in The ROSAT <b>Users</b> <b>Handbook.</b> The ROSAT satellite was primarily designed to study the spatial structure of X-ray sources. The temporal structure of the X-ray photon events will {{be influenced by the}} temporal variations of the source, the spacecraft wobble and the photon counting process in the instrument. Since the first and last process are Poisson processes, the resulting series of photon events will be a compound Poisson process modulated by the spacecraft wobble. In addition to that, if the source appears to have the extended Xray emission (Morse, Wilson, Elvis and Weaver, 1995), the temporal variability of the source may be seriously obscured. In the present report, a possible statistical method to study temporal variations is shown. A list of analyzed ROSAT files is show...|$|R

40|$|TOPEX {{sea surface}} height {{data from the}} first 300 days of the mission are {{compared}} to sea level data from 71 tide gauges. The initial comparison uses sea surface height data processed according to standard procedures as defined in the <b>users</b> <b>handbook.</b> It is found that the median correlations for island and for coastal tide gauges are 0. 53 and 0. 42, respectively. The analogous root mean square (RMS) {{differences between the two}} data sets are 7. 9 and 10. 4 cm. The comparisons improve significantly when a 60 -day harmonic is fit to the differences and removed. This period captures aliased M(sub 2) and S(sub 2) tidal energy that is not removed by the tide model. Making this correction and smoothing the sea surface height data over 25 -km along-track segments results in median correlations of 0. 58 and 0. 46 for the islands and coastal stations, and median RMS differences of 5. 8 and 7. 7 cm, respectively. Removing once per revolution signals from the sea surface heights results in degraded comparisons with the sea levels. It is also found that a number of stations have poor comparisons due to propagating signals that introduce temporal lags between the altimeter and tide gauge time series. A final comparison is made by eliminating stations where this propagation effect is large, discarding two stations that are suspected to have problems with the sea level data, smoothing over 10 -day intervals, and restricting attention to islands gauges. This results in a set of 552 data pairs that have a correlation of 0. 66 and a RMS difference of 4. 3 cm. The conclusion is that on timescales longer than about 10 days the RMS sea surface height errors are less than or of the order of several centimeters...|$|R
