The aim of this work is to determine their influence on ovulation. The major <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> isolated from the urine of adult male mice were voided of bound odorants, dissolved at a physiological concentration in urine of prepubertal mice, {{and put on the}} nostril of reproductively cycling female mice housed in groups, the first day of estrus at 1100.

The results showed that 1) a single stimulus of the major <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> increased ovulation nearly as much as the whole urine of male mice, 2) the effect was not elicited by male rat urine which contains different proteins, 3) a peptide with four residues of the amino-terminal sequence of the major <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> stimulated ovulation, and 4) mice that had been isolated or had the vomeronasal organ (VNO) removed did not respond to the major <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> and had a high spontaneous ovulation.

40|$|Aim: Proteinuria {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, but the mechanism for the differential renal damage induced by proteinuria is unknown. This study examined the effects of <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from patients with idiopathic minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on several epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) -related marker proteins in cultured proximal tubular HK- 2 cells. Methods: <b>Urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from MCD and FSGS patients were extracted by ultrafiltration and incubated with HK- 2 cells; the expression of the cytokeratin- 18, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and vimentin were assessed. p 38 and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) activation were measured by western blotting, and SB 203580 (a p 38 inhibitor) and PD 98059 (an ERK 1 / 2 inhibitor) were used to inhibit their activation. Results: It was observed that <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from FSGS patients more significantly induced the expression of alpha-SMA and vimentin and reduced cytokeratin- 18 expression than those from MCD patients in HK- 2 cells. Both ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 were activated by <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from MCD or FSGS patients. Pretreatment of the cells with SB 203580 or PD 98059 abolished the effect of <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from FSGS patients on the expression of alpha-SMA, vimentin and cytokeratin- 18, while only SB 203580 elicited this effect when cells were treated with <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from MCD patients. Conclusion: The <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from MCD and FSGS patients induced significant changes of EMT-related proteins through activation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase-related signalling pathways. Quality of proteinuria may play an important role in determining the severity and progression of tubular injury associated with different kidney diseases...|$|R

SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) electrophoresis {{was used for}} the differentiation of <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> according to their molecular size. In the azathioprine-treated patients with stable renal function, most of the <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> were albumin. However, the low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, which were suggestive of tubular proteins, appeared in the urine of the ciclosporin-treated patients with stable renal function. During the rejection episodes of the ciclosporin-treated patients, the fraction of LMW proteins increased. The elevation of urinary FDP and NAG index (urinary NAG/urinary Cr) were detected in association with rejection episodes. Urinary NAG index increased in proportion to the elevation of serum Cr. However, the elevation of urinary NAG index was found in some ciclosporin-treated patients with normal serum Cr. The elevation of NAG index without the elevation of urinary FDP occurred in ciclosporin nephrotoxicity.

The hypothesis that circulating effectors substances excreted through the kidney can be actively present in human urine was tested with this assay. Thus, biologically active protein molecules in urine were detected at concentrations of less than 1 mg/L and over a wide range of dilutions. Activities were detected and quantitated by culturing human lymphocytes with human <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> in the presence of [35 S]methionine and subsequently analyzing the labeled lymphocyte proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thus, protein analysis by two-dimensional gels was used to indirectly detect changes produced in cultured lymphocytes after exposure to regulatory molecules.

Aged rats were treated with fluids and antibiotics after CLP. <b>Urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from septic rats without ARF and <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> from septic rats with ARF were compared by difference in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE). CLP surgery elevated interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 10 serum cytokines and blood nitrite compared with sham-operated rats. However, there was a range of serum creatinine values at 24 [*]h (0. 4 – 2. 3 [*]mg/dl) and only 24 % developed ARF. Histology confirmed renal injury in these rats. Forty-nine percent of rats did not develop ARF. Rats without ARF also had less liver injury. The mortality rate at 24 [*]h was 27 % but was increased by housing the post-surgery rats in metabolic cages. Creatinine clearance and urine output 2 – 8 [*]h after CLP was significantly reduced in rats which died within 24 [*]h. Using DIGE we identified changes in a number of <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> including albumin, brush-border enzymes (e. g., meprin- 1 -alpha) and serine protease inhibitors.

BackgroundProteomic techniques have recently become available for large-scale protein analysis. The utility {{of these techniques}} in identification of <b>urinary</b> <b>proteins</b> is poorly defined. We constructed a proteome map of normal human urine as a reference protein database by using two differential fractionated techniques to isolate the proteins. MethodsProteins were isolated from urine obtained from normal human volunteers by acetone precipitation or ultracentrifugation, separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry followed by peptide mass fingerprinting. ResultsA total of 67 protein forms of 47 unique proteins were identified, including transporters, adhesion molecules, complement, chaperones, receptors, enzymes, serpins, cell signaling proteins and matrix proteins. Acetone precipitated more acidic and hydrophilic proteins, whereas ultracentrifugation fractionated more basic, hydrophobic, and membrane proteins.
