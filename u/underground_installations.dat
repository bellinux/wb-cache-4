5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of the}} island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused platform is used for Art on the <b>Underground</b> <b>installations,</b> often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E

25|$|On 21 July 1990, ex-Pink Floyd member Roger Waters {{staged a}} {{gigantic}} charity concert {{of his former}} band's rock extravaganza The Wall to commemorate {{the end of the}} division between East and West Germany. The concert took place at Potsdamer Platz– specifically an area of the former no man's land just {{to the north of the}} Reich Chancellery site, and featured many guest superstars. Ironically it was preparations for this concert, rather than historical interest, that brought about the first detailed post-Cold War survey of the area with a view to determining what, if anything, was left of Hitler's bunker and any other <b>underground</b> <b>installations.</b> Although sections of the main Führerbunker were found, partially destroyed or filled in, another bunker complex was found further north that even the East German authorities had apparently missed, plus other cavities beneath land bordering the east side of Ebertstraße, although these turned out to be underground garages belonging to a former SS accommodation block.|$|E

50|$|As the Allied air {{offensive}} against Nazi Germany intensified after 1943, the Nazi leadership decided to construct <b>underground</b> <b>installations</b> {{in order to}} produce weaponry and related war material. Accelerated construction of such facilities required significant outlay of human resources. The SS provided concentration camp prisoners to carry out the most dangerous tasks, such as hollowing out tunnels from mountainsides and caves, constructing subterranean factories, and hauling construction materials. To facilitate these immense projects, it set up hundreds of satellite camps close to proposed industrial sites in 1944 and 1945.|$|E
5000|$|One {{limitation}} of the detector's design is its small size; due to the limited amount of surplus lead available, half of the neutrons generated escape before hitting a neutron detector.

Budget permitting, there are plans for a larger detector using 1000 t of lead and the remaining leftover 3He detectors (Due to lead's high density; 1000 t is a cube 4.45 m on a side, not an impractical size for <b>underground</b> <b>installation.)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on an {{analysis}} of mounting and cable laying fiber optic lines. The first chapter includes an analysis is made comparing parameters fiber and copper cabling, mainly in terms of access networks. This part specifies the various transmission media and access networks that are operated on them. Attention {{is focused on}} the transmission rate and its possible impact, provided the capacity and other important values. This section also demands site maintenance, service, or any failure on the routes of these networks. With this goal in the second chapter was created several designs networks that provide insight into possible solutions to the situation for emerging networks, and for upgrading existing networks, using both management and elements of optical and copper, or combinations thereof. Provide information from expert sources and verified directs the work of the future and to clarify further the eventual development of individual technologies. Most other space and offers the potential of optical technology, nature, and therefore the third chapter is fully devoted to only the transmission medium. At the beginning of this section is a theoretical analysis of possible ways of cable laying fiber optic cabling with a comparison of advantages and disadvantages. The most stable is an <b>underground</b> <b>installation,</b> which is costly in standard cases.

The fort was recaptured by French infantry on November 2, 1916 after an artillery bombardment involving two long-range 400 mm railway guns. After its recapture, Fort Vaux was repaired and garrisoned.
