40|$|Under {{experimental}} conditions, {{we tested}} whether variations in preference curves, weighted <b>usable</b> <b>areas,</b> and electivity profiles for velocity of 0 + juvenile barbel Barbus barbus {{could be attributed}} to environmental variables (discharge, water depth, time of day) and/or time of sampling. We elaborated preference curves and weighted <b>usable</b> <b>areas</b> according to the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology, as well as electivity profiles. Variation among preference curves, weighted <b>usable</b> <b>areas</b> and electivity profiles was always observed, regardless of time of day, water depth, or discharge combinations. Our results support published concerns that the shape of preference curves is highly dependent on the time of data collection, and that curves derived from a single field sampling excursion can be viewed as representative for that moment in time only, whereas curves generated as composites from typological or time-series samples may provide an approximation for a study area, but at the expense of between-site and/or between-date variation. Spatial/temporal variation is an important aspect of fish habitat studies and should be incorporated as a (layered) component into descriptive/predictive models. To this end, we illustrate how a PCA-based technique and log-linear modelling can be used to assess temporal patterns in collections of preference curves and electivity profiles, respectively...|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC banned {{conventional}} battery cages for {{laying hens}} throughout the European Union from January 1, 2012; they were banned previously {{in other countries}} including Switzerland. In response to these bans, development of prototype commercial furnished cage systems began in the 1980s. [...] Furnished cages, sometimes called 'enriched' or 'modified' cages, are cages for egg laying hens which {{have been designed to}} overcome some of the welfare concerns of battery cages whilst retaining their economic and husbandry advantages, and also provide some of the welfare advantages of non-cage systems. Many design features of furnished cages have been incorporated because research in animal welfare science has shown them to be of benefit to the hens. In the UK, the Defra [...] "Code for the Welfare of Laying Hens" [...] states furnished cages should provide at least 750cm2 of cage area per hen, 600cm2 of which should be usable; the height of the cage other than that above the <b>usable</b> <b>area</b> should be at least 20cm at every point and no cage should have a total area that is less than 2000cm2. In addition, furnished cages should provide a nest, litter such that pecking and scratching are possible, appropriate perches allowing at least 15cm per hen, a claw-shortening device, and a feed trough which may be used without restriction providing 12cm per hen.|$|E
