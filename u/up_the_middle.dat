5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff and a touchback, Florida State's offense {{started work}} at its 20-yard line. Tech {{committed}} a five-yard penalty, {{and as the}} final seconds of the quarter ticked off, Florida State ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> for five yards and a first down. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the score was 147, Florida State leading.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the 23-yard line, and Clemson went three and out after Simmons threw three incomplete passes. The Tigers' punt {{was returned}} to the Tech 30-yard line, and the Hokies began another possession. Vick was again replaced by Meyer at the quarterback position, and running back Dwayne Ward ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the field for a short gain. Third-string running back Keith Burnell gained more yardage with a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> then Ward picked up a first down with a run up {{the left side of}} the field. During the play, Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, but the resulting yardage was still enough for a first down. Tech proceeded to run out the remaining seconds on the clock, and the Virginia Tech Hokies earned a 4120 victory.|$|E
5|$|With {{limited time}} remaining, Clemson {{attempted}} an onside kick {{in an effort}} to retain possession and have a chance to make up some of the scoring deficit. The kick was recovered by Virginia Tech, however, and the Vick-led Tech offense returned to the field at the Clemson 44-yard line. Suggs was stopped for no gain on a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> Vick threw an incomplete pass, then he completed a 14-yard pass to Wynn for a first down at the Clemson 30-yard line. After the first down, Ferguson gained a few yards on a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> then Suggs advanced the ball to just short of the first-down marker. On third down, Suggs gained the first down with a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Following the first down, Clemson defender Alex Ardley was called for a personal foul and ejected from the game. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Clemson 10-yard line. From there, Clemson was called for a five-yard offsides penalty. On the first play after the consecutive penalties, Vick pitched the ball to Suggs, who ran into the end zone untouched. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech extended its lead to 4120 with 3:41 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|From their one-yard line, the Hurricanes ran a short rush <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> then Kelly {{connected}} on a 28-yard pass {{to tight}} end Mark Cooper {{for a first}} down. Three short rushes by fullback Speedy Neal resulted in 12 yards and a first down. With time running out in the quarter, Kelly attempted and completed a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Rocky Belk, driving the Hurricanes to the Tech 30-yard line and bringing the quarter to an end. Miami led, 70 {{at the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Kelly gained one yard {{on first}} down, then Dantzler picked up 11 {{yards and a}} first down on a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the field. An {{incomplete}} pass {{was followed by a}} run for no gain and another incomplete pass. Facing fourth and goal at the eight-yard line, Bowden sent in his field-goal kicker. After the Tigers called a time out, Hunt completed a 27-yard field goal attempt and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 2713 with 7:19 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|On the Tar Heels' {{first play}} of the game, running back Jonathan Linton ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> for a three-yard gain. After the gain, Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf {{completed}} a 31-yard pass to tight end Alge Crumpler for a first down at the Virginia Tech 47-yard line. Now inside Virginia Tech territory, Linton ran for a five-yard gain, which {{was followed by a}} pass from Keldorf to Linton, who gained 26 yards on the play. Following the catch, North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field limping slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, which was good. With 9:15 remaining in the quarter, North Carolina took a 30 lead.|$|E

5|$|Tech's Thomas gained six {{yards on}} a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> then Druckenmiller ran ahead for a one-yard gain. On third down, Tech {{committed}} a 10-yard penalty, negating {{what would have}} been a first-down run. A long pass on third down fell incomplete, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the quarter. The Longhorns fair caught the ball at their 30-yard line with 5:25 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} trick play, the Hokies' offense started at their 44-yard line. The first Tech {{play of the}} drive was a 15-yard pass from DeShazo to Still for a first down. A three-yard run by Thomas was {{followed}} by a seven-yard reverse by Still for another first down at the Tennessee 29-yard line. On first down, Thomas pushed the Hokies eight yards forward with a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> This was followed by two incomplete passes, bringing up fourth down. Again, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to convert the fourth down rather than kick a field goal. Unlike Tech's previous fourth down, however, the try was unsuccessful after DeShazo mishandled the snap and was tackled for a loss. Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs, and Tennessee's offense returned to the game with 1:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Florida State {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. The Seminoles returned the kickoff to their 22-yard line, and on the first play {{of the second half}} attempted a lateral pass. Virginia Tech defender Corey Moore knocked the ball down and out of bounds, causing a loss of 16 yards. Despite the loss, Weinke was able to make good the needed yards with a 28-yard pass to Minor. Minor picked up short yardage on a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> then Weinke passed for another first down, advancing the ball to the State 45-yard line. On first down, Weinke fumbled, but managed to recover the ball after a five-yard loss. Unlike before, State was unable to regain the lost yardage and was forced to punt. Virginia Tech returned the kick to their 33-yard line, where the Tech offense began work.|$|E
5|$|Following halftime, Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who returned it to the Tech 41-yard line. On the first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running play <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas was called for a five-yard running into the kicker penalty and Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Humber nearly {{achieved}} a no hitter for the 2011 Chicago White Sox twice. On April 25, 2011, {{in the sixth}} start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium but, with one out, Alex Rodriguez singled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> leaving Humber to finish with seven scoreless innings. Later that year he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In that contest, Jerry Hairston, Jr. broke up the no-hitter leading off the sixth after Roger Bernadina earned a hit by pitch {{to break up the}} perfect game in the fourth.|$|E

5|$|In {{possession}} of the ball and a large lead, Virginia Tech proceeded to start running out the clock by executing running plays, which do not halt the game clock at their conclusion as do incomplete passing plays. Suggs gained nine yards on a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> then Ferguson was tackled for a loss after an incomplete pass by Vick. Tech punted, and the ball was downed at the 26-yard line. Following the punt, Clemson put backup quarterback Willie Simmons into the game. On his first play, Simmons was sacked by Jim Davis for a five-yard loss. The second play was {{a repeat of the}} first, as Davis again sacked Simmons, this time for an 11-yard loss. On third down, Simmons threw an incomplete pass, and Clemson punted after going three and out.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Air Force {{play of the}} second half, quarterback Chance Harridge ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the field for a 21-yard gain. The Falcons {{followed}} that first-down play {{with a series of}} rushes that resulted in another first down, this time in Virginia Tech territory. But as the Hokies had done before them, the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory. Instead of punting the ball, however, Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed twoyards on fourth down. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Tech's offense returned to the field with 7:40 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Texas fair {{caught the}} punt at their 14-yard line. On {{the first play}} after the kick, a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> was stopped {{for the loss of}} a yard. Williams then gained two yards, and Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Texas went three-and-out {{for the first time in}} the second quarter and prepared to punt. Bryan Still fielded the kick at the Tech 40-yard line and returned it 60 yards to the end zone for Virginia Tech's first points of the game. The subsequent extra point was good, and with 2:34 remaining in the first half, Tech cut Texas' lead to 107.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech downed Texas' {{subsequent}} kickoff in its {{end zone}} for a touchback, and the Hokies attempted {{to answer the}} Texas score starting at the Tech 20-yard line. During the first play after the kickoff, Texas and Tech both committed penalties. After the penalties, Tech had a first down at its 27-yard line. After the penalties, running back Ken Oxendine attempted to run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the field, but had the ball knocked loose by defender Tony Brackens. Texas recovered the fumble and the Longhorns' offense returned to the field at the Tech 32-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Texas {{to begin the}} game, and the Longhorns {{returned}} the kick to the 35-yard line. On the first play of the game, Brown attempted to pass downfield, but Tech defended the Texas receivers and Brown scrambled for a four-yard loss. Texas regained the yardage after Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then Longhorns running back Ricky Williams gained six yards on a run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> A third-down pass fell incomplete, and the Longhorns went three and out on the first possession of the game. Texas punted, and the Hokies returned the kick to their 26-yard line.|$|E
5|$|With 2:19 to {{play and}} nursing a one-point lead, Texas was in {{position}} to win if they could run out the clock. They began with a 12-yard rush {{on the left side}} by Jamaal Charles for a first down. Charles then carried again <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> for a two-yard gain to the Ohio State 7. OSU called a time-out to stop the clock at 1:36. On second-and-goal, Vince Young kept the ball and gained threeyards before being tackled by A. J. Hawk. The Buckeyes again called time-out with 1:23 left. Young carried again for threeyards before being brought down by B. Carpenter and A. J. Hawk just one yard short of the goal-line. This time, Texas took a time-out with 29seconds left to play. Following the time-out, Young handed off to Henry Melton who was stopped for no gain. Ohio State took over on downs.|$|E
