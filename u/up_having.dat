5|$|The {{depositions}} that Hutchinson {{collected and}} sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston.

5|$|While {{the game}} neared completion, the funding began to dry <b>up.</b> <b>Having</b> {{spent more than}} $20million of their own money, Broussard and Miller asked Take-Two for $6million to {{complete}} the game. According to Broussard and Miller, Take-Two initially agreed, but then only offered $2.5million. Take-Two maintained that they offered $2.5million up front and another $2.5million on completion.

However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E

5|$|In {{animated}} {{versions of}} Naruto, Sakura was voiced by Chie Nakamura. Early {{in the first}} series, the actors were told by Kishimoto that Sakura would end marrying Sasuke. However, most of them ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> doubts as during the first anime Sasuke abandoned his teammates. As a result, by the second series, Nakamura was often asked by other people if her character would instead end with Naruto. When Sakura married Sasuke in the end, Nakamura was happy because Sakura stayed true to her feelings. In an interview, Kate Higgins, who does the voice acting for Sakura in the English dub, notes the development of Sakura in the series, remarking that she becomes a more complex character as she becomes more sensitive and caring.|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end <b>up</b> <b>having</b> an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} announced {{that there would}} be a simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows as well as concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended <b>up</b> <b>having,</b> and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested. Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was made despite that no political parties in Oslo supported constructing a ski flying hill and that neither the municipality nor the state were willing to issue grants. There were also concerns from environmental groups as Rødkleiva lies within a protected area. Two days after the convention decision, Vikersundbakken applied to host a World Cup event in 2007. At a public meeting in August, politicians from all parties confirmed {{that they would not}} support Rødkleiva and City Council Chair Erling Lae declared the meeting as a funeral for the project.

5|$|The writing team {{included}} Nakazawa, {{who wrote}} You's route and the Kid's common route; Nakazawa's assistant Kitaro Sasanari, who wrote Tsugumi and Sora's routes; Nobuaki Umeda; and Uchikoshi, who wrote Coco's route. The writing process for all routes were supervised by Uchikoshi, {{in an effort}} to eliminate inconsistencies in the setting or characters, and plot holes between the different parts of the story. Because he was running out of time at the end, he had to rush the writing of the end of Coco's route, which he described as possibly his only regret with the game. Nakazawa wrote his parts in between his directorial work, such as writing specification documents, supervising the production, and doing quality control work; {{due to the lack of}} time, he ended <b>up</b> <b>having</b> to stay overnight at KID everyday and work through the night, something he said was only possible because of how young he was at the time. Nakazawa described himself as working particularly hard on the game because he felt bitter that Never 7 had not sold particularly well.|$|E
