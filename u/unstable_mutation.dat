40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that we owe {{the discovery of}} mobile genetic elements to American scientist Barbara McClintock. However, others before her did indeed encounter transposons, but {{without being able to}} recognize them. The early work of maize geneticist Emerson (Emerson, 1917) put him ahead of his peers because he managed to understand what others failed to; how an <b>unstable</b> <b>mutation</b> responsible for stripes of dark red pigmentation on the kernels of corn behaves within the Mendelian paradigm. He realized that a certain inhibiting factor was affecting the pigmentation gene, but could not exactly describe what this factor could be. This was followed up by Marcus Rhoades (Rhoades, 1945) who found out that a stable null mutation on the A locus of maize could be converted to an unstable one if combined with a locus he named Dotted. It was this type of <b>unstable</b> <b>mutation</b> that Barbara McClintock managed to explain by predicting the existence of jumping genes or mobile genetic elements. While studying chromosome breakage in corn, she noticed the repeated loss of a fragment of chromosome 9, and termed this breakage site the Dissociation (Ds) locus. She further observed that another locus was essential for chromosome breakage activation, the Activator (Ac) locus, and that chromosome breakage was linked to frequency and timing of mutations leading to variegation of maize kernels. Her genetic experiments led to the realization that Ds was indeed moving to a new location on chromosome 9 and she named such an element “Controlling element”. Her “Controlling elements” were transposon insertions disrupting certain genes, causing the type of <b>unstable</b> <b>mutation</b> that Emerson and Rhoades were trying to explain. Konstantinos Repanas was born in KOZANH, Greece, on the 30 th of January 1977. He finished the Lyceum in KOZANH and since he was not good enough for the Greek Universities he went to England to study Dentistry at the University of Manchester. He changed his mind and instead he studied Biological Sciences at the Manchester Metropolitan University, graduating in 2000. He then went to York University for one year to do a Master of Research (MRes) in Biomolecular Science and started a PhD in the lab of Dr. Anastassis Perrakis in 2001 at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.

40|$|OBJECTIVEdThe m. 3243 A. Gmutation in {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) {{is responsible}} for maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD). Other mtDNAmutations are extremely rare. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODSdWe studied a patient presenting with diabetes and deafness who does not carry the m. 3243 A. G mutation. RESULTSdWe identified a deficiency of respiratory chain complex I in the patient’s fibro-blasts. mtDNA sequencing revealed a novel mutation that corresponds to an insertion {{of one or two}} cytosine residues in the coding region of the MT-ND 6 gene (m. 14535 _ 14536 insC or CC), leading to premature stop codons. This heteroplasmic mutation is unstable in the patient’s somatic tissues. CONCLUSIONSdWe describe for the first time an <b>unstable</b> <b>mutation</b> in a mitochondrial gene coding for a complex I subunit, which {{is responsible for}} the MIDD phenotype. This mu-tation is likely favored by the m. 14530 T. C polymorphism, which is homoplasmic and leads to the formation of an 8 -bp polyC tract responsible for genetic instability. Diabetes Care 34 : 2591 – 2593, 2011 The most common form of maternallyinherited diabetes and deafness(MIDD) is associated with the m. 3243 A. G mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is located in the tRNALeu gene (1). The mutation that af-fects up to 1 % of diabetic patients leads to both impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion (2) and progressive b-cell loss (3). However, in some rare cases charac-terized by a highly suggestive phenotype but without m. 3243 A. G mutation, ge-neticists should look for other diabetes-prone variants (4).

FMR 1 CGG repeat alleles are categorized accordingto number as normal, intermediate, premutation, and full mutation alleles. Considerable information is available, fromreported studies, {{on the structure of}} the full mutation alleles. METHODS: This review focused on the characterization of FMR 1 CGG repeat size alleles in the premutation andintermediate ranges. RESULTS: The premutation and intermediate carriers, previously thought to be clinically unaffected, are recentlyknown to be at increased risk of premature ovarian failure (POF), fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome(FXTAS), autism, emotional problems, late-onset neurodegenerative deficits, and neurocognitive deficits. A number ofstudies have suggested that the underlying cause might be RNA toxicity resulting from abnormally high levels of FMR 1 mRNA in these alleles.

Renewed interest in anticipation was evoked by molecular genetic findings of a novel type of mutation termed "unstable DNA. " The unstable DNA model can be construed as the "best fit" for schizophrenia twin and family epidemiological data. We have performed a large-scale Southern blot hybridization, asymmetrical PCR-based, and repeat expansion-detection screening for (CAG) n/(CTG) n and (CCG) n/(CGG) n expansions in eastern Canadian schizophrenia multiplex families demonstrating genetic anticipation. There were no differences in (CAG) n/(CTG) n and (CCG) n/(CGG) n pattern distribution either between affected and unaffected individuals or across generations. Our findings {{do not support the}} hypothesis that large (CAG) n/(CTG) n or (CCG) n/(CGG) n expansions are the major etiologic factor in schizophrenia.

Excision of Ds 1 is known to generate new alleles with small additions and rearrangements of Adh 1 DNA. We characterized 16 revertant alleles with respect to ADH 1 activity levels in scutellum (nutritive tissue of the seed), anaerobic root, and pollen. Whereas gene expression was not different from the wild type in the sporophytic tissues of the scutellum and anaerobic root, there were strong allelic differences in pollen. One allele underexpressed pollen ADH 1 at 48 % of the wild-type level, and another overexpressed pollen ADH 1 at 163 % of the wild-type level. Quantitative RNase protection assays demonstrated that the mutant phenotypes reflected changes in the levels of steady state mRNA in pollen.

40|$|The {{defective}} chloroplasts and leaves-mutable (dcl-m) mutation {{of tomato}} was identified in a Ds mutagenesis screen. This <b>unstable</b> <b>mutation</b> affects both chloroplast development and palisade cell morphogenesis in leaves. Mutant plants are clonally variegated {{as a result}} of somatic excision of Ds and have albino leaves with green sectors. Leaf midribs and stems are light green with sectors of dark green tissue but fruit and petals are wild-type in appearance. Within dark green sectors of dcl-m leaves, palisade cells are normal, whereas in albino areas of dcl-m leaves, palisade cells do not expand to become their characteristic columnar shape. The development of chloroplasts from proplastids in albino areas is apparently blocked at an early stage. DCL was cloned using Ds as a tag and encodes a novel protein of - 25 kDa, containing a chloroplast transit peptide and an acidic a-helical region. DCL protein was imported into chloroplasts in vitro and processed to a mature form. Because of the ubiquitous expression of DCL and the proplastid-like appearance of dclaffected plastids, the DCL protein may regulate a basic and universal function of the plastid. The novel dcl-m phenotype suggests that chloroplast development is required for correct palisade cell morphogenesis during leaf development...|$|E

40|$|The <b>unstable</b> <b>mutation</b> bz-m 039 {{arose in}} a maize (Zea mays) stock that {{originated}} from a plant infected with barley stripe mosaic virus. The instability of the mutation {{is caused by}} a 3. 9 -kb mobile element that has been named Jittery (Jit). Jit has terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of 181 bp, causes a 9 -bp direct duplication of the target site, and appears to excise autonomously. It is predicted to encode a single 709 –amino acid protein, JITA, which is distantly related to the MURA transposase protein of the Mutator system but is more closely related to the MURA protein of Mutator-like elements (MULEs) from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). Like MULEs, Jit resembles Mutator in the length of the element’s TIRs, the size of the target site duplication, and in the makeup of its transposase but differs from the autonomous element Mutator–Don Robertson in that it encodes a single protein. Jit also differs from Mutator elements in the high frequency with which it excises to produce germinal revertants and in its copy number in the maize genome: Jit-like TIRs are present at low copy number in all maize lines and teosinte accessions examined, and JITA sequences occur in only a few maize inbreds. However, Jit cannot be considered a bona fide transposon in its present host line because it does not leave footprints upon excision and does not reinsert in the genome. These unusual mobile element properties are discussed in light of the structure and gene organization of Jit and related elements...|$|E

To investigate the high-speed scraping behavior between a vulcanized silicone rubber and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade and evaluate the abradable performance of seal rubber, abrasion tests were conducted at a blade tip velocity of 50 – 300  m/s with an incursion rate of 100  μm/s. The influences of the blade tip velocity on the wear mechanism and interaction forces were specially analyzed. It is shown that abrasive wear and pattern wear are the predominant wear mechanisms, and pattern wear {{can be seen as}} the emergence and propagation of cracks. With an increase of the blade tip velocity, both of the final incursion depth and wear mass loss of seal rubber exhibit growth trends. The gradual changes of rubbing forces with an increase of rubbing time are the characteristic of abrasive wear, and force curves with <b>unstable</b> <b>mutations</b> are a reflection of pattern wear. At a constant incursion rate of 100  μm/s, the maximum values of interaction forces decrease first and then grow with an increase of the blade tip velocity, and the blade tip velocity of 150  m/s becomes the cut-off point between abrasive wear and pattern wear...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between schizophrenia and chronic delusional syndromes (including the French concept of “psychose hallucinatoire chronique” [PHC] or chronic psychotic hallucinations, paraphrenia, and late paraphrenia) is currently used in various European countries, {{although there are}} no international criteria for chronic and bizarre delusions. The French concept of PHC is characterized by late-onset psychosis, predominantly in females, with rich and frequent hallucinations, but almost no dissociative features or negative symptoms. PHC and late-onset schizophrenia may have risk factors in common, which may help differentiate these disorders from young-onset schizophrenia, especially with regard to the potential role of (i) the estradiol hypothesis; (ii) the impact of sensory deficit; (Hi) putative specific brain abnormalities; or (iv) specific genetic mutations. In accordance with this hypothesis, and taking into account the familial aggregation analyses of PHC, here we evaluate the possibility that PHC represents a less severe form of schizophrenia, which would partly explain the “Sherman paradox” also observed in schizophrenia. The Sherman paradox describes the fact that multiplex families frequently have only one affected ascendant, meaning that an isolated sporadic case is at the origin of a highly loaded family. We thus propose that if <b>unstable</b> <b>mutations</b> are involved in the risk for schizophrenia, then PHC might represent a moderate disorder belonging to the schizophrenia spectrum phenotype...|$|R

We isolated and analyzed genetically 97 independent colored derivatives ("G 2 " series). All but one are pseudorevertants. By the criteria of phenotype and gene conversion pattern with wild type and with G 1, the pseudorevertants represent at least 13 distinct classes. Two of them are large silent deletion mutations.

Homozygous mutant plants produce green, yellow, or green/yellow variegated leaves. Chloroplasts from mutant plants exhibit qualitatively similar profiles for pigment and individual photosynthetic complexes; however, there is a reduction in total chlorophyll {{and the absence of}} several thylakoid membrane proteins. The oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII) includes one polypeptide (OEC 16) which was determined by Western blots to be absent in mutant chloroplasts, whereas, OEC 33 and OEC 23, two other components of the oxygen-evolving complex, are present. The mRNAs for all three products can be detected in equivalent amounts by Northern blots of RNA from both green and yellow tissues. The OEC 16 mRNA derived from yellow leaf tissue is translatable in vitro; however, at reduced efficiency compared to mRNA isolated from green leaf tissue. Northern analysis of specific chloroplast-encoded (rbcL and 16 S rRNA) and nuclear-encoded genes (rbcS and cab) revealed reduced levels of expression in mutant tissues. ^ An <b>unstable</b> <b>mutation</b> in the soybean variety 2 ̆ 7 Williams 2 ̆ 7 was generated by exposure of seeds to gamma (γ) radiation (25 kR; 60 Co). The mutant (E 25 - 10) plants carry abnormal chloroplasts in the yellow leaf sectors as determined by light and electron microscopy. Genetic studies indicate that a single nuclear-encoded gene is responsible for the mutation. In the defective chloroplasts, both the stroma and grana lamella systems are disrupted. LDS-PAGE analysis revealed 5 - 6 polypeptides with estimated molecular weights of 51, 44, 25, 15, 13, and 12 kD that are consistently absent in thylakoid membrane preparations from yellow tissue. Total chlorophyll content is significantly reduced in the mutant plants; however, there is no change in the chlorophyll a/b ratio.

40|$|Human {{parainfluenza virus}} type 3 (HPIV 3), {{a member of}} the family Paramyxoviridae, is an enveloped, negative-sense single {{stranded}} RNA virus, and an important cause of upper and lower respiratory tract disease in children. Infection by HPIV 3 requires fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell. Fusion occurs via the cooperative actions of the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. HN, the receptor-binding protein, binds sialic acid and undergoes a series of conformational changes that are believed to trigger characteristic conformational changes in the F protein that are necessary for membrane fusion. The specific objectives of this dissertation are to elucidate, in greater detail, features of HN-F interaction and F refolding during the entry process. Mutations were introduced at position I 474 of the F protein, in heptad repeat 2 (HR 2), a carboxy-proximal sequence that forms a highly stable structure with the amino-proximal heptad repeat 1 (HR 1), known as the 6 -helix bundle (6 -HB). Formation of the 6 -HB is believed to release energy required for fusion of virion and host cell membranes. Mutation of I 474 to small, polar residues produced F proteins that are uncleaved and non-fusogenic; 6 -HB formed by peptides based these mutants were thermodynamically <b>unstable.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of I 474 to larger polar or nonpolar side chains, or to smaller polar side chains, resulted in F proteins that were cleaved and fusogenic to wild-type levels, although 6 -HB stability was variable. The ability of HR 2 peptides to inhibit virus infection and glycoprotein-driven fusion mirrored 6 -HB stability. Tagging of HN with FLAG and hexahistidine tags permitted Ni-affinity purification of HN. Cotransfection of HN and F, including F I 474 D, S, and E mutants, showed that stable HN-F complexes could be isolated when cell membranes were solubilized with octyl glucoside. A distinct downregulation of HN expression was observed when HN and F were coexpressed in cells, likely as a co-translational or very early post-translational step. A series of three-part chimeric F sequences consisting of fragments of HPIV 3 and bovine PIV 3 F coding regions were constructed. When expressed in the presence of the HPIV 3 HN protein, the chimeric F proteins showed no differences in level of expression or fusogenicity. Also, there were no differences in the stability of homologous and heterologous HR 1 /HR 2 complexes, and inhibition of HPIV 3 infection by HR 2 peptides of the HPIV 3 and BPIV 3 F proteins was similar. HPIV 3 resistant to inhibition by HR 2 was produced by sequential passage of virus in increasing concentrations of a GST-HR 2 fusion protein. Statistically significant resistance of populations as well as plaque-purified clones was demonstrated, although sequencing of resistant clones did not reveal mutations that could be clearly associated with resistance. A model for HN and F in the fusion process is presented, based on data produced in this dissertation and on previously published evidence...|$|E
40|$|By {{balancing}} the average energy gap with its typical change due to mutations for protein-like heteropolymers with M residues, {{we show that}} native states are <b>unstable</b> to <b>mutations</b> on a scale M* ~ (lambda/sigma_mu) ^(1 /zeta_s), where lambda is the dispersion in the interaction free energies and sigma_mu their typical change. Theoretical bounds and numerical estimates (based on complete enumeration on four lattices) of the instability exponent zeta_s are given. Our analysis suggests that a limiting size of single-domain proteins should exist, and leads to the prediction that small proteins are insensitive to random mutations.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{observed}} anticipation (earlier age at onset [AAO] in successive generations) in familial schizophrenia. However, whether true anticipation or ascertainment bias {{is the principal}} originating mechanism remains unclear. In 1944 L. S. Penrose collected AAO data on a large, representative sample of familial mental illness, using a broad ascertainment strategy. These data allowed examination of anticipation and ascertainment biases in five two-generation samples of affected relative pairs. The median intergenerational difference (MID) in AAO {{was used to assess}} anticipation. Results showed significant anticipation in parent-offspring pairs with schizophrenia (n = 137 pairs; MID 15 years; P =. 0001) and in a positive control sample with Huntington disease (n = 11; P =. 01). Broadening the diagnosis of the schizophrenia sample suggested anticipation of severity of illness. However, other analyses provided evidence for ascertainment bias, especially in later-AAO parents, in parent-offspring pairs. Aunt/uncle-niece/nephew schizophrenia pairs showed anticipation (n = 111; P =. 0001), but the MID was 8 years and aunts/uncles had earlier median AAO than parents. Anticipation effects were greatest in pairs with late-AAO parents but remained significant in a subgroup of schizophrenia pairs with early parental AAO (n = 31; P =. 03). A small control sample of other diseases had MID of 5 years but no significant anticipation (n = 9; P =. 38). These results suggest that, although ascertainment-bias effects were observed in parent-offspring pairs, true anticipation appears to be inherent in the transmission of familial schizophrenia. The findings support investigations of <b>unstable</b> <b>mutations</b> and other mechanisms that may contribute to true anticipation in schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Most human cancers contain {{mutations}} in the transcription factor p 53 and {{majority of these}} are missense and located in the DNA binding core domain. In this study, the stabilities of all core domain missense mutations are predicted and are used to infer their likely inactivation mechanisms. Overall, 47. 0 % non-PRO/GLY mutants are stable (ΔΔG 3. 0 kT), 12. 2 % mutants are with 1. 0 kT < ΔΔG < 3. 0 kT. Only 4. 5 % mutants are with no conclusive predictions. Certain types of either stable or <b>unstable</b> <b>mutations</b> are found not to depend on their local structures. Y, I, C, V, F and W (W, R and F) {{are the most common}} residues before (after) <b>mutation</b> in <b>unstable</b> mutants. Q, N, K, D, A, S and T (I, T, L and V) are the most common residues before (after) mutation in stable mutants. The stability correlations with sequence, structure, and molecular contacts are also analyzed. No direct correlation between secondary structure and stability is apparent, but a strong correlation between solvent exposure and stability is noticeable. Our correlation analysis shows that loss of protein-protein contacts may be an alternative cause for p 53 inactivation. Correlation with clinical data shows that loss of stability and loss of DNA contacts are the two main inactivation mechanisms. Finally, correlation with functional data shows that most mutations which retain functions are stable, and most mutations that gain functions are unstable, indicating destabilized and deformed p 53 proteins are more likely to find new binding partners...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} aspects of the new urban and territorial figures of the present day and of their interpretation according to an ecological approach, especially for the transformative potential subtending it, is a central theme for territorial regeneration: the one of open space. These are areas, often particularly malleable and transformable - in their physical structure, in the functions that can accommodate, in the sense that assume within the urban organism, in the relationships with other objects -, which show values evident or latent, and that in perspective allow for the creation of new common landscapes, also referred to as sites of sociality and inclusion, of continuity between networks and spaces, of balance between functions and urban polarity For the transformation of open spaces in urban river areas, in order to their protection, enhancement and regeneration it is therefore necessary to think and act with a process-oriented approach that must support and enhance the procedural character of river space, city and landscape. Open spaces that become part of a landscape in motion, modifying over time their own character and shape, offering them to uses between them also very differently. They are therefore the city and the landscape that require a procedural attitude of the project that supports the evolutionary dynamics of nature and has the ability to interact in dialogue with non-linear and ever-different dynamics. The Process-oriented approach focuses on processes, systems and procedures rather than on results or on fundamental causes, researches an equilibrium with nature and its dynamism, draws new geographies, enhances discontinuous transformations, proposes fluctuating and <b>unstable</b> <b>mutations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The protein encoded by open {{reading frame}} 50 (ORF 50) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) functions as a transcriptional activator and in lytic viral DNA replication to mediate the switch from latent viral infection to the lytic phase. Here we identify regulatory regions of ORF 50 protein that independently control DNA binding and abundance of the protein. One region contains a DNA-binding inhibitory sequence (DBIS) located between amino acids (aa) 490 and 535 of ORF 50. A cluster of basic amino acids in this sequence is important in inhibiting DNA binding. The DBIS can function at the N or C terminus or internally in the ORF 50 protein. Since the DBIS is functional in ORF 50 protein purified from Escherichia coli, {{it is likely to}} work through an intramolecular mechanism. The second regulatory region, a protein abundance regulatory signal (PARS), consists of two components. Component I of the PARS overlaps the DBIS but can be differentiated from the DBIS by specific substitution of basic amino acid residues. Component II of PARS is located between aa 590 and 650. Mutation or deletion of either component results in abundant expression of ORF 50 protein. When the two-component PARS was fused to a heterologous protein, Glutathione S-transferase, the fusion protein was <b>unstable.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in the DBIS or PARS impair the capacity of ORF 50 to activate direct and indirect target viral promoters. Since these overlapping regulatory motifs are located in the C-terminal transactivation domain, {{they are likely to be}} important in controlling many actions of ORF 50 protein...|$|R
40|$|Mutants of E. coli K 12 that overproduce {{ornithine}} transcarbamylase can {{be identified}} in Car- strains because they permit utilization of citrulline as a carbamyl phosphate source, due to reversal of the normal OTCase reaction; they are called Cut mutants (citrulline utilizers). Hfr strains that carry the F factor adjacent to argF (one of two duplicate genes that code for ornithine transcarbamylase in E. coli K 12) yield more Cut mutants than do F+ or F- strains, or Hfr strains in which the F factor is not adjacent to argF. When Hfr strains in which the F factor is integrated adjacent to argF are made recA, they yield few Cut mutants. Many of the Cut mutants recovered {{from one of the}} Hfr strains used in the investigation (Hfr P 4 X) are unstable; the properties of these <b>unstable</b> <b>mutations</b> suggest that they carry aberrations in the region of the argF gene. Thus, the increased yields of Cut mutants probably result from aberrations that occur when the F factor is integrated adjacent to argF. The nature of these aberrations is not yet known. The unstable Cut mutants are to a large extent stabilized by recA; such stabilization is one of the properties of duplications. Other data indicate that the aberrations may be more complex than simple gene duplications; in particular properties of segregants and some recombinants derived from unstable Cut mutants are most easily interpreted by assuming that segregation from, and possibly formation of, the unstable mutants occurs in several stages...|$|R
40|$|We have {{introduced}} the maize Ac transposable ele-ment in Arabidopsis thaliana {{and found that}} after three selling generations, the element is immobile and extensively methylated. Moreover, the nopaline synthase (nos) gene present on the same transferred T-DNA, was active early after transformation and regeneration, but inactive {{in most of the}} SI progeny. We used 5 -azacytidine (5 AzaC) to deter-mine whether a reduction in the methylation would affect both Ac transposition and expression of the nos gene. After treatment with 5 AzaC doses from 0. 3 mM to 1. 0 mM, approximately 25 % of the plants produced detectable amounts of nopaline, indicating that the nos gene was reac-tivated. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the empty donor site left by Ac transposition, we demonstrated that 5 AzaC also activates Ac excision in the transgenic plants. Approximately 13 % of the 5 AzaC treat-ed plants (doses from 0. 1 mM to 1. 0 mM) were shown to have empty donor sites due to Ac excision. None of the plants cultivated in the absence of 5 AzaC showed evidence for Ac transposition or reactivation of the nos gene. Fur-ther analysis using Southern blot indicate that some de-methylation ocurred in the genome of individual plants. These results may represent demethylation in few cells dur-ing development which may be sufficient to reactivate in these cells the expression of the nos and Ac transposase transgenes, the latter promoting Ac transposition in somat-ic cells. Key words: Ac transposable element — Arabidopsis — 5 Azacytidine — Nopaline synthase gene — Transgene reacti-vation.

40|$|AbstractVenezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} virus (VEEV) is an arbovirus that causes periodic outbreaks that impact equine and human {{populations in the}} Americas. One of the VEEV subtypes located in Mexico and Central America (IE) has recently been recognized as an important cause of equine disease and death, and human exposure {{also appears to be}} widespread.

This IRES-based vaccine was unable to establish productive infection in mosquito cell cultures or in intrathoracically injected Aedes taeniorhynchus, demonstrating that it cannot be transmitted from a vaccinee.
