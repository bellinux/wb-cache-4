5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} for Zoroastrianism {{was the creation}} of the Avestan alphabet by the Sassanids, which enabled the accurate rendering of the Avesta in written form (including in its original language/phonology) for the first time. The alphabet was based on the Pahlavi one, but rather than the inadequacy of that script for recording spoken Middle Persian, the Avestan alphabet had 46 letters, and was well suited to recording Avestan in written form in the way the language actually sounded and was <b>uttered.</b> <b>The</b> Persian magi where therefore finally able to record all surviving ancient Avestan texts in written form.|$|E
25|$|Under Pope Callistus III, in 1455, he was {{appointed}} an arbiter on the questions at issue between the Conventuals and Observants. His decision was published 2 February 1456 in a papal bull, which pleased neither part. A few years later, on Easter Monday 1462, James, preaching at Brescia, <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> opinion of some theologians that the Precious Blood shed during the Passion was not united with the Divinity of Christ during the three days of his burial. The Dominican friar, James of Brescia, the local inquisitor, immediately summoned him to his tribunal. James refused to appear, and after some troubles appealed to the Holy See. The question was discussed at Rome during Christmas 1462 (not 1463, as some have it), before Pope Pius II and the cardinals, but no decision was ever given. James spent {{the last three years}} of his life in Naples, and died there on 28 November 1476.|$|E

25|$|The King {{knew that}} he had to take Paris if he stood any chance of ruling all of France. This, however, was no easy task. The Catholic League's presses and {{supporters}} continued to spread stories about atrocities committed against Catholic priests and the laity in Protestant England (see Forty Martyrs of England and Wales). The city prepared to fight to the death rather than accept a Calvinist king. The Battle of Ivry, fought on March 14, 1590, was another victory for the king, and Henry's forces went on to lay siege to Paris, but the siege was broken by Spanish support. Realising that his predecessor had been right {{and that there was no}} prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in Catholic Paris, Henry reputedly <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> famous phrase Paris vaut bien une messe (Paris is well worth a mass). He was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1593 and was crowned at Chartres in 1594.|$|E

500|$|On June 19, 1879, Sherman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the graduating class of the Michigan Military Academy, in which he may have <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> famous phrase [...] "War Is Hell". [...] On April 11, 1880, he addressed a crowd of more than 10,000 at Columbus, Ohio: [...] "There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell." [...] In 1945, President Harry S. Truman would say: [...] "Sherman was wrong. [...] I'm telling you I find peace is hell." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhythm {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} component of [...] "Old Dan Tucker". It begins with a cadenced introduction and little melody. Even when the tune begins in earnest, it is flat and non-harmonized and does little more than provide a beat on which words are <b>uttered.</b> <b>The</b> refrain is syncopated in a way that had only previously been used in the minstrel song [...] "Old Zip Coon". The intense rhythm on the line [...] "Get out the way!" [...] generates a forward momentum and is answered by instruments in one example of the song's black-influenced call and response.|$|E
500|$|Loder {{performed}} six songs live {{as part of}} {{an interview}} on CBC Radio in April 2013. She had written five of these songs, and four of them had not been previously released. The unreleased songs were [...] "Playground", [...] "Nursing a Broken Heart", [...] "Like a Flower", and [...] "One Girl", and the fourth song was [...] "On This Drive", which had appeared on Imperfections & Directions. The fifth song was a cover version of Johnny Cash's [...] "Folsom Prison Blues". She was inspired to write the song [...] "Nursing a Broken Heart" [...] after watching George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight on which Hugh Jackman <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> phrase [...] "nursing a broken heart" [...] {{as part of an}} interview. She wrote [...] "Like a Flower" [...] after a friend challenged her to write a song directed at herself as a child.|$|E

The choir is brought back towards the end, followed by an orchestral passage consisting of the main theme, accompanied by sounds of gong and timpani. Madonna sings the final verses, uttering the lines [...] "share my glory, so share my coffin". Author J. Randy Taraborrelli complemented Madonna's singing in the book, , describing her vocals as [...] "supple and strong". This view was shared by author Lucy O'Brien in [...] who said that [...] "the sweetness {{and the power of}} Madonna's voice comes out as never before on these tracks". It also received positive review from Paul Verna of Billboard, who listed the [...] "flamenco flavored" [...] song as a highlight from the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2007, Lady Gaga's {{management}} company introduced her to songwriter and producer RedOne, whom they also managed. By 2008, Gaga relocated to Los Angeles {{in order to work}} extensively with her record label to complete her debut album, The Fame, and set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga. [...] "LoveGame" [...] was one of the songs written by Gaga and RedOne who also produced the track. With Rolling Stone, Gaga explained that she was at a nightclub and had a [...] "sexual crush" [...] on somebody. She went up to the person and <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> line, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". Thinking it to be a thoughtful metaphor for penis, Gaga went to the recording studio the next day and wrote the song in roughly four minutes. Gaga also had ideas for the live performance of the song where she used [...] "an actual stick—it looks like a giant rock-candy pleasuring tool—that lights up".|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} {{the origin of}} the title [...] "Rhythm Nation", Jackson stated she first <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> phrase during a conversation with her producers. [...] "I thought {{it would be great if}} we could create our own nation" [...] adding that it would be [...] "one that would have a positive message and that everyone would be free to join." [...] She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity. The usage of the number [...] "1814" [...] represents the year the national anthem [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] was written. Rolling Stone emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album's opening pledge (the first track of the recording), which states: [...] "We are a nation with no geographic boundaries, bound together through our beliefs. We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rid of color-lines." [...] Several critics noted that [...] "R" [...] (Rhythm) and [...] "N" [...] (Nation) are the eighteenth and fourteenth letters of the alphabet, though Jackson said this was coincidental.|$|E

500|$|The 12th-century chronicler William of Malmesbury records a story, {{in which}} shortly after Urse was {{appointed}} sheriff, he encroached on the cemetery {{of the cathedral}} chapter of Worcester Cathedral. Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, pronounced a rhyming curse on Urse, declaring [...] "Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse." [...] Ealdred had been Bishop of Worcester before becoming archbishop, and still retained {{an interest in the}} diocese. Gerald of Wales, a late 12th- and early 13th-century writer, wrote that Wulfstan <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> curse after Urse had attempted to have Wulfstan deposed as bishop. Gerald goes on to relate that Wulfstan stated he would only relinquish his episcopal staff to the king who had granted it, William I's predecessor, Edward the Confessor. Gerard then reports that Wulfstan proceeded to work a miracle at Edward's tomb, a miracle so impressive that King William confirmed Wulfstan in his episcopate. Although Urse did not succeed in removing Wulfstan, and although there are certainly embellishments added in Gerald's story, it is clear that Urse and Wulfstan were the main powers in Worcestershire, and were thus great rivals.|$|E
500|$|TV Week often {{commented on}} her {{pregnancy}} storyline. After the plot was half way through Erin Miller of TV Week said that Nicole {{had changed her}} mind about adopting her baby [...] "more times that Julia Gillard has <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> phrase 'moving forward'". Upon watching Nicole's beach birth scenes, the magazine website editor quipped [...] "Who knew sand had birthing properties?! Well, maybe not... but you could forgive pregnant teen Nicole for thinking that after a casual stroll along the Bay's beach ends with Angelo delivering her newborn son!" [...] Commenting on the realism of the storyline they added: [...] "Only in the Bay would a baby be born on the beach!" [...] Miller thought it was odd she had then [...] "miraculously lost any signs that she even had a baby." [...] She quipped [...] "already the teen is back to wearing skin-tight dresses!". They later described Nicole and Marilyn's argument over George as [...] "the mother of all rifts" [...] and said [...] "It's exhausting just thinking about it!" [...] Miller later criticised Nicole's career in fashion, after John told her he hated her designs for the Surf Club. She said [...] "I had to agree with him - putting lifesavers in pink polo-neck swimmers is a terrible idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN [...] "loved" [...] Tom's first {{appearance}} because [...] "It's a great scene and our first introduction to The Others besides Ethan's infiltration of the camp." [...] Gainey found the fan {{reaction to his}} {{first appearance}} [...] "really tough", because [...] "everywhere [...] went people would just give [...] dirty looks and they were like 'What {{are you going to}} do with that boy?'", but he noted this gradually improved after his appearances in season two. Erin Martell from AOL's TV Squad listed Tom in her five [...] "most entertaining guest roles" [...] from the first three seasons, commenting [...] "I am counting his first episode as my favorite. For my money, there was nothing more disturbing than when Gainey showed up out of the blue and <b>uttered</b> <b>the</b> words, 'We're gonna have to take the boy.' I could not get that scene out of my head for days after 'Exodus' aired. Ben has made Tom seem relatively less menacing over time, but I have a feeling that the terrifying, bearded sea captain is still in there somewhere." [...] In her review of the season four episode [...] "The Other Woman", Nikki Stafford of Wizard called the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] (Tom) a [...] "highlight". Following his posthumous flashback appearance in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", Martell said [...] "Now I feel even worse about his death. He wasn't just one of Ben's scary, Walt-napping minions. He had a heart." [...] Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle thought the revelation that Tom is gay was a [...] "unique and funny twist". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post noted this revelation [...] "seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal (well for an 'Other') not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E
