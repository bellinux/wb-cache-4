5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or <b>unlined</b> flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an <b>unlined</b> bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E
5|$|After its sale to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust, 70000 was {{overhauled}} at Crewe {{and returned}} to the main line in 2011 (its 60th anniversary), initially in <b>unlined</b> black without name plates as originally outshopped in 1951 (the plates were first fitted for the Festival of Britain later that year).|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and <b>unlined,</b> is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest {{within a day or}} so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted <b>unlined</b> black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, <b>unlined</b> apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an <b>unlined</b> depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, a workers' tent {{camp was}} erected {{on the eastern}} side of Stirling Ridge to house the men working on the main intercepting sewer. The {{following}} year saw the start of the construction of 62 small, four-room, <b>unlined</b> timber cottages, to be used as housing for the married tradesmen involved {{in the construction of the}} provisional Parliament House. Other camps were established at the eastern end of Stirling Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie's settlement (1922–30), consisting of 25 timber cottages for his married men and timber barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single men's tent camps were established nearby—Old Tradesmen's Camp (1923–27) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924–27). The men from Howie's worked on the Hotel Canberra and the others on the construction of the provisional Parliament House and nearby administrative buildings.|$|E
5|$|The nine {{remaining}} gliders transporting {{the airborne}} troops assigned to Group Granite successfully {{landed on the}} roof of Fort Eben-Emael, using arrester-parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt. The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements {{on the top of the}} Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges. In the southern part of the Fort, Objective No. 18, an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge, which collapsed the casemate's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself. Objective No. 12, a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops, who then moved to Objective No. 26, a turret holding another three 75mm weapons; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off, this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers, who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it. Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled, as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops. However, attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful; the objective, twin turrets with heavy-calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola, was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own, forcing troops from two gliders to be used. Primitive <b>unlined</b> shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated, but whilst they shook the turrets they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels.|$|E
25|$|The Lining: lining is {{considered}} an unnecessary burden and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the jacket is <b>unlined</b> or only half lined, {{in order to provide}} lightness; even the sleeves are completely <b>unlined,</b> as they’re meant to fit like a second skin. Additionally, the lining is often left open (“volante,” literally “flying”) so that people can admire the fine details and construction of the jacket.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{reactive}} with acidic foods {{which can}} result in corrosion, the byproducts of which can foment copper toxicity. In certain circumstances, however, <b>unlined</b> copper is recommended and safe, for instance {{in the preparation of}} meringue, where copper ions prompt proteins to denature (unfold) and enable stronger protein bonds across the sulfur contained in egg whites. <b>Unlined</b> copper is also used in the making of preserves, jams and jellies. Copper does not store ("bank") heat, and so thermal flows reverse almost immediately upon removal from heat. This allows precise control of consistency and texture while cooking sugar and pectin-thickened preparations. Alone, fruit acid would be sufficient to cause leaching of copper byproducts, but naturally occurring fruit sugars and added preserving sugars buffer copper reactivity. <b>Unlined</b> pans have thereby been used safely in such applications for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Two Class 31 diesels {{were painted}} in trial liveries. No.D5578 was painted in an <b>unlined</b> 'Light Electric blue', and No.D5579 was painted in a colour {{variously}} described as 'Bronze Gold' and 'Golden Ochre'.|$|E
25|$|The {{first batch}} was {{turned out in}} black livery with green lining, and were {{numbered}} 19111915 with 'Southern' in yellow on the water tanks. The Ashford batch was outshopped in <b>unlined</b> black livery, and the initial batch were also converted to this new livery. These locomotives were numbered 19161925.|$|E
25|$|The tunnels {{are very}} {{unstable}} as, {{contrary to popular}} belief, most were bored not into solid granite, but loose shale. This {{is evident from the}} large number of roof collapses in the incomplete, <b>unlined</b> tunnels. Most of the tunnels still survive today and are infrequently visited by organised parties (with permission).|$|E
25|$|In the Sierra and Selva, with 97% of Peru's water availability, {{surface water}} {{supplies}} agricultural fields by furrow irrigation. Irrigation systems consist {{of an open}} canal network, generally <b>unlined,</b> with rudimentary water intakes and distribution systems supplying small plots devoted mostly to subsistence agriculture. Less than 5% of irrigated land is equipped with improved on-farm irrigation systems.|$|E
25|$|Many commercially {{available}} soap molds {{are made of}} silicone or various types of plastic, although many soapmaking hobbyists may use cardboard boxes lined with a plastic film. Wooden molds, <b>unlined</b> or lined with silicone sleeves, are also readily available to the general public. Soaps {{can be made in}} long bars that are cut into individual portions, or cast into individual molds.|$|E
25|$|Evening Star {{was built}} at Swindon railway works in 1960. Though {{the last to}} be built, {{it was not the}} last 9F numerically as Crewe Works had already {{completed}} engines with higher numbers. It was equipped with a BR1G-type tender and given BR Brunswick green livery, normally reserved for passenger locomotives, and was completed with a copper-capped double chimney. All other members of the class of heavy freight locomotives were painted <b>unlined</b> black.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{considered}} the walls to be {{a prime example of}} 16th century military architecture. Their design incorporates specific innovative techniques, marking the beginning of a renaissance era in fortification construction. These include the positioning of gates {{to the side of the}} adjoining bastions, so they could be more easily protected in times of siege, and leaving the upper half of the wall <b>unlined</b> with masonry, to increase its ability to absorb the impact from cannon shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of irrigation canals began {{on a large}} scale in the 1940s. Many of the canals were poorly built, allowing water to leak or evaporate. From the Qaraqum Canal, the largest in Central Asia, perhaps 30 to 75% of the water went to waste. Today, only 12% of Uzbekistan's irrigation canal length is waterproofed. Of the 47,750km of interfarm irrigation channels in the basin, only 28% have anti-infiltration linings. Only 77% of farm intakes have flow gauges, and of the 268,500km of onfarm channels, only 21% have anti-infiltration linings, which retain on average 15% more water than <b>unlined</b> channels.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the twelve}} frames of the shield weighed over seven tons. The key {{innovation}} of the tunnelling shield was its support for the <b>unlined</b> ground in front and around it {{to reduce the risk}} of collapses. However, many workers, including Brunel himself, soon fell ill from the poor conditions caused by filthy sewage-laden water seeping through from the river above. This sewage gave off methane gas which was ignited by the miner's oil lamps. When the resident engineer, John Armstrong of Ingram Northumberland , fell ill in April 1826 Marc's son Isambard Kingdom Brunel took over at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|The Korean {{word for}} trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in {{recorded}} history {{around the turn}} of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the <b>unlined</b> gouei to the padded sombaji.|$|E
25|$|A further {{issue is}} {{industrial}} and metropolitan waste from early-established landfills and waste-emitting factories {{on the banks}} of the river. These include an <b>unlined</b> waste dump at Horotiu, just downriver from Hamilton, whose leachates include persistent organic pollutants such as dieldrin in quantities toxic to freshwater marine life. The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website. In 2002 dead eels were found in a tributary of the river when a container of pesticides and other chemicals was apparently illegally dumped. The chemicals were diluted when they entered the much bigger Waikato River. The harmful effect was temporary.|$|E
25|$|The nests of trogons {{are thought}} to usually be <b>unlined.</b> Between two and four eggs are laid in a nesting attempt. These are round and {{generally}} glossy white or lightly coloured (buff, grey, blue or green), although they get increasingly dirty during incubation. Both parents incubate the eggs (except {{in the case of}} the bare-cheeked trogon, where apparently the male takes no part), with the male taking one long incubation stint a day and the female incubating the rest of the time. Incubation seems to begin after the last egg is laid. The incubation period varies by species, usually lasting between 16–19 days. On hatching the chicks are altricial, blind and naked. The chicks acquire feathers rapidly in some of the montane species, {{in the case of the}} mountain trogon in a week, but more slowly in lowland species like the black-headed trogon, which may take twice as long. The nestling period varies by species and size, with smaller species generally taking 16 to 17 days to fledge, whereas larger species may take as long as 30 days, although 23–25 days is more typical.|$|E
500|$|From 1925, {{the class}} was repainted in a darker olive green livery, {{introduced}} by Maunsell, with plain white lining, black borders and primrose yellow markings. In 1939, shortly {{after the start of}} the Second World War, locomotives Nos.1413 and 1850 were painted in <b>unlined</b> olive green because of labour shortages. In 1941, Nos.1821, 1825, 1847, 1878 and 1403 were run in <b>unlined</b> olive green with Bulleid's gilt block lettering. Labour and paint shortages during the Second World War meant that all Nclass locomotives were painted in plain black by 1945. In 1946, two locomotives, Nos.1817 and 1854, were repainted in Bulleid's malachite green livery, with yellow and black lining and [...] "Sunshine" [...] yellow lettering.|$|E
500|$|The nest tunnel is [...] {{long and}} [...] across, with a {{slightly}} narrower entrance. The nest chamber is typically <b>unlined,</b> although pairs may bring in some grass, bracken or seaweed. Although the storm petrel is generally non-territorial when breeding, a pair will defend the nest chamber itself after the eggs have been laid.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, {{increasing}} runoff {{in the creek}} from the growing cities in the watershed begun to spell ecological problems and severe erosion for the creek. Although a series of flood control channels upstream of Aliso Creek Road (near Aliso Canyon) {{had already begun to}} prevent erosion in those heavily developed areas, the creek eroded to depths of [...] or more in any <b>unlined</b> areas.|$|E
500|$|In Hasidic courts, the kvitel {{is inscribed}} {{with the names}} of the {{petitioner}} and his family members, along with their specific requests. The form of the name is the person's full Hebrew name and his mother's Hebrew name (e.g. Shmuel ben Chana, [...] "Shmuel the son of Chana"), even if the Rebbe already knows who he is. It is customary to write the kvitel on a blank, <b>unlined</b> piece of paper.|$|E
500|$|Nclass {{locomotives}} {{were initially}} painted in an <b>unlined</b> dark grey livery with white lettering and numbering. This Maunsell grey livery {{was introduced by}} the SECR as a wartime economy measure. After Grouping in 1923, the Southern Railway replaced the different liveries of the constituent companies with a standard sage green livery (the colour was that previously used by Robert Urie on the LSWR) with black and white lining, primrose yellow numbering and [...] "Southern" [...] on the tender. This livery was first applied to No.825.|$|E
500|$|About 110 {{metric tonnes}} {{of solid waste}} are {{collected}} from Thanjavur every day by door-to-door collection and subsequently the source segregation and dumping is {{carried out by the}} sanitary department of the Thanjavur Corporation. The coverage of solid waste management had an efficiency of 100% as of 2001. The underground drainage system covers 70% {{of the city and the}} remaining sewerage system for disposal of sullage is through septic tanks, open drains and public conveniences. The Corporation maintains a total of [...] of storm water drains: [...] surfaced drains and [...] <b>unlined</b> drains.|$|E
500|$|A long-distance footpath, the Mendip Way, follows {{much of the}} {{northern}} boundary of the site. There is also a [...] long tunnel {{which was part of}} the Cheddar Valley Line but is now used for pedestrians and cyclists. Within the tunnel the central surface has been paved with tarmac but it is unlit except for a central guide line of small guide lamps. The north half of the tunnel is brick lined, but about midway it reverts to <b>unlined</b> rock for the southern half, marking a change in the underlying geology from sandstone to limestone.|$|E
500|$|Completed to {{its final}} {{dimensions}} in 1938, O'Shaughnessy Dam now stands [...] above the riverbed and [...] above bedrock. The crest spans [...] with a [...] wide roadway crossing the top; {{the thickness of}} the dam wall reaches a maximum [...] at the base. Altogether, the structure contains [...] of concrete and [...] of steel. Aside from normal water flows through the Canyon Tunnel to the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, water is released from the reservoir through eleven jet-flow gates on the dam face and an <b>unlined</b> side spillway controlled by three [...] wide steel drum gates. With gates lowered, the spillway has a capacity of [...]|$|E
500|$|In May 1938, after Bulleid's {{appointment}} as CME, No.749 Iseult was trialled in bright <b>unlined</b> light green with yellow-painted block numerals replacing the cast numberplates. The tender was given two designs of lettering, with [...] "Southern" [...] {{on one side}} and the initials [...] "SR" [...] on the other. The Board of Directors disapproved and Bulleid repainted the locomotive in darker malachite green with black and white lining (this would later be applied to his Pacifics). The legend [...] "Southern" [...] in block-lettering remained on the tender, though the number was relocated to the cabside {{on one side and}} the smoke deflector on the other. Both were painted in a light [...] "sunshine yellow". No.749 was returned to Maunsell’s green livery.|$|E
500|$|New Melones Dam and its {{reservoir}} {{comprise the}} independent New Melones Unit of the Central Valley Project. The dam's primary {{purpose is to}} control the runoff from , or about 92percent, of the watershed of the Stanislaus River, a major tributary of the San Joaquin River. At [...] high from the foundations and [...] long, and containing [...] of material, New Melones is the second tallest earthfill dam in the United States, after Oroville Dam, and the sixth tallest dam overall.

500|$|No.822 was {{completed}} before Grouping, and initially {{ran in the}} SECR's <b>unlined</b> dark grey livery with white lettering and numbering. It was repainted {{at the same time}} as the resetting of the boiler pressure in June 1925, in a dark olive green livery. [...] The green was complemented with plain white lining, black borders and primrose yellow markings. This livery was also applied to the five locomotives built in 1930. During the Second World War, when labour and paint were in short supply, the class was gradually repainted in matt black. The repainting took place during essential maintenance visits to Ashford works, and included the application of Bulleid's [...] "Sunshine" [...] yellow block lettering and numerals on both tender and cabside. This livery was gradually replaced with gloss black between 1945 and 1947.|$|E
500|$|Not much {{is known}} about the species' behaviour, as it became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made. It is likely that the Choiseul pigeon was a largely terrestrial species, feeding and nesting near the forest floor. The indigenous people of the town of Vundutura said that the pigeon would roost in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs close to the ground. They claimed that the species was very tame, allowing local hunters to approach it and pick it up off of its perch by hand. They reported that the species had stones in its gizzard. It laid a single dark, cream-coloured egg in an <b>unlined</b> depression on the ground. The egg was about [...] in size, which is considered small in proportion to the bird.|$|E
500|$|The {{earthquake}} shaking {{also led}} to extensive damage to the irrigation systems of the Imperial Valley, leading to breaches in some canals, particularly the All-American Canal that brings water to the valley from the Colorado River. A [...] section of the <b>unlined</b> canal between the Ash and East Highline canals experienced settling. The Imperial Irrigation District estimated damage to be $982,000 for the three canals. Water flow was immediately reduced to prevent further damage and to allow assessments to be made, and within four days the repairs had been completed and full capacity restored. A hydraulic gate and a concrete facility that were damaged during the May 1940 earthquake needed repair again. The 1940 event caused significant destruction to canals {{on both sides of}} the international border, with [...] of damage along eight canals on the US side alone.|$|E
500|$|The American {{journalist}} George Thayer, who {{met with}} Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being [...] "blonde and balding", with [...] "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall [...] "had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." [...] In {{his study of the}} National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off [...] "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as [...] "a rather small man with a hard, <b>unlined</b> face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic, and he speaks in a loud voice with a clipped inflection." [...] Walker described him as having a [...] "keen political mind", with a [...] "concern for organisation [...] meticulous planning".|$|E
