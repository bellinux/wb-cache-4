In that setting, the sender has a set U of n messages, and the transfer constraints are specified by a collection A of permissible subsets of U.The receiver may obtain any subset of the messages in U that appears in the collection A.

Cyanobacteria are promising host organisms {{for the production of}} small molecules that can be secreted such as ethanol, butanol, fatty acids and other organic acids. Eukaryotic microalgae are interesting for products for which cellular storage is important such as proteins, lipids, starch and alkanes. For the development of new and promising lines of production, strains of both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae have to be improved. Transformation systems have been much better developed in cyanobacteria. However, several products would be preferably produced with eukaryotic microalgae. In the case of cyanobacteria a synthetic-systems biology approach has a great potential to exploit cyanobacteria as cell factories. For eukaryotic microalgae transformation systems need to be further developed. A promising strategy is transformation of heterologous (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) genes in established eukaryotic hosts such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{three questions}} related to the choice between war in Iraq and {{a continuation of the}} pre-war containment policy. First, in terms of military resources, casualties and expenditures for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, is war more or less costly for the United States than containment? Second, compared to war and forcible regime change, would a continuation of the containment policy have saved Iraqi lives? Third, is war likely to bring about an improvement or deterioration in the economic well-being of Iraqis? We address these questions from an ex ante perspective as of early 2003. According to our analysis, pre-invasion views about the likely course of the Iraq intervention imply present value costs for the United States in the range of $ 100 to $ 870 billion. Our estimated present value cost for the containment policy is nearly $ 300 billion and ranges upward to $ 700 billion when we account for several risks stressed by national security analysts. Our analysis also indicates that war and forcible regime change will yield large improvements in the economic well-being of most Iraqis relative to their prospects under the containment policy, and that the Iraqi death toll would likely be greater <b>under</b> <b>containment.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{hot water}} layer system (HWLS) {{is a novel}} system for {{reducing}} radioactivity under research reactor containment. This system is particularly useful in pool-type research reactors or other light water reactors with an open pool surface. The main purpose of a HWLS is to provide more protection for operators and reactor personnel against undesired doses due to the radio- activity of the primary loop. This radioactivity originates mainly from the induced radioactivity contained within the cooling water or probable minute leaks of fuel elements. More importantly, the bothersome radioactivity is progressively proportional to reactor power and, thus, the HWLS is a partial solution for mitigating such problems when power upgrading is planned. Following {{a series of tests}} and checks for different parameters, a HWLS has been built and put into operation at the Tehran research reactor in 2009. It underwent a series of comprehensive tests for a period of 6 months. Within this time-frame, it was realized that the HWLS could provide a better protection for reactor personnel against prevailing radiation <b>under</b> <b>containment.</b> The system is especially suitable in cases of abnormality, e. g. the spread of fission products due to fuel failure, because it prevents the mixing of pollutants developed deep in the pool with the upper layer and thus mitigates widespread leakage of radioactivity...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades, animal cell culturing has been {{essential}} for biomedical research and biotechnological activities in general. Along with this increasing importance, biosafety concerns have pointed to the risks of manipulating animal cell cultures for {{human health and the}} environment. A maximal reduction of these risks necessitates a thorough risk assessment of the cell cultures used. It involves an evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture, including subsequent properties acquired as a result of genetic modification, and the possibility that the cell culture may inadvertently or deliberately become contaminated with pathogens. The latter is a major hazard associated with the manipulation of animal cell cultures, as adventitious agents may be pathogenic and have a better capacity to survive in unfavorable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the risks encountered during the handling of cell cultures should include considerations regarding the type of manipulation as well. As a rule, cell cultures known to harbor an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent. With the exception of very well-characterized cell cultures for which the use of a type II biosafety cabinet depends on the origin of the cells, work with cell cultures from human or primate origin should generally and minimally be performed <b>under</b> <b>containment</b> level 2 using a type II biosafety cabinet.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study certain {{fundamental}} and distinguished subsets of weights of an arbitrary highest weight module over a complex semisimple Lie algebra. These sets wt_J V^λ are defined for each highest weight module V^λ and each subset J of simple roots; we term them "standard parabolic subsets of weights". It is shown that for any highest weight module, the sets of simple roots whose corresponding standard parabolic subsets of weights are equal form intervals in the poset of subsets {{of the set}} of simple roots <b>under</b> <b>containment.</b> Moreover, we provide closed-form expressions for the maximum and minimum elements of the aforementioned intervals for all highest weight modules V^λ over semisimple Lie algebras g. Surprisingly, these formulas only require the Dynkin diagram of g and the integrability data of V^λ. As a consequence, we extend classical work by Satake, Borel-Tits, Vinberg, and Casselman, as well as recent variants by Cellini-Marietti to all highest weight modules. We further compute the dimension, stabilizer, and vertex set of standard parabolic faces of highest weight modules, and {{show that they are}} completely determined by the aforementioned closed-form expressions. We also compute the f-polynomial and a minimal half-space representation of the convex hull of the set of weights. These results were recently shown for the adjoint representation of a simple Lie algebra, but analogues remain unknown for any other finite- or infinite-dimensional highest weight module.

40|$|About 94 % of {{the world}} {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea L.) production comes from the rainfed crop grown largely by resource-poor farmers. Several biotic and abiotic stresses limit groundnut productivity, together causing annual yield losses of over US $ 3. 2 billion. The Arachis species harbor genes capable of improving both seed yield and quality in addition to imparting high levels of resistance to diseases and insect pests. Many of the wild Arachis species are not cross compatible with cultivated groundnut. However, efforts to overcome incompatibility in wide crosses have started to liberate resistance genes in interspecific progenies. But these progenies carry a lot of linkage drag. Marker-assisted backcross breeding should minimize the linkage drag as it greatly facilitates monitoring of introgressed chromosome segments carrying beneficial genes from wild Arachis to cultivated groundnut. Transgenic groundnuts with resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses have been produced and are {{in various stages of}} characterization <b>under</b> <b>containment</b> and/or controlled field conditions. Once favorable genes are introduced into cultivated groundnut through wide crossing and/or genetic transformation techniques, these genes will become ideal candidates for marker-accelerated introgression. DNA marker based genetic linkage map should enable breeders to effectively pyramid genes for good seed quality and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses into agronomically enhanced breeding populations in a much shorter time than would be possible by conventional techniques. To date 110 SSR markers detected genetic variation in a diverse array of 24 groundnut landraces. However, substantial efforts are still required to develop sufficient PCR-based markers, particularly SSRs and SNPs, for the construction of high-density genetic linkage map and for the routine application in the molecular breeding in groundnut.
