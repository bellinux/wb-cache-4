5|$|Phyllis Hyman also {{recorded}} a potential theme song, written by Stephen Forsyth and Jim Ryan, but the song—an <b>unsolicited</b> submission—was passed over given Legrand's contractual obligations with the music.|$|E
5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, {{this story}} was an <b>unsolicited</b> {{submission}} sent to the production office in early 1975. Although only fifteen minutes worth of material was considered unsuitable for Doctor Who, script editor Robert Holmes brought in Chris Boucher to discuss ideas with himself and producer Philip Hinchcliffe. This led to unmade scripts for The Dreamers of Phados and The Mentor Conspiracy, before finally being commissioned as The Face of Evil.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Wiltshire, {{this was}} an <b>unsolicited</b> script for a six-part story. The story {{revolved}} around a nuclear submarine diving into the 'Fault of Menday' and discovering a subterranean world. The 'sun' for this world is dying and the underground dwellers, Suranians led by Zorr, are planning to invade the surface world. Wiltshire was never commissioned to develop the storyline further.|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many <b>unsolicited</b> letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest {{literary}} topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Westland made an {{unsuccessful}} <b>unsolicited</b> offer to the British Ministry of Defence, proposing an enhanced Merlin variant intended {{to satisfy the}} demand for additional lift capacity. An alternative measure was the acquisition of six AW101s from Denmark in 2007; designated Merlin HC3A, these {{were assigned to the}} RAF, allowing Merlins to be deployed in Afghanistan. The HC3A is used for training and not for frontline operations due to various configuration differences. In December 2007, a second Merlin squadron, No. 78 Squadron was formed at RAF Benson.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, two {{teenagers}} {{get into a}} fight in the woods. The girl, named Maggie (Jillian Bach), runs into the woods to be alone and Kevin (Angelo Vacco), her boyfriend, gives chase. However, he is attacked and his heart is removed. Meanwhile, the writer intensely transcribes the event on his typewriter. The next day, Mulder and Scully discuss this latest incident via phone. An unmarked envelope is discovered by Scully in the office containing a milagro, a type of pendant. While she examines the pendant, a voice-over from the writer describes Scully's most intimate feelings as she examines the <b>unsolicited</b> gift.|$|E
5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in politics {{at the local level}} in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an <b>unsolicited</b> Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E
5|$|Unrepresented by management, Davis {{sent his}} script out <b>unsolicited</b> to agents and studios {{over the course}} of the next three years. Davis secured {{representation}} through his efforts and received a number of studio offers, but, in a story reminiscent of Sylvester Stallone's experience with Rocky, he refused to sell the script unless he was signed to play the title role. He also resisted demands that Marty be made heterosexual. While Davis and director O'Flaherty honed the script, Davis trained as a boxer to add to the film's authenticity. The film was shot in Los Angeles on high-definition digital video on a budget of $200,000 and was O'Flaherty's feature debut.|$|E
5|$|While Jyllands-Posten has {{published}} satirical cartoons depicting Christian figures, it rejected <b>unsolicited</b> cartoons in 2003 which depicted Jesus, opening it to accusations {{of a double}} standard. In February 2006, Jyllands-Posten refused to publish Holocaust cartoons, which included cartoons that mocked or denied the Holocaust, offered by an Iranian newspaper which had held a contest. Six of the less controversial images were later published by Dagbladet Information, after the editors consulted the main rabbi in Copenhagen, and three cartoons were later reprinted in Jyllands-Posten. After the competition had finished, Jyllands-Posten also reprinted the winning and runner-up cartoons.|$|E
5|$|Written by Marc Platt, this <b>unsolicited</b> {{story was}} {{submitted}} to script editor Robert Holmes in late 1975 {{and dealt with}} a sentient star using the Time Lord libraries {{as a means of}} invading Gallifrey. Holmes felt that it lacked action and drama, and was in need of a proper antagonist. Even so, Robert Holmes thought that Fires of the Starmind had more potential than most of the other amateur submissions and he encouraged Marc Platt to continue writing. Fires of the Starmind was rejected on 15 December.|$|E
5|$|After {{campaigns and}} editorials with {{photographer}} Tony Duran, Ratajkowski began shooting more fashion editorials and posed for several early {{issues of the}} artistic erotica magazine treats!, including the cover of its third issue, in March 2012. She credits that cover for bringing her the two <b>unsolicited,</b> high-profile, music video roles. Ratajkowski later filmed commercials for Nikon and Carl'sJr., including multiple versions of a 2012 Carl'sJr. commercial with Sara Jean Underwood. She also did nude and clothed art modeling for magazines, including a May 2012 shoot with Jonathan Leder, as well as work for Frederick's of Hollywood; a 2012 holiday video and a 2011 Valentine's video in which Ratajkowski appeared for the company {{are among the most}} popular videos on the company's YouTube channel. Ratajkowski worked with photographer Tony Kelly for the March 2013 GQ Turkey cover.|$|E
5|$|As {{a first-time}} novelist, Niffenegger had trouble finding a {{literary}} agent. She eventually sent the novel to MacAdam/Cage <b>unsolicited</b> and, after an auction took {{place for the}} rights, Niffenegger selected them as her publishers. The book became a bestseller after an endorsement from author and family friend Scott Turow on The Today Show, and as of March 2009 had sold nearly 2.5 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many reviewers were impressed with Niffenegger's unique perspectives on time travel. Some praised her characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized her writing style as melodramatic and the plot as emotionally trite. The novel won the Exclusive Books Boeke Prize and a British Book Award. A film version was released in August 2009.|$|E
5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer <b>unsolicited</b> advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Bradley's {{name was}} again put before the General Assembly as a {{candidate}} for the U.S. Senate, but he was defeated by James B. Beck by a vote of 94–31. Later that year, he received 103 of 832 votes for the Vice-Presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican National Convention, losing the nomination to Levi P. Morton. Upon the <b>unsolicited</b> recommendation of Senator Beck, President Benjamin Harrison nominated Bradley as Minister to Korea in 1889, but Bradley declined the nomination, opting to remain in Kentucky and pursue future political opportunities there. He was elected to the Republican National Committee three times between 1890 and 1896. In 1896, he was the Kentucky delegation's choice for Presidential nominee.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 2014, {{there was}} {{increasing}} {{speculation that the}} Sōryū class (or a derivative) was the most likely candidate for the replacement. Defence technology sharing deals between Japan and Australia, along with the loosening of Japanese defence export restrictions, were seen as preliminary steps towards such a deal. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was also cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such a deal. In response to the rumours of the Japanese deal, <b>unsolicited</b> proposals were made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (its Type 216 submarine concept), Saab (an enlarged version of the A26 submarine), and Thales and DCNS (a diesel-electric variant of the Barracuda-class submarine).|$|E
5|$|Life with My Sister Madonna, {{a book by}} Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted {{at number}} two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some {{friction}} between Madonna and her brother, because of the <b>unsolicited</b> publication. Madonna eventually filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. On December 15, 2008, Madonna's spokeswoman announced that the singer had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which grant him between £50 million and £60 million, a figure that includes {{the value of the}} couple's London pub and residence and Wiltshire estate in England. Madonna and Guy Ritchie's marriage was dissolved by District Judge Reid by decree nisi at the clinical Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. Madonna and Ritchie entered into a compromise agreement for Rocco and David, then ages eight and three respectively, and divided the children's time between Ritchie's London home and Madonna's in New York, where the two will be joined by her daughter, Lourdes, from a previous relationship.|$|E

It was the largest such private placement ever completed by a Canadian e-commerce company. In 2014, Vipond taught a one-day course on mining valuation at Sauder School of Business that involved working through a mining acquisition opportunity and the impact on such an mining investment.|$|E
25|$|For works written {{independently}} of the publisher, writers often first submit a query letter or proposal directly to a literary agent or to a publisher. Submissions sent directly to a publisher {{are referred to as}} <b>unsolicited</b> submissions, and the majority come from previously unpublished authors. If the publisher accepts <b>unsolicited</b> manuscripts, then the manuscript is placed in the slush pile, which publisher's readers sift through to identify manuscripts of sufficient quality or revenue potential to be referred to acquisitions editors for review. The acquisitions editors send their choices to the editorial staff. The time and number of people involved in the process are dependent {{on the size of the}} publishing company, with larger companies having more degrees of assessment between <b>unsolicited</b> submission and publication. <b>Unsolicited</b> submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some sources estimating that publishers ultimately choose about three out of every ten thousand <b>unsolicited</b> manuscripts they receive.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th Century Western Union allowed telegraphic {{messages}} on its network {{to be sent}} to multiple destinations.

25|$|Overtures to the {{proprietor}} of Pennsylvania, John Penn at Pennsbury at first elicited {{no more than a}} polite response, but an <b>unsolicited</b> gift of 34 pound sterling arrived in the summer of 1738 from Walter Sydserfe, a Scottish-born physician and planter of Antigua.|$|E
25|$|Obama was {{the only}} Democratic presidential {{candidate}} to issue an <b>unsolicited</b> statement expressing his views on disability community issues.

25|$|Burton courted further {{controversy}} in 1976 {{when he wrote}} an <b>unsolicited</b> article for The Observer about his friend and fellow Welsh thespian Stanley Baker, who had recently died from pneumonia {{at the age of}} 48; the article upset Baker's widow with its depiction of her late husband as an uncultured womaniser.|$|E

25|$|Tupolev made <b>unsolicited</b> {{proposals}} for variants, including the Tu-8B with Mikulin AM-42 engines and the Tu-8S with Charomski ACh-30BF diesel engines, but none were accepted. Soviet military planners {{had decided to}} devote resources to development of jet bombers, such as the Tupolev Tu-73, which were already flying, and which exhibited much more potential than piston-engined aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The XB-42 was {{developed}} initially {{as a private}} venture; an <b>unsolicited</b> proposal {{was presented to the}} United States Army Air Forces in May 1943. This resulted in an Air Force contract for two prototypes and one static test airframe, the USAAF seeing an intriguing possibility of finding a bomber capable of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress's range without its size or cost.|$|E
25|$|Despicable Me was {{initially}} developed by Sergio Pablos under the original title Evil Me.

25|$|A {{person may}} {{experience}} multiple orgasms, or an involuntary orgasm, {{such as in}} the case of rape or other sexual assault. An involuntary orgasm from forced sexual contact often results in feelings of shame caused by internalization of victim-blaming attitudes. The incidence of those who experience <b>unsolicited</b> sexual contact and experience orgasm is very low, though possibly under-reported due to shame or embarrassment; such orgasms additionally happen regardless of gender.|$|E
