40|$|<b>Ultramarine</b> <b>pigments</b> are aluminosilicate-based {{and contain}} sulphur-based chromophores. Several samples from two batches of fine fly ash, a {{predominantly}} aluminosilicate waste product of coal combustion, were used successfully to synthesise ultramarine blue.

A comparison of the scanning electron micrographs of fly ash, fly ash treated at 1 000 °C, fly ash reacted with sodium carbonate at 860 °C and the ultramarine products showed that sulphur had a structure-directing effect. The sulphur clusters found in <b>ultramarine</b> <b>pigments</b> were studied by Self-Consistent-Field Hartree-Fock theory extended by Møller-Plesset second order perturbation theory at the minimum energy with the 6 - 311 G** basis set to determine the relative stability of S 2, S 2 -•, S 22 -, and S 3, S 3 -•, S 32 -. The singly charged species were the most stable in both sets, supporting the hypothesis that the exothermic transition from green to blue ultramarine was the transformation of the doubly charged species to the singly charged species. The open, C 2 v, isomer was most stable for the S 3 -• molecule - the blue ultramarine chromophore. The S 4 molecule was a likely chromophore in ultramarine red. A Woodward-Hoffmann analysis supported the concerted formation of the puckered square S 4, pyramidal S 4, and gauche S 4 chain isomers. Other possible species for the red chromophore were S 4 -, S 3, S 3 Cl, S 3 Cl-, S 2 Cl, S 2 O, and S 2 O-. On the basis of their calculated vibrational spectra most of the species could be discounted as possible red chromophores.

These products show colors from blue to green at different shades, both influenced by the amount of additives and cooling rate after calcination.

5000|$|A notable {{feature of}} the murals in Kizil is the {{extensive}} use of blue pigments, including the precious <b>ultramarine</b> <b>pigment</b> derived from lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. In the classification {{of the art of}} the region by Ernst Waldschmidt, there are three distinct periods: [...] the murals from the first phase are characterized by the use of reddish pigments, while those from the second phase used bluish pigments in abundance. [...] The earlier paintings reflect more Greco-Indian or Gandharan influences, while the second ones show Iranian (Sassanian) influences. [...] Later caves seem to have fewer legends and/or jatakas, being replaced by the repetitive designs of numerous small Buddhas (the so-called thousand Buddha motif), or sitting Buddhas with nimbuses. [...] The paintings of the first two phases showed a lack of Chinese elements. [...] The last phase is the Turkic-Chinese period which is centered around Turfan but in Kizil only two caves showed Tang Chinese influence. Another characteristic of the Kizil murals is the division into diamond-shaped blocks in the vault ceilings of the main room of many caves. Buddhist scenes are depicted inside these diamond-shapes in many layers {{on top of one another}} to show the narrative sequences of the scenes.|$|E
50|$|Blue {{has been}} used for art and {{decoration}} since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, coming from mines in Afghanistan, was used in ancient Egypt for jewelry and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments.It is the most important color in Judaism. In the Middle Ages, cobalt blue was used to colour the stained glass windows of cathedrals. Beginning in the 9th century, Chinese artists used cobalt to make fine blue and white porcelain. Blue dyes for clothing were made from woad in Europe and indigo in Asia and Africa. In 1828 a synthetic <b>ultramarine</b> <b>pigment</b> was developed, and synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced mineral pigments and vegetable dyes. Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Vincent van Gogh and other late 19th century painters used ultramarine and cobalt blue not just to depict nature, but to create moods and emotions. In the late 18th century and 19th century, blue became a popular colour for military uniforms and police uniforms. In the 20th century, because blue was commonly associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union. Toward the end of the 20th century, dark blue replaced dark grey as the most common colour for business suits; surveys showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.|$|E

The intensity of some blue and yellow zones on the wall painting and the exact coincidence with the pigments analyzed from the studio allowed to infer that at least these two colors were repainted. Samples containing the black pigment display bands at about 1595 and 1319  cm− 1 certainly ascribed to amorphous carbon. This pigment is known as carbon black [52]; the absence of the band at 960  cm− 1, of the phosphate moiety in calcium phosphate [57], suggests the vegetal origin of the coal in the fresco. The white color is due to CaCO 3 (band at 1090  cm− 1), which is the binder used in this painting technique; gypsum (CaSO 4 [*]·[*] 2 H 2 O) displays a characteristic band at 1011  cm− 1. The green color is due to the chromium(III) oxide (Cr 2 O 3), the main green chromophore in the mural painting, with bands at ca. 554 and 349  cm− 1 [58, 59]. The identified pollutants suggest that the strong pulverization observed in this wall painting is probably due to the successive transformation of calcite into gypsum. Large gypsum crystals detach sand from the calcite matrix. The pulverization in different degrees of the painting layer produced by this phenomenon appears on the whole surface. This suggests that sulfate impurities were probably present in the original materials used by the artist. It is probable that external pollutants are acting on some areas that appear more affected today. Pulverization continues due to the high humidity in Concepción, Chile.|$|R
