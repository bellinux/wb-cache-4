5|$|US-89 {{meets the}} current {{alignment}} of US-91 {{in the southern}} outskirts of Brigham City, turning east for an overlap on the city's southeast bypass. (SR-13 and SR-90 are the former alignment through Brigham City.) The two routes head east <b>up</b> <b>Box</b> Elder Canyon in the southern Wellsville Mountains, finally leaving {{the valley of the}} Great Salt Lake into a small valley that contains Mantua Reservoir (elevation 5200 feet/1585 m). US-89/US-91 turns north there, bypassing the town of Mantua to the west, and continues to ascend through Dry Canyon to Sardine Summit (elevation 5900 feet/1798 m). Another small valley leads to Wellsville Canyon, where the four-lane roadway again turns east and descends into the Cache Valley. In that valley, US-89/US-91 heads northeast, bypassing Wellsville to the east, into downtown Logan. US-91 continues northerly from Logan into Idaho, but US-89 splits to the east, beginning a long climb of the Bear River Range through Logan Canyon. The Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, a Utah and National Scenic Byway, begins at Logan and follows US-89 up the canyon, past the access road to the Beaver Mountain ski area, to Garden City and on to the state line. Bear Lake Summit (elevation 7800ft/2377 m), {{at the top of the}} range, is the highest point on US-89 in Utah, from which it descends the east slope via horseshoe curves to Garden City on the shore of Bear Lake (elevation 5900ft/1798 m). The final segment of US-89 to the Idaho state line follows the lake's west shore, its location constrained by the Bear River Range just to the west.|$|E

Strange, sweet insanity! And this letter, the source of my joy, I had not yet read: did not yet know the number of its lines.|$|E

50|$|New {{system for}} {{leveling}} up. Every time the player levels up, {{they get a}} choice of 3 boxes. Each one contains a prize such as wallpaper, a song M/V, a character, a note, or a gear. The prizes are randomly selected. When the player picks one, all 3 boxes reveal what prizes they had, and the player obtains the prize {{that was in the}} box they selected. As the player levels up, the amount of potential prizes increase. For example, all the hidden songs become level <b>up</b> <b>box</b> prizes once the player reaches a certain level. When the player reaches level 99, all the prizes they didn't pick are automatically unlocked.|$|E

The stories told would often be a reenactment of a famous fairy tale or rhyme. Each episode included audience participation from children, calling out or responding. The series was presented and narrated by a puppet called 'Dog', as seen on sister show Tiny and Crew. Dog also provided in-vision presentation for the channel's Tiny Living strand.|$|E

5000|$|Manchester’s fifth annual {{festival of}} design, with a {{programme}} of 50 events, {{is supported by}} headline sponsor the Co-op, Gold sponsors Manchester School of Art, G [...] F Smith and Manchester Fashion Institute, sponsors including Auto Trader, the [...] AHRC Creative Economy Programme and University of Salford, with funding support from Manchester City Council. Media partners are Creative Review and The Guardian. The theme, Reframing Reality, reflects on the rich musical and visual heritage of the city {{with an eye on}} the future. The first announcement that has been made is of “a four-track EP of events” titled Fizzing at the Terminals to mark the fortieth anniversary of the release of the Orgasm Addict single by Manchester punk band Buzzcocks, who will play the O2 Ritz on 19 October supported by all-female Manchester rock band PINS. A retrospective exhibition of Malcolm Garrett’s designs for Buzzcocks from 1977 to the present day (including a 1977 Love Battery gig poster that featured the Fizzing at the Terminals lyric) will take place at the PLANT workshop space in the NOMA district. [...] A parallel exhibition at The Refuge and throughout the city, titled Orgasm Addict Reframed, invites leading designers and emerging creatives to re-imagine the famed record sleeve that featured in the V&A’s Postmodernism exhibition, where Garrett (then still a student at Manchester School of Art) had collaborated with his artist friend Linder Sterling, taking her montage illustration, turning it upside down and printing it in single colour to create the graphic impact of the striking blue and yellow sleeve. The fourth track on the EP of Buzzcocks events is an exhibition titled Time’s Up at the University of Bolton, where (when it was Bolton Institute of Technology) the band was formed in 1976. This exhibition shows the output of the band’s first line-up with Howard Devoto, including the Spiral Scratch EP and the Time’s <b>Up</b> <b>box</b> set alongside handbills, posters and photographs.|$|E

40|$|Most of seismic {{provisions}} given {{so far in}} {{codes are}} based upon analytical and experimental studies for panel zones behaviour of beam to column connections, are limited to I-beam to H-column connections with planner webs. There are not enough documented studies for the cases when beam web(s) and column web(s) are not in one plane. Since, use of built <b>up</b> <b>box</b> columns in Asian countries is a common practice,and for them, beams are connected directly to the face of column flanges, so the mobilization of column panel zones are due to proper passage of beam flange forces from column flanges in an out of plane state which has a very low strength and stiffness. In this paper the results of analytical studies of using a pair of horizental continuity plates at beam flanges level inside of column section as a suitable path are presented for transfer of beam seismic moments to column panel zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of combining small dimension timber with timber webs of suitable thickness {{has been demonstrated}} by of this experimental investigation on nailed built up timber box beams of different cross sectional profiles in which the flanges and webs are entirely of timber. No literature was available on such timber box beam construction. The effect of web thickness, overall depth, and shape of flange on the load carrying capacity and flexural rigidity of timber box beams were investigated. Timber beams consisting of webs of 25 mm thickness and overall depth of 225 mm were shown {{to be the most}} cost effective. The profile of the flange {{does not appear to have}} a significant effect on either the load carrying capacity or flexural rigidity. No attempt wa<i made to model the nail deformation on either the load capacity or the flexural rigidity. Rather, analytical studies showed that the load capacity of the 225 mm deep built-up all timber box beams are approximately 30 % and their flexural rigidity is in the range of 25 % to 40 % that of an integral hollow timber section of identical dimensions. Thus at first glance, the advantage of built up beams of these dimensions may seem questionable. However, considering the fact that integral hollow sections of these dimensions are not available and that there is value addition to the small dimension timber sections whose capacity in bending as solid timber sections acting alone is very small, the all timber built <b>up</b> <b>box</b> beams have immense potential...|$|E
