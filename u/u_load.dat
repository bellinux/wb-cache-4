40|$|The {{influence}} of the ellipticity parameter k and the dimensionless speed <b>U,</b> <b>load</b> W, and materials G parameters on minimum film thickness for materials of low elastic modulus was investigated. The ellipticity parameter was varied from 1 (a ball-on-plane configuration) to 12 (a configuration approaching a line contact); U and W were each varied by one order of magnitude. Seventeen cases were used to generate the minimum- and central-film-thickness relations. The {{influence of}} lubricant starvation on minimum film thickness in starved elliptical, elastohydrodynamic configurations was also investigated for materials of low elastic modulus. Lubricant starvation was studied simply by moving the inlet boundary closer {{to the center of}} the conjunction in the numerical solutions. Contour plots of pressure and film thickness in and around the contact were presented for both fully flooded and starved lubrication conditions. It is evident from these figures that the inlet pressure contours become less circular and closer to the edge of the Hertzian contact zone and that the film thickness decreases substantially as the serverity of starvation increases. The results presented reveal the essential features of both fully flooded and starved, elliptical, elastohydrodynamic conjunctions for materials of low elastic modulus...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} (C) of dissolved ^(238) U,^(234) U,^(232) Th and 230 Th {{in fresh}} and brackish waters from the Baltic Sea were determined using TIMS. The brackish waters range in salinity {{from that of}} sea water (SW) to 2. 5 ‰. C_(238 U) in oxygen-saturated, surface waters is well correlated with salinity and shows quasi-conservative behavior, as does Sr. Samples from the redox water interface show depletion in C_(238 U), demonstrating that dissolved U is being removed by FeMn oxyhydroxides. From a simple mixing relationship for the brackish water,δ^(234) U^* = 1000 ‰ was calculated for the fresh water source in the northern Baltic. A study of the Kalixälven River over an annual cycle yields high δ^(234) U during spring and summer discharge and lower values during fall and winter, showing that different sources contribute to the <b>U</b> <b>load</b> in the river during different seasons. C_(232 Th) and C_(230 Th) in river water are governed by the discharge, reflecting {{the importance of the}} increased abundance of small particles (< 0. 45 μm) for the ^(232) Th-^(230) Th load at high discharge. ^(232) Th/^(238) U in river water is about 40 times less than in detrital material. In the brackish water, C_(232 Th) drops 2 orders of magnitude in the low salinity region (< 5 ‰), reaching a value close to that of sea water at a salinity of 7. 5 ‰. Almost all of the riverine ^(232) Th must be deposited in the low-salinity regions of the estuary. The ^(230) Th/^(232) Th in river waters is about twice the equilibrium value for ^(232) Th/^(238) U (3. 8). In the brackish waters, ^(230) Th/^(232) Th is greater by a factor of 10 – 100 than both river water and SW. The big increase in ^(230) Th/^(232) Th in the Baltic Sea waters over the riverine input indicates that the Th isotopes enter the estuary as a mixture of two carrier phases.

U 500 mg m(- 2) was administered orally and plasma concentrations of U and dihydrouracil (DHU) were determined. In the deficient group, polymerase chain reaction amplification of all 23 coding exons and flanking intronic regions of DPYD was performed. A U pharmacokinetic model was developed and used to determine the maximum enzymatic conversion capacity (Vmax) of the DPD enzyme for each patient.

Triggered by a recent increase in media attention, political pressure on governmental authorities has mounted to assess the associated health risks and implement appropriate mitigation measures. However, owing to the complexity of the catchment arising from the presence of a mul-titude of dischargers, a complex karst hydrology and large-scale modifications thereof by deep-level gold mining, most attempts to address the issue to date have been limited to uncoordinated ad hoc studies generally suffering from a lack of temporal and spatial representivity of the underlying data.

While soft scaffolds are better at mimicking the extracellular environment, they cannot withstand the high loads required to be efficient substitutes for bone in vivo. We propose a 3 D hybrid scaffold combining the load-bearing capabilities of polycaprolactone (PCL) and the ECM-like chemistry of collagen gel to support the dynamic mechanical differentiation of human embryonic mesodermal progenitor cells (hES-MPs). In this study, hES-MPs were cultured in vitro and a BOSE Bioreactor was employed to induce cells differentiation by mechanical stimulation. From day 6, samples were compressed by applying a 5 % strain ramp followed by peak-to-peak 1 % strain sinewaves at 1 Hz for 15 min. Three different conditions were tested: unloaded (<b>U),</b> <b>loaded</b> from day 6 to day 10 (L 1) and loaded as L 1 and from day 16 to day 20 (L 2). Cell viability, DNA content and osteocalcin expression were tested. Samples were further stained with 1 % osmium tetroxide in order to investigate tissue growth and mineral deposition by micro-computed tomography (µCT). Tissue growth involved volumes either inside or outside samples at day 21 for L 1, suggesting cyclic stimulation is a trigger for delayed proliferative response of cells. Cyclic load also had a role in the mineralization process preventing mineral deposition when applied at the early stage of culture. Conversely, cyclic load during the late stage of culture on pre-compressed samples induced mineral formation. This study shows that short bursts of compression applied at different stages of culture have contrasting effects on the ability of hES-MPs to induce tissue formation and mineral deposition.

As a result, the ATR is a representative candidate for assessing the necessary modifications and evaluating the subsequent operating effects associated with low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel conversion. A detailed plate-by-plate MCNP ATR 1 / 8 th core model was developed for the fuel cycle burnup comparison analysis. Using the current HEU 235 U enrichment of 93. 0 % as a baseline, an analysis can be performed to determine the LEU uranium density and 235 U enrichment required in the fuel meat to yield an equivalent Keff between the HEU core and a LEU core versus effective full power days (EFPD). The MCNP ATR 1 / 8 th core model {{will be used to}} optimize the 235 <b>U</b> <b>loading</b> in the LEU core, such that the differences in Keff between the HEU and LEU core can be minimized for operation at 150 EFPD with a total core power of 115 MW.

In this strategy, R- 7. 5, 1. 5 -in. -thick extruded polystyrene was installed on the exterior of the slab for a modeled savings of 4, 500 Btu/h on the heating load...|$|R
40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is a new method for design {{analysis}} of bicycle frames. The new method relies on measurements of rider i n d <b>u</b> d <b>loading</b> to perform a stress analysis of a bicycle frame. The vehicle for the stress analysis is ANSYS, a commercially available finite element code. Through application of individual measured loads, the method examines the corresponding nodes of maximum stress. Polar plots are developed to illustrate the variation of stress {{as a function of}} crank arm angle. Polar plots are also developed for the nodes experiencing the maximum total stress. Such a procedure enables the contribution of individual measured loads to the maximum stress to be ascertained. With this information, not only are the important loads for design analysis identified, but also the structural members of relalive high and low stress are determined. Accordingly, these results have application to the detailed design of individual structural members. To illustrate the new method, stress analysis of an aluminum frame is undertaken. The loading data are derived from an earlier study by the authors where significant seat, handlebar, and pedal loads were measured together with absolute pedal position. The loading data simulate that of steady-state cycling over Rat terrain at about 9 m/s (20 mile/hr). The node of maximum total stress under steady-state loading is found to be the intersection of the top and seat tubes. Inasmuch as frames typically fail {{in the area of the}} bottom bracket (i. e., intersection of down and seat tubes), this result contradicts experience. This contradiction is explained by observing that the alternating stress/mea...|$|R

U. diversum is released through organic secretions, especially semen, preputial and vaginal mucus, conjunctival secretion, and milk. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop a TaqMan probe, highly sensitive and specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for the detection and quantification of U. diversum from genital swabs of bovines. Primers and probes specific to U. diversum 16 S rRNA gene were designed. The specificity, detection limit, intra- and inter-assay variability of qPCR to detect this ureaplasma was compared with the results of the conventional PCR assay (cPCR). Swabs of vaginal mucus from 169 cows were tested. The qPCR assay detected as few as 10 copies of U. diversum and was 100 -fold more sensitive than the cPCR. No cross-reactivity with other Mollicutes or eubacteria was observed. U. diversum was detected in 79 swabs (46. 42 %) by qPCR, while using cPCR it was detected in 42 (25 %) samples. The difference in cPCR and qPCR ureaplasma detection between healthy and sick animals was not statistically significant. But the <b>U.</b> diversum <b>load</b> in samples from animals with genital disorders was higher than in healthy animals. The qPCR assay developed herein is highly sensitive and specific for the detection and quantification of U. diversum in vaginal bovine samples...|$|R
40|$|When {{impervious}} {{cover in}} upstream watersheds exceeds 10 %, {{the quality of}} local streams, lakes, and wetlands declines sharply, and the following impacts often result (CWP, 1998) : u Higher peak discharge rates and greater flooding, u Lower stream flow during dry weather (clearly evident in coastal Georgia during the recent drought), u Greater stream bank erosion, u Alteration of natural stream channels, u Degradation of stream habitat structure, u Increase of sediment disposition in nearby streams, u Fragmentation of riparian forest corridor, u Warmer stream temperatures, <b>u</b> Greater <b>loads</b> of stormwater pollutants, u Decline in wetland plant and animal diversity; lower diversity of aquatic insects and native fish species, u Sewage derived bacterial levels that exceed recreational contact standards, and u Increased number of stream crossings with greater potential to affect fish passage. Not only is it critical for these resources to remain intact and functional for environmental reasons, it is also economically sensible to preserve these areas. Economists have calculated that each acre of coastal wetland contributes from $ 800 to $ 9, 000 to the local economy through flood protection and recreation such as fishing, boating, and bird watching. (Kirby, 1993.) 2. 2. 3. 1 Wetlands Coastal wetland systems {{are some of the}} most productive ecosystems in the world. Georgia’s tidal wetlands account for a third of all remaining saltwater wetlands on the east coast. Of equal importance, freshwater wetlands and streams provide essential habitat for a range of species, including some that depend on aquatic environments part or most of their life cycle. In addition, wetlands, both tidal and freshwater, provide surface and groundwater filtration and storage, flood protection, and erosion control. Th...|$|R
