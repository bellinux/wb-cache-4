The apparent <b>unimolecular</b> rate constant kcat is also called turnover number and denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} elementary reactions are <b>unimolecular</b> and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule {{is involved in}} a <b>unimolecular</b> reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a <b>unimolecular</b> reaction is the cis–trans isomerization, in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Reactions in {{chemical}} processes are either <b>unimolecular</b> or bimolecular. The rate of a <b>unimolecular</b> reaction is an average over a vast ensemble {{of the rate}} coefficients for the microscopic events of collisional energy transfer and of reaction of a completely isolated molecule. Gilbert's {{work in the field}} of <b>unimolecular</b> processes started with the development of theorems for this relationship. These theorems are elegant developments in matrix algebra, proving relations that had been previously known only for particular cases. His theorems also became the basis for numerical methods that he developed to perform the requisite calculations. For this purpose, he created a computer code, UNIMOL, which is widely used by researchers.|$|E
25|$|E1 is a {{model to}} explain a {{particular}} type of chemical elimination reaction. E1 stands for <b>unimolecular</b> elimination and has the following specificities.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} rate is influenced {{only by the}} concentration of the alkyl halide because carbocation formation is the slowest step, aka the rate-determining step. Therefore, first-order kinetics apply (<b>unimolecular).</b>|$|E
25|$|Where the {{rate-determining step}} of a {{nucleophilic}} substitution reaction is <b>unimolecular,</b> {{it is known}} as an SN1 reaction. In this case, the slowest (thus rate-determining step) is the heterolysis of a carbon-halogen bond to give a carbocation and the halide anion. The nucleophile (electron donor) attacks the carbocation to give the product.|$|E
25|$|For {{elementary}} reactions or reaction steps, {{the order}} and stoichiometric coefficient are both equal to the molecularity or number of molecules participating. For a <b>unimolecular</b> reaction or step the rate {{is proportional to the}} concentration of molecules of reactant, so that the rate law is first order. For a bimolecular reaction or step, the number of collisions is proportional to the product of the two reactant concentrations, or second order. A termolecular step is predicted to be third order, but also very slow as simultaneous collisions of three molecules are rare.|$|E
25|$|The OH {{group is}} not a good leaving group in {{nucleophilic}} substitution reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH2+, the leaving group (water) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with hydrochloric acid to produce tertiary alkyl halides, where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a chlorine atom by <b>unimolecular</b> nucleophilic substitution. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with hydrochloric acid, an activator such as zinc chloride is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using thionyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|These {{developments}} {{led to a}} {{deep understanding}} of basic processes in free-radical polymerisation—the commonest industrial process. For the propagation reaction, Gilbert led an international team that produced a methodology that overcame the long-standing problem of obtaining reliable rate coefficients for this process. He showed that the Arrhenius parameters for different types of monomer take different classes of values, and developed qualitative and quantitative understanding of these classes from fundamental transition-state theory and quantum mechanics. These new methods were based on those that he had developed in his work on <b>unimolecular</b> gas-phase processes. For the termination reaction, his data and models led to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of this process as diffusion-controlled.|$|E
25|$|As with <b>unimolecular</b> reactions, {{the keys}} to the {{qualitative}} and quantitative understanding of the many processes in emulsion polymerisation are the rate coefficients of the individual steps. These steps are initiation (how quickly a growing chain starts), propagation (how quickly individual monomer units are added), radical loss processes (the termination and transfer of radical activity), and particle formation (nucleation). With Prof D Napper, Gilbert applied equations that he had solved in gas-phase chemistry to the area of emulsion polymerisation. This opened the way for him to develop—initially in collaboration with Napper—new theoretical and experimental methods for extracting the rate coefficients of elementary processes. He produced targeted data using these methods, particularly the time evolution of reaction rates and molecular-weight and particle-size distributions. This included novel types of systems, such as γ-radiolysis relaxation, in which events such as radical loss can be separated from radical propagation and growth.|$|E
500|$|The Michaelis–Menten {{kinetic model}} of a single-substrate {{reaction}} is shown on the right. There is an initial bimolecular reaction between the enzyme E and substrate S to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. The rate of enzymatic reaction increases {{with the increase of}} the substrate concentration up to a certain level called Vmax; at Vmax, increase in substrate concentration does not cause any increase in reaction rate as there no more enzyme (E) available for reacting with substrate (S). Here, the rate of reaction becomes dependent on the ES complex and the reaction becomes a <b>unimolecular</b> reaction with an order of zero. Though the enzymatic mechanism for the <b>unimolecular</b> reaction [...] ES -> {E} + P [...] can be quite complex, there is typically one rate-determining enzymatic step that allows this reaction to be modelled as a single catalytic step with an apparent <b>unimolecular</b> rate constant kcat.|$|E

2500|$|An E1 {{reaction}} {{consists of}} an <b>unimolecular</b> elimination, where the rate determining step of the mechanism depends on the removal of a single molecular species. [...] This is a two-step mechanism. [...] The more stable the carbocation intermediate is, the faster the reaction will proceed, favoring the products.

2500|$|An {{elimination}} {{reaction is}} a type of organic reaction in which two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one or two-step mechanism. The one-step mechanism is known as the E2 reaction, and the two-step mechanism is known as the E1 reaction. [...] The numbers do not {{have to do with the}} number of steps in the mechanism, but rather the kinetics of the reaction, bimolecular and <b>unimolecular</b> respectively. In rare cases, for molecules possessing [...] particularly poor leaving groups, a third type of reaction, E1CB, [...] exists.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} type, a nucleophile, an atom or {{molecule}} with {{an excess of}} electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge, replaces another atom {{or part of the}} [...] "substrate" [...] molecule. The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the leaving group departs with an electron pair. The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged. Examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion, alkoxides, amines and halides. This type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon. The latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups. Nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms, SN1 and SN2. In their names, S stands for substitution, N for nucleophilic, and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction, <b>unimolecular</b> or bimolecular.|$|E
2500|$|The SN1 {{reaction}} is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry. [...] "SN" [...] stands for nucleophilic substitution and the [...] "1" [...] represents {{the fact that}} the rate-determining step is <b>unimolecular.</b> Thus, the rate equation is often shown as having first-order dependence on electrophile and zero-order dependence on nucleophile. This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the carbocation intermediate. Instead, the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady-state kinetics. [...] The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. [...] With primary and secondary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. [...] In inorganic chemistry, the SN1 {{reaction is}} often known as the dissociative mechanism. This dissociation pathway is well-described by the cis effect. A reaction mechanism was first proposed by Christopher Ingold et al. in 1940. This reaction does not depend much on the strength of the nucleophile unlike the SN2 mechanism.this type of mechanism involves two steps the first step is the reversible ionization of Alkyl halide in the presence of aqueous acetone or an aqueous ethyl alcohol this step provides a carbocation as an intermediate in second step this carbocation is attacked by the nucleophile to give the product ...|$|E
