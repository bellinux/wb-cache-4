5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's <b>upper</b> <b>extremity</b> in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with <b>upper</b> <b>extremity</b> DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E

25|$|Another study {{examined}} the incorporation of music with therapeutic <b>upper</b> <b>extremity</b> exercises on pain perception in stroke victims. Over the course of eight weeks, stroke victims participated in <b>upper</b> <b>extremity</b> exercises (of the hand, wrist, and shoulder joints) in conjunction {{with one of the}} three conditions: song, karaoke accompaniment, and no music. Patients participated in each condition once, according to a randomized order, and rated their perceived pain immediately after the session. Results showed that although {{there was no significant difference}} in pain rating across the conditions, video observations revealed more positive affect and verbal responses while performing <b>upper</b> <b>extremity</b> exercises with both music and karaoke accompaniment. Nayak et al. examined the combination of music therapy with traditional stroke rehabilitation and also found that the addition of music therapy improved mood and social interaction. Participants who had suffered traumatic brain injury or stroke were placed in one of two conditions: standard rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation along with music therapy. Participants received three treatments per week for up to ten treatments. Therapists found that participants who received music therapy in conjunction with traditional methods had improved social interaction and mood.|$|E

This is the so-called acute central cervical cord injury which Schneider reported in 1954. Within this group, I have noticed a subgroup (<b>upper</b> <b>extremities</b> type) that is slightly different from those with typical acute central cervical cord injury.

40|$|The purpose: {{to define}} the {{diagnostic}} importance of computer esthesiometry for use in diagnostics of hereditary neuropathy with primary defeat of myelin sheath of peripheral nerves of the <b>upper</b> <b>extremities.</b> Materials and methods: 47 individuals in a condition of relative health (control group) from 21 to 50 years, comparable group % 40 patients from 6 to 81 years, with hereditary neuropathy Charcot%Marie%Tooth (CMT). Vibrating sensitivity was investigated by means of computer vibrometer “Vibrotester MBN” VТ% 02 % 1 (MBN, RF) in a wide strip of frequencies of vibration (8, 16, 32, 64, 125, 250, 500 Hz).
