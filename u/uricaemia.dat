40|$|In a {{selected}} group {{of pregnant women}} we studied the influence of specific haematoclinical maternal factors (age, pre-pregnancy weight, pregnancy weight gain, blood pressure, haematocrit (HTC), haemoglobinaemia (Hb), platelets (PTL), <b>uricaemia)</b> on neonatal weight. The results show an association among pre-pregnancy low maternal weight, hypertension and low neonatal weight. The <b>uricaemia</b> behaviour {{and the role of}} PTL, Hb, HCT are uncertain...|$|E
40|$|Variations in body weight, {{behaviour}} of lipidaemic fractions proteinaemia, <b>uricaemia</b> and uricuria, and lipid {{and protein}} absorption were studied preoperatively and at varying times following operation in five subjects {{who had undergone}} jejuno-ileal bypass for obesity. The results showed high serous NEFA and a definite, early and persistent reduction in all lipidaemic fractions after operation. The post-operative levels of serous proteins, particularly albumin, which were reduced in all subjects, reached pathological levels in two patients where proteic malnutrition following on the operation was associated with serious liver disease. The results agree with reported data. The variations in lipidic and proteic malabsorption proved to be in agreement with weight drop and the serous parameters considered. The reduction in <b>uricaemia</b> encountered in the five patients studied failed to agree with data reported in the Anglo-Saxon literature. This {{may be explained by}} alimentary and racial differences between the two populations of patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} CASTEL, a {{population-based}} (n= 3282) {{prospective study}} which began 14 years ago, was to identify those items which had a prognostic impact in the elderly, and to evaluate whether the typical cardiovascular risk factors, particularly arterial hypertension, play a role {{after the age of}} 65 years. Initial screening, final follow-up and annual detection of mortality were performed. Mantel-Hanszel approach and multivariate Cox model were used for statistics. Cardiovascular mortality was 23. 3 % in normotensive, 23. 3 % in borderline, and 25 % in the sustained hypertensive subjects (insignificant difference). In women, the incidence of stroke and coronary artery disease weakly depended on pulse pressure. Historical stroke and myocardial infarction predicted cardiovascular mortality in women; diabetes, <b>uricaemia</b> and high heart rate in men. In the very old, the predictors were less numerous, and blood pressure was not a predictor whatsoever; pulse blood pressure and murmurs at the neck were especially predictive in women, historical heart failure, proteinuria and tachycardia in men, historical stroke and myocardial infarction, pulmonary disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes and <b>uricaemia</b> in both genders. The elderly have a different cardiovascular risk pattern compared to younger people. Hypertension is not a predictor of coronary and stroke mortality. Prognosis depends on pulse pressure rather than on the label 'hypertension'. Hypercholesterolaemia is not a risk factor. This could simply indicate that elderly persons are the survivors in a population where significant mortality has already made its mark, eliminating those with the worst risk pattern. The two genders have a different risk profile due to sex-specific susceptibility to risk factors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many interfering {{factors may}} reduce the {{reliability}} of waist circumference (WC) measurement in estimating the risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with obesity. Therefore, we determined the independent associations of para- and perirenal ultrasonographic fat thickness with the main markers of kidney function. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 151 type- 2 diabetic subjects. Para- and perirenal fat thickness was measured from the inner side of the abdominal musculature {{to the surface of}} the kidneys. CKD was defined as eGFR < 60 mL min(- 1) 1. 73 m(- 2). RESULTS: Using both univariate and multivariate regression analyses, eGFR, renal resistance index and <b>uricaemia</b> were best predicted by para- and perirenal fat thickness even when BMI and waist circumference were further added in the statistical model (r(2) : 0. 366, P = 0. 001; r(2) : 0. 529, P = 0. 005; r(2) : 0. 310, P = 0. 026, respectively), whereas waist circumference and BMI did not contribute independently of para- and perirenal fat thickness. Albuminuria was predicted by waist circumference but not by para- and perirenal fat thickness. In subjects with waist circumference above the diagnostic values of metabolic syndrome (48 M/ 59 F), eGFR significantly and progressively declined across tertiles of para- and perirenal fat thickness (87. 0 ± 27. 9 vs 83. 5 ± 26. 0 vs 62. 3 ± 30. 6 mL min(- 1) 1. 73 m(- 2), adjusted P < 0. 0001) despite comparable waist circumference, and an increasing frequency of CKD was observed across tertiles of subjects with waist circumference both below and above the metabolic syndrome diagnostic values (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Para- and perirenal fat thickness is an independent predictor of kidney dysfunction in type- 2 diabetes explaining an important proportion of the variance of eGFR, renal resistance index and <b>uricaemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the benefit of}} gastric surgery in terms of improvement in health risk factors, the loss of weight and its long-term maintenance, 28 non-diabetic morbidly obese subjects were followed during {{three to five years}} after vertical banded gastroplasty. Aside from a rapid and sustained loss of weight averaging nearly 75 % reduction of weight excess, there occurred a concomitant improvement in glucose tolerance with 50 % reduction in fasting insulinaemia and correction of hypertension. The improvement in cardiovascular risk factors also included the drop in plasma triglycerides associated with an increase in HDL-cholesterol, while <b>uricaemia</b> decreased to low normal levels. Gastric procedures are therefore an effective treatment of severe obesity and of its comorbid conditions, but they should be followed by careful medical and nutritional monitoring to prevent any possible digestive or nutritional complications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{describe}} {{a case of}} drug-induced cytolytic hepatitis probably secondary to hypersensitivity to allopurinol which was prescribed incorrectly for secondary hyperuricaemia during treatment with pyrazinamide. The diagnosis was reviewed {{in view of the}} late occurrence of hepatitis in relation to the onset of the antituberculous treatment, the absence of a viral aetiology and the presence of clinical manifestations, biological and histological features which were compatible with hypersensitivity to allopurinol. The authors recalled that the type of <b>uricaemia</b> induced by pyrazinamide is most often asymptomatic and does not require any treatment with uric acid lowering drugs. Cessation of pyrazinamide is justified in cases of symptomatic hyperuricaemia but when the indications for pyrazinamide are imperative, treatment with an eliminator of uric acid is indicated. Allopurinol is contra-indicated in association with pyrazinamide on account of its inhibitory reaction to xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase decreases the level pyrazinoic acid, a metabolite of pyrazinamide, which is responsible for the inhibition of the tubular secretion of uric acid...|$|E
40|$|Background & aims: This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} clarifying whether high dietary fiber intake {{has an impact on}} incidence and risk of stroke at a population level. Methods: In 1647 unselected subjects, dietary fiber intake (DFI) was detected in a 12 -year populationbased study, using other dietary variables, anagraphics, biometrics, blood pressure, heart rate, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, <b>uricaemia,</b> fibrinogenaemia, erytrosedimentation rate, diabetes, insulin resistance, smoking, pulmonary disease and left ventricular hypertrophy as covariables. Results: In adjusted Cox models, high DFI reduced the risk of stroke. In analysis based on quintiles of fiber intake adjusted for confounders, HR for incidence of stroke was lower when the daily intake of soluble fiber was > 25 g or that of insoluble fiber was > 47 g. In multivariate analyses, using these values as cut-off of DFI, the risk of stroke was lower in those intaking more that the cut-off of soluble (HR 0. 31, 0. 17 e 0. 55) or insoluble (HR 0. 35, 0. 19 e 0. 63) fiber. Incidence of stroke was also lower (50...|$|E
40|$|Urate, a naturally-occurring antioxidant, is a marker/factor for {{cardiovascular}} disease. Hyperuricaemia {{is associated}} with IR, MetS and endothelial dysfunction. We characterised the associations between neurohormones, <b>uricaemia,</b> and glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) males. Cross-sectional; 705 T 2 DM males divided into two groups: uric acid or= 7. 0 mg/dl (hyperuricaemic; n= 229). HOMA beta-cell function (B), insulin sensitivity (S), hyperbolic product (BxS), and (BxS) loss rate were determined alongside neurohormones (Nt-proANP, BNP, Big ET- 1 and UII). Mean age and diabetes duration were not different between groups. Hyperuricaemics had more macroangiopathy, total/central adiposity, IR, hypertension, dyslipidemia and MetS prevalence. Nt-proANP and BNP levels were {{more than twice as}} high in hyperuricaemics, whereas Big ET- 1 and UII were higher by 46 % and 14 %, respectively. HOMA (BxS) was higher in hyperuricaemics: 31 (16) % vs. 26 (18) % (p= 0. 0004). BxS loss rate was faster in normouricaemics: 1. 36 (0. 54) % vs. 1. 20 (0. 43) %/year(- 1) (p< 0. 0001). The proportion with HbA(1 C) < 7. 0 % was 39 % (normouricaemics) vs. 49 % (hyperuricaemics; p= 0. 0091). In T 2 DM males, hyperuricaemia {{is associated with}} raised neurohormones together with better beta-cell indices. Urate's dual properties may translate into beneficial (glucose homeostasis) and detrimental (raised neurohormones) effects...|$|E
30|$|There are two special {{conditions}} requiring the preventive treatment of AKI: (1) {{high doses of}} methotrexate infusion [200]; (2) patients with {{a high risk of}} tumour lysis syndrome. Methotrexate at high doses (1 – 12  g/m 2) is a treatment required for numerous malignant tumours. This drug can induce AKI (up to 40  % of patients in a recent study), which is due to direct tubular toxicity and intratubular precipitation [201]. Intravenous hydration (≥ 2  l/m 2) and urine alkalinization are both recommended strategies for preventing AKI. Several historical observational and interventional studies highlighted that these strategies were associated with an increased methotrexate clearance and decreased episodes of severe toxicity [202 – 205]. Urine alkalinization decreases methotrexate crystallization [202]. Thus, it is recommended to alkalinize the urine of patients who must receive high doses of methotrexate (1 – 12  g/m 2) in order to prevent AKI. About one-third of patients with a high risk of tumour lysis syndrome develop AKI [206, 207]. In this clinical condition, hyperuricaemia is one of the factors which contribute to AKI by different mechanisms [208]. In two randomized controlled studies and 2 recent meta-analyses, rasburicase administration was associated with a more rapid and profound decrease in <b>uricaemia</b> as compared with allopurinol [209 – 211]. However, there is no proof that rasburicase is associated with reduced AKI incidence [212]. Hyperuricaemia {{is only one of the}} numerous mechanisms implicated in renal injury during tumour lysis syndrome (phosphate and calcium crystals, hypovolaemia, renal tumour infiltration, nephrotoxic exposure, inflammation). In patients with a high risk of tumour lysis syndrome, rasburicase administration is proposed by four recent expert recommendations [198, 213 – 215].|$|E
40|$|In 1978 {{a random}} sample (367 men and 568 women aged 18 - 65 years) taken from the general {{population}} of a north-eastern Italian town was screened for cardiovascular risk; 16 years later, the women were invited to a second screening. Three groups were identified at the initial screening (fertile, naturally menopausal and surgically menopausal) and four in the longitudinal study (137 remained fertile during the whole study, 205 became naturally menopausal, 56 were ovariectomised and 127 were already going through the menopause). The protocol included a questionnaire, blood pressure (BP) measurement, and blood exams. Continuous variables were adjusted for confounders. Systolic BP, prevalence of hypertension, cholesterol, glycaemia and <b>uricaemia</b> were similar, whereas diastolic and triglycerides (TG) were lower in surgically-menopausal than in fertile women (P < 0. 001). No significant difference in 16 years' variation from baseline was observed between the four groups, although women who remained fertile showed the smallest increases. In particular, neither systolic or diastolic BP increases differed between the women who were oophorectimised and those who remained fertile. 'Fertile status' was rejected from the logistic equation of incidence of hypertension, and 'age of menopause' was also rejected when this analysis was repeated in ovariectomised women. New coronary artery disease (angina pectoris or myocardial infarction) was observed in one ovariectomised woman, in three naturally menopausal, and in 13 already menopausal women which seemed to reflect the age trend. No new cases were observed in women who remained fertile. In conclusion, in Italian women surgical menopause, similarly to natural menopause, is devoid of any negative prognostic effect.
