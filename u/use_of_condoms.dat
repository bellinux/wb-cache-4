5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> is {{a matter}} that {{teenagers}} approach, a fact that proves the antecipation of protection. However, this isn’t the same as asking a partner for its use – or, in other words, {{to reach an agreement}} on the method used. Negotiating the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> consists on the ability to persuade the partner into using this method during the couple’s interactions. Objectives: 1) to describe the emotional and sexual career, 2) the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> with the current partner, 3) the adoption of negotiation strategies, 4) the connection between emotional and sexual experience and the negotiation <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom.</b> Method: Transversal, quantitative and descriptive study. Convenient sample of 342 adolescents (41, 5 % boys) that attend high schools in the region of Évora. The inquiry regards sociodemografic aspects, emotional and sexual experiences and the Condom Influence Strategy Questionnaire (CISQ-S) scale of Noar (2003) with α of Cronbach varying between. 949 and. 783 on the subscales. Results: On the emotional and sexual career, practices reveal that 96, 4 % have touched their partner, 93, 7 % kissed him/her, 75, 7 % have had sexual contact above their clothes, 55 % experienced sexual contact without penetration and 49, 2 % have had sexual intercourse with penetration. The negotiation strategies around the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> are <b>of</b> high number. Nevertheless, the more experienced had lower propensity to negociate the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the method. Conclusions: We verify the need to redirect teenagers’s education towards the prevention of STI. Having a bigger number of sexual experiences is compatible with a more advanced age and a broader information, which would led into a propensity to negociate. However that isn’t what we veryfied. This suggests that subjects are taking some risks...|$|R

40|$|The National Family Planning Programme of India had {{introduced}} <b>condom</b> as one <b>of</b> the family planning methods {{in the late}} 1960 s.

40|$|SUMMARY AIM: Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) {{are common}} among college students. Evidence suggests {{there may be}} increasing trend in females. This study assesses the differences in attitude to <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> to determine the risk of infections among students. METHOD: A total of 880 students from College of Education Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria were assessed for attitude to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> and relative risk <b>of</b> STIs, <b>using</b> the Sexual Risk Questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age for males was 22. 4 &# 177; 4. 7 years and females 21. 9 &# 177; 5. 5 years. There were variable attitudes to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> among students; 24. 2 % males and 21. 9 % females were used to unsafe sex with 1. 105 (RR) of STIs at 95 % CI; 34. 7 % against 27. 4 % who were of the same HIV status had 1. 179 (RR) at 95 % CI; while 44. 7 % against 37. 9 % {{who claimed to be}} enjoying sex without condom had 1. 132 (RR). The difference in relative risk of STIs was statistically significant in 29. 4 % of males and 32. 0 % of females who were pressured by partners not to use condom (p= 0. 024). CONCLUSION: Condom use is influenced by sexual practices. Negative attitude leading to its neglect encourages sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS among students.

30|$|Also, it is {{interesting}} to observe that psychosocial competences do not play any role in predicting risky sexual behaviours. This is quite surprising given that previous literature suggest self-efficacy (or self-confidence) {{to be one of the}} key factors for contraceptive uses and particularly for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> which, particularly for girls, requires negotiating its use with the partner (see for example Salazar et al. 2005).|$|R
25|$|Healthcare {{professionals}} suggest safer sex, {{such as the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condoms,</b> as {{the most}} reliable way of decreasing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases during sexual activity, but safer sex should by no means be considered an absolute safeguard. The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as blood transfusions and other blood products, sharing injection needles, needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing tattoo needles, and childbirth are other avenues of transmission. These different means put certain groups, such as medical workers, and haemophiliacs and drug users, particularly at risk.|$|E
25|$|Safe sex {{commonly}} {{involves the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> (also known as male condoms), but female condoms, which give women more control during the safe sex practice, {{may also be}} used; both condoms keep semen from coming {{in contact with the}} vagina, which can also help prevent unwanted pregnancy. There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs, and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which {{may be due to the}} female condom not fitting as tightly as the male condom or because it can slip into the vagina and spill semen.|$|E
25|$|While {{cases of}} HIV and AIDS in women have {{stabilized}} internationally, Chile {{has seen a}} rise in HIV/AIDS infection.
