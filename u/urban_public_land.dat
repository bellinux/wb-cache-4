40|$|Abstract—A {{preliminary}} {{evaluation of the}} urban land system {{is presented in the}} article together with the instruments of land policy in Serbia. The main reason for the analysis is demand for definition of reform framework for urban land management in Serbia in the period of transition towards market-led system. It is concluded that due to the limitations of the current regulation it will be impossible in the future to apply market principles in the urban land policy (supply and demand of land, land capitalization, investment efficiency, et al.). Based on the estimation that the urban land system and land policy are key factors of competitiveness between regions and towns in Serbia, it is necessary to initiate changes in this field. There are indicated on an option of privatization of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> <b>land</b> and possible establishment of leasehold land. A comparative analysis of the possibilities of the reform urban land system in Serbia has been carried out in relation to two approaches of market systems: (a) with dominant private ownership of urban land (neo/liberal approach) and (b) with dominant public ownership of urban land (system of leasehold) whose findings can be a basis for further study of the new system in Serbia [...] The attanied results are part of studies matter for the making of Strategy of territorial development of Serbia...|$|E

40|$|The {{debate over}} when, {{and to what}} extent, the {{government}} may regulate public smoking, is a contentious one of great moment. The {{point at which the}} line will be drawn with regard to an individual 2 ̆ 7 s right to smoke in public is narrowing. This right may stop at public restaurants and the workplace; or it may reach as far as public stadia, outdoor gathering spots and public streets. In 2006, one report showed 461 municipalities in thirty-three states and the District of Columbia, had adopted one-hundred percent smoke-free coverage in restaurants, bars or workplaces; and 135 municipalities had one-hundred percent coverage in all three of these areas. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), or second-hand smoke, {{has been shown to be}} carcinogenic, yet the streets of the major metropolitan areas bring countless olfactory assaults to the sense of the average pedestrian forced to use them and the sidewalks. Put simply, the sidewalks - as public spaces - must be free from becoming carcinogenic incubators for the citizenry. This Article analyzes efforts undertaken by the global community and The European Union and the World Health Organization, as well as the United States federal government, state governments (notably California) and various municipal responses through the enactment of ordinances, together with model ordinances formulated by the American Medical Association and the Non Smokers Rights, which address the issue - and, to some extent - resolve the limits to which the governments may go in order to maintain the health of the public in both public and restricted environments. Robert C. Ellickson 2 ̆ 7 s effort to divide <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> <b>land</b> spaces within cities into zones and, thus, regulate levels of conduct (e. g., smoking and panhandling) is evaluated and found to be a creative response which should be used as positive step for including smoking as a chronic public nuisance tolerated, as such, more suitably only in one 2 ̆ 7 s home. Rather than explore the complex issues of Constitutional Law underpinning the 2 ̆ 2 right to smoke, 2 ̆ 2 this Article takes a Property/Tort Law approach to problem-solving. The conclusion is reached that - on balance - common law principles of Public Nuisance, strengthened by the Doctrine of Anticipatory Nuisance, serve as an important tool, in conjunction with municipal regulations, to assure and maintain smoke-free environments and thereby protect the Public Health...|$|E

40|$|Call for papers: “Artistic and {{cultural}} praxes in the transitional and contested territory of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space”. A stream at Critical Legal Conference, 5 - 7 September 2013 in Belfast. Conveners: Peter Bengtsen & Matilda Arvidsson (Lund University, Sweden) In their {{presentation of the}} “Reconciliation & Reconstruction” theme of this year’s Critical Legal Conference, the organisers suggest that a pertinent topic of discussion might be the role of art and culture in contested political territories. While the notion of political territory may immediately bring to mind a specific contested geo-political location, this stream proposes a take on the theme that invites submissions which specifically consider the <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space as a contested territory. Where people meet, so do conflicting interests and ideas: in cities, which are characterised by – among other things – a high population density, this invariably leads to incompatible spatial claims and on-going clashes between diverging agendas of a political, commercial, legal, moral, social, cultural, and artistic nature. This is reflected in, for instance, people’s everyday praxes on city streets, where legislation, social norms, and notions of spatial justice help regulate interaction in – and with – <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space. While in this sense constricting, these elements of social control also constitute a nexus of creativity as they continuously incite individual agency, as people seek to circumvent them. While laws, regulations, and norms {{play an important role}} in maintaining the relative openness of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space (by limiting what any one agent – an individual, organisation, a company, or other legal entities – can legitimately do there and lay claim to), this space is arguably also constituted by the individual and collective agency which takes place within this cross-field of diverging interests. The collaborative or conflicting acts, resulting from the multiple agendas and visions of the nature and purpose of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space, leaves it in a state of constant transition and contestation. This can be seen in for instance authorities’ removal of graffiti writing, which not only restores <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space to its intended (material, visual, and legal) state, but also leaves a blank canvas for someone else to engage with. In thinking about <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space as a contested political territory, this stream invites participants to discuss a range of topics including, but not limited to: - the transitional nature of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space and the artistic {{and cultural}} expressions found within it - artistic and cultural praxes which investigate, problematise and/or actively challenge <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space and its dominant uses - artistic and cultural praxes as a means of regenerating <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space - the materiality and agency of artworks and their potential to address and/or resolve conflicts in <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space - the strategies and voice(s) of the marginalised in <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space - personal appropriations of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space and their (positive or negative) contribution to the publicness of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space - the role of critical legal theory in investigating and understanding artistic and cultural praxes within <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space - the effects of legislation, legal decisions, and law enforcement on individual praxis in <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space and/or the effects of individual praxis in <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space on law enforcement, legal decisions, and legislation The stream welcomes traditional papers/presentations as well as formats which transgress or transform the traditional framework of an academic paper presentation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the use, experience, and appropriation of everyday <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> spaces by Turkish immigrant {{women living in}} Enschede, the Netherlands. Based on the two premises of conceptualizing the <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space as a social construct and of valorizing users as social actors, the main objective of this thesis is to explore and analyze the spatial practices and variety of conceptions and interpretations of everyday <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> spaces, presenting the multi-facetedness of Turkish immigrant women’s connections, orientations, and involvement with the urban space and social life. This thesis advocates a relational approach to <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space, acknowledging everyday <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space {{as a place of}} reciprocal dynamic relations full of symbols and power, wherein differences, like gender, class, and ethnicity are imbued in their social constructions and spatial representations. Turkish immigrant women, whose relations with space, both locational and transnational, influence the social construction of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> spaces, are portrayed as active social actors constructing and reconstructing <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> spaces based on their own realities and meanings, derived from the conflicts, contestations, and coalitions of appropriation of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> space. This thesis presents an in-depth analysis of Turkish immigrant women and their relational contexts, which in turn constrain, shape, or frame their spatial behavior and patterns of use and experience of public spaces, and at the same time, elaborates how different characteristics and kinds of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> spaces condition the use and users’ spatial interactions. Publicness and privateness are interwoven in these contextual definitions in which Turkish immigrant women position themselves and others in a variety of public spaces in the city.

However, hot weather during the days due to the effect of global warming discourages {{community}} activities in the <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> parks. Furthermore, the urbanites' daily life is affecting the lack of time and opportunities for leisure and recreational activities. These constraints have changed the behaviour of the urban communities, preferable to carry out their leisure time activities in the <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> parks after the sun has set.

40|$|This econometric study {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate about {{the costs and benefits}} of urban form by employing interdisciplinary means—urban planning, econometrics and public administration—to explore the relationship between urban form and <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> services expenditure. In China, particularly, rapid urbanization is accompanied by an increase of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> services expenditure and a difference in efficiency, which undermines the promotion of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> service development. The Chinese government has paid great attention to urban sustainable development and promoting <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> services performance; however, until recently there has been a lack of empirical studies exploring the relationship between <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> services expenditure and urban form. Thus, the present research aims to analyze this issue by using relevant indicators based on an econometric model. The results provide a promising basis for improving <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> services expenditure efficiency. Based on the urban area interpreted by remote sensing data and geographic information system, two urban form metrics, the compactness ratio and the elongation ratio, are selected and quantified to describe urban compactness and urban sprawl accurately. Panel data analyses are performed using a cross-sectional dataset of the 30 cities for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 to assess the likelihood of association between indicators of urban form and <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> services expenditure, while controlling for other determinants, such as educational level, income per capita, degree of industrialization, and unemployment rate. The results indicate that urban elongation is positively correlated to per capita <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> services expenditure and urban compactness is insignificantly correlated to it. Thus, it is recommended that policymakers consider the relationship between <b>urban</b> form and <b>public</b> services expenditure as part of urban planning and on-going strategies to promote public service efficiency...|$|R
